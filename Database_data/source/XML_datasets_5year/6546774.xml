<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and the major cause of dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. It is also a progressive disease, the symptoms of which worsen over decades. The neuropathological hallmarks of AD include extracellular deposits of amyloid-β (Aβ), the major component of senile plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the initial elevation of Aβ levels is the unique primary trigger of AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, with a deterioration in Aβ metabolism and the accumulation of Aβ plaques starting two decades prior to the appearance of clinical symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In contrast, tauopathy, which is observed in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, is significantly enhanced following Aβ amyloidosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, the molecular mechanisms that link Aβ amyloidosis, tauopathy and neurodegeneration remain unresolved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">We previously developed two lines of novel AD model mice based on an <italic>App</italic> (amyloid precursor protein) knock-in (KI) strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The first mouse model (<italic>App</italic><sup><italic>NL-F</italic>/<italic>NL-F</italic></sup> KI; <italic>App</italic><sup><italic>NL-F</italic></sup>) carries two mutations (KM670/671NL: Swedish; I716F: Iberian) identified in human familial AD. The second model (<italic>App</italic><sup><italic>NL-G-F</italic>/<italic>NL-G-F</italic></sup>; <italic>App</italic><sup><italic>NL-G-F</italic></sup>) carries an additional mutation (E639G: Arctic mutation), and exhibits aggressive pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Both lines, which produce humanized Aβ without overexpressing APP, show pronounced Aβ amyloidosis, gliosis, and memory deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Further, we established human <italic>MAPT</italic> (human tau)-KI mice (hTau-KI), which express 6 isoforms of wild-type (WT) human tau instead of murine tau. Although we thought that the double-KI mice generated by cross-breeding <italic>App </italic>KI and hTau-KI mice might show greater AD pathology than the single <italic>App-</italic>KI mice due to tau humanization, we noted no overt pathological changes in the former mice. These results suggested the presence of mechanisms/factors in addition to Aβ amyloidosis that induce tauopathy and neurodegeneration.</p>
<p id="Par5">In order to understand the molecular mechanism of tau accumulation, we screened for tau-interacting proteins using Wtau-transgenic (Tg) mice, which express WT human tau tagged with a Flag epitope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We isolated tau-binding proteins by immunoprecipitation using a Flag-tag antibody and identified them by LC-MS/MS analysis. The methods used to generate the tau interactome were validated by identification of the tubulin beta-4A chain as one of the tau-binding proteins (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>), given that tau is a microtubule-binding protein.</p>
<p id="Par6">Among the proteins identified in the tau interactome, we focused on one protein, named carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (CAPON). CAPON is an adaptor protein of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which acts as an enzyme for the production of nitric oxide (NO), and is involved in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. CAPON is generally assumed to recruit substrates to nNOS, and facilitate their NO-mediated modification through protein-protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Several studies have reported that CAPON polymorphisms are associated with schizophrenia, and other psychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, Richier et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> demonstrated that CAPON positively regulates spine density, while Li et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> reported that CAPON regulates neuronal cell death downstream of the NMDA receptor. It therefore appears that CAPON contributes to neurotransmission and neuronal excitotoxicity. In addition, according to a report by Hashimoto et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, CAPON is upregulated in CA1 pyramidal cells in the AD brain. These results imply that CAPON may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD, although the underlying mechanism(s) remain unknown.</p>
<p id="Par7">To clarify the effect of CAPON on AD pathology, we used an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated approach to introduce CAPON cDNA into the brain of <italic>App</italic><sup><italic>NL-G-F</italic></sup> and <italic>App</italic><sup><italic>NL-G-F</italic></sup>/<italic>MAPT</italic> (hTau) double-KI mice which we newly developed. Given that the hTau-KI mouse expresses an endogenous level of WT human tau, we were able to analyze the effects of the human tau protein. Our results revealed that CAPON expression facilitates hippocampal atrophy, with accompanying neuronal cell death. We also verified that deficiency of CAPON in P301S-Tau-Tg tauopathy mouse model suppressed tau pathology and neurodegeneration. In addition, we examined the molecular mechanisms that lead to CAPON-induced neuronal cell death and AD pathology, i.e. tau phosphorylation and aggregation, Aβ deposition, and gliosis, in CAPON-expressing mice.</p>

<p id="Par8">In this study, to evaluate functions of a novel tau-binding protein: CAPON on AD-related pathologies including tau pathology, we used a new mouse model expressing tau protein in the manner of human brain.</p>
<p id="Par9">Normal adult human brains express six distinct isoforms which are classified into 3-repeats (3R)-tau and 4-repeats (4R)-tau depending on the number of repeated microtubule-binding domains. On the other hand, adult mouse possesses 4R-tau only. Importantly, NFTs in human AD comprise an equal mixture of all 3R and 4R tau isoforms. Therefore, mouse model should express all tau isoforms when we evaluate formation of tau pathology. In addition, ideally, the mouse model of tau pathology should be based on the KI strategy because overexpression of tau may disturb the normal physiological functions of neurons, such as microtubule assembly and synaptic functions. Accordingly, we generated human <italic>MAPT</italic> KI (hTau-KI) mice, in which the entire human <italic>Mapt</italic> gene was inserted at the murine <italic>Mapt</italic> gene locus (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Wild-type mice predominantly expressed 4R tau, while <italic>MAPT</italic> KI mice expressed all human tau isoforms as observed in human samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a, b</xref>). The relative ratio of mRNA for 4R-tau/3R-tau was 0.69 ± 0.07 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>b, c), which is close to that of human brain. <italic>MAPT</italic> KI mouse did not display acceralated neuroinflammation, neuronal cell death and brain atrophy (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2c, d</xref>). Moreover, cross-breeding of <italic>MAPT</italic> KI with <italic>App</italic><sup><italic>NL-G-F</italic></sup> KI did not alter amyloid pathology, neuroinflammation, and neuronal cell death of <italic>App</italic><sup><italic>NL-G-F</italic></sup> KI (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1d, e</xref>). These findings indicate that humanization of the <italic>Mapt</italic> gene does not affect neurodegenerative processes.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Characterization of human <italic>MAPT</italic> KI mice. <bold>a</bold> Tau isoforms in <italic>MAPT</italic> KI mouse brains were determined.

<sec id="Sec4">
<title>AD pathology alters the expression pattern of CAPON</title>
<p id="Par10">In order to identify tau-binding proteins, we generated a tau interactome, based on mass spectrometry-based immunoprecipitation proteomics. We performed immunoprecipitation with a Flag-tag antibody using brain lysate from WT (negative control) and Wtau-tg mice, which express WT human tau tagged with a Flag epitope, to isolate tau and its binding proteins. Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref> summarizes the proteins which were specifically identified from the Wtau-tg mice. We subsequently focused on CAPON as it is specifically expressed in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and polymorphisms have been identified in several psychiatric diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, CAPON is also upregulated in the hippocampal pyramidal cells of AD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and may therefore play a pivotal role in the etiology of this disease.</p>
<p id="Par11">According to Hashimoto et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, although CAPON accumulates in hippocampal pyramidal cells in the AD brain, the overall amount of the protein is significantly lowered in AD patients compared with healthy controls. We therefore first examined whether Aβ amyloidosis and tau pathology affect the level or pattern of CAPON expression in the brain. Western blot analyses of hippocampal and cortical tissues from 12–14-month-old WT, <italic>App</italic><sup><italic>NL-G-F</italic></sup> (with Aβ pathology), hTau single-KI (without Aβ pathology) and <italic>App</italic><sup><italic>NL-G-F</italic></sup> / hTau double-KI (with Aβ pathology) mice revealed that presence of with Aβ pathology resulted in higher CAPON expression levels in these animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a, b</xref>). Intriguingly, immunohistochemical analyses showed a significantly stronger CAPON signal in the pyramidal cell layer of <italic>App</italic><sup><italic>NL-G-F</italic></sup> mice than in the WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). These results indicate that Aβ pathology elevates the level and localization of CAPON in hippocampal pyramidal cells. On the other hand, P301S-Tau-Tg mice (tauopathy model) exhibited an age-dependent decline in CAPON protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>), suggesting that severe pathology such as that associated with frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17 (FTDP-17) mutant tau-induced cytotoxicity decreases the level of CAPON, presumably because the number of neuronal cells where CAPON is mainly expressed is reduced (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). Indeed, P301S-Tau-Tg mice display severe brain atrophy in association with neuronal cell death, in an age-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Endogenous CAPON expression in <italic>App</italic><sup><italic>NL-G-F</italic></sup> mice. <bold>a</bold> The protein levels of CAPON in the hippocampi and cortices of 14-month-old (M) WT and male <italic>App</italic><sup><italic>NL-G-F</italic></sup> mice were determined.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file</p></caption><graphic id="d29e805" xlink:href="41467_2019_10278_Fig2_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par12">How does Aβ pathology alter the expression pattern of CAPON? We selected two candidates as potential mediators of this change: nNOS and neuroinflammation. Further analysis revealed a dramatic reduction in the protein levels of CAPON, without any change in its mRNA levels, in the nNOS-deficient mouse brain, suggesting that stabilization of the CAPON protein is highly dependent on its interaction with nNOS (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5a, b, c</xref>). Because pathogenic Aβ species interact with and activate NMDA receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, nNOS is considered to be activated under amyloid pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par13">We next examined the involvement of neuroinflammation. Shao et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> reported that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation induces CAPON expression, and Cheng et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> proposed that CAPON increases after spinal cord injury.

Indeed, <italic>App</italic><sup><italic>NL-G-F</italic></sup> mice display marked activation of microglia and astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Similar to Shao et al, we examined the expression pattern of CAPON 1 week after intraventricular injection of LPS. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed significant induction of CAPON in regions where the microglia was highly activated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>-left). However, the CAPON signals did not colocalize with Iba1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>-left, and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>) and non-neuronal cells markers (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>), whereas the signals colocalized with the nNOS immunoreactivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>-right), and other neuronal cell markers (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). Therefore, CAPON appears partially increased in neuronal rather than glial cells. These results indicate that neuroinflammation associated with Aβ pathology may possibly be involved in CAPON elevation.</p>

Significant shrinkage of the hippocampus was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of brain sections (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>). We also observed a significant decrease in NeuN (neuron marker) -positive neuronal cells and an increase in cleaved caspase 3 (cell death marker) signals in the hippocampus of CAPON-expressing mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>).

<title>Mitochondrial damage is involved in CAPON-induced neuronal cell death</title>
<p id="Par18">Several studies have demonstrated that CAPON mediates signaling from the NMDA receptor in association with nNOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

We therefore examined mitochondrial dysfunction in CAPON-overexpressing mice. Upon mitochondrial damage, cytochrome C (CytC) is released into the cytosol from the mitochondria. Immunohistochemistry revealed that CAPON overexpression increases the CytC levels in the hippocampal pyramidal cell layer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>, b). Moreover, the protein level of Bax, which is induced by mitochondrial damage and induces neuronal cell death, was also elevated in AAV-CAPON-injected mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6e</xref>). We also analyzed the mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption rate of CAPON-overexpressing primary neurons: CAPAN overexpression resulted in a decrease these cellular fundamental functions compared to those of the controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c, d</xref>).

<p id="Par19">Dexras1, a Ras family protein, is known to act as a CAPON-binding protein, and its activation inhibits Raf, MEK and ERK signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

We therefore examined the levels of Dexras1 and MEK-ERK phosphorylation.

Taken together, these findings indicate that CAPON could induce mitochondrial damage and neuronal cell death by regulating Dextras1-MEK-ERK signaling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6e</xref>). Zhu et al suggested that overexpression of CAPON activates Dexras1 activity by facilitating the s-nitrosylation of Dexras1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. They detected Dexras1 activation after several days of lentivirus-mediated overexpression of CAPON in the mouse brain. In contrast, we observed a decrease in Dexras1 after 3 months, suggesting that prolonged overexpression of CAPON decreases the level of the Dexras1 protein via negative feedback, and results in hyperactivation of the MEK-ERK signal. Incidentally, the baseline expressions of Dextras1 and phosphorylated (p)-MEK were essentially identical between WT and double-KI mice, and we also observed alterations of these proteins in CAPON-overexpressing WT mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>).</p>

<title>CAPON expression facilitates tau phosphorylation and insolubility but not amyloid pathology</title>
<p id="Par20">As we originally identified CAPON as a tau-binding protein, the interaction between CAPON and tau could be considered a cause of tau pathology, resulting in the induction of neuronal cell death. We therefore tested whether CAPON overexpression aggravates tau pathology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>). We first validated the interaction between tau and CAPON in the WT, hTau-KI, <italic>App</italic><sup><italic>NL-G-F</italic></sup>, and double-KI mouse brain using the Duolink system (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">11a</xref>). We then assessed pathological changes in tau in CAPON-overexpressing double-KI mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b–f</xref>). Intriguingly, CAPON overexpression significantly increased the phosphorylation level at all the phosphorylation sites which we tested, without any change in the total tau level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b</xref>). To investigate the formation of insoluble inclusions such as NFTs in CAPON-overexpressing mice, we isolated a 1% sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of hippocampal protein and detected insoluble tau by immunoblotting using the Tau5 antibody. A greater amount of sarkosyl-insoluble Tau was detected in CAPON-overexpressing mice compared to control mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>). We also observed a higher amount of soluble tau oligomer, which could be detected by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, in the CAPON-overexpressing mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7d</xref>). An increase in AT8-positive tau was also seen by immunohistochemistry not only around Aβ plaques but also over a wide area of the hippocampus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7e</xref>). In addition, we found that the MC1 antibody, which recognizes the pathological conformation of tau protein, detected some neuronal cells in CA1 pyramidal cell layer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7f</xref>). Consistently, these cells were also stained for phosphorylated-Ser404 (pS404) rabbit antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7f</xref>).

<p id="Par21">How does CAPON facilitate the phosphorylation and accumulation of tau? Many reports indicate that CAPON essentially functions as a scaffold protein for nNOS. We therefore speculated that it induces the nitration of tau, which is associated with the progression of tauopathy. To investigate this, we analyzed nitration at the 18<sup>th</sup> tyrosine (Y18) and Y29 of tau using nitrated-tyrosine antibodies, revealing significant enhancement of nitration at Y29 in CAPON-overexpressing mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7g</xref>). This suggests that nitration at Y29 is enhanced by CAPON, resulting in pathological tau aggregation. Indeed, Reynolds et al, have reported that tau with nitrated Y29 is more abundant in NFTs than soluble tau, with the authors suggesting that nitration at Y29 is a disease-related event that may alter the intrinsic ability of tau polymerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p>

We injected AAV-CAPON into 6-month-old tau-KO or WT mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>), and assessed their brain pathologies 3 months later. Interestingly, much higher levels of CAPON were expressed in the tau-KO mice, although the reason for this remains unknown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9a</xref>). MRI and histochemical analyses revealed that the degree of hippocampal atrophy corresponded with the expression level of CAPON (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9a–d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>). Moreover, we observed significant activation of caspase 3 and neuronal loss in the AAV-CAPON-expressing tau-KO mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9e</xref>). These results indicate that CAPON induces neuronal cell death via a tau-independent mechanism or through a combination of both tau-dependent and tau-independent mechanisms. We would also like to point out that tau is not the only microtubule-binding protein (MAP) and that the other MAPs such as MAP2 might be involved although we do not have any experimental evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>CAPON overexpression in tau-KO mice induces neurodegeneration. <bold>a</bold> AAV-CAPON was introduced into 6-month-old WT (male) or tau-KO mice (#1, #2 and #4 are male, and #3 is female), and expression levels of CAPON in the hippocampus were determined 3 months after injection. <bold>b</bold> Representative MRI scan of the CAPON-overexpressing tau-KO mouse brain scanned 7 days and 3 months after the introduction of AAV.

<title>Deficiency of CAPON restores AD-related pathological phenotypes in P301S-Tau-Tg mice</title>
<p id="Par24">We thus far analyzed the effect of CAPON overexpression on pathological characteristics in double-KI mice. As a proof of evidence, we next examined the effect of CAPON deficiency on tau pathology and neurodegeneration in tauopathy mouse model. The P301S-Tau-Tg mice on the CAPON KO background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> exhibited significantly reduced levels of total and phosphorylated tau (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10a</xref>). CAPON deficiency also resulted in reduction of Sarkosyl-insoluble tau in P301S-Tau-Tg mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10b</xref>), suggesting that CAPON contributes to progression of tau pathology in P301S-Tau-Tg mice.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par25">In this study, we have demonstrated that Aβ pathology leads to the accumulation of CAPON protein, and that the increase in CAPON induces tau pathology and neuronal cell death. Our findings suggest that CAPON is one of the novel mediators that link Aβ, tau and neurodegeneration. CAPON was originally identified as a nNOS-binding protein and is considered to be involved in NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Although one report proposed that CAPON prevents excitotoxicity by competitively inhibiting nNOS-PSD95 binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, recent studies have indicated that it mediates NMDA receptor-induced neuronal toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Our study supports the latter proposal, given our observation that overexpression of CAPON leads to neuronal cell death and hippocampal atrophy. We also demonstrated the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction to this pathology. Aβ oligomers have been reported to upregulate reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and induce mitochondrial dysfunction via their interaction with the NMDA receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Abnormal activation of nNOS signaling together with mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload produces excess ROS and RNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. This in turn leads to abnormal s-nitrosylation, sulfonation and the accumulation of peroxides, resulting in protein misfolding and dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. For example, s-nitrosylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal injury, and protein disulfide isomerase is associated with protein misfolding in neurodegenerative disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Dysfunction of CAPON may contribute to disruption of these proteins, thereby producing pathological changes. Mitochondrial dysfunction also induces caspase activation and cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par26">In CAPON-overexpressing mice, we detected not only apoptosis markers such as cleaved-caspase 3 but also non-apoptotic cell death markers, i.e. cleaved-GSDMD and GSDME. GSDMD is a physiological substrate for inflammatory caspases, and its activation is required for initiation of pyroptosis. GSDME activation by caspase 3 induces pyroptosis and necrosis secondarily if apoptotic cells are not scavenged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Our observation suggests that CAPON-induced neuronal cell death is not composed of a single simple pathway but also of complicated mechanisms, which involve multiple pathways. Indeed, activation of several cell death pathways were also detected in AD samples and AD mouse models. For instance, NLRP1-dependent neuronal pyroptosis is detected in APPswe/PS1dE9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Also, activation of necroptosis pathway, a programmed form of necrosis, is observed in AD samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Taken together, the mechanisms of neurodegeneration observed in the present study appear quite complex, and we thus need further investigation to understand the entire landscape while taking contribution of neuroinflammation into consideration. It is possible that neuroinflammation may be attributed as a cause of cell death induced by CAPON overexpression.</p>
<p id="Par27">We observed a significant decrease in Dexras1 and enhanced MEK-ERK phosphorylation in CAPON-overexpressing mice. Activation of MEK-ERK signaling is related to the induction of mitochondrial damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. We therefore concluded that Dexras1-MEK-ERK signaling is one of the mediators of CAPON-induced neuronal cell death. In contrast, Chen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> demonstrated that a deficiency in Dexras1 inhibits NMDA-induced neuronal cell death. Moreover, Zhu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> reported that CAPON overexpression facilitates Dexras1 activity via enhancement of its s-nitrosylation, and that this inactivates MEK-ERK signaling. We assumed that this inconsistency is due to the difference in experimental conditions between studies, as Zhu et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> used a lenti-virus to overexpress CAPON, observing activation of Dexras1 and inactivation of MEK-ERK signaling 4 days after introduction of the virus. We also assumed that a reduction in activated Dexras1 rather than a deficit in Dexras1 <italic>per se</italic> facilitated MEK-ERK signaling, and disrupted mitochondrial function. This effect could be mediated by prolonged overexpression of CAPON.</p>
<p id="Par28">Although we could detect a significant increase in CAPON protein in the hippocampus and cortex of the <italic>App</italic><sup><italic>NL-G-F</italic></sup> mouse, these mice do not exhibit severe neuronal cell death or tau pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In sporadic AD patients, Aβ accumulation starts about 20 years prior to the clinical onset of the disease. We therefore assume that the prolonged effect of Aβ leads to the accumulation of CAPON and results in tau pathology and neuronal cell death.</p>
<p id="Par29">We found that the nitration of tyrosine at Y29 is one of the mechanisms by which tau pathology is induced. Nitrated-Y29-positive tau is predominately detected in tau inclusions such as NFTs, suggesting that nitration at Y29 facilitates the aggregation of tau<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. We attempted to validate the contribution of nNOS to tau nitration using nNOS-deficient mice that overexpress CAPON. However, we were unable to successfully overexpress CAPON by AAV delivery in nNOS-KO mice, probably because the protein is not stable in these animals. CAPON overexpression-induced neuroinflammation may also contribute to acceleration of tau pathology through other possible mechanisms. For instance, genome-wide and rare variant association studies have shown linkage between single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes related to immune system and etiology of AD. In particular, Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), the mutation in which increases the risk of AD, is associated with tau pathology and synaptic loss in post mortem human cortical samples from AD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Also, Asai et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> demonstrated that depletion of microglia and inhibition of exosome synthesis interrupted tau propagation, suggesting that microglia and exosomes contribute to the progression of tauopathy. Thus, although there is still room for argument about relationship between neuroinflammation and tau pathology, CAPON may be a candidate facilitater of tau pathology in such processes.</p>
<p id="Par30">Given that tau pathology occurred earlier than neurodegeneration in CAPON-overexpressing mice, we predicted that this pathology was driving neurodegeneration. However, we observed CAPON-induced hippocampal atrophy and neuronal cell death not only in double-KI mice but also in tau-KO mice. This result indicates that CAPON-induced neuronal cell death occurs via a tau pathology-independent manner or through a combination of both tau-dependent and tau-independent mechanisms. Since CAPON deficiency in tauopathy mouse model attenuated tau accumulation and neuron loss, the CAPON-induced cell death can be attributed at least in part to a tau-dependent mechanism. A positional correlation between tau pathology and neuron loss is observed in the human AD brain, while it remains unclear whether tau is the actual killer of neuronal cells. Although overexpression of tauopathy-associated mutant tau induces neuronal cell death, overexpression of WT tau or artificial facilitation of tau propagation by aggregate seeding almost never induces such death. Hence, the relationship between tau pathology and neurodegeneration still requires further investigation.</p>
<p id="Par31">Numerous studies have reported that CAPON is a risk gene for schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Psychiatric symptoms are a major feature of AD, and sometimes appear from the early stages of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. The disruption of CAPON expression induced by Aβ may therefore link these clinical conditions.</p>
<p id="Par32">A recent study used the APP/PS1 mouse and an in vitro system to demonstrate that the interaction between CAPON with nNOS is enhanced under amyloid pathologies, and that this facilitates neuronal toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In contrast, we did not detect an enhanced interaction between CAPON and nNOS in <italic>App</italic> KI mice. However, because these mice, unlike APP/PS1 animals, do not present significant neuron loss or neuronal cell death, it is possible that such an effect might not be detected. We assume that the gradual accumulation of CAPON over long periods could enhance the CAPON-nNOS interaction and induce neuronal toxicity, particularly as Aβ accumulation starts more than two decades before the onset of the clinical phenotype. Another reason for the difference between <italic>App</italic> KI and APP/PS1 mice could lie in the overexpression of APP and PS1 in the latter case. We have previously suggested that APP and/or presenilin overexpression itself alters calcium homeostasis without regard for amyloid pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. For example, unlike <italic>App</italic> KI mice, APP-overexpressing mice display calpain-dependent conversion of p35 to p25, which upregulates the kinase activity of CDK5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Moreover, APP/PS1 mice exhibit enhanced endoplasmic reticulum stress, whereas <italic>App</italic> KI and APP-single transgenic mice do not<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. CAPON and nNOS function could therefore be subjected to the action of calcium signaling, and care is required when interpreting results obtained using the APP/PS1 model.</p>
<p id="Par33">It is desirable to prevent the progression of AD before the onset of neurodegeneration. Many groups have been developing novel therapeutic agents to target Aβ and tau accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. However, few studies are targeting the connection between amyloid pathology and tau pathology or neuronal cell death. We believe that CAPON is a promising drug target to break the connection between Aβ and tau or cell death. Inhibition of the interaction between CAPON-tau or CAPON-nNOS could therefore be a novel approach for the treatment of AD and related diseases.</p>

When we stained using anti-Synaptophysin, we used FITC-labeled antibody.</p>
<p id="Par45">After deparaffinization, sections were heated in an autoclave at 121 °C for 5 min in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for epitope retrieval, after which endogenous peroxidase was inactivated by 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. To block nonspecific immunoreactivity, sections were treated with the blocking solutions (TSA Biotin System kit). First antibodies, diluted in TNT buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween20, pH 7.5), were reacted overnight at 4 °C. The sections were then washed three times in TNT buffer for 5 min, and treated with secondary antibodies. In the case of the TSA method, the sections were treated with biotinylated goat anti-mouse/rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h, and then incubated with HRP-conjugated-avidin for 30 min (1:100 dilution in TNT, TSA System) at room temperature. Visualized was achieved with tyramide-enhanced FITC (1:50 dilution in amplification solution; supplied in the TSA System) for 10 min. When the direct immunofluorescence method was being used, the sections were treated with Alexa 488- or Alexa 546-conjugated anti-mouse/rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Finally, the sections were coverslipped using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the slides were scanned on a NanoZoomer NDP system (Hamamatsu Photonics, Iwata, Japan) with ×20 resolution, an FSX100 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), or All-in-one Fluorescence Microscope BZ9000 (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). The signals were quantified using Metamorph Imaging Software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) or Definiens Tissue Studio (Definiens, Parsippany, NJ). Fluorescence intensity of each protein is calculated as the product of average of fluorescence intensity and fluorescence area.</p>

<title>Duolink</title>
<p id="Par46">Duolink PLA probes and PLA detection reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Deparaffinization, epitope retrieval, inactivation of endogenous peroxidase, and blocking were performed in the same manner as that used for immunohistochemistry. Antibodies (mixture of CAPON/nNOS antibody or CAPON/Tau5 antibody), diluted in TNT buffer, were initially reacted overnight at 4 °C. The sections were then washed three times in TNT buffer for 5 min, and reacted with PLA probes (a mixture of the Anti-Mouse Plus and Anti-Rabbit Minus probes) in a humidified chamber at 37 °C. The ligation, amplification, and HRP labeling reactions were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Interaction signals were visualized with tyramide-enhanced FITC (1:50 dilution in amplification solution; supplied in the TSA Biotin System kit) for 10 min. The sections were then reacted with Hoechst solution, and coverslipped. The slides were scanned on a NanoZoomer NDP system (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) with ×40 resolution, and signals were quantified using Definiens Tissue Studio.</p>

<title>Isolation of sarkosyl-insoluble fraction</title>
<p id="Par47">Dissected brains were immediately frozen by liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The sarkosyl-insoluble fraction was isolated according to the method described in Sahara et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Briefly, the hippocampus was homogenized in 10× volumes of Hsiao TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 274 mM NaCl, and 5 mM KCl) containing protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. The homogenates were centrifuged at 26,300 × <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were stored at −80 °C as the S1 fraction. The pellets (P1 fraction) were re-homogenized in 5× volumes of high salt and sucrose buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.8 M NaCl, 10% sucrose, 1 mM EGTA) containing protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, and centrifuged at 26,300 × <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants (S2 fraction) were incubated with 1% sarkosyl (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C, and then, centrifuged at 150,000 × <italic>g</italic> at 1 h at 4 °C. The pellets (P3 fraction) were suspended in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA), and used as the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction.</p>

<sec id="Sec23">
<title>Western blotting</title>
<p id="Par48">The S1 fraction or P3 fraction (sarkosyl-insoluble fraction) of the hippocampus was used for analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). An equivalent amount of protein from each animal was mixed with a 4 x sample buffer with or without 2-mercaptoethanol, then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred electrophoretically to a PVDF membrane (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA). The membrane was treated with the ECL prime blocking solutions (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), and reacted with each antibody diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween20 (TNB), pH 7.5, overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed three times in TNB for 5 min, and treated with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare) for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands on the membrane were visualized with ECL select (GE Healthcare) and scanned with a LAS-3000mini LuminoImage analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan).</p>

<title>RNA extraction and semi-quantitative RT-PCR</title>
<p id="Par49">Total RNA was extracted from brain samples using RNAiso Plus (Takara, Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR for detection of both 3R- and 4R-tau mRNA as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, with minor modifications. The primer pairs used for tau were: 5′-AAGTCGCCGTCTTCCGCCAAG-3′ and 5′-GTCCAGGGACCCAATCTTCGA-3′, and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH): 5′- CCATGGCACCGTCAAGGCTGA-3′ and 5′-GCCAGTAGAGGCAGGGATGAT-3′. PCR products of 288 bp and 381 bp correspond to 3R-tau and 4R-tau, respectively. RT-PCR products were detected by 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, and 34 PCR cycles to mortgage the linearity of the products, and the result was decided by 26 cycles. Band intensity was calibrated using Image J software.</p>

<title>Separation of cortical neurons and cell-based assays</title>
<p id="Par50">Cortices and hippocampi were separated from E16–18 embryos of WT mice and placed in Neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The tissues were chopped with scalpels and treated with 5 mL of 0.25% trypsin at 37 °C for 15 min with rotation. Then, 0.125 mL of 1% DNaseI was added and the solution was mixed by pipetting. After centrifugation of the tissues at 1500 rpm for 3 min, 5 mL of Hank’s buffered salt solution containing 0.125 mL of 1% DNaseI was added to the pellet, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, with gentle movement, in a water bath. Following this, the tissues were again centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 3 min, and the resulting pellet were suspended in 15 mL of Neurobasal medium containing B27 plus supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 25 μM glutamate. The cells were filtered using a Falcon 2360 Cell Strainer with 100 μm Nylon, and seeded in cell culture plates with Neurobasal medium containing B27 and glutamate. Before use, the culture medium was first changed to Neurobasal medium without glutamate, and after 24 h, was changed to Neurobasal medium containing AAV vector.</p>
