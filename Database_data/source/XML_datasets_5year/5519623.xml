<abstract>
<p>The cerebellum (Cb) is an exquisite structure that controls elaborate motor behaviors and is essential for sensory-motor learning. During development, the Cb is derived from rhombomere 1 (r1). Within this embryonic compartment, precursors in r1 are patterned by signaling cues originating from the <underline>is</underline>thmus <underline>o</underline>rganizer (IsO) and subsequently undergo complex morphogenic movements to establish their final position in the mature Cb. The transcription factor <italic>Gbx2</italic> is expressed in the developing Cb and is intimately involved in organizing and patterning the Cb. Nevertheless, how precursors expressing <italic>Gbx2</italic> at specific embryonic time points contribute to distinct cell types in the adult Cb is unresolved. In this study, we used <underline>G</underline>enetic <underline>I</underline>nducible <underline>F</underline>ate <underline>M</underline>apping (GIFM) to mark <italic>Gbx2</italic>-expressing precursors with fine temporal resolution and to subsequently track this lineage through embryogenesis. We then determined the terminal neuronal fate of the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage in the adult Cb. Our analysis demonstrates that the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage contributes to the Cb with marking over the course of five stages: Embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) through E11.5. The <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage gives rise to Purkinje cells, granule neurons, and deep cerebellar neurons across these marking stages. Notably, the contribution of the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage shifts as development proceeds with each marking stage producing a distinct profile of mature neurons in the adult Cb. These findings demonstrate the relationship between the temporal expression of <italic>Gbx2</italic> and the terminal cell fate of neurons in the Cb. Based on these results, <italic>Gbx2</italic> is critical to Cb development, not only for its well-defined role in positioning and maintaining the IsO, but also for guiding the development of Cb precursors and determining the identity of Cb neurons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The cerebellum (Cb) controls motor behaviors, sensorimotor learning, gait, balance, coordination, proprioception, memory, reward, and cognition (reviewed in Zervas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2005</xref>; Buckner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2013</xref>; Wagner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2017</xref>). The Cb forms over a prolonged developmental window, beginning during early embryogenesis and continuing postnatally (Altman and Bayer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1997</xref>). This prolonged time course makes the Cb particularly vulnerable to developmental errors, which manifest in well characterized Cb disorders, including Dandy-Walker malformation, Joubert syndrome, Autism, and Tuberous Sclerosis (Ten Donkelaar and Lammens, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2009</xref>; Tsai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2012</xref>; Reith et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2013</xref>; D'Mello and Stoodley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2015</xref>). Thus, both basic scientific inquiry and emerging clinical interests encourage a deeper investigation into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underpinning Cb development.</p>
<p>During development, the Cb is derived from the anterior-dorsal region of rhombomere 1 (r1), which is patterned through a network of hierarchically organized and functionally interconnected transcription factors and secreted molecules (Zervas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2005</xref>; Joyner and Zervas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2006</xref>; Sillitoe and Joyner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2007</xref>). <italic>Gastrulation Brain Homeobox 2</italic> (<italic>Gbx2</italic>) encodes a transcription factor that is integral for patterning the Cb (Li and Joyner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2001</xref>). <italic>Gbx2</italic> is first expressed throughout the posterior extent of the embryo during gastrulation, but as development proceeds <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression becomes restricted to the spinal cord and r1 (Wassarman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">1997</xref>; Luu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2011</xref>). <italic>Gbx2</italic> interacts with another homeobox transcription factor <italic>Otx2</italic>, which is expressed in the mesencephalon (mes). At their interface these two transcriptor factors exhibit mutual repression which initiates an intricate molecular pathway that establishes a signaling center at the mes/r1 boundary (Millet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">1999</xref>). This signaling center, known as the <underline>is</underline>thmus <underline>o</underline>rganizer (IsO), is delineated by the expression of <italic>Fgf8</italic> and is ultimately responsible for patterning both the presumptive midbrain and Cb (Liu and Joyner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2001</xref>; Zervas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2004</xref>; Sato and Joyner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2009</xref>). Thus, <italic>Gbx2</italic> plays a critical role in Cb development, albeit indirectly, through its role in positioning and maintaining the IsO.</p>
<p>The functional requirement for <italic>Gbx2</italic> in Cb development was revealed by the striking phenotype of <italic>Gbx2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutant mice. In particular, <italic>Gbx2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutants have a complete loss of the Cb and die perinatally (Wassarman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">1997</xref>). A <italic>Gbx2</italic>
<underline>c</underline>onditional <underline>k</underline>nock<underline>o</underline>ut (<italic>Gbx2</italic>-CKO) mouse line allowed for a more targeted deletion of <italic>Gbx2</italic>, which elucidated its temporal requirement in Cb development (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2002</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Gbx2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> null mice, the conditional deletion of <italic>Gbx2</italic> allowed for the elimination of <italic>Gbx2</italic> specifically in r1 at temporally controlled and later stages in development (from E8.5 onward). Consequently, over half of <italic>Gbx2</italic>-CKO mutants survived into adulthood and produced Cb tissue. However, the remaining Cb did not develop normally nor establish conventional Cb structures. In particular, two distinct <italic>Gbx2-CKO</italic> phenotypes were observed: Severely affected <italic>Gbx2</italic>-CKO mutants were nearly devoid of a vermis, but had bi-lateral hemispheres. Less severely affected mutants had a distinct vermis, but displayed abnormally small vermal folia. Concomitant with these morphological changes, the genes <italic>Otx2</italic> and <italic>Fgf8</italic> were ectopically extended posteriorly into r1 (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, <italic>Gbx2</italic> is clearly required for the proper maintenance of the IsO and the subsequent patterning of the midbrain and anterior hindbrain. However, <italic>Gbx2</italic> may also shape the development of the Cb through cell autonomous mechanisms. Notably, the terminal cell fate of <italic>Gbx2</italic> expressing precursors and the distribution of their progeny has not been resolved in the Cb. Elucidating the <italic>Gbx2</italic> fate map would reveal the following information: 1. How the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage produces specific cell types in the Cb, 2. How the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage integrates into the mature structure of the Cb, and 3. Provide a more complete understanding of how <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression shapes Cb development. We addressed these gaps in the field using <underline>G</underline>enetic <underline>I</underline>nducible <underline>F</underline>ate <underline>M</underline>apping (GIFM) to heritably mark and track cells with temporal control (Zervas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2004</xref>; Joyner and Zervas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2006</xref>; Ellisor et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2009</xref>). Based on <italic>Gbx2</italic>-CKO mice, we hypothesized that the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage would contribute to the Cb vermis more prominently than the lateral hemispheres. Moreover, we speculated that the down-regulation of <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression during development would result in the progressive restriction of the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage across development. In this report, we used <italic>Gbx2-CreER</italic> mice (Chen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2009</xref>; Luu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2011</xref>) to delineate temporally restricted fate maps of <italic>Gbx2</italic> derived neurons in the Cb. Specifically, we marked the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage at five distinct embryonic time points (E7.5-E11.5). Our fate mapping analysis did reveal medial biases, but we also uncovered additional differences in the spatial distribution and cell fate of <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived neurons. Specifically, the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage produced numerous Cb cell types including neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), Purkinje cells, granule cells, and inhibitory interneurons. We also showed that the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage was not progressively restricted in its contribution to Cb cell types, suggesting that <italic>Gbx2</italic>-expressing precursors followed a competency model and generated distinct waves of cell type specific neurogenesis. Finally, the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage contribution was temporally and spatially complementary to the <italic>Wnt1</italic> lineage (Hagan and Zervas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2012</xref>), which suggests that Cb precursors in the URL transition from a <italic>Gbx2</italic>+ molecular identity to a <italic>Wnt1</italic>+ identity in the URL. In this regard, the temporal regulation of <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression may have cell autonomous effects including the control of cell fate decisions in Cb precursors.</p>

<title>Timing of <italic>Gbx2</italic> controls the spatial distribution of the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage in the developing Cb</title>
<p>Although <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression throughout development has previously been described, the allocation of <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived precursors within the Cb primordia has not been determined. Therefore, we used GIFM (Joyner and Zervas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2006</xref>; Dymecki and Kim, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2007</xref>) concomitantly with <italic>Gbx2</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic>−<italic>IRES</italic>−<italic>EGFP</italic>/+</sup>; <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>tdTomato</italic></sup> mice to permanently and heritably mark <italic>Gbx2</italic>-expressing precursors. Marked cells express tdTomato (red fluorescence is produced from recombination of the <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>tdTomato</italic></sup> allele). Specifically, we administered tamoxifen to <italic>Gbx2</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic>−<italic>IRES</italic>−<italic>EGFP</italic>/+</sup>; <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>tdTomato</italic></sup> embryos at five distinct developmental stages (E7.5, E8.5, E9.5, E10.5, and E11.5) and then analyzed embryos at E12.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). With early marking (tamoxifen at E7.5 or E8.5), the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage gave rise to a majority of cells in r1 at E12.5 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,F,B,G</xref>). However, small populations of unlabeled cells were observed in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the lateral-posterior region of r1 with marking at E8.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>, arrowheads). The <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage marked at E9.5 contributed to cells throughout medial and intermediate sagittal planes of r1. However, increased domains of unlabeled cells were distributed along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis in lateral r1 and were more extensive compared to marking a day earlier (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>, arrowheads). Finally, at later marking stages (E10.5-E11.5) we observe two notable alterations: 1. The <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage preferentially populated anterior r1 and showed a sharp decrease in the contribution to posterior r1; this was observed across the entire medial-lateral extent of the embryonic Cb (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D,I,E,J</xref>); 2. The <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage became even more sparse in the lateral VZ at these later stages (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I,J</xref>). Notably, only sparse <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived cells were observed in the upper rhombic lip and the posterior ventricular zone (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D,I,E,J</xref>). In lateral r1, <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived cells were further segregated ventrally (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref>). Thus, <italic>Gbx2</italic> was extinguished in r1 in a posterior-lateral to anterior-medial direction.</p>

<p>We next took advantage of <italic>Gbx2</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic>−<italic>IRES</italic>−<italic>EGFP</italic>/+</sup>; <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>tdTomato</italic></sup> mice to mark the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage at E8.5 and assess the lineage concomitantly with <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression (EGFP) at E12.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This allowed us to compare how <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression was regulated within the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage as the Cb architecture was being established. In both medial and lateral sections at E12.5, the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage that had been marked by tamoxifen administration at E8.5 was distributed throughout r1 including the URL (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>, red labeling), which is consistent with data shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. In the URL of posterior-medial r1 the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage was present, but no longer continued to express <italic>Gbx2</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, URL). The dorsal mes and r1 are separated by the IsO, which expresses <italic>Fgf8</italic> (Zervas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2004</xref>). This translates into the IsO being framed by the expression of OTX2 (marker of the mes) and GBX2 (marker of r1), (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>). Notably, a small number of cells derived from the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage was observed in the IsO (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, white arrowhead and inset) and had ceased to express <italic>Gbx2</italic> (EGFP, green). <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived cells with a clonal arrangement were also occasionally observed in the medial mes at E12.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, white arrowheads, inset).</p>

<p>In lateral sections, <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression had extinguished between E8.5 and E12.5 throughout r1 with the exception of a small domain in the VZ (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Although the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage was largely confined to r1, small clones could be observed in the mes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, white arrowhead, inset). <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived cells could also be seen in the lateral OTX2+ mes, yet most of the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage in this territory did not yet express OTX2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, white arrowhead, inset). However, a rare example of cells derived from the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage (red) was observed in the mes and was coincident with OTX2 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, yellow cell, inset) suggesting that the small population derived from the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage that entered the mes between E8.5-E12.5 were in the processing of dynamically switching their molecular identity to that of a mesencephalic cell.</p>

<title>The <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage differentially contributes to the granule cell layer</title>
<p>As development proceeds, Cb progenitors migrate, differentiate, and acquire their mature molecular identity. Therefore, we followed <italic>Gbx2</italic>-expressing progenitors across development to determine their terminal cell fate in the adult Cb. We used GIFM, taking advantage of <italic>Gbx2</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic>−<italic>IRES</italic>−<italic>EGFP</italic>/+</sup> mice and the conditional <italic>mGFP</italic> reporter line, which upon recombination produces both nuclear beta-galactosidase and EGFP (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref>), to permanently and heritably mark <italic>Gbx2</italic>-expressing precursors at distinct time points during embryogenesis. Subsequently, we analyzed the distribution of the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage in the mature Cb. The <italic>mGFP</italic> reporter line allowed us to identify the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage via their expression of nuclear LacZ and membrane bound GFP. Through this analysis, we showed that the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage gave rise to a variety of neuronal cell types in the mature Cb, with a striking contribution to granule cells.</p>
<p>Specifically, when tamoxifen was administered at E7.5, the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage contributed to granule cells both in the medial (vermis) and lateral hemispheres (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A–F</xref>). Medially, <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived granule cells were most prominent in the central zone (lobules VI and VII) and least pronounced in the nodular zone (lobules X and ventral IX) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This spatial bias was evident by comparing the anterior folia (folia II) and the posterior folia (folia X) of the vermis at higher magnification (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B,C</xref>). Laterally, <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived granule cells were more evenly distributed across all folia and contributed heavily to granule cells in the paramedian lobule (Pm) and contributed to numerous granule cells in the lobulus simplex (S), crus I (CI), crus II (CII), and copula pyramidis (P) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D–F</xref>). Similarly, progenitors expressing <italic>Gbx2</italic> at E8.5 contributed to granule cells in both the vermis and hemispheres (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G–L</xref>). Notably, the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage marked at E8.5 constituted the peak contribution to granule cells across the medial-lateral axis. In the vermis, the anterior bias that was observed with marking a day earlier (at E7.5) was no longer present and robust granule cell contribution was observed throughout the Cb (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G–I</xref>). Laterally, the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage contributed strongly to Pm, but also populated the other lobules (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3J–L</xref>).</p>

<p>Marking at mid-embryonic development (E9.5) revealed that <italic>Gbx2</italic>-expressing progenitors persisted in giving rise to granule cells throughout the Cb (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). With marking at E9.5, the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage populated the anterior vermis with a subtle decrease in <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived granule cells in the most posterior folia of the vermis (compare Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H,I</xref> to Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B,C</xref>). In contrast, there was a noticeable decrease to the posterior folia in the bi-lateral hemispheres compared to marking a day earlier (compare Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3J–L</xref> to Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D–F</xref>). We subsequently labeled and followed the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage at later stages and showed that the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage persisted in contributing to Cb granule cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Marking at E10.5 showed that the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage preferentially populated the anterior vermis while far fewer <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived granule cells were observed posteriorly (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A–C</xref>). In particular, the most prominent contribution to granule cells with marking at E10.5 was seen in the anterior zone (lobules I-V). Notably, granule cell marking was progressively diminished in the central zone (lobules VI and VII) and the posterior zone (lobules VIII and dorsal IX). The most significantly decreased contribution was to the nodular zone (dorsal IX and X) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). The anterior bias was also observed in the lateral hemispheres (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D–F</xref>). In general, anterior lobules (A, S, and CI) contained more fate mapped granule cells than posterior lobules (CII, Pm, and P) with marking at E10.5. The <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage gave rise to the greatest number of granule cells in anterior folia, such as the lobulus simplex (S) and the fewest in copula pyramidis (P) with marking at E10.5 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E,F</xref>). By comparing the medial vermis and lateral hemispheres, there was a clear medial bias toward <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived granule cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A,D</xref>). This bias was most noticeable in the posterior Cb, with the posterior hemispheres exhibiting a significant decrease in <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived granule cells compared to the posterior vermis (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C,F</xref>). Marking at E10.5 also revealed that the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage was significantly shifted compared to earlier marking stages with fewer labeled granule cell projections in the molecular layer which consequently revealed a slightly banded marking pattern in the lateral hemispheres (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E,F</xref>). The molecular layer was comprised of a richly dense, and uniform plexus of GFP-positive projections due to the large number of granule cell axons with early marking (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B,C,E,F,H,I,K,L</xref>). Finally, marking at E11.5 revealed that the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage gave rise to fewer granule cells vs. any other other earlier marking stage (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G–L</xref>). In the vermis, the reduced amount of <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived granule cells was observed in the anterior lobe (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G,H</xref>) while the posterior vermis was nearly devoid of <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived granule cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G,I</xref>). Marking the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage at E11.5 resulted in only sparse labeling of granule cells and parallel fibers in the molecular layer of Cb hemispheres (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5J–L</xref>). Consequently, Purkinje cell dendrites were observed as a discernible striped projection pattern in the molecular layer (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5K,L</xref>). Marking at this later stage also revealed <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived neurons in the molecular layer of the vermis (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H,I</xref>, arrows).

<title>The <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage produces purkinje cells over a prolonged time period</title>
<p>In addition to neurons in the granular cell layer, large <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived neurons were observed in the Purkinje cell layer at every marking stage (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). With early marking (tamoxifen at E7.5 and E8.5), the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage contributed to Purkinje cells throughout the vermis and hemispheres, with a bias toward the posterior vermis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). There was also a posterior bias of <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived Purkinje cells in the vermis observed with marking at E9.5 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A–C</xref>). We verified that these <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived neurons were indeed Purkinje cells by co-localizing ß-gal with two different Purkinje cell biomarkers, calbindin and parvalbumin (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A–F</xref>). Calbindin is a calcium binding protein expressed specifically in Purkinje cells in the Cb while parvalbumin is also a calcium binding protein, but is expressed in both Purkinje cells and inhibitory interneurons of the molecular layer (Bastianelli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2003</xref>). Our biomarker analysis confirmed that nearly all calbindin+ (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A–C</xref>) and PV+ (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D–F</xref>) Purkinje cells were ßgal+. These results indicate that the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage marked at E9.5 represents the peak contribution to Purkinje cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B,E</xref>). Finally, with later marking (E10.5 and E11.5), the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage continued to give rise to Purkinje cells. However, there was a prominent decrease in <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived Purkinje cells in the lateral-posterior Cb (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This observation was confirmed with calbindin and parvalbumin marker analysis (data not shown).

<title>The <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage has a minimal contribution to cerebellar interneurons</title>
<p>In our fate mapping experiments, we observed <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived neurons in both the granular and molecular layers that could not be identified based on cellular morphology alone. Therefore, we again used cell-type specific biomarkers in conjunction with ß-gal to determine the molecular identity of these cells. First, we used parvalbumin to discern GABAergic interneurons positioned in the molecular layer (ML). With both early (E7.5 and E8.5) and late (E10.5 and E11.5) marking stages, the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage failed to give rise to any parvalbumin+ cells in the ML (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D,F</xref>, arrows). It is noteworthy that <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived inhibitory interneurons (parvalbumin+) were observed in the molecular layer of all folia, but only with marking at E9.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>, arrowheads, inset). Interestingly, this intermediate marking stage corresponded to the peak contribution of the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage to another GABAergic cell type, Purkinje cells, which were positioned in the Purkinje cell layer (PCL) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D–F</xref>).</p>
<p>We observed Gbx2-derived neurons in the granule cell layer (GCL) that were larger than granules cells yet smaller than Purkinje cells. Based on their size and location in the granule cell layer, we assessed whether these <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived “intermediate” cells expressed calretinin, a calcium binding protein expressed in a subpopulation of unipolar brush cells (Englund et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2006</xref>). In particular, unipolar brush cells are glutamatergic interneurons located in the nodular zone of the vermis (Bastianelli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2003</xref>). However, the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage failed to give rise to calretinin+ cells at any marking stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>; data not shown). In contrast, GABAergic interneurons positioned in the GCL are identified by the expression of <italic>Pax2</italic>, a paired box transcription factor (Maricich and Herrup, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">1999</xref>). At all marking stages, the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage gave rise to relatively few Pax2+ cells medially and laterally (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6H</xref>, white arrowheads).</p>
<p>Finally, the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage gave rise to neurons in the DCN with marking at each embryonic stage in our analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage had its highest contribution to DCN neurons with marking at E7.5 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A,B</xref>). With this early marking stage, <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived neurons were found evenly distributed in all three DCN. At intermediate marking stages (tamoxifen at E9.5), there was a sharp drop off of medially marked neurons vs. lateral DCN neurons (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C,D</xref>). However, with late marking (tamoxifen at E11.5), there were notably fewer <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived neurons located in lateral DCN than intermediate or medial nuclei (the interpositus and fastigial nuclei, respectively) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E,F</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The homeobox transcription factor, <italic>Gbx2</italic>, is transiently expressed during embryogenesis and functions to position and maintain the IsO, which is located at the junction of the mes and r1. In addition, <italic>Gbx2</italic> plays an integral role in patterning the presumptive Cb. However, the cell autonomous lineage decisions of <italic>Gbx2</italic> expressing precursors has not been investigated in the Cb. Additionally, analysis of <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression in r1 does not uncover the relationship between the timing of <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression and terminal cell fate decisions of Cb precursors nor does it reveal the contribution of <italic>Gbx2</italic> expressing precursors to the mature Cb. With GIFM, we permanently and heritably marked <italic>Gbx2</italic> expressing precursors at specific embryonic stages and tracked these precursors and their progeny across development. Our GIFM analysis reveals that the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage is not progressively restricted in its contribution to the Cb, but rather gives rise to molecularly and spatially distinct subpopulations at different developmental stages (summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These findings raise the possibility that <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression guides Cb development from within r1 precursors and that the previously reported <italic>Gbx2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> phenotype results, not only from perturbations in the IsO, but also from a loss of cell autonomous <italic>Gbx2</italic> function (i.e., cell fate decisions).</p>
<p>At E8.5 <italic>Gbx2</italic> is expressed throughout the entire extent of r1, but by E9.5 the <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression domain becomes more restricted spatially (Liu and Joyner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2001</xref>). Based on this expression pattern, we hypothesized that the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage would contribute to all Cb neurons with early marking and that this contribution would diminish with marking at intermediate and later stages. However, we discovered that the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage gives rise to several Cb cell types with distinct peaks of contribution. For example, the greatest contribution to the DCN occurs at E7.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In contrast, the peak contribution to granule cells occurs at E8.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and the peak contribution to Purkinje cells transpires at E9.5 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These observations disprove that a lineage restriction model applies to <italic>Gbx2</italic> expressing progenitors and indicates that <italic>Gbx2</italic> is induced <italic>de novo</italic> in Cb progenitors at distinct temporal epochs.</p>
<p>Neurogenesis within the Cb is segregated into two distinct germinal zones during development: 1. The ventricular zone (VZ), which produces all inhibitory neurons of the Cb; 2. The upper rhombic lip (URL), which generates all excitatory Cb neurons (Hoshino et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2005</xref>; Machold and Fishell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2005</xref>; Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2005</xref>; Leto et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2006</xref>). Within each germinal zone, neurogenesis is also temporally compartmentalized resulting in different Cb cell types emerging at distinct embryonic stages. Our GIFM analysis of adult mice demonstrates that the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage yields substantial production of DCN neurons, granule cells, and Purkinje cells. In contrast, the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage makes only a minor contribution to inhibitory interneurons of the granular and molecular layers and does not give rise to unipolar brush cells. These results indicate that <italic>Gbx2</italic> expressing precursors contribute to the earliest born cell types produced in the Cb germinal zones. It also appears that Cb cell types generated later in embryogenesis (post-E11.5) do not have a history of <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression. Interestingly, <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived granule cells have a biased contribution to the anterior-medial Cb where the first born granule cells are located (Altman and Bayer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1997</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived Purkinje cells are predominately found in the posterior Cb where the earliest born Purkinje cells are positioned (Altman and Bayer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1997</xref>). These findings suggest that progenitors within the VZ and URL lip are temporally and molecularly partitioned into two distinct cohorts (<italic>Gbx2</italic>+ and <italic>Gbx2</italic>-). Thus, <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression instructs Cb precursors to adopt an early born cell fate.</p>
<p>Our analysis also indicates that early <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived neurons are distributed within the two Cb germinal zones at E12.5. With early marking, a majority of r1 is derived from the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage, although a small cohort of unmarked cells is also observed. Over the course of development, these unmarked precursors apparently undergo massive proliferation to give rise to later born Cb cell types. In contrast, Cb precursors with a history of later <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression (E10.5 and E11.5) are not located in the most posterior VZ and URL at E12.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). At these later embryonic stages, <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression is downregulated in the posterior Cb. Therefore, fate mapping at these stages only marks cells that have already emerged from the URL and posterior VZ by E12.5. By comparing all five fate mapping marking stages, we determined that early <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression does not necessarily translate into early migration away from the germinal zone. These findings establish that the timing of <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression does not regulate when the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage emerges from the VZ or URL.</p>
<p>Beyond birth order, the spatial distribution of the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage may also be attributed to morphogenic movements that establish the complex anatomy of the mature Cb. For example, the medial bias of <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived granule cells may occur because the heavily labeled anterior folia are not contiguous with the Cb hemispheres (Altman and Bayer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1997</xref>). In addition, the anterior-posterior axis of dorsal r1 undergoes a 90° rotation from E9.5 to E12.5 and is converted into the medial-lateral axis of the adult Cb (Sgaier et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2005</xref>). Therefore, any medial bias in labeling within the adult Cb may result from an anterior bias in <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression embryonically (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">2</xref>). In particular, the medial distribution of <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived granule cells and Purkinje cells at later marking stages is most likely explained by the down-regulation of Gbx2 expression in posterior r1 (See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Moreover, the sharp decrease in granule cell marking from E8.5 to E11.5 and the relatively prolonged contribution to Purkinje cells suggests that <italic>Gbx2</italic> becomes restricted to the anterior ventricular zone as development proceeds.</p>
<p>The spatial biases in our GIFM analysis also provides new insights into the vermis phenotype of the conditional knock out of <italic>Gbx2</italic> at E8.5 (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2002</xref>). Previous gene expression analysis revealed that the <italic>Otx2</italic> and <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression domains extend posteriorly into medial r1 in <italic>Gbx2</italic>-CKO mice. This posterior shift in gene expression verified that <italic>Gbx2</italic> continues to function in positioning and maintaining the IsO after E8.5 (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2002</xref>). However, we show that the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage also preferentially contributes to cells located in the medial Cb. Specifically, the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage consistently gives rise to granule cells in the vermis across all fate mapping stages, while the contribution to the Cb hemispheres is significantly reduced after E9.5. These fate mapping results contribute to the explanation as to why the vermis is more affected by the loss of <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression after E8.5 and points to a cell autonomous role for <italic>Gbx2</italic> in Cb precursors.</p>
<p>The loss of <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression in <italic>Gbx2</italic>-CKO mice also allows the secreted glycoprotein, <italic>Wnt1</italic>, to be aberrantly expressed within r1—in addition to endogenous <italic>Wnt1</italic> expression in the rhombic lip (Hagan and Zervas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2012</xref>). Interestingly, the expanded <italic>Wnt1</italic> expression domain is only observed medially and may help explain the vermis phenotype in <italic>Gbx2</italic>-CKO mice (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2002</xref>). In <italic>Gbx2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, <italic>Wnt1</italic> expression also extends into r1. Moreover, <italic>Gbx2</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>;Otx2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> double knockout mutants confirm that that the enlarged <italic>Wnt1</italic> expression domain is not purely because of a posterior shift in <italic>Otx2</italic> expression (Wassarman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">1997</xref>; Li and Joyner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2001</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Gbx2</italic> likely functions to cell autonomously repress <italic>Wnt1</italic> expression in r1 precursors. Importantly, this repression not only occurs at the interface of the IsO and r1, but also delays the onset of <italic>Wnt1</italic> expression in the URL. Notably, at E7.5 and E8.5 the expression of <italic>Gbx2</italic> extends throughout r1 and <italic>Wnt1</italic> is not expressed in the Cb primordia. However, by E9.5 <italic>Gbx2</italic> starts to diminish particularly in posterior r1 and may allow for <italic>Wnt1</italic> expression to be upregulated in the upper rhombic lip at E10.5 (Wilkinson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">1987</xref>; Hagan and Zervas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2012</xref>). In fact, GIFM experiments tracking the temporal contribution of the <italic>Wnt1</italic> lineage revealed that <italic>Wnt1</italic>-derived granule cells marked at later embryonic stages are generally distributed in a complementary pattern to the <italic>Gbx2</italic>-derived granule cells (this study and Hagan and Zervas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2012</xref>). In this regard, the <italic>Gbx2</italic> lineage gives rise to the earliest progenitors emerging from the VZ and URL, while the <italic>Wnt1</italic> lineage produces progenitors arising from the URL slightly later in development (Hagan and Zervas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2012</xref>). Together, these results suggest that <italic>Gbx2</italic> plays a cell autonomous role in regulating the timing of <italic>Wnt1</italic> expression in r1. Through this temporal control of gene expression, a combinatorial molecular code may emerge to determine the cell fate of precursors within the developing Cb.</p>
<p>The Cb has a prominent role in complex disorders including Tuberous Sclerosis and autism (Tsai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2012</xref>; Hampson and Blatt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2015</xref>; Mosconi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2015</xref>; reviewed in D'Mello and Stoodley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2015</xref>). The anatomical domains Crus I/II have emerged as being seminal in autism (D'Mello et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2015</xref>) and a reduction of Purkinje cells is a cellular correlate to autism phenotypes (Bauman and Kemper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2005</xref>). Consistent gray matter reductions that occur in autism are in Crus I and lobules VIIIB, and IX (Stoodley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2014</xref>). Interestingly, these regions have decreased <italic>Gbx2</italic> contribution beginning at E10.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), which is nearly coincident with the peak of <italic>Wnt1</italic> contributation to these domains (Hagan and Zervas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2012</xref>). We believe that our current study linking <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression, cell lineage, and cell fate in the Cb may provide valuable context for understanding neurological disease. Determining the temporal relationships between <italic>Gbx2</italic> expressing precursors and the cell types that this lineage gives rise to is a valuable guide for understanding the organization of the Cb. Additionally, these findings will be fruitful for interpreting when specific Cb domains, Cb cell types, and behaviors may be altered in human disease or in experimental mouse models of neurological disease.</p>
