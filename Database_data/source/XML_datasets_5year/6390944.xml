<p id="P3">The discovery of significant amounts of metabolically active brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans renders it a promising target for anti-obesity therapies by inducing weight loss through increased energy expenditure. The components of the <italic>N</italic>-acetylaspartate (NAA) pathway are highly abundant in BAT. Aspartate <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase (Asp-NAT, encoded by <italic>Nat8l</italic>) synthesizes NAA from acetyl-CoA and aspartate and increases energy expenditure in brown adipocytes. However, the exact mechanism how the NAA pathway contributes to accelerated mobilization and oxidation of lipids and the physiological regulation of the NAA pathway remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of NAA pathway genes corresponds to nutrient availability and specifically responds to changes in exogenous glucose. NAA is preferentially produced from glucose-derived acetyl-CoA and aspartate and its concentration increases during adipogenesis. Overexpression of <italic>Nat8l</italic> drains glucose-derived acetyl-CoA into the NAA pool at the expense of cellular lipids and certain amino acids. Mechanistically, we elucidated that a combined activation of neutral and lysosomal (acid) lipolysis is responsible for the increased lipid degradation. Specifically, translocation of the transcription factor EB to the nucleus activates the biosynthesis of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Lipid degradation within lysosomes accompanied by adipose triglyceride lipase-mediated lipolysis delivers fatty acids for the support of elevated mitochondrial respiration. Together, our data suggest a crucial role of the NAA pathway in energy metabolism and metabolic adaptation in BAT.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P4">The worldwide epidemic of obesity is primarily caused by increased food intake, sedentary lifestyle, and genetic predisposition. These conditions cause an imbalance between energy consumption and energy expenditure resulting in a massive accumulation of fat, predominantly in white adipose tissue (WAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Conversely, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is specialized to increase energy expenditure and is a promising target for interventions to combat obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. BAT has the ability to oxidize high amounts of glucose and fatty acids (FA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The mobilization of FA from cellular lipid stores requires the enzymatic hydrolysis of triacylglycerols (TG) by neutral or acid lipolysis, which are classified depending on the pH-optimum of the involved enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Neutral lipid hydrolysis is mediated by a lipolytic cascade consisting of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. ATGL specifically catabolizes TG generating free FA and diacylglycerol (DG). Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is capable of hydrolyzing a broad substrate spectrum with highest activities toward DG and cholesterol ester. The last step of neutral lipolysis is facilitated by monoacylglycerol lipase, which converts monoacylglycerols to FAs and glycerol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. In BAT, lipophagy substantially contributes to TG degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Lipophagy is a specialized form of macroautophagy and defined as the autophagic degradation of intracellular lipid droplets in the lysosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. To this end, cytosolic cargo is engulfed by double membrane vesicles (autophagosomes) that ultimately fuse with lysosomes for degradation of <italic>e.g.</italic> TG carried out by lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p>
<p id="P5">The important role of BAT in maintaining body temperature through the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-mediated thermogenesis in rodents and infants has long been recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. The more recent discovery of significant amounts of metabolically active BAT in adult humans has revealed additional roles for BAT in the maintenance of energy homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. However, the metabolic pathways that respond to and regulate energy homeostasis in BAT are not well defined. Thus, it is of critical importance to understand novel metabolic pathways that control energy homeostasis in BAT to counteract obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p>
<p id="P6">We previously identified the <italic>N</italic>-acetylaspartate (NAA) pathway as highly abundant in BAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Previously, the NAA pathway was extensively investigated in brain, where aspartate <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase (Asp-NAT, encoded by the gene <italic>Nat8l</italic>) catalyzes the formation of NAA from acetyl-CoA and <sc>l</sc>-aspartate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Thereafter, NAA is cleaved by aspartoacylase (<italic>Aspa</italic>) yielding <sc>l</sc>-aspartate and acetate. Subsequently, acetate can be incorporated into acetyl-CoA and acts as a precursor for lipid synthesis (<italic>i.e.</italic> myelination). Intact NAA metabolism has been shown to determine physiological function and status in the brain. Abnormalities in NAA levels have been reported in patients with cerebral disorders such as brain tumors, stroke, inborn genetic predispositions, and neurodegenerative disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Although NAA metabolism has been studied mostly in the context of the central nervous system, several studies suggested an essential role of NAA in peripheral tissues and metabolic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. For instance, Nat8l expression was significantly reduced in adipose depots of obese mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] and in subcutaneous and visceral fat of insulin-resistant obese humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p>
<p id="P7">Our previous studies showed that modulation of the NAA pathway impacts lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Specifically, constitutive overexpression of Nat8l in brown adipocytes led to an increased incorporation of glucose into lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], whereas blockage of the NAA pathway by knockdown of Aspa reduced cytosolic acetyl-CoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, overexpression of Nat8l also caused increased lipolysis, brown marker gene expression, and mitochondrial respiration. In brown adipocytes, Nat8l is expressed in mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], while Aspa is localized in the cytosolic fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] indicating that NAA may act as a metabolic storage or transport molecule with the potential to modulate the availability of acetyl-CoA for lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. To better understand the observed phenotype and its relevance for brown adipocytes biology, we have investigated i) how the NAA pathway is physiologically regulated, ii) which energy sources are used for the formation of NAA, and iii) how manipulation of the NAA pathway impacts lipid metabolism and BAT biology.</p>

<title>Animal studies</title>
<p id="P8">All animal procedures were approved by the Austrian Ministry for Education, Science, and Research (Vienna, Austria) and were performed in accordance with these guidelines and regulations. Male C57BL/6J mice were used for this study. Animals were kept on a 14/10 h light/dark cycle and had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water, except when food was restricted during fasting. The fasting period was 24 h. At the age of 8–9 weeks, mice were either fed a chow diet (calories 11 kJ% from fat, 53 kJ% from carbohydrates, and 36 kJ% from protein, #V1126, Ssniff<sup>®</sup> Spezialdiäten, Soest, Germany) or put, at the age of 8–9 weeks on HGD (calories 7 kJ% from fat, 72 kJ% from carbohydrates, and 21 kJ% from protein, #E15629-34, Ssniff<sup>®</sup> Spezialdiäten, Soest, Germany) or on HFD (Sniff<sup>®</sup> Spezialdiäten, Soest, Germany, #E15744-34, 45 kJ% calories from fat, 35 kJ% from carbohydrates, and 20 kJ% from protein). Experiments were performed after 12–13 weeks (HGD) or 21–22 weeks (HFD) on the according diet (age and number of mice used are noted in figure legends). Tissues were harvested from mice in fed <italic>ad-libitum</italic>, 24 h fasted or 2 h refed states after 24 h fasting and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p id="P9">To generate immortalized brown adipogenic cells (iBACs, obtained from Patrick Seale, University of Pennsylvania, USA), brown preadipocytes were isolated from newborn mice by collagenase digestion and immortalized by infection with the retroviral vector pBabe encoding SV40T antigen and selected with puromycin (2 μg/ml) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Preadipocytes were grown to confluence in growth media (high glucose DMEM, #11995065) supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 20 mM Hepes (all purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Adipocyte differentiation was induced by treating confluent cells for 48 h in differentiation medium (high glucose DMEM supplemented with 20 nM insulin, 1 nM triiodothyronine (T3), 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 0.5 μM dexamethasone, and 0.125 mM indomethacin (all Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)). After a two-day induction period, the medium was replaced by growth medium supplemented with 20 nM insulin and 1 nM T3. Medium was changed every other day. Full differentiation was achieved after seven days. Stable overexpression of Nat8l in iBACs has been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Nat8l knockdown cell lines were generated using lentiviral shRNA particles and a non-targeting control construct obtained from Merck (CSTVRS-TRCN0000114584, Merk, Darmstadt, Germany). Infected cells were selected with G418 (1.5 mg/ml, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for seven days. To investigate autophagy flux by immunoblotting, fully differentiated brown adipocytes were cultivated in maintenance medium supplemented with bafilomycin A1 (100 nM 6 h, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Acetate complementation was performed supplementing 10 mM sodium acetate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), pH 7.4 to growth medium for 48 h. To determine lipolysis, free fatty acids were measured using NEFA-HR(2) Kit (Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). Values were normalized to protein content (Pierce BCA reagent, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). To stimulate lipolysis, cells were incubated with 10 μM isoproterenol (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 2 h. To determine effects of lipophagy or adipose triacylglycerol lipase (ATGL)-mediated lipolysis, cells were pretreated with 10 nM bafilomycin A1, 40 μM chloroquine (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) or 40 μM atglistatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] (Ai) for 48 h. All cell lines were routinely monitored and confirmed to be free of mycoplasma.</p>

<title>The NAA pathway is regulated by glucose and nutrient availability in adipose tissue</title>
<p id="P24">Adipocytes play a key role in the maintenance of whole-body energy homeostasis by sensing nutrient availability and adapting metabolic gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. To investigate a potential role of the NAA pathway in metabolic adaptation in adipose tissue (AT), we examined the mRNA expression of the key enzymes in NAA metabolism (<italic>Nat8l</italic> and <italic>Aspa</italic>) under different physiological conditions. To that end, C57BL/6J mice were fed <italic>ad libitum</italic>, fasted for 24 h or refed for 2 h after fasting. In BAT and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), <italic>Nat8l</italic> and <italic>Aspa</italic> expression declined with fasting and returned to baseline after 2 h of refeeding a chow diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). This regulation is in accordance with genes involved in glucose metabolism and <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis (DNL) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Further, we investigated mRNA expression of NAA pathway genes in BAT under nutrient-rich conditions mimicked by high-glucose diet (HGD) and high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. On these energy-rich diets, <italic>Nat8l</italic> and <italic>Aspa</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>) as well as control genes involved in glucose metabolism and lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B, C</xref>) were increased when compared to mice fed a chow diet. To determine whether alterations in glucose availability selectively regulate <italic>Nat8l</italic> or <italic>Aspa</italic>, we examined their expression in immortalized brown adipogenic cells (iBACs). Glucose depletion strongly decreased <italic>Nat8l</italic> and <italic>Aspa</italic> expression and replenishment of glucose completely restored expression of both genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). A similar response to changes in glucose flux was seen in the expression of glucose-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>). As expected from elevated <italic>Nat8l</italic> expression in mature adipocytes compared to pre-adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], NAA levels also strongly increased upon differentiation of iBACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P25">To identify the key substrates used for NAA production, we cultured iBACs in growth media with uniformly labeled <sup>13</sup>C-glucose, <sup>13</sup>C-acetate or <sup>13</sup>C- and <sup>15</sup>N-labeled glutamine or branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), namely leucine and valine. Incorporation of heavy isotope label into NAA and its precursor molecules, acetyl-CoA and aspartate was examined by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G, H</xref>). The relative abundance of isotopic carbon labels revealed the preferential utilization of glucose for NAA production in iBACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). Glucose was the only substrate that labeled all six carbon atoms of NAA (M + 6) and was the major contributor to M + 2, M + 3, M + 4, and M + 5 NAA, suggesting that glucose supplies both acetyl-CoA and <sc>l</sc>-aspartate for NAA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H, I</xref>). Interestingly, BCAA (leucine and valine) and glutamine contributed to NAA labeling by supplying their amino group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E</xref>). In comparison to glucose, the carbon contribution from BCAA, glutamine, and acetate was minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). Taken together, expression of <italic>Nat8l</italic> and <italic>Aspa</italic> are nutritionally regulated and respond robustly to changes in glucose availability. NAA is preferentially produced from glucose-derived acetyl-CoA and aspartate and increases during adipogenesis, suggesting that NAA might be an essential contributor to the adipocyte energy metabolite pool.</p>

<title>NAA pathway activity affects metabolic pathways, lipid and energy metabolism</title>
<p id="P26">Our data revealed that <italic>Nat8l</italic> expression is increased under nutrientrich conditions and upon BAT activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. To further investigate the role of <italic>Nat8l</italic> in energy metabolism and metabolic pathways of brown adipocytes, we overexpressed <italic>Nat8l</italic> in iBACs (Nat8l o/e). As expected, we detected increased <italic>Nat8l</italic> mRNA and Asp-NAT protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). In addition, Nat8l o/e resulted in coordinated up-regulation of pathway enzymes, including ASPA and acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2), which are responsible for NAA cleavage to acetate and aspartate and converting acetate into acetyl-CoA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Furthermore, we observed increased ASPA activity, which enables an increased flux through the NAA pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P27">Transcriptomics analysis followed by DAVID functional clustering on the set of genes upregulated by Nat8l o/e revealed an enrichment of genes involved in metabolic pathways, such as oxidative phosphorylation, carbon metabolism, TCA cycle, FA degradation and metabolic processes, degradation of BCAAs and FA elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), indicating that <italic>Nat8l</italic> is involved in the regulation of BAT metabolism. This prompted us to investigate the effect of Nat8l o/e on cellular metabolism in more details. Metabolic profiling showed significantly elevated NAA levels upon Nat8l o/e (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). As labeling experiments revealed glucose as the main contributor to NAA synthesis in brown adipocytes, we performed untargeted <sup>13</sup>C-glucose tracing in control and Nat8l o/e iBACs. We observed a dynamic formation of NAA over a time course of 8 h. In Nat8l o/e cells, we detected increased incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C glucose-derived acetyl-CoA into NAA compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Concomitantly, unlabeled (<sup>12</sup>C) NAA decreased over time, suggesting an active turnover of NAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). However, the percent label enrichment from <sup>13</sup>C labeled glucose, acetate, BCAA or glutamine was comparable between control and Nat8l o/e iBACs revealing that the overexpression did not alter the way NAA was synthesized and also Nat8l o/e iBACs used glucose as their main source (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>).</p>
<p id="P28">We hypothesized that increased NAA metabolism might shuttle acetyl-CoA to the cytosol, where it serves as precursor for lipid synthesis. Therefore, we investigated cytoplasmic intermediates of neutral lipid (malonyl-CoA) and cholesterol (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA, HMG-CoA) biosynthesis. Our data revealed that malonyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>) and HMG-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>) were more abundant in Nat8l o/e iBACs, which is consistent with our previous findings that Nat8l o/e promotes DNL. Further investigation of the impact of increased Asp-NAT activity on energy metabolism with <sup>13</sup>C-glucose tracing revealed that glucose-derived TCA cycle intermediates such as citrate and malate were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J, K</xref>). In addition, increased AA catabolism has been detected. Specifically, we observed a significant reduction of arginine, glutamine, glycine, threonine, tryptophan, leucine, lysine and valine and a significant increase of aspartate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2L, M</xref>). In summary, these data provide evidence that increased Asp-NAT expression accelerates the entire NAA pathway and impacts metabolic pathways and energy metabolism.</p>

<title>Increased NAA pathway activity elevates the number of lysosomes and induces autophagy</title>
<p id="P29">To identify the mechanisms of altered energy metabolism and increased lipid turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] upon increased NAA pathway activity, we tested the hypothesis that maintenance of energy homeostasis requires the induction of autophagy. Autophagy is a catabolic process that degrades cellular components within autophagolysosomes and plays a particularly critical role in recycling metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) translocation to the nucleus and activates the expression of genes involved in autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. To address TFEB translocation, we performed subcellular fractionation and found increased TFEB in the nucleus upon Nat8l o/e (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Concomitantly, we counted elevated number of lysosomes, as determined by transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, C</xref>). Additionally, incubation of cell with the fluorescence dye LysoTracker, which stains acidic compartments (lysosomes) in living cells, and subsequent analysis by fluorescence microscopy and quantification using flow cytometry revealed a two-fold increase in the number of lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D, E</xref>). Furthermore, we observed increased protein levels of the autophagy marker LC3-II under basal conditions and after treatment with the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). To further corroborate these findings, we transfected cells with the tandem mRFP-GFP-LC3 sensor that contains an acid-stable RFP and acid-labile GFP to distinguish between autophagosome and autolysosome by confocal microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. We observed that Nat8l o/e increased the number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes, detected by an increase of red vesicles (mRFP-positive), but not green vesicles (as the GFP signal is quenched in the acidic lysosomal environment), indicating an increased autophagic flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). To address if the increased requirement of acetyl-CoA for NAA synthesis drives the increased induction of autophagy, we aimed to replenish acetyl-CoA and to monitor LC3-II expression. Of note, autophagic levels of Nat8l o/e cells returned to baseline control levels in response to acetate supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H, I</xref>). Together, these data suggest that Nat8l o/e activates autophagy as a compensatory pathway to maintain energy homeostasis as evident by increased lysosomal content and autophagy flux.</p>

<title>Increased lipid catabolism and cellular respiration in Nat8l o/e iBACs are lipophagy and ATGL-mediated</title>
<p id="P30">Our recent publication showed that flux through the NAA pathway affects brown adipocytes by increasing free FA turnover and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in Nat8l o/e iBACs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. FAs are important energy substrates and activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α and PPARα target gene expression and thereby mitochondrial respiratory functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. Hence, we investigated whether the elevated number of lysosomes and autophagolysosomes contribute to this increased free FA release <italic>via</italic> the process of lipophagy. We detected increased activity of LAL, which is active at an acidic pH and mediates lysosomal degradation of lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). In line, inhibition of autophagy flux by BafA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) and chloroquine (CQ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>) significantly reduced free FA release in control and Nat8l o/e cells. Importantly, autophagy inhibition was sufficient to reduce free FA release of Nat8l o/e cells to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B, C</xref>). In addition, chemical inhibition of ATGL by atglistatin (Ai) strikingly reduced free FA release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). To determine the relative contribution of acid and neutral lipolysis to increased OCR observed upon Nat8l o/e in iBACs, we compared basal and uncoupled respiration of control and Nat8l o/e iBACs upon autophagy and neutral lipolysis inhibition. BafA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E–G</xref>), CQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H–J</xref>) as well as Ai (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4K–M</xref>) treatment blocked Nat8l o/e-induced basal and maximum respiration. In line with these results, activation of neutral lipolysis by isoproterenol (Iso) increased free FA release (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>) and further induced basal and maximum respiration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B–D</xref>). Together, these data indicate that a combined activation of neutral and acid lipolysis is responsible for the increased lipid catabolism and supports the elevated mitochondrial respiration in Nat8l o/e iBACs.</p>

Corroborating effective Nat8l-KD, metabolites directly involved in the NAA pathway, such as NAA and aspartate, were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C, D</xref>), whereas TCA cycle intermediates and BCAA were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E, F</xref>). Apart from reduced glutamine and increased proline levels, AA levels were unchanged upon Nat8l-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>). In contrast to increased lysosomal number and autophagy in Nat8l o/e cells, Nat8l-KD showed reduced number of lysosomes and trends to decreased abundance of LC3-II in the absence and presence of BafA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H–J</xref>). Together, the data suggests that Asp-NAT is the primary enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of NAA in brown adipocytes and coordinates the entire pathway. Inhibition of NAA synthesis might make more acetyl-CoA available for other metabolic pathways and therefore lysosomal degradation and autophagy are not required.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P32">This study uncovers the NAA pathway as a new nutrient-responsive player in the regulation of energy metabolism in adipose tissue (AT). Recently, we and others reported a crucial role for NAA outside the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. Here, we provide evidence that a continuous supply with dietary nutrients is a prerequisite for the activation of the NAA pathway in AT and nutrient-rich conditions (HGD, HFD) further upregulate this pathway. Specifically, high glucose availability acts as a potent trigger to regulate <italic>Nat8l</italic> and <italic>Aspa</italic> gene expression in brown adipocytes. Of note, increased glucose uptake during adipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] might explain the upregulation of the NAA pathway genes and NAA levels upon differentiation. The feeding/fasting response of the NAA pathway is in accordance with clinical data, which showed that NAA concentrations were blunted in brain during energy-demanding processes such as hypoxia as well as after stroke and traumatic brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. In addition, we have previously shown that <italic>Nat8l</italic> expression was downregulated in BAT and eWAT of genetically obese (ob/ob) mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Of note, ob/ob mice are diabetic and highly insulin-resistant. Thus, decreased glucose uptake resulting from AT insulin resistance might be an explanation for decreased <italic>Nat8l</italic> expression in ob/ob mice. Consistently, NAA concentrations in serum and urine of ob/ob mice were reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. In this study, we identified glucose as the main substrate for NAA synthesis in brown adipocytes, indicating a direct link between glucose availability and NAA synthesis.</p>
<p id="P33">Our study revealed that increased NAA pathway activity altered energy metabolism in brown adipocytes and interfered with lipid metabolism. We observed increased incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C glucose-derived acetyl-CoA into NAA upon Nat8l o/e. Our data suggest that an increased requirement of acetyl-CoA for NAA synthesis might activate compensatory mechanisms such as acid lipolysis, leading to increased TFEB translocation to the nucleus, increased lysosomal biogenesis, and elevated LC3 lipidation. These findings are further supported by our previous study, where we demonstrated elevated expression of several TFEB target genes such as PGC1α and PPARα, which mediate mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Increased number of lysosomes, elevated autophagic flux, and increased activity of LAL indicate that specifically lipid degradation by lipophagy might be induced in Nat8l o/e iBACs to maintain energy homeostasis. Concomitantly, we found a substantial contribution of ATGL-mediated lipolysis to TG degradation. Although the interplay between lipophagy and lipolysis has not been resolved yet, it was suggested that lipophagy complements neutral lipolysis and that they regulate each other. Both lipophagy and lipolysis hydrolyze LD-stored TGs and deliver FA, which support OCR and browning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Our data indicate that activation of acid and neutral lipolysis contributed to increased lipid catabolism in Nat8l o/e iBACs and elevated mitochondrial respiration was also largely dependent on the increased lipolytic activity.</p>
<p id="P34">Apart from the induction of neutral and acid lipolysis, Nat8l o/e iBACs showed increased <sc>l</sc>-aspartate and NAA levels. <italic>Vice versa</italic>, we observed reduced <sc>l</sc>-aspartate concentrations accompanied by a strong reduction of NAA in Nat8l-KD cells, indicating a regulation of the aspartate pool through modulated NAA pathway activity. So far it is unknown if NAA-derived aspartate (as a result of ASPA-mediated hydrolysis), is utilized for protein synthesis and cell proliferation or whether it re-enters the TCA cycle as oxaloacetate for energy derivation. The regulation of the aspartate pool by the NAA pathway might be also relevant in the context of cancer. Interestingly, non small cell lung cancer cells with metabolic abnormalities, including elevated NAA levels, synthesize the aspartate moiety of NAA predominantly from glutamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. However, some cancer types including ovarian cancer show elevated glucose uptake and utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>] and high levels of NAA and its biosynthetic enzyme Asp-NAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. In line, we identified glucose as the main source for NAA synthesis in brown adipocytes. These findings suggest that the NAA pathway is differently regulated in various tissues and upon pathophysiological conditions.</p>
<p id="P35">In conclusion, our data contribute to the understanding how the NAA pathway increases energy expenditure in brown adipocytes. We demonstrate that nutrient availability and specifically exogenous glucose activate the NAA pathway. NAA is preferentially produced from glucose-derived acetyl-CoA and aspartate. Elevated NAA pathway activity upon overexpression of Nat8l drains glucose-derived acetyl-CoA into the NAA pool thereby affecting lipid turnover, AA degradation and TCA cycle intermediates. We conclude that the NAA pathway is an important regulator of nutrient availability and energy homeostasis in brown adipocytes. Therefore, we suggest the NAA pathway as a promising target to combat metabolic complications associated with adipose tissue dysfunction.</p>

<title>The NAA pathway is regulated in a glucose and nutrient-dependent manner.</title>
<p>Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of <italic>Nat8l</italic> and <italic>Aspa</italic> mRNA expression in (A) brown adipose tissue (BAT) and (B) epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) isolated from male, 12-week-old C57BL/6J mice fed chow diet <italic>ad libitum</italic>, 24 h fasted, or 2 h refed a chow after 24 h fasting (<italic>n</italic> = 5). (C) BAT from 20-week-old mice harvested in overnight fasted – 2 h refed state. Mice were fed a chow or high-glucose diet (HGD). HGD started at the age of 8 weeks (<italic>n</italic> = 4). (D) BAT from 29-week-old mice harvested in fed state. Mice were fed chow or high-fat diet (HFD). HFD started at the age of 8 weeks (<italic>n</italic> = 5). (E) <italic>Nat8l</italic> and <italic>Aspa</italic> mRNA expression in mature immortalized brown adipogenic cells (iBACs) cultivated in high-glucose (gluc) media, 24 h depleted from gluc or 24 h of gluc replenishment after 24 h of gluc depletion, (<italic>n</italic> = 4). (F) Relative NAA levels in brown pre-adipocytes and mature iBACs cultivated in high gluc medium (<italic>n</italic> = 3). (G) Schematic depicting experimental design of NAA carbon labeling produced from acetyl-CoA and aspartate using either [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-gluc, [1,2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]-acetate, branched chain amino acids (BCAA) such as [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>,<sup>15</sup>N]-<sc>l</sc>-leucine and [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>,<sup>15</sup>N]-<sc>l</sc>-valine or [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>,<sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>]-<sc>l</sc>-glutamine (gln). M + n: a metabolite with n carbon atoms labeled with <sup>13</sup>C. (H) iBACs were cultured 5 h in the presence of indicated tracer followed by mass spectrometry. The color codes indicate for the percentage of carbon and nitrogen incorporated into NAA that is heavy isotope-labeled by the indicated number of n atoms labeled with <sup>13</sup>C (<italic>n</italic> = 3). (I) NAA labeling scheme using [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-gluc. For simplicity, labeling of only the first round of TCA cycle is shown. Oxaloacetic acid (OAA) is produced from pyruvate <italic>via</italic> pyruvate carboxylation (PC) or pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) yielding acetyl-CoA, which enters the TCA cycle. Aspartate is synthesized through the transamination of OAA. Data are shown as mean ± SD. Statistical significance was calculated using two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic>-test (*<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, ****<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).
