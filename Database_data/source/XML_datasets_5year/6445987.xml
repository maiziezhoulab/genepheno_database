<abstract>
<p>Presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels regulate channel abundance and are involved in glutamatergic synapse formation. However, little is known about the specific functions of the individual α<sub>2</sub>δ isoforms and their role in GABAergic synapses. Using primary neuronal cultures of embryonic mice of both sexes, we here report that presynaptic overexpression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 in GABAergic synapses strongly increases clustering of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Strikingly, presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 exerts the same effect in glutamatergic synapses, leading to a mismatched localization of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. This mismatching is caused by an aberrant wiring of glutamatergic presynaptic boutons with GABAergic postsynaptic positions. The trans-synaptic effect of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 is independent of the prototypical cell-adhesion molecules α-neurexins (α-Nrxns); however, α-Nrxns together with α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 can modulate postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R abundance. Finally, exclusion of the alternatively spliced exon 23 of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 is essential for the trans-synaptic mechanism. The novel function of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 identified here may explain how abnormal α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit expression can cause excitatory–inhibitory imbalance often associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
<p><bold>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</bold> Voltage-gated calcium channels regulate important neuronal functions such as synaptic transmission. α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits modulate calcium channels and are emerging as regulators of brain connectivity. However, little is known about how individual α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits contribute to synapse specificity. Here, we show that presynaptic expression of a single α<sub>2</sub>δ variant can modulate synaptic connectivity and the localization of inhibitory postsynaptic receptors. Our findings provide basic insights into the development of specific synaptic connections between nerve cells and contribute to our understanding of normal nerve cell functions. Furthermore, the identified mechanism may explain how an altered expression of calcium channel subunits can result in aberrant neuronal wiring often associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism or schizophrenia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Auxiliary α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits are traditionally envisioned as potent modulators of voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Felix et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Klugbauer et al., 1999</xref>). Recently, synaptic functions of all four α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit isoforms have been suggested, which may be partly or entirely independent of the channel complex: α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 has been identified as postsynaptic receptor for glia-secreted thrombospondins, which mediate excitatory synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Eroglu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">Risher et al., 2018</xref>). In mice, loss of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 affected morphology and function of cerebellar Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Barclay et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Brodbeck et al., 2002</xref>), as well as structure and function of auditory hair cell synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Fell et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 has been identified as a suppressor of axonal regeneration in the adult CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">Tedeschi et al., 2016</xref>). The invertebrate homologs of α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 are crucial for the presynaptic development of motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Kurshan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Caylor et al., 2013</xref>) and, in mice, loss of α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 results in aberrant synapse formation of auditory nerve fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">Pirone et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, α<sub>2</sub>δ-4 is required for the organization of rod and cone photoreceptor synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Kerov et al., 2018</xref>). The overall importance of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits is emphasized by their involvement in various neurological disorders: CACNA2D1 and CACNA2D2, the genes encoding α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 and α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, have been linked to epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Chioza et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Edvardson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Pippucci et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">Vergult et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Butler et al., 2018</xref>); CACNA2D3 is a potential risk gene for autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Iossifov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">De Rubeis et al., 2014</xref>); and all three genes may be associated with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Purcell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Moons et al., 2016</xref>). Mutations in CACNA2D4 can cause retinal dysfunction in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Ba-Abbad et al., 2016</xref>) and a partial deletion of CACNA2D4 was identified in patients with late-onset bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">Van Den Bossche et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the increasing knowledge, it is still largely elusive how the individual α<sub>2</sub>δ isoforms contribute to the formation and function of central synapses. The fact that α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits constitute large extracellular and highly glycosylated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Davies et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Bauer et al., 2010</xref>) puts them in an ideal position for extracellular functions, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Fell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, a recent study provided evidence for an interaction of α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 with NMDARs in dorsal horn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) and presynaptic α-neurexins (α-Nrxns) are potential candidates for mediating synaptic functions of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">Tong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Brockhaus et al., 2018</xref>). However, the role of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits has until now only been addressed in excitatory glutamatergic synapses. This is surprising because α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits are strongly expressed in GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Cole et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">Schlick et al., 2010</xref>) and aberrant GABAergic signaling is primarily implicated in the etiology of the abovementioned neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Bonansco and Fuenzalida, 2016</xref>). Finally, the brain robustly expresses α<sub>2</sub>δ-1, α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, and α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">Schlick et al., 2010</xref>); however, whether and how the individual isoforms contribute to specific functions in neurons simultaneously expressing all isoforms is elusive.</p>
<p>Therefore, to address α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit-mediated synaptic functions, we analyzed the consequences of presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit expression in glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. We show that presynaptic overexpression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 specifically induces the formation of mismatched glutamatergic synapses by trans-synaptically recruiting postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Moreover, α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 recruits postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs also in GABAergic synapses and thus independently of the presynaptic neurotransmitter identity. Most importantly, the mismatched synapse formation is explained by an altered wiring of glutamatergic axons to GABAergic postsynaptic positions. Interestingly, the α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-induced GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering is further upregulated in glutamatergic neurons lacking all three α-Nrxns. Therefore, α-Nrxns can modulate the presynaptic effect of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2; however, they are not required for the trans-synaptic role of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 in recruiting GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Together, our findings prove that presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 acts trans-synaptically on postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R. The fact that increased α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 expression triggers aberrant axonal wiring is particularly interesting in light of neurological disorders associated with axonal wiring defects and altered excitatory–inhibitory balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Huang and Hsueh, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Lee et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

<p>Animal procedures for WT BALB/c and α<sub>2</sub>δ mutant mice were performed at the Medical University Innsbruck in compliance with government regulations and approved by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy (license numbers BMWFW-66.011/0113-WF/V/3b/2014 and BMWFW-66.011/0114-WF/V/3b/2014). Regular reports including the mouse numbers used for this project were given to the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy (bmwfw). Animal experiments at the University of Münster [α-Nrxn triple knock-out (TKO) and control mice] were performed in accordance with government regulations for animal welfare and approved by the Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz (LANUV, NRW, Germany, license numbers 84-02.05.20.11.209 and 84-02.04.2015.A423). Mice were maintained at the central animal facilities in Innsbruck and Münster under standard housing conditions with food and water available <italic>ad libitum</italic> on a 12 h light/dark cycle.</p>

<sec>
<title>Breeding and genotyping of mutant mice.</title>
<p>WT and α<sub>2</sub>δ-3<sup>−/−</sup> mice used for qRT-PCR and LacZ reporter expression were obtained from breeding double heterozygous α<sub>2</sub>δ-1<sup>+/−</sup>, α<sub>2</sub>δ-3<sup>+/−</sup> mice having a mixed 129J × C57BL/6 background. The α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 knock-out mouse strain (α<sub>2</sub>δ-1<sup>−/−</sup>) was previously generated and characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Fuller-Bicer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">Patel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Mastrolia et al., 2017</xref>). Genotyping for the Cacna2d1 gene was done as published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Fuller-Bicer et al., 2009</xref>) with some modifications by use of standard PCR conditions (annealing at 52°C for 30 s). Primers were as follows: WT-F1: 5′-GAGCTTTCTTTCTTCTGATTCCAC-3′, mutant-F2: 5′-CTGCACGAGACTAGTGAGACG-3′, R: 5′-ACATTCTCAAGACTGTAGGCAGAG-3′. Expected band sizes were 346 bp for WT (α<sub>2</sub>δ-1<sup>+/+</sup>) and 635 bp for knock-out (α<sub>2</sub>δ-1<sup>−/−</sup>) animals, respectively, and heterozygous mice showed both bands. The α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 knock-out mice (α<sub>2</sub>δ-3<sup>−/−</sup>) generated by Deltagen (B6.129P2-Cacna2d3<sup>tm1Dgen</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Neely et al., 2010</xref>) were originally purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and provided by Jutta Engel (Saarland University, Germany). Knock-out was obtained by targeted insertion of a bacterial LacZ cassette into the Cacna2d3 gene such that the endogenous promoter drives the expression of β-galactosidase. The following primers were used for detecting the WT allele (F1-R, 183 bp fragment) and the knock-out allele (F2-R, 331 bp fragment): F1: 5′-TAGAAAAGATGCACTGGTCACCAGG-3′, F2: 5′-GGGCCAGCTCATTCCTCCCACTCAT-3′, R: 5′-GCAGAAGGCACATTGCCATACTCAC-3′ by use of standard PCR conditions (annealing at 63°C for 30 s). α-Nrxn TKO mice were generated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Missler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Dudanova et al., 2007</xref>). Genotyping of α-Nrxn-deficient mice was performed at the same time of neuronal preparation and as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Missler et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Lentiviral production.</title>
<p>Lentiviruses were produced by transient transfection of confluent tsa201 cells with the lentiviral expression vectors containing pHR-βA-eGFP, pHR-βA-mcherry, or pHR-βA-eGFP*α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 in combination with psPAX2 (packaging plasmid) and the pVSV (envelope plamid) using Metafectene (Biontex Laboratories). The following day, medium was changed to neuronal plating medium (NPM; consisting of MEM, 10% horse serum, 0.2% glucose, and 1 m<sc>m</sc> sodium pyruvate) and, after 24 and 48 h, supernatants containing the viruses were harvested, sterile filtered (0.20 μm), aliquoted, and stored at −20°C. Cultured hippocampal and striatal neurons were infected immediately after plating with the lentiviral medium supernatant diluted 1:4 in NPM and incubated for 4 h in a humidified incubator (95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) at 37°C. More details for infection procedures are given in the individual sections below.</p>

<title>Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons for fluorescence imaging.</title>
<p>Low-density cultures of hippocampal neurons were obtained from 16.5- to 18-d-old embryonic BALB/c mice of either sex as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">Obermair et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Kaech and Banker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">Stanika et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Folci et al., 2018</xref>). In brief, hippocampi were dissected in cold Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) following dissociation by 2.5% trypsin-EDTA treatment and trituration. Dissociated neurons were plated at a density of ∼3500 or 7000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> on 18 mm glass coverslips (#1.5; GML) coated with poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) in 60 mm culture dishes. After allowing the neurons to attach for 3–4 h, coverslips were transferred neuron-side down into a 60 mm culture dish containing a glial feeder layer. Maintenance of neurons and glia was done in serum-free neurobasal medium supplemented with Glutamax and B-27 (NBKO, all ingredients from Thermo Fisher Scientific). Three days after plating, Ara-C (5 μ<sc>m</sc>) was added to stop glial proliferation and 1/3 of the medium was replaced weekly with fresh maintenance medium. Plasmids were introduced into neurons at 6 days <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) with Lipofectamine 2000-mediated transfection (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">Obermair et al., 2004</xref>). For cotransfection of pβA-eGFP plus pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ or mCherry plus pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ, 1.5 μg of total DNA was used at a molar ratio of 0.7:1. Control neurons from the same culture preparations were transfected with 1–2 μg of pβA-eGFP or mCherry, respectively. Labeling of cells for superresolution gated stimulated emission depletion (gSTED) microscopy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref><italic>A–C</italic>) was done by introducing mCherry or mCherry plus α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 at 6 DIV and pβA-eGFP at 7 DIV with lipofection. Cells were processed for immunostaining experiments between 20 and 30 DIV.</p>
<p>For α-Nrxn TKO, WT and mutant mice of either sex were used for neuronal cultures derived from timed pregnant dams at embryonic day 17 (E17). Dissociated primary neurons were prepared in HBSS from single hippocampi as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Neupert et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, cell suspensions obtained after 0.25% trypsin treatment and trituration were plated onto 18 mm glass coverslips (Menzel-Glaeser) coated with poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) at a density of 55,000 cells/coverslip. After 4 h at 37°C in plating medium (MEM, 10% horse serum, 0.6% glucose, and 1 m<sc>m</sc> sodium pyruvate), coverslips were inverted onto a 70–80% confluent monolayer of astrocytes grown in 12-well plates (Falcon) and incubated in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> glutamine, and 12.5 μ<sc>m</sc> glutamate. After 3 d, media were refreshed with Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> glutamine, and 5 μ<sc>m</sc> AraC. Cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Neurons were transfected at 14 DIV using lipofectamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and experiments were performed between 20 and 25 DIV.</p>

<p>Because the inclusion of glutamatergic neurons is required for the proper development of GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">Segal et al., 2003</xref>), we modified the protocol for hippocampal neurons and adapted the striatal–cortical coculture published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Penrod et al., 2011</xref>). Cocultures of cortical neurons and striatal MSNs were prepared from 16.5- to 18-d-old embryonic BALB/c mice of either sex as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>. Briefly, fetuses were removed from the uterus, decapitated, and brains were dissected in cold HBSS. After separating the cerebral hemispheres and stripping away the meninges, hemispheres were placed medial surface up, showing the hippocampus as a clearly visible structure. A region of the prefrontal cortex was dissected, minced, and transferred to a 15 ml Falcon tube containing HBSS (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>). The remaining cortical tissue was peeled along the line of the hippocampus to reveal the striatum, which was scooped out using small curved scissors and transferred to a separate tube. Striatal and cortical tissue of at least 2 hemispheres was separately collected and dissociated by 2.5% trypsin-EDTA treatment and trituration as described for hippocampal neurons (see above). Plasmid DNA–lipid complexes were prepared according to the Lipofectamine 2000-mediated transfection protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and ∼2.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> striatal neurons were transfected for 20 min in a 37°C water bath keeping the total volume to 1 ml with NBKO. Subsequently, the cell suspension was directly seeded on poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine-coated glass coverslips within a 60 mm culture dish containing 4 ml of prewarmed NPM and striatal neurons were allowed to attach at 37°C. For the entire transfection procedure, dissociated cortical neurons were maintained in HBSS in a 15 ml tube at 37°C and occasionally swirled. After 2 h, transfection of striatal neurons was stopped by replacing the transfection-plating solution with 5 ml of fresh, prewarmed NPM and untransfected cortical neurons were seeded onto striatal neurons in a ratio of 2 (cortical neurons) to 3 (MSNs) at a total density of ∼14,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. For the immunostaining experiments and electrophysiological recordings shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, striatal neurons were plated at a density of 4000 or 7000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, and infected with a lentiviral pHR-βA-eGFP construct. Following attachment of MSNs and viral infection for 4 h, untransfected cortical neurons were plated at a density of 2800 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Cortical cells were allowed to attach for 3–4 h and coverslips were transferred neuron-side down into a 60 mm culture dish containing a glial feeder layer. In cocultures for superresolution gSTED microscopy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref><italic>E</italic>), striatal and cortical neurons were labeled with eGFP and mCherry, respectively. For this purpose, striatal neurons were plated at a density of 7000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> on poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine-coated glass coverslips in a 60 mm culture dish containing 4 ml of prewarmed NPM. MSNs were virally infected using a lentiviral pHR-βA-eGFP construct and allowed to attach for 3–4 h. In the meantime, ∼2.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> cortical neurons were transfected at 37°C in a water bath, keeping the total volume to 1 ml with NBKO. To this end, mCherry or mCherry plus α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 were introduced using the Lipofectamine 2000-mediated transfection protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Total DNA amounts and molar ratios were the same as described above for hippocampal neurons. Infection of striatal neurons was stopped by replacing the virus-plating solution with 4 ml of fresh, prewarmed NPM. The cell suspension containing the cortical neurons and transfection solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm at 4°C. Finally, cortical neurons were resuspended in 1 ml of NBKO, seeded onto striatal neurons, and allowed to attach for 3–4 h before coverslips were transferred neuron-side down into a 60 mm culture dish containing a glial feeder layer. Ara-C treatment and maintenance of neurons and glia were as described above. Cells were processed for immunostaining and patch-clamp experiments at 21–27 and 13–14 DIV, respectively.</p>

<title>Neuronal cultures for paired recordings.</title>
<p>Culture protocols were modified to enable electrophysiological recordings from pairs of isolated neurons. Poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine solution (Sigma-Aldrich) was sprayed on glass coverslips, producing uniformly distributed single dots of neuronal substrate. Hippocampal neurons were seeded at a density of 880 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and infected with pHR-βA-eGFP*α<sub>2</sub>δ-2. Cells were processed for electrophysiological experiments at 13–18 DIV.</p>

<title>TaqMan qRT-PCR gene expression analysis.</title>
<p>For expression analysis of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits (α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 to α<sub>2</sub>δ-4), RNA was isolated from 3 individual preparations of mono-cultured MSNs and adult male mouse striatum (7–8 weeks) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">Schlick et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, striatal neurons were prepared from 16.5- to 18-d-old embryonic BALB/c mice of either sex and plated on poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine-coated glass coverslips in four 60 mm culture dishes at a density of 10,500 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. After 24–25 d in culture, neurons were harvested for subsequent RNA extraction by trypsin treatment and homogenized with QiaShredder columns (Qiagen). For RNA isolation from brain tissue, WT mice obtained from double-heterozygous α<sub>2</sub>δ-1<sup>+/−</sup>, α<sub>2</sub>δ-3<sup>+/−</sup> breedings were killed by CO<sub>2</sub> exposure, decapitated, and the striatum was dissected in cold HBSS and stored at −80°C in RNAlater RNA Stabilization Reagent (Qiagen) until further use. Tissue samples were disrupted using a Sonicator (UP200S; Hieschler) and QiaShredder columns (Qiagen). After homogenization, total RNA was immediately isolated with the RNeasy Protect Mini Kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen) and concentrations were measured using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Subsequently, 1 μg (striatum) or 5.7 μl (∼50 ng, neurons) of RNA was transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and random hexamers (Promega). qRT-PCR (50 cycles) was performed in duplicates using a maximum amount of 20 ng RNA equivalent of cDNA per sample and the following TaqMan gene expression assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific): α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 (ID: Mm00486607_m1), α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (ID: Mm00457825_m1), α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 (ID: Mm00486613_m1), α<sub>2</sub>δ-4 (ID: Mm01190105_m1), and Hprt1 (ID: Mm00446968_m1) as an endogenous control. The absolute number of α<sub>2</sub>δ transcripts was calculated by applying standard curves generated from PCR products of known concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">Schlick et al., 2010</xref>). To compare the relative expression of distinct α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits in different preparations, data were normalized to the preparation with the highest Hprt1 expression.</p>

<title>Expression vectors and cloning procedures.</title>
<p>To facilitate neuronal expression, all constructs were cloned into a eukaryotic expression plasmid containing a neuronal chicken β-actin promoter, pβA. Cloning of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing (Eurofins Genomics).</p>
<p>For pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-1: Mouse α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 was cloned from genomic cDNA derived from mouse cerebellum. Primer sequences were selected according to GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM-001110844">NM-001110844</ext-link>. Briefly, the cDNA of α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 was amplified by PCR in three fragments. The forward primer used for amplifying fragment 1 introduced a NotI site and the Kozak sequence (CCTACC) upstream of the starting codon and the reverse primer used for amplifying fragment 3 introduced a KpnI and a SalI site after the stop codon. Fragment 2 (nt 1442–2564) was MfeI/BamHI digested and fragment 3 (nt 2335–3276) was KpnI/BamHI digested and co-ligated in the corresponding MfeI/KpnI sites of the pβA vector, yielding an intermediate construct. Fragment 1 (nt 1–1575) was NotI/MfeI digested and co-ligated with the SalI/MfeI-digested intermediate construct containing fragments 2 and 3 and the NotI/SalI-digested pβA vector, yielding pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="MK327276">MK327276</ext-link>).</p>
<p>For pβA-2HA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-1: The putative signal peptide (aa1–24) was predicted using Signal P (SignalP 4.0: discriminating signal peptides from transmembrane regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Petersen et al., 2011</xref>). A double hemagglutinin tag (2HA) followed by a TEV cleavage site was introduced between the third and fourth amino acids after the predicted signal peptide cleavage site of mouse α<sub>2</sub>δ-1; that is, residue F27. Introduction of this sequence did not alter the predicted cleavage site. Briefly, the cDNA sequence of α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 (nt 1–516) was PCR amplified with overlapping primers introducing the double HA tag and the TEV cleavage site in separate PCRs using pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 as a template. The two separate PCR products were then used as templates for a final PCR with flanking primers to connect the nucleotide sequences. The resulting fragment was then NotI/BglII digested and ligated into the corresponding sites of pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-1, yielding pβA-2HA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-1.</p>
<p>For pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (v1): Mouse α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 was cloned from genomic cDNA from mouse brain. Primer sequences were selected according to GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM-001174049">NM-001174049</ext-link>. The cDNA of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 was amplified by PCR in four fragments. The forward primer used for amplifying fragment 1 introduced a HindIII site and the Kozak sequence (CCTACC). Fragment 1 was isolated from cerebellum, whereas the other three fragments were isolated from hippocampus. Fragment 1 (nt 1–686) and Fragment 2 (nt 323–1294) were HindIII/BamHI and BamHI/EcoRI digested, respectively, and co-ligated in the corresponding HindIII/EcoRI sites of the pBS (Bluescript) vector, yielding the intermediate construct pBS-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-part1. Fragment 3 (nt 1137–2359) was EcoRI/PmlI digested and ligated into the corresponding sites of the pSPORT vector, yielding the intermediate construct pSPORT-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-part2. Fragment 4 (nt 2226–3444) was BmtI/XbaI digested and ligated into the corresponding sites of pSPORT-part2, yielding the intermediate construct pSPORT-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-part3. pSPORT-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-part3 (v1) was EcoRI/XbaI digested and the band containing fragments 3–4 (bp 1137–3444) was ligated into pBS-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-part1, yielding pBS-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2. This construct was then HindIII/XbaI digested and the cDNA of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 was ligated into the pβA vector, yielding pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (v1) (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="MK327277">MK327277</ext-link>).</p>
<p>For pβA-2HA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (v1): A putative signal peptide was not reliably predicted using Signal P (SignalP 4.0: discriminating signal peptides from transmembrane regions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Petersen et al., 2011</xref>); however, the highest prediction showed that the signal peptide comprises residues 1–64. The 2HA tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site was therefore introduced after the predicted signal peptide cleavage site of mouse α<sub>2</sub>δ-2; that is, residue A64. Introduction of this sequence did not alter the predicted cleavage site. Briefly the cDNA sequence of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (nt 1–761) was PCR amplified with overlapping primers introducing the double HA tag and the thrombin cleavage site in separate PCRs using pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 as a template. The two separate PCR products were then used as templates for a final PCR with flanking primers to connect the nucleotide sequences. The resulting fragment was then HindIII/AflII digested and ligated into α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (v1).</p>
<p>For pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (v2): An alternative splice variant was isolated from cerebellum, corresponding to GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM-020263">NM-020263</ext-link>. Fragment 3 contained an additional 21 nt at position nt 1992 and was cloned into pSPORT together with fragment 4, yielding pSPORT-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-part3 (v2). pSPORT-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-part3 (v2) was digested with ClaI/BglII and cloned into the corresponding sites of pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (v1), yielding pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (v2) (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="MK327278">MK327278</ext-link>).</p>
<p>For pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (v3): An alternative splice variant was isolated from hippocampus, corresponding to GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM-001174048">NM-001174048</ext-link>. Fragment 4 contained an additional 3 nt at position nt 2598 (resulting in an additional Q residue) and an additional 6 nt at position 3219 nt (translated in CPA instead of S) and was cloned into pSPORT together with fragment 3, yielding pSPORT-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-part3 (v3). pSPORT-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-part3 (v3) was digested with ClaI/XbaI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (v1), yielding pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (v3) (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="MK327279">MK327279</ext-link>).</p>
<p>For pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-3: Mouse α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 was cloned from genomic cDNA from mouse hippocampus. Primer sequences were selected according to GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM-009785">NM-009785</ext-link>. Briefly, the cDNA of α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 was amplified by PCR in four fragments. The forward primer used for amplifying fragment 1 introduced a NotI site and the Kozak sequence (CCTACC) upstream of the starting codon. Fragment 3 (nt 1520–2817) was then SacI/PstI digested and fragment 4 (nt 2727–3276) was DraI/PstI digested and co-ligated in the corresponding SacI/SmaI sites of the pSPORT vector, yielding an intermediate construct. Fragment1 (nt 1–653) was then NotI/BamHI digested and fragment2 (535–1636) was SacI/BamHI digested and co-ligated with the SacI/NotI digested intermediate construct containing fragments 3 and 4, yielding pSPORT-α<sub>2</sub>δ-3. The cloned cDNA of α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 was then NotI/RsrII digested and ligated into the corresponding sites of the pβA vector, yielding pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 (GenBank accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="MK327280">MK327280</ext-link>).</p>
<p>For pβA-2HA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-3: The putative signal peptide (aa 1–28) was predicted using Signal P (SignalP 4.0: discriminating signal peptides from transmembrane regions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Petersen et al., 2011</xref>). The 2HA tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site was therefore introduced after the predicted signal peptide cleavage site of mouse α<sub>2</sub>δ-3; that is, residue D28. Introduction of this sequence did not alter the predicted cleavage site. Briefly, the cDNA sequence of α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 (nt 1–653) was PCR amplified with overlapping primers introducing the double HA tag and the thrombin cleavage site in separate PCRs using pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 as a template. The two separate PCR products were then used as templates for a final PCR with flanking primers to connect the nucleotide sequences. The resulting fragment was then NotI/BsrGI digested and ligated into the corresponding sites of pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-3, yielding pβA-2HA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-3.</p>
<p>For pHR-pβA-eGFP*α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (v1): To remove the HA tag from pβA-eGFP*2HA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, pβA-eGFP*2HA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 was XhoI/RsrII digested to isolate part of the promoter and the eGFP coding sequence. The obtained fragment was then inserted in the corresponding sites of pβA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, yielding pβA-eGFP*α<sub>2</sub>δ-2. For generating the viral vector pHR-pβA-eGFP*α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, the eGFP*α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 coding sequence was introduced with HindIII/XbaI into a custom-built pENTR vector and inserted into a custom-built destination vector, pHR-βA-DEST, using the LR Clonase II enzyme mixture (GATEWAY; Invitrogen), yielding pHR-pβA-eGFP*α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (v1).</p>
<p>For pβA-eGFP*2HA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (v1): The eGFP coding sequence, followed by a stop codon and the Kozak sequence (CCTACC), were introduced by PCR between the Kozak sequence and the coding sequence of 2HA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2. The resulting fragment was then HindIII/PpuMI digested and ligated into the corresponding sites of pβA-2HA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, yielding pβA-eGFP*2HA-α<sub>2</sub>δ-2. This construct was then transfected in hippocampal cultures with lipofectamine to insure that both the eGFP and HA signals were present in transfected neurons.</p>
<p>For pHR-pβA-eGFP: The cloning procedure to generate this plasmid was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">Subramanyam et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>For pHR-pβA-mcherry: The coding sequence of mcherry was inserted into a custom-built destination vector, pHR-βA-DEST, using LR Clonase II enzyme mixture (GATEWAY; Invitrogen) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Etemad et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>High-resolution fluorescence microscopy.</title>
<p>Immunolabeling of permeabilized or live-cell-stained neurons was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">Obermair et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">Stanika et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Folci et al., 2018</xref>) and information on antibodies is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. For PSD-95 labeling of eGFP-transfected neurons, cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose (pF) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, rinsed in PBS followed by a second fixation with absolute methanol for 10 min at −20°C. For all other antibody combinations, neurons were fixed with pF only. Subsequent to fixation and washing, cultures were incubated for 30 min in 5% normal goat serum in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBS/BSA/Triton), enabling membrane permeabilization. Primary antibodies were applied overnight in PBS/BSA/Triton at 4°C and detected by fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies incubated for 1 h at room temperature. For surface staining of HA-tagged α<sub>2</sub>δ constructs, transfected neurons were incubated with rat-anti-HA antibody for 20 min at 37°C following rinsing in warm HBSS and fixation with pF for 10 min at room temperature. Subsequent washing and blocking steps were done with PBS and PBS/BSA, respectively, followed by 1 h incubation with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary goat-anti-rat Alexa Fluor 594 antibody. After rinsing and postfixation of cells in pF for 5 min, neurons were permeabilized by blocking with PBS/BSA/Triton. Primary mouse-anti-synapsin antibody was applied overnight at 4°C and detected with goat-anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 350 antibody. Coverslips were either mounted in p-phenylenediamine glycerol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Flucher et al., 1993</xref>) or DAKO fluorescence mounting medium (Agilent Technologies) for α-Nrxn knock-out and control cultures. Hippocampal cultures were mainly viewed with an Axio Imager microscope (Carl Zeiss) using a 63× 1.4 numerical aperture (NA) oil-immersion objective lens and 14-bit grayscale images were recorded with a cooled CCD camera (SPOT; Diagnostic Instruments) using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). α-Nrxn knock-out cultures and MSNs were observed with a BX53 microscope (Olympus) using a 60× 1.42 NA oil-immersion objective lens and 14-bit grayscale images were recorded with a cooled CCD camera (XM10; Olympus) using cellSens Dimension software (Olympus). To analyze presynaptic and postsynaptic differentiation cover glasses were systematically screened for contact sites between axons of presynaptic neurons [transfected with the fluorescent marker alone (eGFP or mCherry only) or cotransfected with the marker and target construct (eGFP or mCherry plus α<sub>2</sub>δ)] and dendrites or somas of nontransfected postsynaptic neurons. Images of randomly selected well differentiated cells were acquired with the same exposure and gain settings for all conditions within an experiment. These settings were initially adjusted to facilitate optimal visualization of peripheral cell compartments (axons and presynaptic boutons) also in weakly expressing neurons. Therefore, overly saturated neurons (based on eGFP and mCherry levels) were excluded from analysis and only cells with medium to low eGFP or mCherry expression were selected for further analysis. Images were analyzed with MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) as described below. Figures were assembled in Adobe Photoshop CS6 and linear adjustments were done to correct black level and contrast.</p>

<title>gSTED microscopy.</title>
<p>For gSTED microscopy of mCherry-transfected permeabilized hippocampal and striatal MSNs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), immunolabeling was done as described for high-resolution fluorescence microscopy with some modifications. Briefly, mouse-anti-GABA<sub>A</sub>R<sub>β2/3</sub> antibody was used at higher concentrations (1:250) and detected with secondary goat-anti-mouse Oregon Green (OG) 488 (1:500). Coverslips were mounted in DABCO/glycerol to retard photobleaching (2% DABCO, 90% glycerol, buffered in Tris-HCl, pH 8.5; DABCO and glycerol were purchased from Carl Roth). Samples were visualized using a TCS SP8 gSTED microscope equipped with an HCXPL APO 100× 1.4 NA oil-immersion objective (Leica Microsystems) and images were scanned at a pixel size of 15 nm. For hippocampal neurons, individual fluorophores were recorded in the following sequence (excitation/detection range wavelength in nm): mCherry (575/600–690; gate 0.20–6 ns, in confocal mode) and OG 488 (mouse-anti-GABA<sub>A</sub>R<sub>β2/3</sub>; 502/512–581; gate 1–6 ns, STED laser at 592 nm 100%). For MSNs, individual fluorophores were recorded in the following sequence (excitation/detection range wavelength in nm): mCherry (mCherry only or mCherry + α<sub>2</sub>δ-2; 575/600–690; gate 0.20–6 ns, in confocal mode) and OG 488 (mouse-anti-GABA<sub>A</sub>R<sub>β2/3</sub>; 502/510–582; gate 1–6.2 ns, STED laser at 592 nm 100%). To study the localization of excitatory synapses on postsynaptic dendrites of excitatory neurons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref><italic>B</italic>), hippocampal neurons labeled with mCherry and eGFP, respectively, were fixed in 4% pF in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and mounted in DABCO/glycerol. Fluorophores were recorded in the following sequence (excitation/detection range wavelength in nm): mCherry (presynaptic axon: mCherry only or mCherry + α<sub>2</sub>δ-2; 584/600–688; gate 0.20–6 ns in confocal mode) and eGFP (postsynaptic dendrite: eGFP only, 490/508–584 or 520–584; gate 1–6.2 ns, STED laser at 592 nm). To enable clear visualization of dendritic structures, STED laser intensity was adjusted according to the eGFP signal. To study the localization of excitatory synapses on postsynaptic dendrites of inhibitory GABAergic neurons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref><italic>E</italic>), cortical neurons and MSNs were labeled with mCherry and eGFP, respectively, as described above. Primary mouse-anti-gephyrin (1:1000) was applied overnight in PBS/BSA/Triton at 4°C and detected with secondary goat-anti-mouse STAR440 (1:500). Fluorophores were recorded in the following sequence (excitation/detection range wavelength in nm): mCherry (presynaptic axon: mCherry only or mCherry + α<sub>2</sub>δ-2; 580/600–690; gate 0.5–6 ns in confocal mode), eGFP (postsynaptic dendrite: eGFP only, 470/508–580; gate 1–6.0 ns, STED laser at 592 nm), and STAR440 (mouse-anti-gephyrin; 470/480–570; gate 1–6.0 ns, STED laser at 592 nm). STED laser intensity was adjusted according to the eGFP signal to enable clear visualization of dendritic structures and to reduce cross-activation during the detection of STAR440. Channel dye separation was performed to further split the eGFP and STAR440 signals. Images were recorded with LAS AF software (Leica Microsystems), analyzed using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices), and figures were assembled in Adobe Photoshop CS6 and linear adjustments were done to correct black level and contrast.</p>

<title>LacZ reporter expression.</title>
<p>Using the LacZ reporter function of the mutated Cacna2d3 gene (Cacna2d3<sup>tm1Dgen</sup>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Neely et al., 2010</xref>), β-galactosidase activity was analyzed in male α<sub>2</sub>δ-3<sup>−/−</sup> knock-out mice. Eight-week-old mice were killed by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation, decapitated, and brains were removed from the skull. Subsequently, hemispheres were separated with a sagittal cut along the midline, placed medial side down on a flat piece of thin acryl glass, and frozen in 2-methylbutan (Carl Roth) cooled to −80°C. Native samples were stored at −80°C until further processing and transferred to −20°C 1 d before sectioning. Twenty-micrometer-thick sagittal sections of one hemisphere were obtained with a cryotome (NX50; Histocom), collected on polylysine-coated glass slides (Lactan), and stored at −20°C until further use. Sections were air dried at room temperature for 15 min, fixed with freshly prepared cold 4% pF and 0.2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min, and washed repeatedly in PBS for 30 min. X-Gal staining reaction was done with X-Gal (Boehringer Mannheim; 4% in N,N-dimethylformamide) diluted 1:40 in prewarmed X-Gal buffer (5 m<sc>m</sc> K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>, 5 m<sc>m</sc> K<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> · 3H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub> in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C in a humidified incubator. Reaction was stopped after 24 h by several washes with PBS and rinsing in Milli-Q water (Millipore) at room temperature. Sections were counterstained with 0.2% eosin (Carl Roth) in 0.1 <sc>m</sc> CH<sub>3</sub>COOH in Milli-Q, dehydrated by a graded series of ethanol, followed by washing in xylene (Carl Roth) and mounting with Eukitt (Christine Gröpl, Tulln, Austria). Representative images were recorded with a BX53 microscope (Olympus) equipped with a SC100 color camera (Olympus). Eight-bit panorama photographs were created by scanning specimens with a 4× 0.16 NA objective and using the manual multiple image alignment (MIA) function in cellSens Dimension software (Olympus).</p>

<title>Colocalization of synaptic proteins.</title>
<p>The synaptic localization of HA-tagged α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits, presynaptic (synapsin, vGAT, vGLUT1) and postsynaptic proteins (GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes, gephyrin, GLUR1) were analyzed with the “line scan” function in MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Di Biase et al., 2009</xref>). Average fluorescence intensities of green (A488), blue (A350), and red (A594) signals were measured along a line of 3 or 8 μm length, background subtracted, and plotted in Microsoft Excel.</p>

<title>Quantification of fluorescent clusters in single boutons.</title>
<p>To analyze the effects of presynaptic expression of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits in GABAergic synapses of cultured MSNs, 14-bit grayscale images from triple-fluorescence labeling were acquired from the eGFP (green), GABA<sub>A</sub>R<sub>β2/3</sub> (red), and vGAT (blue) channels. Images were analyzed with a custom programmed and semiautomated MetaMorph journal (Molecular Devices) as follows. Corresponding eGFP and vGAT images were superimposed, eGFP/vGAT-positive varicosities (putative GABAergic synapses) were randomly chosen as regions of interest (ROIs), and a region for background subtraction was selected. Axonal varicosities were defined as prominent swellings with higher fluorescence signal compared with the adjacent axonal shaft. Subsequently, eGFP, GABA<sub>A</sub>R, and vGAT grayscale images were thresholded to include the entire area of individual varicosities (eGFP) and synaptic clusters (GABA<sub>A</sub>R, vGAT). Selected ROIs were then transferred to the eGFP image and, by applying the “shrink region to fit” tool, automatic boundaries were drawn according to the threshold enabling only colocalized clusters to be analyzed. ROIs and background regions were further transferred to the thresholded GABA<sub>A</sub>R and vGAT channel images and ROI staining intensities were recorded. Therefore, the following parameters could be measured for the individual synapses in each of the channels in a blinded manner: eGFP threshold area as a measure for bouton size and average and integrated fluorescence intensities providing information on the size and intensity of clusters. To address the effects of presynaptic expression of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits in glutamatergic synapses of α-Nrxn TKO neurons, 14-bit grayscale images from triple-fluorescence labeling were acquired from the eGFP (green), GABA<sub>A</sub>R<sub>β2/3</sub> (red), and vGLUT1 (blue) channels. Images were analyzed with a custom programmed and semiautomated journal as described above. Corresponding eGFP and vGLUT1 images were superimposed and eGFP/vGLUT1-positive varicosities (putative glutamatergic synapses) were randomly selected as ROIs. To analyze the effects of presynaptic expression of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits in glutamatergic synapses of cultured hippocampal WT neurons, 14-bit grayscale images from triple-fluorescence labeling were acquired from the eGFP (green), GLUR1 (red), and GABA<sub>A</sub>R<sub>β2/3</sub>/gephyrin (blue) channel. Images were analyzed in the same manner as mentioned above but without the use of a semiautomatic MetaMorph journal. For all experiments, background subtractions for individual channels and further data organization and analyses were done with Microsoft Excel. Mean values for individual cells were calculated from individual boutons and normalized to the control (eGFP only) or α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 condition within each culture preparation. Cumulative frequency distribution of GABA<sub>A</sub>R<sub>β2/3</sub> fluorescence intensities of single boutons was done to visualize the effect of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits on the whole GABA<sub>A</sub>R population. Two to four independent culture preparations were analyzed and details are given in the respective figure legends.</p>

<title>Quantification of gephyrin content in mismatched and neighboring synapses.</title>
<p>To compare gephyrin content of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-induced mismatched synapses with endogenous clusters, 14-bit grayscale images from triple-fluorescence labelings were acquired from the eGFP (green), GLUR1 (red), and gephyrin (blue) channel and analyzed with MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). First, corresponding eGFP, GLUR1, and gephyrin images were superimposed and eGFP-positive varicosities expressing α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (putative mismatched synapses) were selected as ROIs and a region was selected for background subtraction. eGFP, GLUR1, and gephyrin grayscale images were thresholded to include the entire area of individual varicosities (eGFP) and synaptic clusters (GLUR1, gephyrin). Regions were transferred to the eGFP image, shrunk to fit the threshold area, and further transferred to the thresholded gephyrin channel images. After measuring the integrated gephyrin intensity of eGFP-positive mismatched synapses, ROIs of 10 untransfected neighboring WT synapses located on the same dendrite were selected and regions were shrunk according to the gephyrin threshold. The GLUR1 staining served as orientation to outline dendritic morphology of untransfected neurons. Per image, one mismatched gephyrin cluster induced by α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 was compared with the mean of 10 endogenous clusters. Dots in graph represent values for individual boutons (mismatched synapses) and means of 10 endogenous clusters measured per image. Values were normalized to endogenous gephyrin intensities of neighboring synapses within each culture preparation. Three independent culture preparations were done and eight to 10 images per preparation were analyzed.</p>

<title>Analysis of synapse localization in gSTED images.</title>
<p>Scans of mCherry-labeled boutons (control or α<sub>2</sub>δ-2) contacting eGFP-labeled postsynaptic dendrites were acquired from the eGFP (green, gSTED mode) and mCherry (red, confocal mode) channels. Axonal varicosities were visible as prominent swellings with higher fluorescence signal compared with the adjacent axonal shaft. Initially, linear contrast adjustments were done with LAS AF software (Leica Microsystems), thus enabling clear visualization of postsynaptic dendritic spines and the potential overlap of fluorescence signals, which was used to define the contact zone of putative synapses. Superimposed images were exported into a TIFF format and further analyzed using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). To determine the position of synapses on postsynaptic elements, two types of analysis were used. First, the postsynaptic contact sites of presynaptic boutons were manually classified as dendritic shafts, dendritic spines, or unclear localizations. Second, the distances from the postsynaptic dendritic shafts to the contact points with the presynaptic boutons were calculated as follows. First, the distances between the center of the dendritic shafts and the shaft surfaces were determined and measured. Second, the distances between the center of dendritic shafts and the contact zone (presynaptic bouton with postsynaptic dendrite) were determined and measured. Third, the actual distance from the dendritic shaft surface to the contact zone was determined by subtracting the individual center surface distances from the center contact zone distances. Dots in graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref><italic>C</italic>) represent values for individual boutons and means (lines) ± SEM are shown. Two independent culture preparations were analyzed, of which one experiment was performed in a blinded manner.</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Induced (evoked) AMPAR-mediated synaptic responses were recorded from paired hippocampal neurons (holding potential −70mV) using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Neurons were stimulated with 10 ms depolarization pulse from a holding potential of −70 to 60 mV. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Harvard Apparatus), fire-polished (Microforge MF-830; Narishige), and had resistances of 2.5–4 MΩ when filled with the following (in m<sc>m</sc>): 130 K-gluconate, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 4 Mg-ATP, and 0.3 Na-GTP, pH 7.2 with KOH. The bath solution contained the following (in m<sc>m</sc>): 137 NaCl, 3 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.05 DL-AP5, and 10 glucose, pH 7.4 with NaOH. Currents were recorded with an EPC 10 amplifier controlled by PatchMaster software (HEKA Elektronik Dr. Schulze). To test synaptic plasticity (or paired-pulse plasticity), we applied a pair of pulses with varying interpulse intervals (10, 25, 50, 100, 250, or 500 ms) and calculated the paired-pulse amplitude ratio (P2/P1).</p>
<p>To test spontaneous activity of mixed cortical-MSN cultures, TTX (1 μ<sc>m</sc>) and bicuculline (10 μ<sc>m</sc>) or CNQX (10 μ<sc>m</sc>) were added to bath solution and miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs; holding potential −70 mV) or miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs; holding potential 0 mV), respectively, were recorded.</p>

<title>Sequence alignment and homology modeling</title>
<p>Information on α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 splice sites was obtained from the Uniprot (Q6PHS9) and Ensemble (ENSMUSG00000010066) databases. Protein sequences of the distinct variants were aligned with CLUSTAL O (1.2.4) multiple sequence alignment tool. The high-resolution structure of α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 (PDB code: <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="5GJV">5GJV</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">Wu et al., 2016</xref>) was used as a template to model the structure of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 splice variants.

<title>Experimental design and statistical analysis</title>
<p>According to the RRR principle, the number of mice used was kept to the minimum necessary for a statistical representative analysis, which was comparable to numbers reported in previous studies. Where indicated and possible, investigators were partially blinded during experiments and analyses. Moreover, analysis of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins was done in a blinded manner as described above. Two to four independent culture preparations were analyzed per experiment and details on cell or bouton numbers are given in the respective figure legends. The graphs show values of individual cells/boutons (dots) and means (line) ± SEM. The numbers (<italic>n</italic>) used to calculate SEMs were either given by number of animals used (qRT-PCR) or the number of analyzed cells/boutons. Before statistical analysis, the distribution of datasets was evaluated with histograms. Whenever datasets were strongly skewed or normality was experimentally excluded (e.g., a large proportion of “0” values), raw data were log10 transformed and data distribution was reevaluated by histograms. For normally distributed raw or log10-transformed datasets, unpaired <italic>t</italic> test or one-way ANOVA with Holm–Sidak <italic>post hoc</italic> test was used. Alternatively, when log10 transformation did not result in normally distributed data, the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test or Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA with Dunn's <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis was applied. Significance levels (<italic>p</italic>-values) of statistical tests and <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis are presented in the respective figure legends. The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> was generated with Maya software (version 2018; Autodesk).

<title>Presynaptic overexpression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 induces the formation of mismatched synapses in excitatory hippocampal neurons</title>
<p>To date, the synaptic functions of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits have been identified in cells and tissues primarily expressing a single dominant α<sub>2</sub>δ isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Eroglu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">Pirone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Fell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). To study the involvement of the individual α<sub>2</sub>δ isoforms in glutamatergic synapse formation and differentiation, we homologously overexpressed mouse α<sub>2</sub>δ-1, α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, and α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 cDNAs in WT mouse hippocampal cultures together with soluble eGFP. To analyze the consequences on synapse differentiation, transfected neurons were immunolabeled against the vesicular glutamate transporter (vGLUT1), a marker for presynaptic excitatory synapses, and the postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R<sub>β2/3</sub> subunit (GABA<sub>A</sub>R), which is typically absent in glutamatergic synapses. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that, as expected, in control hippocampal neurons (eGFP only) axonal varicosities were positive for presynaptic vGLUT1 and negative for postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>,<italic>B</italic>, first column). Surprisingly, presynaptic expression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 induced a robust localization of GABA<sub>A</sub>R clusters opposite vGLUT1-positive presynaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>, blue arrowheads). These apparently mismatched synapses are atypical because they are formed between excitatory nerve terminals and inhibitory postsynaptic receptors. Importantly, mismatched postsynaptic receptor localization was not observed opposite terminals expressing α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 or α<sub>2</sub>δ-3.</p>

<p>Excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter transporters can coexist in glutamatergic hippocampal and cerebellar mossy fiber terminals, possibly leading to the corelease of glutamate and GABA and the localization of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Bergersen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Münster-Wandowski et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we next tested whether vesicular GABA transporters (vGATs) are present in synapses overexpressing presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits. As expected and in contrast to neighboring untransfected GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>, asterisks), presynaptic vGAT and postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs were not found in putative excitatory synapses expressing α<sub>2</sub>δ-1, α<sub>2</sub>δ-3, or eGFP only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>,<italic>D</italic>). Most importantly, presynaptic vGAT labeling was also absent in synapses expressing presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, which again showed strong postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>, +α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, blue arrowheads). Therefore, the mismatched localization of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs cannot be explained by the existence of inhibitory neurotransmitters within glutamatergic nerve terminals.</p>
<p>To further characterize our observation, we next quantitatively assessed the postsynaptic receptor composition of mismatched glutamatergic synapses by double labeling transfected hippocampal neurons with markers for excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A–C</italic>). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that, in control hippocampal neurons (eGFP only) postsynaptic AMPARs (GLUR1), but not GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, were expressed opposite transfected presynaptic terminals, as expected for putative glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>, control). Consistent with our initial observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R fluorescent intensities were strongly and significantly increased opposite α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-expressing presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>,<italic>D</italic>). The elevated GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>) was accompanied by a 76% reduction of GLUR1 clustering compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>E</italic>). Surprisingly, presynaptic expression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-3, which did not alter postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering, also caused a significant reduction of GLUR1 receptors (66% reduction vs control). Finally, we also observed a slight but not significant tendency for a reduced GLUR1 receptor expression opposite α<sub>2</sub>δ-1-overexpressing boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>E</italic>). We next tested whether gephyrin, a key organizer of GABAergic synapses that anchors, clusters, and stabilizes GABA<sub>A</sub>R and other postsynaptic elements of inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Choii and Ko, 2015</xref>), was also recruited to mismatched GABA<sub>A</sub>R-positive synapses. Indeed, we found that the strong increase in GABA<sub>A</sub>R expression opposite α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-expressing terminals was accompanied by similarly increased gephyrin abundance, whereas it was missing from control and α<sub>2</sub>δ-1- or α<sub>2</sub>δ-3-expressing synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>,<italic>F</italic>).</p>

<title>Presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 recruits synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes</title>
<p>Because immunofluorescence analysis suggested an effect on postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R clusters opposite presynaptic boutons, we next used superresolution gSTED microscopy to verify their subsynaptic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>). Postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R clusters appear closely opposed to mCherry-positive, α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-overexpressing presynaptic boutons: depending on the orientation of the imaged synapses, the GABA<sub>A</sub>R-labeling pattern is either visible as a thin line (side view; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>, first column and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>, top) or as a ring-like structure (planar view; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>, second column and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>, bottom).

<title>Potential mechanisms explaining an α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-induced mismatched synapse formation</title>
<p>So far, our results show that the specific expression of a single α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit isoform, α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, in presynaptic glutamatergic terminals triggers a mismatched localization of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, which was accompanied by a strong reduction of postsynaptic AMPARs. The underlying mechanism could be explained by three hypotheses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>): First, it is known that an elevated expression of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits increases presynaptic calcium channel abundance and current densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Hoppa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Geisler et al., 2015</xref>) and thus likely enhances synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">Zhou and Luo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs could be recruited opposite these glutamatergic boutons in an attempt to suppress excessive glutamatergic excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">Shrivastava et al., 2011</xref>). If this hypothesis applies, then GABA<sub>A</sub>R abundance at inhibitory synapses should not change upon α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 overexpression in GABAergic presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>). Second, presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, an extracellular protein extending far into the synaptic cleft, may contribute to the anchoring of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs by a trans-synaptic mechanism. Such a specific role of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 should be independent of the synapse type and thus GABA<sub>A</sub>R abundance should be affected when α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 is overexpressed in both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic>). Independent of the two hypotheses, the observed reduction in GLUR1 labeling opposite α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-expressing glutamatergic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) could be explained by GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs competing for AMPAR slots within dendritic spines. Alternatively, however, presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 could also trans-synaptically induce an aberrant axonal wiring by guiding glutamatergic axons to GABAergic postsynaptic locations along dendritic shafts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>). In this scenario, the reduced GLUR1 expression would be a secondary effect because no GLUR1 receptors are to be expected in postsynaptic GABAergic synapses. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we next studied the consequence of presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-overexpression on the molecular composition of GABAergic synapses.</p>

<p>Potential mechanisms explaining the observed mismatched synapse formation of glutamatergic nerve terminals expressing α<sub>2</sub>δ-2. <bold><italic>A</italic></bold>, Compensatory mechanism. Elevated expression of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits increases presynaptic calcium channel abundance and current densities and thus glutamate release. Therefore, GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs could be recruited to the dendritic spine in an attempt to compensate for excessive excitatory synaptic activity.

<title>MSNs express three presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ isoforms</title>
<p>The cultures of hippocampal neurons used for the analysis of experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> contain only 5–10% GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Obermair et al., 2003</xref>). Consequentially transfected GABAergic neurons are rarely observed. Therefore, to quantitatively address the role of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits in GABAergic synapses, we established cultures of striatal neurons, which consist of ∼95% inhibitory MSNs. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that differentiated monocultured MSNs (24–25 DIV) expressed three neuronal α<sub>2</sub>δ isoforms (α<sub>2</sub>δ-1, α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, and α<sub>2</sub>δ-3) similar to the adult mouse striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>). Whereas α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 and α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 expression levels were similar in cultured neurons, the higher abundance of α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 transcripts in 8-week-old striatal tissue was consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Cole et al., 2005</xref>). The strong expression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 was confirmed on cryosections of a mouse line carrying a lacZ reporter gene in the Cacna2d3 locus using β-galactosidase histochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>). The α<sub>2</sub>δ-4 isoform, which is predominantly present in the retina, was hardly detectable and thus not considered for the following experiments. For studying presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit expression in differentiated GABAergic neurons, we adapted a coculture system of GABAergic MSNs with glutamatergic cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Penrod et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>A</italic>). Lentiviral infection of MSNs with soluble eGFP just before starting the coculture allowed discriminating them from excitatory cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>B</italic>) based on their eGFP fluorescence. Immunolabeling of presynaptic and postsynaptic markers for excitatory (vGLUT1, PSD-95) and inhibitory (vGAT) synapses demonstrated that glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses formed properly on dendritic spines and shafts, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>C–E</italic>). Moreover, patch-clamp recordings of spontaneous mEPSCs and mIPSCs in MSNs further confirmed the functionality of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in 14 DIV cocultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><italic>F</italic>). Finally, live-cell labeling of MSNs cotransfected with HA-tagged α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits and soluble eGFP revealed that all α<sub>2</sub>δ isoforms are expressed on the surface of presynaptic axonal varicosities and thus can in theory contribute to synaptic functions in GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>C</italic>).</p>

<title>Presynaptic overexpression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 upregulates postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in inhibitory synapses</title>
<p>To distinguish between our hypotheses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), we coexpressed individual α<sub>2</sub>δ isoforms together with soluble eGFP in differentiated GABAergic MSNs. As expected, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that, in control MSNs (eGFP only), axonal varicosities were typically positive for presynaptic vGAT and postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>A</italic>,<italic>B</italic>). Postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs were similarly localized opposite vGAT-positive terminals expressing the individual α<sub>2</sub>δ isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>B</italic>). However, quantitative analysis of GABA<sub>A</sub>R fluorescence intensities of individual cells revealed that GABA<sub>A</sub>R labeling was strongly (∼2-fold) and significantly increased opposite boutons expressing the α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>C</italic>). Furthermore, presynaptic expression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 caused a 20% decrease of GABA<sub>A</sub>R labeling intensity compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>C</italic>). Plotting the cumulative frequency distribution of GABA<sub>A</sub>R fluorescence intensities of the single synapses demonstrates that presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit isoforms differentially regulate postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R abundance in MSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>D</italic>). GABA<sub>A</sub>R clusters were increased in size and intensity in the majority of synapses overexpressing α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (blue line), causing a shift of the entire population to the right toward higher fluorescence intensities compared with control (eGFP only, green line). In contrast, ∼24% and ∼40% of all boutons expressing α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 (yellow line) and α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 (magenta line), respectively, lacked postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R labeling and the remaining population was left shifted toward smaller clusters. The slightly but significantly reduced GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering opposite α<sub>2</sub>δ-3-overexpressing boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>C</italic>) was associated with smaller presynaptic boutons (27% smaller than control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>E</italic>) and decreased presynaptic vGAT content (46% lower than control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref><italic>F</italic>). Conversely, presynaptic expression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, which strongly increased postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering, affected neither bouton size nor vGAT labeling intensity.</p>

MSNs were cotransfected with α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 and soluble mCherry or mCherry only (control). In both conditions, postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R clusters appeared closely opposed to mCherry-positive presynaptic boutons, thus confirming their localization in the postsynaptic membrane. Moreover, similar to hippocampal neurons, the GABA<sub>A</sub>R pattern was either visible as a thin line (side view; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>, first and third column and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>, top) or a ring-like structure (planar view; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>, second and fourth column and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>, bottom).

<title>α-Nrxns modulate postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R abundance set by presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2</title>
<p>Thus far, our results revealed that presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 strongly induced postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor clustering in both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, suggesting that α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 acts trans-synaptically according to our hypothesis outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. This means that α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 could either directly interact with postsynaptic receptors or may act via other synaptic organizer molecules such as α-Nrxns. Presynaptic α-Nrxns are synaptic cell adhesion molecules whose general importance in a variety of synaptic functions is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Reissner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">Südhof, 2017</xref>). Several lines of evidence implicate α-Nrxns as interesting candidates for mediating a possible indirect interaction between α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. First, α-Nrxns have been linked functionally to high-voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>channels, which has strong effects on presynaptic neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Missler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Second, α-Nrxns have been implicated as organizing molecules at both excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic synapses by promoting clustering of postsynaptic AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Heine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Aoto et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2015</xref>) and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Kang et al., 2008</xref>). Third, the presynaptic complex of α-Nrxn and its ligand neurexophilin-1 is characteristic for inhibitory interneurons and can induce postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R recruitment when ectopically expressed at excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Born et al., 2014</xref>). Fourth, neurexin-1α has recently been shown to modulate P/Q-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Brockhaus et al., 2018</xref>) and N-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">Tong et al., 2017</xref>) calcium channels by cooperating with α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits. Therefore, to test the possibility that upregulation of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs depends on α-Nrxns, we expressed α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 in glutamatergic synapses lacking all three α-Nrxn isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Missler et al., 2003</xref>). We transfected eGFP alone or in combination with α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 or α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 in hippocampal cultures from WT and α-Nrxn TKO mice. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that, as expected, in control hippocampal neurons, axonal varicosities were typically positive for presynaptic vGLUT1 but negative for postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>A</italic>,<italic>C</italic>, WT control). Consistent with our previous observations, presynaptic expression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 induced the formation of mismatched synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>A</italic>,<italic>C</italic>, WT+α<sub>2</sub>δ-2), whereas expression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 had no effect (<italic>p</italic> = 0.64; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>A</italic>,<italic>C</italic>, WT+α<sub>2</sub>δ-3). Strikingly, expression of presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 in α-Nrxn TKO neurons induced postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering opposite glutamatergic boutons more strongly than in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>A</italic>,<italic>C</italic>, α-Nrxn TKO+α<sub>2</sub>δ-2). Quantitative analysis revealed that this effect was three times higher compared with the WT+α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 condition, suggesting that the propensity of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 in inducing mismatched synapses was enhanced in the absence of α-Nrxns. In fact, increased GABA<sub>A</sub>R abundance was already visible in nontransfected α-Nrxn TKO synapses in which the presence of endogenous α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 may be responsible for a significantly increased baseline level of mismatched GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<italic>p</italic> = 0.023; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>A</italic>,<italic>C</italic>). This is an important result because it suggests that no overexpression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 is needed to induce postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering, but an imbalance between α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 and α-Nrxns. These differential effects can be best compared by blotting the cumulative frequency distribution of GABA<sub>A</sub>R fluorescence intensities of all individual synapses analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</xref><italic>D</italic>). Compared with WT (control, green line), the entire population of synapses was right-shifted toward larger GABA<sub>A</sub>R clusters in α-Nrxn TKO neurons (dashed green line). Presynaptic expression of transfected α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 strongly shifted the distributions toward larger GABA<sub>A</sub>R clusters in WT (+α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, blue line) and α-Nrxn TKO neurons (TKO+α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, dashed blue line). Presynaptic expression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 had no effect in WT neurons, which, due to the lack of mismatched synapses, basically displayed only background GABA<sub>A</sub>R intensity (+α<sub>2</sub>δ-3, magenta line). Interestingly, overexpression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 in α-Nrxn TKO neurons reduced the elevated GABA<sub>A</sub>R clusters to control levels (TKO+α<sub>2</sub>δ-3, dashed magenta line). This possibly indicates that overexpressed, abundant α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 blocked the effect by endogenous α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 on baseline GABA<sub>A</sub>R intensity in TKO synapses. Together, our data suggest that presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 potently induced mismatched synapse formation with GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering in the absence of α-Nrxns. This demonstrates that the trans-synaptic role of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 in recruiting postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is independent of α-Nrxns. However, the fact that GABA<sub>A</sub>R abundance was already increased in α-Nrxn TKO synapses without overexpression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 and that the abundance could be differentially modulated by presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 and α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 suggests a cooperative and trans-synaptic activity of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits and α-Nrxns in fine-tuning postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R levels.</p>

<title>α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 induces the aberrant wiring of glutamatergic axons to GABAergic postsynaptic positions</title>
<p>Our experiments described above demonstrate that presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 induces the recruitment of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs opposite glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic boutons. Moreover, this effect of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 is independent of the presynaptic neurotransmitter identity, suggesting a trans-synaptic activity in recruiting/anchoring postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. As hypothesized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), such a trans-synaptic role of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 could result in two types of mismatched synapses: the GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs could either be recruited to postsynaptic compartments of dendritic spine synapses with a concomitant reduction of the resident glutamate receptors or α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 could induce an altered wiring of glutamatergic axons to GABAergic postsynaptic locations along the dendritic shaft.</p>
<p>To distinguish between these two possibilities, we focused more closely on the position of the mismatched synapses along the postsynaptic neurons. First, it is important to emphasize that α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 induced the upregulation of postsynaptic GABAergic components only at the sites contacted by the presynaptic axon without affecting the neighboring synapses. This is best visualized by the observation that gephyrin fluorescence intensity was 4.5 times higher in α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-induced mismatched synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref><italic>A–C</italic>, asterisks in <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>) compared with neighboring endogenous GABAergic synapses situated on the same dendrite, which are formed by axons from untransfected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref><italic>A–C</italic>, arrowheads in <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). This finding further supports a local and synapse-specific effect of presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 rather than a global alteration in the expression of GABAergic postsynaptic components. Importantly, α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-overexpressing glutamatergic axons preferentially formed synapses at typical GABAergic postsynaptic locations, namely linearly aligned along the dendritic shaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref><italic>D</italic>, right column, blue arrowheads), in contrast to control axons, which preferably contacted dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref><italic>D</italic>, left column, white arrowheads). Therefore, to determine the exact position of mismatched synapses on postsynaptic dendrites, we established hippocampal cultures in which presynaptic (control or α<sub>2</sub>δ-2) and postsynaptic neurons were transfected with mCherry (red) and eGFP (green), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref><italic>A–C</italic>). gSTED microscopy allowed precise visualization of the contact point between the presynaptic mCherry-positive axon and the postsynaptic eGFP-positive dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref><italic>A</italic>,<italic>B</italic>). As expected for glutamatergic excitatory synapses, the vast majority of axonal varicosities was located on dendritic spines in the control condition (80% spine, 13% shaft, 7% unclear; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref><italic>B</italic>,<italic>C</italic>, top). In contrast, presynaptic expression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 significantly shifted the preferential contact points to dendritic shafts (24% spine, 65% shaft, 11% unclear; χ<sup>2</sup> test: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). This finding was further corroborated by a highly significant reduction of the mean distance from the contacting presynaptic boutons to the postsynaptic dendritic shafts in α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-transfected compared with control axons (mean distance ± SEM: control: 0.92 ± 0.05 μm; α<sub>2</sub>δ-2: 0.54 ± 0.05 μm; Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref><italic>C</italic>, bottom). Importantly, applying the same methodological approach for the coculture of GABAergic MSNs and glutamatergic cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref><italic>D</italic>, also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>) revealed that axonal varicosities from control cortical neurons generally contacted dendritic spines of postsynaptic inhibitory MSNs (total of 65 synapses: 83% spine, 1.5% shaft, 15.5% unclear: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref><italic>E</italic>,<italic>F</italic>, top). In contrast, the presynaptic expression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 shifted the preferential contact points of cortical boutons to dendritic shafts of MSNs (total of 51 synapses: 19.6% spine, 72.6% shaft, 7.8% unclear; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref><italic>E</italic>,<italic>F</italic>, bottom, gephyrin labeling and position at dendritic shaft). These findings demonstrate that the α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-induced aberrant wiring is independent of the identity of the postsynaptic neuron.</p>

<title>Reduced synaptic transmission in aberrantly wired synapses</title>
<p>Excitatory and inhibitory synapses require matched presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations to enable efficient and synchronous neurotransmission. To assess the functional consequences of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 overexpression in presynaptic boutons of aberrantly wired glutamatergic synapses, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on synaptically connected pairs of isolated neurons grown on poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine dots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</xref><italic>A</italic>). We first investigated whether AMPAR-mediated evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs) between individual pairs of hippocampal neurons were altered by the lentiviral overexpression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 in the presynaptic neuron. Isolated synaptic currents were measured in the postsynaptic neuron in response to an action potential induced in the presynaptic neuron. The presynaptic action potential followed a given waveform recorded from WT hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</xref><italic>B</italic>). This experimental setup allowed to directly compare synaptic transmission in glutamatergic control synapses (presynaptic cell = control, postsynaptic cell = α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 overexpressing) and mismatched synapses (presynaptic cell = α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 overexpressing, postsynaptic cell = control). In each of seven neuronal pairs recorded, the eEPSC amplitude was lower in the mismatched compared with the control pair (on average reduced by 48%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</xref><italic>C</italic>). To discriminate whether the eEPSC reduction is the result of the reduced postsynaptic AMPA receptor expression associated with the aberrantly wired axons or if presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 reduces release probability, we next measured synaptic paired-pulse response ratios (PPRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Katz and Miledi, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>). eEPSCs were recorded in the postsynaptic neuron in response to two action potentials elicited in the presynaptic neuron at different interstimulus intervals. As previously reported for hippocampal pyramidal neurons, calculated PPRs displayed facilitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</xref><italic>D</italic>) with a decline in the magnitude at increasing intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Dobrunz et al., 1997</xref>). Overexpression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 in presynaptic neurons slightly increased facilitation at 25 and 50 ms compared with the initial 10 ms interval. The strong reduction of eEPSC amplitudes is thus consistent with a reduced number of functional synapses caused by the aberrant wiring of glutamatergic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-expressing boutons with GABAergic postsynaptic sites. Conversely, the only moderately altered paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) indicates that the decreased amplitude of eEPSCs was not caused by a reduced presynaptic release probability. The observed slightly increased PPF may reflect an increased abundance of presynaptic calcium channels caused by the overexpression of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits, as has been previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Hoppa et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Lack of exon 23 in α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 splice variants mediates the trans-synaptic effect on GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs</title>
<p>Our results revealed a specific trans-synaptic function of only one of the three expressed α<sub>2</sub>δ isoforms, namely α<sub>2</sub>δ-2. Sequence comparisons of the previously known alternatively spliced regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Hobom et al., 2000</xref>) identified three potential splice sites in α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 13</xref><italic>A</italic>, scheme): inclusion or absence of exon 23 and two alternative splice sites at exons 30 and 38. Using homology modeling, we explored the potential implication of these sequence differences on the structural fold of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref>) based on the recently suggested α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Inclusion of exon 23 resulted in the formation of an extra loop that might disrupt an α-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Figs. 13</xref><italic>B</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14</xref><italic>B</italic>), whereas alternative splicing of exons 30 and 38 predicted only small changes in the secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 14</xref><italic>C</italic>,<italic>D</italic>). Therefore, to test whether alternative splicing at these sites is involved in the trans-synaptic function of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, we cloned and compared three splicing variants (α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-v1, α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-v2, and α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-v3, α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-v1 = original construct; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 13</xref><italic>A</italic>). To determine the potential of the splice variants in inducing mismatched synapses, we transfected WT hippocampal neurons with the three distinct α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 variants together with soluble eGFP. Strikingly, only the splice variants lacking exon 23 (α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-v1 and α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-v3) induced the clustering of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs opposite transfected glutamatergic nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 13</xref><italic>C</italic>, ΔExon 23). The fact that α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-v1 and α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-v3 both induced mismatched synapse formation excludes a major role of exons 30 and 38, which differ in α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-v1 and α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-v3. In contrast, α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-v2, which contains the exon 23 insert, failed completely to induce mismatched synapse formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 13</xref><italic>C</italic>, +Exon 23), indicating that the trans-synaptic function of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 on GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is transcriptionally regulated. Together, our results have uncovered a highly specific role of the α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in clustering postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, an important process that is further regulated by the presence of α-Nrxns and by alternative splicing.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The experiments described here reveal that presynaptic expression of a single splice variant of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 trans-synaptically regulates postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R abundance. Therefore, presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 modulates postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering independently of the presynaptic neurotransmitter, induces an aberrant wiring of glutamatergic axons with postsynaptic GABAergic sites of both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, and alters synaptic transmission in mismatched synaptic pairs. These results demonstrate for the first time that presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits are able to trans-synaptically regulate synapse specification and axonal wiring.</p>
<sec>
<title>α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 induces the formation of mismatched synapses via a trans-synaptic mechanism</title>
<p>Excitatory and inhibitory synapses are characterized by their distinct molecular composition and subcellular localization in neurons. The proper alignment of presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations is a hallmark of synapse formation and a prerequisite for efficient and synchronous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Lardi-Studler and Fritschy, 2007</xref>). Only a small number of studies have reported mismatched synapses <italic>in vitro</italic>. In micro-island cultures of autaptic hippocampal neurons, the vast majority of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and gephyrin clusters are located opposite glutamatergic terminals, suggesting that postsynaptic compartments can be recruited without the proper presynaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Rao et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Christie et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, in low-density cultures of hippocampal and cerebellar granule neurons, mismatches of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins can form during early developmental stages, but are essentially absent in differentiated cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Brünig et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">Studler et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast to these studies, the mismatched synapses reported in our study are specifically induced by the presynaptic expression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 and are independent from neurotransmitter input, suggesting that α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 operates via a different mechanism.</p>
<p>Mixed synapses with glutamatergic and GABAergic properties have also been detected in different brain areas, indicating a functional role <italic>in vivo</italic>. For example, postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are present opposite presynaptic glutamatergic mossy fiber axon terminals in the cerebellar cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">Nusser et al., 1996a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Bergersen et al., 2003</xref>). Physiologically, these receptors may be involved in fine-tuning excitatory synaptic transmission in response to GABA spillover from surrounding synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Isaacson et al., 1993</xref>). Although we cannot completely rule out GABA spillover from adjacent neurons, it is important to note that the α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-induced mismatched synapses do not express presynaptic vGAT. Therefore, the recruitment of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is entirely independent of presynaptic GABA release. These findings are consistent with a recent report showing that, even in the absence of presynaptic glutamate release, dendritic spines are formed and AMPARs are present in glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">Sigler et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Generally, excitatory and inhibitory synapses are mostly targeted to different subcellular regions of the postsynaptic neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Lardi-Studler and Fritschy, 2007</xref>). Therefore, glutamatergic boutons predominantly contact postsynaptic dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">Peters, 2002</xref>), whereas GABAergic nerve terminals mostly connect to the shaft of the dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Markram et al., 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, converging lines of evidence demonstrate morphologically mixed synapse types in different parts of the brain. In the adult neocortex, for example, two distinct types of GABAergic synapses are positioned either on the shaft or spine of the dendrite, which are suggested to have different roles in shaping dendritic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). It is hypothesized that these constellations facilitate the shunting of excitatory currents, thereby balancing excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">Nusser et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">Root et al., 2014</xref>). Along these lines, we proposed that the underlying mechanism of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-induced mismatched synapses could be explained by a compensatory upregulation of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs due to increased excitatory transmission upon α<sub>2</sub>δ overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">Zhou and Luo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). However, several of our observations argue against this theory. First, using distinct experimental paradigms, we show here that α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 and α<sub>2</sub>δ-3, which both enhance excitatory synaptic transmission and increase presynaptic release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Hoppa et al., 2012</xref>), do not induce postsynaptic clustering of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes. Second, the effect of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 is independent of the presynaptic neurotransmitter identity, thus providing compelling evidence for a trans-synaptic function. Third, solely α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 splice variants lacking exon 23 specifically induced the recruitment of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs opposite glutamatergic nerve terminals. Fourth, the effect of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 is restricted to transfected synapses, emphasizing a synapse-specific role rather than a global alteration of GABAergic postsynaptic components.</p>

<title>Presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits differentially modulate postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R abundance via distinct mechanisms</title>
<p>We found diverging effects of presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 and α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 on the postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R abundance of GABAergic MSNs because α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 strongly increased and α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 reduced postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). In contrast to presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 expression, which modulated the postsynaptic composition without apparently affecting the presynaptic side, the effect of α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 was associated with smaller presynaptic boutons and decreased presynaptic vGAT content. Smaller presynaptic boutons may also explain the reduced GLUR1 content opposite α<sub>2</sub>δ-3-expressing synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Together, these data suggest that presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits regulate presynaptic differentiation and postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R abundance by two independent mechanisms. Although expression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 induces smaller synapses associated with a reduced postsynaptic receptor density, presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 modulates postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R abundance but does not affect presynaptic bouton size. Altered expression of mammalian α<sub>2</sub>δ-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">Pirone et al., 2014</xref>) and its invertebrate homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Kurshan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Caylor et al., 2013</xref>) has previously been shown to affect the size and morphology of presynaptic boutons of auditory nerve fibers and motoneurons, respectively.</p>

<sec>
<title>Evidence for an α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-mediated trans-synaptic signaling cascade</title>
<p>To date, surprisingly little is known on the specific signals imperative for the proper alignment of inhibitory synapses and the targeting of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and gephyrin to the postsynaptic compartment. <italic>In vitro</italic> cultured neurons provide an excellent and reduced model system allowing us to address basic cell biological mechanisms. Most importantly, they are less prone to potential compensatory mechanisms compared with the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Brown et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, overexpression of proteins in their native environment provides a powerful experimental tool but needs to be carefully discussed, particularly in relation to the specific physiological roles. Therefore, it is conceivable that an aberrantly high accumulation of presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 proteins may induce artificial synaptic connections. Nevertheless, our study provides several lines of evidence supporting a presynaptic role of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 in the trans-synaptic alignment of synapses and receptor clustering. First, we observed that presynaptic expression of a single splice variant of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 trans-synaptically regulates postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R abundance. Second, overexpression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 specifically induces an aberrant wiring of glutamatergic axons to postsynaptic GABAergic sites independently of the postsynaptic neuron type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</xref>). Third, whereas mismatched synapses lack glutamate receptors, they contain different synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes and gephyrin. Importantly, the strongly reduced GLUR1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) in the mismatched and aberrantly wired synapses is a secondary effect because no AMPARs are to be expected in postsynaptic GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>, model). Fourth, gephyrin abundance is higher in α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-induced mismatched synapses compared with untransfected endogenous GABAergic synapses. Considering that gephyrin immobilizes synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R clusters in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Jacob et al., 2005</xref>), we provide strong evidence that gephyrin recruitment occurs secondary to synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering.</p>
<p>However, it is still unknown whether the interaction with postsynaptic receptors is mediated by a direct trans-synaptic action of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 or if it may be indirectly mediated by the interaction with other primary synaptic organizers (see also discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Fell et al., 2016</xref>). Several studies implicate the trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules α-Nrxns as the most interesting candidates for mediating a possible indirect interaction between α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Missler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Born et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">Tong et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 also potently induces mismatched synapse formation in the absence of α-Nrxns. Although this finding supports an α<sub>2</sub>δ-2-mediated trans-synaptic effect and possibly a direct trans-synaptic interaction of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 with postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, it does not exclude the potential involvement of other cell adhesion molecules not addressed in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Graf et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Lardi-Studler and Fritschy, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The effect of overexpressed α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 was more pronounced in α-Nrxn TKO synapses compared with WT control synapses. We observed that the baseline expression of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in TKO was already significantly increased, which shows that no overexpression of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 is needed for inducing postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering. This finding may indicate that the presence of α-Nrxns negatively influences GABA<sub>A</sub>R recruitment by α<sub>2</sub>δ-2. Alternatively, the loss of α-Nrxns could be either overproportionally compensated by the still present β-neurexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Missler et al., 2003</xref>) or shift the modulation of postsynaptic receptor abundance to the neuroligin-2/Slitrk3 or the neuroligin-2/MDGA1 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">Pettem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Independently of the detailed underlying mechanism, our findings support a cooperative action of α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits and neurexins in fine-tuning synaptic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">Tong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Brockhaus et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<title>Future implications and potential relevance to neurological disorders</title>
<p>One important finding presented here is that only α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 splice variants lacking exon 23 induced a mismatched localization of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. This is interesting for several reasons. First, the presynaptic effect of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 lacking a single spliced exon is highly specific and thus argues against a simple unspecific effect caused by homologous overexpression of α<sub>2</sub>δ isoforms in our experimental paradigm. Second, in light of discussing potential interaction mechanisms (see above), it is tempting to speculate that α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 interacts with its partners via the region surrounding the lacking exon 23, which will be tested in future experiments. Third, our findings show that the trans-synaptic function of α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 may be independent of the calcium channel complex. This is further supported by a previous study showing that heterologous coexpression of different α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 splice variants with various α<sub>1</sub> subunits caused similar effects on calcium channel current densities and activation/inactivation kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Hobom et al., 2000</xref>). Fourth, and most importantly, alternative splicing has also been described for mouse and human genes encoding for α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 and α<sub>2</sub>δ-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Lana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bacchi et al., 2015</xref>). This is particularly interesting considering the previously identified associations between α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits with neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Chioza et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Edvardson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Pippucci et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">Vergult et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">Valence et al., 2018</xref>). Two distinct splice site mutations in CACNA2D2, for example, lead to the truncation of the protein, causing epilepsy, dyskinesia, and cerebellar atrophy in one patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Pippucci et al., 2013</xref>), whereas the other mutation is associated with congenital ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">Valence et al., 2018</xref>). These clinically observed phenotypes are similar to the previously described phenotype of Cacna2d2 mutant or null mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Barclay et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Brodbeck et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Ivanov et al., 2004</xref>) and may be caused by the loss of functional GABAergic synapses and the consequential increased excitatory activity. Moreover, α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits are potential risk genes for autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Iossifov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">De Rubeis et al., 2014</xref>) and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Purcell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Moons et al., 2016</xref>), diseases classically associated with altered neuronal connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Belmonte et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Fornito and Bullmore, 2015</xref>). The findings presented here provide a possible mechanistic explanation for how altered α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit expression may be linked to neurological disorders. However, for the future understanding of the precise underlying disease mechanisms, it will be necessary to reveal whether all α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit isoforms can act as similarly specific trans-synaptic organizers in distinct synapses. Finally, our findings allow hypothesizing that presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits are critical determinants of synapse specificity and connectivity. Therefore, alterations in the balance of presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>δ isoforms may underlie synaptic plasticity and, conversely, pathological axonal wiring observed in neurological disorders.</p>
