<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During a neonate’s first months of life, the electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a
neurophysiologic marker of brain organization and maturation not only in healthy
neonates but also in those at risk for later neurodevelopmental compromise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1179069518797108">1</xref></sup> Maturation of the brain evidenced by EEG follows an inherited program showing
a characteristic pattern of development which evolves in a generally predictable
manner as a function of postmenstrual age (PMA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1179069518797108">2</xref></sup> Despite this overall trend, individual differences in EEG power in children
of the same age are striking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1179069518797108">3</xref></sup> These individual differences are being used to diagnose deviant brain
development, such as that related to neurologic and behavioral problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1179069518797108">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1179069518797108"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1179069518797108">5</xref></sup> Studies using power spectra, a
measure of oscillatory amplitude that contributes to neural synchrony, have
documented differences in EEG power spectra that are associated with autism spectrum
disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1179069518797108">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1179069518797108"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1179069518797108">7</xref></sup> However, it is
not clear whether these differences in neural oscillations represent an index of the
disorder or are shared more broadly among both affected and unaffected family members.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1179069518797108">5</xref></sup> In addition, it remains unclear how early these differences emerge in
development and whether they remain constant or change over time. Moreover, it is
not yet known whether the altered functional brain maturation in the absence of
major encephalopathic patterns may represent “natural” fluctuations or significant
changes from the genetically promoted time course of maturation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1179069518797108">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1179069518797108">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1179069518797108">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1179069518797108">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Evidence from numerous investigations, including twin and family studies, has
suggested that interindividual differences of human brain wave patterns are
predominantly determined by genetic factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1179069518797108">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1179069518797108"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1179069518797108">12</xref></sup> Twin studies provide an
overall impression of the role of genetic factors in the EEG variability by
comparing the phenotypic resemblance of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins.
If identical twins (which share nearly 100% of their genes) were considerably more
similar than fraternal twins (share 50% of their genes), this would implicate that
genes play an important role in some trait.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1179069518797108">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1179069518797108">14</xref></sup> Extensive twin studies by
Vogel in the 1960s and 1970s established strong evidence that EEG and its variants
are under genetic control. Moreover, investigation by Vogel of different EEG
parameters based on 110 pairs of MZ and of 98 pairs of DZ twins, between 5 and
20 years old have suggested that genetic factors determine not only the individual
EEG but also the rhythm of EEG maturation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1179069518797108">15</xref></sup> He found MZ twins to be absolutely concordant during childhood, thus
suggesting that speed of maturation is determined genetically. Using spectral
patterns, Stassen et al reported that the waking EEG in MZ twins was strikingly
similar (as a person is to himself over time) and that the EEGs of MZ twins reared
apart were as similar to each other as are the EEGs of the same person over time or
as the EEGs of MZ twins brought up together.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1179069518797108">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1179069518797108">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>This phenomenon has not been examined in early infancy when brain development
influences the EEG recordings. It is unclear whether genetic contribution to EEG
parameters is evident over the first postnatal months. During the period between 35
and 52 weeks of PMA, the brain is subjected to large structural and functional
changes including formation of multiple interconnected neuronal networks that create
a new anatomical substrate for the continuous changing of electrical
activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1179069518797108">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1179069518797108">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Delta activity (1-4 Hz) is the dominate activity in human EEG during early
developmental stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1179069518797108">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1179069518797108">21</xref></sup> It means that delta activity not only has the highest power in
the spectrum (comparative to theta and alpha frequencies) but is also the most
functionally “active” oscillation in earlier developmental stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1179069518797108">20</xref></sup> Delta activity provides important information in the assessment of brain
damage in preterm infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1179069518797108">22</xref></sup> Delta brushes (rhythmic 0.3-1.5 Hz delta activity of 50-250 μV associated
with a superimposed rhythm of low to moderately faster frequencies of 10-20 Hz) are
a prominent feature of delta oscillatory activity in the human cortex during the
third trimester of gestation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1179069518797108">2</xref></sup> Other delta rhythms occur in the temporal and occipital locations
particularly after 28 weeks’ gestation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1179069518797108">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1179069518797108">23</xref></sup> With advancing PMA, spectral
power of the delta frequencies decreases. The decrease in the amplitude with
increasing PMA is distinctive in the lowest frequency band (&lt;1 Hz).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1179069518797108">24</xref></sup> During further development of resting state activity, the EEG generally
decreases in amplitude, and slow activity is substituted by fast activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1179069518797108">25</xref></sup> This dynamic is generally considered as a sign of maturation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1179069518797108">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>A series of precise studies investigated maturational changes of delta activity but
none of them investigated delta maturation in twins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1179069518797108">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1179069518797108">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1179069518797108">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1179069518797108">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1179069518797108">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, we particularly focused our research on delta maturation in twins
because the developmental changes in the delta power spectra represent an index of
central nervous system maturation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1179069518797108">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1179069518797108">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>We postulated that if the rhythm of brain maturation evidenced by EEG was determined
by genetic factors, it would follow that changes in delta activity would proceed at
the same rate for identical twins, whereas the developmental synchronies should be
lower within pairs of fraternal twins. Such data would be of great value when
searching for the role of genetic factors in the EEG variability in the infancy.</p>
<p>Therefore, we conducted a twin study comparing developmental changes of delta 1
(0.5-2.0 Hz) and delta 2 (2.25-3.75 Hz) power spectra between healthy MZ and DZ twin
pairs and MZ and DZ twin groups during AS/REM and QS/NREM sleep stages at their
38th, 46th, and 52nd weeks of PMA.</p>

<title>Spectral Analysis of the EEG</title>
<p>For further processing, the sampled EEG recording, taken from a NicoletOne software
package in ASCII format, along with the recording of sleep state, was further
processed using a MATLAB software package as part of a software system developed for
the purposes of this study. For the present analysis, we selected EEG data from the
left fronto-central derivation (Fp1-C3), central (C3-Cz), and centro-occipital
(C3-O1) derivations of each of 3 recordings. These derivations were selected on the
basis of the maximal amount of artifact-free data. It was also taken into account
that occipital areas may be most suitable for assessing EEG maturation. The EEG data
of AS/REM and QS/NREM sleep were submitted to fast Fourier transform which allowed
time-series data to be shown as corresponding amplitudes of spectral power density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1179069518797108">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>As total spectral power between subjects may vary considerably, spectral power values
are normalized for total power and expressed as relative spectral power measures.
Relative power of a band was defined as the ratio of the absolute power of that band
to the total power of all bands, expressed as percentage. Spectra of 30-second
epochs were matched with the corresponding sleep stages.</p>
<p>For the further analysis, delta spectrum (0.5-4.0 Hz) was isolated from the entire
frequency spectrum and subdivided into 2 frequency bands: delta 1 (0.5-2.0 Hz) and
delta 2 (2.25-3.75 Hz).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>R (R Core Team, 2018) and Statistica 10 software package (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK,
USA) were used to perform statistical analysis of the data.</p>
<p>Mixed model analysis of variance (type 3) with afex package was used to determine
whether there were any differences among the means and absolute difference of
relative spectral values in delta 1 (0.5-2 Hz) and delta 2 (2.25-3.75 Hz)
frequencies in active and quite sleep for MZ and DZ twin pair in 3 repeated
experimental conditions (at 38th, 46th, and 52nd week of PMA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1179069518797108">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>The 2 grouping factors are participants (id) and group (MZ and DZ twin pair). The
within-participant factors are time (38th, 46th, and 52nd week of PMA), sleep
(active, quite sleep), electrodes (FC, CC, CO), and frequency (delta 1, delta 2). We
used the Kenward-Roger method for obtaining <italic>P</italic> values within mixed
model analysis of variance which provides the best control against anticonservative
results. Similarity in the developmental changes of delta power within MZ and DZ
twin pairs was estimated by calculating mean absolute differences of relative
spectral values in delta 1 and delta 2 frequencies. The MZ and DZ twin pair
differences for developmental changes of delta 1 and delta 2 power spectra were
illustrated by Box-Whisker plots of mean with 95% confidence interval of absolute
differences of power values in MZ and DZ twin groups. Statistical values were
considered significant at 99% (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). The MZ and DZ
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values were calculated using irr package.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1179069518797108">35</xref></sup></p>

<p>Our initial approach was to ascertain the maturational changes of relative delta 1
(0.5-2 Hz) and delta 2 (2.25-3.75 Hz) power spectra in MZ and DZ twins at 3
electrode positions regarding sleep state. Analyses of these data indicated that the

measurements (38th, 46th, and 52nd PMA) regardless of zygosity, sleep stages, and
electrode positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1179069518797108">Figure

<p>In this study, we investigated spectral power changes in delta frequency range, in
serial 4-hour EEG recordings performed in late preterm MZ and DZ twins between 38th
and 52nd weeks of PMA. This is an extension of our previous study evaluating genetic
influence on EEG composition during sleep. Our present research was particularly
focused on the comparison of the maturational changes of delta power spectra between
MZ and DZ twin partners and MZ and DZ twin groups over the same postnatal
developmental period.</p>
<p>After subdividing the delta frequency band in the delta 1 and delta 2, we found 2
opposite patterns of changes in delta activities that were dependent on frequency
band: relative delta power decreased, whereas delta 2 power increased from 38th
toward 52nd week of PMA regardless of zygosity, sleep stages, and electrode position
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1179069518797108">Figure 1</xref>). These
results corresponded with the EEG pattern of maturing preterm infants in whom the
EEG pattern changes from high-amplitude low-frequency waves to low-amplitude
high-frequency waves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1179069518797108">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1179069518797108">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1179069518797108"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1179069518797108">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>We also demonstrated that EEG maturation of delta activity in early infancy occurred
equally in MZ and DZ twin groups. No significant differences were found between MZ
and DZ twin groups in the proportion of delta 1 (0.5-2 Hz) and delta 2
(2.25-3.75 Hz) power spectra during 2 sleep stages and 3 periods of measurement.
Moreover, MZ and DZ twin groups showed consistency in maturational changes of delta
activity that was not dependent on the region of the brain. These findings are in
agreement with the results of visual analysis presented in our previous study in
which we showed that macrostructural parameters of sleep architecture changed with
the increase in PMA in all subjects regardless of zygosity, whereas MZ and DZ twin
groups differed from each other only sporadically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1179069518797108">28</xref></sup> Considering that EEG activity has been proposed as a measure of the
developmental changes within neuronal networks that are responsible for the
expression of particular quantitative EEG measures, it is not surprising that these
changes occurred equally in the population of healthy neonates regardless of their
zygosity.</p>
<p>The central part of this study was focused on the comparison of maturational changes
of delta 1 and delta 2 power spectra among MZ and DZ twin partners throughout the 2
sleep stages and 3 periods of measurement. We found some dissociation in
distribution of within-pair MZ and DZ similarities that was dependent on frequency,
periods of measurement, electrode position, and sleep state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1179069518797108">Figure 2</xref>). However, the main finding revealed
that within-pair MZ similarity was as high as that of DZ twins for delta 1 and delta
2 power spectra on each electrode position and both sleep stages. In addition,
zygosity groups did not significantly differ in within-pair MZ and DZ similarity for
delta 1 and delta 2 power spectra. Furthermore, the results revealed that
within-pair similarity for delta 1 and for delta 2 power spectra substantially
decreased with age, not only in DZ but also in MZ twin groups. It was shown
particularly at fronto-central and central electrode positions during both sleep
stages and at centro-occipital electrode during AS/REM.</p>
<p>As a first step in genetic analyses, MZ and DZ correlations were computed on relative
powers of 2 delta bands and all leads (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1179069518797108">Table 4</xref>). Our results showed low
correlations for MZ as well as for DZ twin partners for all electrode positions and
both delta frequencies during AS/REM and QS/NREM sleep stages. Moreover,
correlations of the MZ twins were about the same as the DZ twins, indicating lack of
genetic influence on delta frequency range. The results of this study clearly
demonstrated that the rhythm of EEG maturation evidenced by the maturation of delta
1 and delta 2 power spectra was not dependent of zygosity and proceeded in the same
way in MZ and DZ twins. There have been few twin studies in children reporting
genetic influences on quantitative EEG parameters but none of them included EEG
sleep measures during early infancy. In a large twin study on 209 five-year-old MZ
and DZ twin pairs, Van Baal et al reported striking genetic influence for the
spectral composition of the EEG background during quiet rest with estimates ranging
from 63% to 68% for most frequency bands. Somewhat lower heritability was found in
delta band (mean heritability 55%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1179069518797108">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a study on 49 pairs of MZ and 45 pairs of DZ twins aged 7 to 12 months, Orekhova
et al (2003) provided the evidence for genetic determination of alpha frequency in
infants similar to that in adults. They also reported decrease in DZ similarity
while increase in MZ similarity for many of the EEG parameters during the second
half of the first year of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1179069518797108">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, the results of this study can only be compared with our previous study
which was designed to investigate genetic influence on absolute power values of EEG
power spectrum during the first trimester of life-time period that represents a
milestone of functional reorganization of brain activity in the early
infancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1179069518797108">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1179069518797108">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Those results showed substantially higher correlations in MZ than in DZ twins for
alpha (8-11.5 Hz), sigma (12-14 Hz), and beta (14.5-20 Hz) frequency ranges in all 3
periods of measurements (37th, 46th, and 52nd weeks), thus suggesting genetic
influence in these frequencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1179069518797108">29</xref></sup> In contrast, only weak correlations were found for absolute delta power
spectra at each stage of development. Although the present results failed to
indicate any genetic influence on delta frequency range, we considered challenging
to target our present research specifically on more precise investigation on delta
oscillations. There has been evidence that wide range of developmental disorders is
associated with the increase in relative power in low EEG frequencies including
delta range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1179069518797108">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1179069518797108"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1179069518797108">44</xref></sup> The most consistent finding
has been an increased low-frequency activity in children with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder compared with control children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1179069518797108">42</xref></sup> Therefore, delta waves could provide sensitive indicator for cortical health
across development. However, if we expected for EEG spectral power to represent an
endophenotype than it should posses a pattern of genetic expression within its
structure. The present findings suggested the absence of genetic influence on
maturation of delta 1 and delta 2 power spectra in the first 3 months of life, thus
confirming our previous results. Genetic influence on EEG measures has not been
examined in early infancy when brain development influences the EEG recordings.
Hence, it is unclear whether genetic contribution to EEG parameters is evident over
the first postnatal months when the brain is subjected to large structural and
functional changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1179069518797108">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1179069518797108">19</xref></sup> The existing literature showed that genetic effects are not
fixed for life. Genetic determination of many psychological and somatic
characteristics increases from infancy to childhood, whereas the influence of shared
environment decreases with age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1179069518797108">41</xref></sup> Furthermore, the relative roles of genetic and environmental influences on
brain structure during childhood and adolescence do not seem to be static. A recent
meta-analysis found that heritability increased for a range of cognitive and
behavioral features, including IQ, externalizing behaviors, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1179069518797108">45</xref></sup> Recent advances in the field of genetics have also shown that there may be
limitations regarding a second assumption of the twin model, which is that MZ twins
actually have identical genetic material. Bruder et al found a significant incidence
of differences in copy number variations in MZ twin pairs, providing evidence for
the presence of somatic mosaicism and the possible contribution of posttwinning
structural variation in chromosomal architecture to phenotypic differences between
identical twins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1179069518797108">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>We are aware that the interpretations of our study results are limited by the small
sample size. Besides, it would be beneficial to involve subsequent measurements with
larger sample sizes, matching for multiple demographics covariates
(mono/dichorionic, mono/diamniotic, spontaneous, or fertility treatment–induced
pregnancies) to validate the genetic influence on the process of EEG maturation.
Therefore, longitudinal twin data are needed to test the change in genetic
contribution to the rhythm of delta maturation over time.</p>
<p>When summarizing our results that indicated high degree of MZ variability in the
process of delta maturation, it follows that delta frequency range may not possess
the characteristics of endophenotype. We still consider that future neonatal EEG
twin studies may constitute a neurophysiologic representative of gene-environment
interreactions that can be used to diagnose neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The main finding of our study was that the MZ twins were no more similar in respect
to their delta power spectra maturation than DZ twins. We suggest that these
findings illustrate an important phenomenon that is related to the developmental
age. This research has importance because there is not a single twin study based on
quantitative analyses of EEG sleep measures that explored similarity in the rhythm
of EEG maturation in the first 3 months of life.</p>
