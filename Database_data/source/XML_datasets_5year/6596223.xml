<abstract>
<p>Sensory processing, and auditory processing in particular, is altered in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The typical maturation of the auditory system is perturbed in these individuals during early development, which may underlie altered auditory reactivity that persists in later life. Of the many genes that regulate the auditory system development, loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>CNTNAP2</italic> gene are strongly associated with language processing deficits and ASD. Therefore, using a novel <italic>Cntnap2</italic> knock-out rat model, we tested the impact of <italic>Cntnap2</italic> loss on auditory processing, filtering, and reactivity throughout development and young adulthood in male and female animals. Although hearing thresholds were not altered in <italic>Cntnap2</italic> knock-out animals, we found a reduction in response amplitudes and a delay in response latency of the auditory brainstem response (ABR) in juvenile <italic>Cntnap2</italic> knock-out rats compared with age-matched controls. Amplitudes and latency of the ABR largely normalized by adulthood, indicating a delayed maturation of auditory processing pathways in <italic>Cntnap2</italic> knock-out rats. Despite the reduced ABR amplitudes, adolescent <italic>Cntnap2</italic> knock-out animals displayed increased startle reactivity accompanied by disruptions in sensory filtering and sensorimotor gating across various conditions, most of which persisted in adulthood. All of these observations show striking parallels to disruptions reported in ASD. Our results also imply that developmental disruptions of sensory signal processing are associated with persistent changes in neural circuitries responsible for implicit auditory evoked behavior, emphasizing the need for interventions that target sensory processing disruptions early during development in ASD.</p>
<p><bold>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</bold> This is the first study of brainstem auditory processing in a novel knock-out rat model with very high construct and face validity for autism spectrum disorders. Electrophysiological and behavioral measures of implicit auditory-evoked responses were systematically taken across developmental stages. Auditory processing, filtering, and reactivity disruptions show striking similarities to observations in autism. We also show for the first time that, whereas auditory brainstem responses normalize by adulthood, disruptions in brainstem-mediated auditory-evoked behavior persist. This indicates that early developmental perturbations in sensory processing can cause permanent maladaptive changes in circuitries responsible for auditory reactivity, underlining the importance for interventions early during development aiming at normalizing sensory processing.</p>
