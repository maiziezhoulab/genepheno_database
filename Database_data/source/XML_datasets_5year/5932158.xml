<abstract>
<p>Microglial cells form a context-dependent network of brain immunoeffector cells. Despite their indispensable roles, unresolved questions exist around biomarker discovery relevant to their cellular localization, self-renewing potential, and brain developmental dynamics. To resolve the existent gap in the annotation of candidate biomarkers, we conducted a meta-analysis of brain cells using available high-throughput data sets for deciphering microglia-specific expression profiles. We have identified 3,290 significant genes specific to microglia and further selected the top 20 dysregulated genes on the basis of <italic>p</italic>-value and log<sub>2</sub>FC. To this list, we added 7 known microglia-specific markers making the candidate list comprising 27 genes for further downstream analyses. Next, we established a connectome of these potential markers with their putative protein partners, which demonstrated strong associations of upregulated genes like Dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (<italic>DOCK2</italic>) with early/mature microglial markers such as Sphingosine kinase 1 (<italic>SPHK1</italic>), <italic>CD68</italic>, and <italic>CD45</italic>. To elucidate their respective brain anatomical location, we deconvoluted the BrainSpan Atlas expression data. This analysis showed high expression of the majority of candidate genes in microglia-dense regions (Amygdala, Hippocampus, Striatum) in the postnatal brain. Furthermore, to decipher their localized expression across brain ages, we constructed a developmental dynamics map (DDM) comprising extensive gene expression profiles throughout prenatal to postnatal stages, which resulted in the discovery of novel microglia-specific gene signatures. One of the interesting readout from DDM is that all the microglia-dense regions exhibit dynamic regulation of few genes at 37 post conception week (pcw), the transition period between pre- and postnatal stages. To validate these findings and correlate them as potential biomarkers, we analyzed the expression of corresponding proteins in hESC-derived human microglia precursors. The cultured microglial precursors showed expression of Pentraxin 3 (<italic>PTX3</italic>) and <italic>SPHK1</italic> as well as several known markers like <italic>CD68</italic>, Allograft inflammatory factor 1 (<italic>AIF1</italic>/<italic>IBA1</italic>). In summary, this study has furnished critical insights into microglia dynamics across human brain ages and cataloged potential transcriptomic fingerprints that can be further exploited for designing novel neurotherapeutics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The complex human brain is composed of neurons embedded in a framework of glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia) and blood vessels. Microglial cells, the third and highly motile type of glial cell populating the brain were first identified and simultaneously reported by F. Robertson and F. Nissl, who first gave them the name “Staebchenzellen” based on their rod-like nuclei shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Later, these cells were renamed as “microglia” by Pio del Rio-Hortega, who further characterized and delimited them from other glial types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). It is noteworthy that the primary role of microglia is to dynamically monitor CNS-invading threats. Studies have proven that microglia play critical functions like maintenance of neuronal development by continuous patrolling of active neurons, scavenging dead neurons and dendritic spine pruning under normal physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Abnormal microglial activities can either under-prune or over-trim the dendritic spines leading to progressive neurodevelopmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Besides this, these brain scavengers can play multidimensional roles in maintaining brain homeostasis. One of the newly discovered roles suggests that microglia regulates the number of healthy neural precursor cells (NPCs) in adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). First, microglia control the number of NPCs by selectively colonizing near proliferative NPC zones and phagocytizing the neural precursors <italic>in utero</italic>, and second, the microglial activity gets regulated in the brain by NPC-derived chemokines, such as <italic>VEGF</italic>, as shown by increased microglial density surrounding NPC pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Notably, this NPC-microglia crosstalk is most active during neuroinflammation, as microglia is one of the primary innate immunoeffector cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). They usually accumulate around degenerating neurons, leading to the obvious misconception of causing detrimental effects. Albeit monumental efforts made toward understanding microglia dynamics in the developing brain, knowledge regarding their cellular localization, self-renewal/expansion property, and other stage-specific roles is still in its infancy.</p>
<p>Origin and continual existence of microglia throughout human brain span are being currently investigated. Interestingly, microglial ontogeny describes three lines of opinions. This includes its emergence either during the embryonic day (E7.0–E10.5) from yolk sac (YS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) or their infiltration during diseased conditions from bone-marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). There is also a third view which suggests that microglia is of neuroectodermal origin, derived either from glioblasts or from the germinal matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In a recent study, Tay et al. established an <italic>in vivo</italic> fate mapping system and studied proliferation of microglia in the healthy and diseased brain which demonstrated a context-dependent growth pattern of microglia under normal physiological conditions and selective clonal expansion during disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p>
<p>The burning questions of the hour deal with life-long inhabitation and maintenance of microglia in the human brain. Answers to these will shed light underlying disease onset and manifestations in several neurological diseases including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease (AD and PD). One of the challenges in microglial biology is to track their expression and activity throughout the brain development (fetal to adult and aged brain stages). Till date, hardly any study exists that has shed light on <italic>in silico</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> tracking of the microglial population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Specifically, microglial age and variance over brain regions can be the guidance cue to understanding onset and progression of neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). To track microglia-specific biomarker expression, their localization, and generation of a regulatory dynamic map, this study presents an integrated meta-analysis approach wherein, we analyzed the differentially expressed microglia-specific gene subsets using available data repositories. This led to a unique catalog of genes (27) which are dynamically/consistently expressed in the microglial population during different stages of brain development. For the first time, we have employed a novel strategy for <italic>in silico</italic> monitoring of microglial gene signatures to decipher their developmental dynamics map (DDM). Interestingly, protein–protein interaction network analysis revealed six different protein clusters, which exposed primary interacting partners like Tissue factor (coagulation) protein family, Retinoid X receptor gamma signaling linked <italic>MGST</italic> protein family, ATP-dependent protein family, and hippocampal BMP signaling molecules like <italic>BMP4</italic>. Furthermore, region specificity of the above candidates was evaluated using Allen Brain Atlas’s (ABA) BrainSpan which revealed localized expression of several genes in microglia-centric regions. Finally, to validate the emergence of early/mature microglial sig-natures <italic>in vitro</italic>, we induced hESC-derived microglial differentiation using an in-house protocol. In conclusion, the study has validated the expression of stage-specific markers as well as presented an updated catalog of potential age-specific microglial biomarkers, which can be used as future prognostic biomarkers. The overall strategy adopted for <italic>in silico</italic> analyses has been compiled (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S2-1">
<title>Literature Survey</title>
<p>We utilized repositories including NCBI Pubmed and HighWirePress to understand the prior literature linked to microglia biology. Other high-throughput data repositories like NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Sequence Read Archive (SRA) were scanned for biological sequence data specific to transcriptomics of human microglia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2-2">
<title>High-Throughput Data Analysis</title>
<p>First, using available RNA-sequencing data set linked to microglia transcriptomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), we delineated the brain cell-type specific expression in accordance with different brain cell types namely, microglia, astrocytes, endothelium, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. Specifically, we evaluated the differential expression between Rest of the Brain Cells comprising astrocytes, endothelial cells, oligodendrocytes and neurons (ROBC), and microglial cell type. Log<sub>2</sub>FoldChange (FC) values threshold of ±1.5 was considered with a <italic>p</italic>-value significance of &lt;0.05. This formed our <italic>primary</italic> data set comprising microglia cell type-specific genes. Our <italic>secondary</italic> data set was utilized to gauge the correlation of differential expression between brain cell types and differential expression of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) versus derived microglia. This data series deposited in GEO database contains human microglia-specific microarray Affy HuGene-2_0-st data (GSE78115) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Specifically, we considered the 12 samples (3 replicates each) derived from 2 different cell lines NCRM-5 and iNC-01 of iPSC origin. Using OLIGO package of R Bioconductor, we performed data analysis (including data normalization) to assess the differential expression pattern specific to human microglia with respect to iPSCs. The OLIGO package is freely available through Bioconductor website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Differential expression cutoff of ±1.5 log<sub>2</sub>FC and <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.05 was considered significant in all cases. The differentially expressed genes from both primary and secondary human microglia sample sets were combined to ensure minimal data loss. This integration yielded a common pool of microglial specific genes (3,290), which was further used for downstream analyses. Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for the integrated gene list (3,290) using R. We further analyzed the expression patterning between the <italic>primary</italic> and <italic>secondary</italic> data sets using the top 20 (out of 3,290) up and downregulated genes, which were shortlisted on the basis of <italic>p</italic>-value and log2FC values below 0.01 and above ±5.0, respectively. To this list, we also added a list of seven known biomarker genes specific to microglia for understanding their development expression dynamics. Taken together, the total list used for brain age and region-specific dynamics consisted of 27 genes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2-3">
<title>Protein Classification and Pathway Analysis</title>
<p>We utilized Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships classification system and mapped the total differentially expressed list of 3,290 genes to various protein classes for elucidating their functional significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). For pathway analysis, we inputted the same gene list to Consensus PathDB-human to identify their key associative pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>-value cutoff &lt;0.01 was applied for both analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2-4">
<title>Gene Set Enrichment Analysis</title>
<p>In order to ascertain significant gene sets in our differentially expressed gene list, we implemented Gene Set Enrichment analysis using the Broad Institute GSEA v2.07 software,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"><sup>1</sup></xref> the molecular signatures database,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2"><sup>2</sup></xref> and the C5: GO gene sets database, comprised of 1,454 gene sets named by genes and respective GO terms.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2-5">
<title>Protein–Protein Interaction Network Analysis</title>
<p>The differentially expressed gene list (3290) was mapped to STRING for whole proteome network analysis. Furthermore, the shortlisted microglia-specific gene list (27) was also analyzed for protein partner associations using STRING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Primarily, using all the top upregulated and downregulated protein clusters, a single protein–protein network was constructed. A stringent cut-off of 0.7 for edge/interaction score was considered for building the primary protein–protein interaction network without clustering and no more than 20 primary interactor proteins. This combined confidence score is calculated on the basis of various parameters including phylogenetic co-occurrence, gene fusion, homology, co-expression, experimentally determined interaction, and neighborhood on any chromosome. The graph was primarily constructed according to interaction/edge score while specifying the source and target nodes. All networks were visualized using Cytoscape 3.4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2-6">
<title>Brain Region Expression Mapping</title>
<p>The Allen Brain Atlas contains an extensive catalog of human brain expression data (Microarray and RNA-Seq) with region specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). We collected the raw data of the developmental transcriptome from Allen Brain Atlas and segregated the data into different ages from prenatal to postnatal (adult) brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Here, we mapped the top gene set of 27 genes onto all the prenatal and postnatal brain regions, with a special emphasis on human microglia-enriched regions like Hippocampus, Striatum, and Amygdala. Other than these genes, we also show the expression of known microglial marker genes like <italic>TMEM119, P2RY12</italic>, Phospholipase D4 (<italic>PLD4</italic>), <italic>AIF1, PTPRC1</italic>, Sphingosine kinase 1 (<italic>SPHK1</italic>), <italic>PTX3</italic>, and G protein-coupled receptor 34 (<italic>GPR34</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2-7">
<title>Age-Wise Dynamics</title>
<p>To assess the microglia dynamics throughout the age (pre- and postnatal) of a human being, we utilized the human developmental transcriptome data (BrainSpan) deposited in the Allen Brain database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Replicate samples for each developmental stage (prenatal or postnatal) were considered for analysis. The age groups ranged from prenatal stages, including 14th postconception week (pcw), 22 pcw to 40 years of age. Specifically, for each microglia-enriched region of the brain (hippocampus, striatum, and amygdala), we constructed individual graphs for age-wise DDM of potential and known microglia-specific markers which included shortlisted gene set of 27, containing 20 (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01, log<sub>2</sub>FC &gt; ±5.0) and 7 known markers. Following this, correlation analysis was performed using the same gene list as input to find correlations among the human ages spanning prenatal stages like 12 pcw, 37 pcw to postnatal stages, such as 1, 15–19, and 40 years of age. Pearson correlation matrices or correlograms were constructed and visualized using the Corrplot package of R Bioconductor suite. All graphs have been made using RStudio 1.0.153 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S2-8">
<title>Culturing of Human Embryonic Stem Cells (H9)</title>
<p>Human embryonic stem cells (h9-hESC, NIH approved) were obtained from human embryonic stem cell core, Baylor College of Medicine. H9 clones were propagated based on feeder-free culture system, using human ESC-qualified Matrix, BD Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), and grown in mTeSR-1 complete media supplements (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Clones were maintained and expanded according to manufacturer’s protocol, in accordance with NIH guidelines. Complete media was changed every day and cells were sub-cultured using Dispase (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) every 5–6 days. During each stage of sub-culture, uniform H9 colonies were collected without any visible differentiation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2-9">
<title>Embryonic Body (EB) Formation</title>
<p>To induce the formation of EBs or neuroectodermal spheres, the H9 colonies with 70% confluency were used. To achieve neural induction, H9 colonies were incubated in neural induction me-dium [NIM; DMEM/F12: Neurobasal (1:1), 2% B27, 1% N2 (Invitrogen)] for almost 24 h and dissociated into small clumps by manual scraping. Small clumps were further grown as suspension culture with NIM in non-coated bacterial Petri dishes for a period of 4 days as exactly described by Cho et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). 50% of the media were replaced in each of the EB-containing Petri dishes at a timely interval of 48 h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2-10">
<title>Microglial Differentiation and Generation of Microglia Precursors From hESC</title>
<p>To induce microglial differentiation in culture from H9 derived EBs and obtain human microglial precursors <italic>in vitro</italic>, we used an in-house standardized protocol (unpublished), modified based on an earlier established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). In brief, the whole process goes through a long-term culture (approximately 8 weeks) covering four major steps, (i) formation of hESC (H9) derived EBs, (ii) neuroectodermal lineage commitment, (iii) microglial differentiation, and (iv) formation of induced microglia precursors (iMPs), as suggested in the previous article by Beutner et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). We have used stage-specific conditioned media supplements as suggested by Beutner et al., including differentiation media (DIFF), Insulin/Transferrin/Selenite/Fibronectin media (ITSF<sub>n</sub>) and N2 Media. However, we have introduced several modifications during the stage-specific progression of microglial differentiation. These include the following: (1) Usage of NIM media till 5 Days <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) for maintaining EBs and then switching them to ITSF<sub>n</sub> on sixth day, (2) addition of human stem cell factor (hSCF, Peprotech, USA) and basic fibroblast growth factor (Peprotech) in culture from DIV 7 to DIV 14 with concentrations of 50 and 25 ng/ml, respectively, (3) treatment of cultures from DIV 14 to DIV 21 with hSCF, hIL3, and human granulocyte macrophage stimulating factor (hGM-CSF, Peprotech) with concentrations of 50 ng/ml for both hSCF and hIL3, and 25 ng/ml for hGM-CSF, and finally (4) addition of only hGM-CSF from DIV 21 onward till DIV 40 and furthermore.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2-11">
<title>Immunocytochemistry/Immunofluorescence Analysis</title>
<p>Cells from different stages of microglia induction and differentiation were fixed for performing immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence-based analyses using primary antibodies and fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies.

<title>Cell-Type Specific Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of Human Microglia</title>
<p>The complete GEO and SRA high-throughput databases were scanned to identify microglia-specific data sets. Out of this, two data sets were shortlisted for further in-depth <italic>in silico</italic> analyses. Initially, we analyzed the <italic>primary</italic> data set, i.e., the total gene set from the cell-type specific data comprised of significantly expressed genes in ROBC versus microglia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). A total of 3,853 genes were differentially expressed, with a range comprising 6.0 log<sub>2</sub>FC as the maximum expression to −9.4 log<sub>2</sub>FC as the minimum expression. The samples of various cellular origins were tested for homogeneity <italic>via</italic> 2D-Principal Component Analysis which resulted in noticeable differences in microglia sample cluster from other cell types in Principal components, PC 1 and PC 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). We specifically considered the <italic>primary data set</italic> to be the cell-type data to ensure elimination of non-microglia related noise in the human brain. Furthermore, we identified known biomarkers including <italic>SPHK1, PLD4, TMEM119</italic>, and <italic>CD68</italic>, expressed in the range of 2–6 FC and used them as a positive control for <italic>in silico</italic> tracking of microglia.</p>

Purinergic receptor 12 (<italic>P2RY12</italic>) is known to suppress microglial process motility and delay in closure of blood–brain barrier (BBB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). <italic>P2RY12</italic>-mediated microglial cell activation contributes to the rapid closure of BBB small leaks, by aggregation of microglial cells at the injury site. Expression of Phospholipase D4 (<italic>PLD4</italic>) and its localization changes are correlated with the activation state of microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). This transmembrane glycoprotein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus is primarily seen to play an important role in microglia dynamics during early postnatal brain development. Transmembrane protein 119 (<italic>TMEM119</italic>) is an established, reliable microglial marker that discriminates resident microglia from blood-derived macrophages in the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). A glia-derived Pentraxin 3 (<italic>PTX3</italic>) expressed in the microglial secretome, has been seen to modulate phagocytic functions of microglia having crucial implications in the regulation of microglial activity in brain diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>secondary</italic> data set was a redundant list of total 4,776 genes which was seen to be differentially expressed among 2 human microarray data sets. This data set contains six induced microglia samples derived from human iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). We integrated the differentially expressed microglia-specific data enriched from both <italic>primary</italic> and <italic>secondary</italic> data sets containing 3,853 and 4,776 genes, respectively. This meta-analysis yielded a common pool of microglial specific genes (3,290) which was further used for downstream analyses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p>

<title>Pathway Mapping and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis</title>
<p>The readout of gene candidates (3,290) was used to target enriched pathways. Among the candidate pathways, GPCR, Glycerophospholipid, NOTCH1, RAP1, glycosaminoglycan metabolism, VEGFR signaling, etc. were significant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). This analysis also demonstrated enrichment of 278 out of 3,290 genes within the immune system pathway, suggesting their potential roles in microglia functioning or immune surveillance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C).</p>
<p>The list of significantly expressed genes (3,290) was used for gene/protein type-based clustering. This analysis revealed 25 crucial protein classes that majorly comprise of 10.7% enzyme regulators, followed by 9.9% nucleic acid binding proteins, and enzymes like transferases, hydrolases, transcription factors, and signaling molecules (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref> in Supplementary Material). The other segments included cell junction, immunity/defense and extracellular matrix proteins containing 28, 40 and 46 proteins, respectively. These classes acted as guidance cues for the protein–protein based network analysis as well as pathway mapping and exposed many critical clusters of gene regulatory elements. We also performed GSEA on critically altered gene set of 20 dysregulated genes and 7 known microglia-specific markers to find critical GO terms like Immune System process, Receptor activity, Regulation of cell proliferation which further substantiated the data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D; Supplementary Table 2 in Supplementary Material).

<title>Correlation Analysis of Microglial Biomarkers Among the Data Sets</title>
<p>To establish correlations among the <italic>primary</italic> and <italic>secondary</italic> data sets, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient for the common gene pool between the two data sets (3,290), which resulted in a value of −0.22 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A,B). First, the primary and secondary datasets were analyzed for the similarity in expression of shortlisted gene set comprising 27 (20 novel + 7 known) genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C). Within the upregulated gene set, all these biomarker genes excluding <italic>GPR34</italic> demonstrated similarity in expression when compared to the <italic>secondary</italic> data set [iPSC derived microglia (iMG) data] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). To highlight, top upregulated genes, including Dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (<italic>DOCK2</italic>), Guanylate binding protein 2 (<italic>GBP2</italic>), A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 28 (<italic>ADAM28</italic>), G Protein-coupled receptor 183 (<italic>GPR183</italic>), Calpain small subunit 2 (<italic>CAPNS2</italic>), and Fc-α receptor mediator (FCAR), were found to be consistently expressed in primary and secondary data set.</p>

<p>Further literature mining of this top altered gene set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) substantiated their mechanistic roles relevant to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. Among these, <italic>DOCK2</italic>, an atypical Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for <italic>RAC</italic> and/or <italic>CDC42</italic> GTPases are known to regulate phagocytic activity, cytokine release, and paracrine neurotoxicity in microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). In one of the microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory cascades, the <italic>DOCK2</italic>-<italic>RAC1</italic> pathway was seen to be elicited by S1P through an integrin-dependent association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Precisely, S1P which is the phosphorylated end-product of <italic>SPHK1</italic> is known to regulate immune cell trafficking upon binding to G-coupled receptors (<italic>GPRs</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Interestingly, we found fivefold expression of a novel marker <italic>GPR183</italic> in microglia whose role is yet to be elucidated. <italic>DOCK2</italic> is directly regulated by the Prostaglandin E2 receptor (<italic>EP2</italic>) and has also been linked with AD pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Concurrent evidence involving Prostaglandin signaling in microglia also suggested that balanced induction of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (<italic>PPARG)</italic> by <italic>LPS/IL13</italic> or activation of <italic>EP2</italic> can lead to neuroprotection or death of microglia <italic>via</italic> calpain-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Our data also validated the elevated expression of <italic>PPARG</italic> as well as its downstream target calpain associated genes like <italic>CAPNS2</italic> in the microglial pool versus the other cell types.</p>
<p>Another immunoeffector molecule, <italic>FCAR</italic> (<italic>CD89</italic>) was seen to be highly expressed among the top 20 altered genes in the microglial population, which also corroborated by a recent report by Galatro et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Previous reports suggest that human microglial cells expressing truncated IRF3 show decreased expression of <italic>GBP2</italic>, thus proposing a possible link of this protein to <italic>TLR3/4</italic>-dependent neuroinflammation. Our study has shown another important marker of the microglial cell type known to be involved in CNS invasion, i.e., <italic>ADAM28</italic>, a member of the metalloproteinase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Another enriched marker gene <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase <italic>B3GNT5</italic> was seen to be a prominent player in the expression of lactoseries sulfoglucuronylglycolipids within glycosphingolipid pathway during the prenatal brain develop-ment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). High expression of Kelch-like family member 6 (<italic>KLHL6</italic>) was also detected in the microglial pool, which is supported by previous AD mice model-based studies linked it to AD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). We also found an interesting factor known as macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (<italic>MSR1</italic>) involved in the phagocytic machinery of microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>).</p>
<p>Contrary to this, in case of top 10 downregulated genes, the expression values for the <italic>secondary</italic> data set were found to be non-correlative to the primary data set (ROBC vs. microglia) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C). Microsomal Glutathione S-Transferase 1 (<italic>MGST1)</italic>, a regulator of Retinoid X receptor gamma signaling during remyelination showed non-correlative expression between the two data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Genes like S100 Calcium Binding Protein A1 (<italic>S100A1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>) and Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-2 (<italic>GABRA2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>) which are known to be highly expressed in astrocytes were also seen to be enriched in the secondary data set and repressed in the primary data set, thus justifying the need to enrich a pure microglia cell type marker-enriched population for <italic>in silico</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> tracking. We also detected a novel gene EGF Containing Fibulin Like Extracellular Matrix Protein 1 (<italic>EFEMP1</italic>), a fibulin glycoprotein family member which was found to be downregulated in ROBC versus microglia. This was earlier shown to be upregulated in malignant gliomas and age-related macular degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). Another interesting observation suggested expression of several synaptosomal and synaptic receptor genes like <italic>SLC4A4</italic> and <italic>GABRA2</italic> significantly downregulated in the primary data set in coherence with the study by Ji et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). This analysis sheds light on probable roles of the top 20 genes in other brain cell types as well as exposes a filtered population of markers linked to microglia function in the developing human brain.</p>

<p>Subset PPI networks were constructed based on the top 20 differentially expressed gene list in combination with the known biomarkers. This network exposed primary neighborhood interacting partners of <italic>DOCK2, F3, GJA1, CHRDL1, MGST1</italic>, and <italic>ATP1A2</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Among these, one of the highly upregulated genes, <italic>DOCK2</italic> showed multiple interacting partnerships with known biomarkers like <italic>SPHK1, PTPRC</italic>, and <italic>CD68</italic>, which is substantiated by numerous connections (edges) and their respective confidence scores (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). <italic>DOCK2</italic> is also seen to be connected to <italic>SPHK1</italic> through <italic>LYN</italic>, and to <italic>PTPRC</italic>, and <italic>CD68</italic> through <italic>FYN</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In a second cluster, we found <italic>GJA1</italic> to be interacting with <italic>CDH2</italic> and <italic>TJP1</italic>. The <italic>GJA1</italic> mutation has been seen to cause Oculodentodigital dysplasia, an autosomal dominant disorder, with high penetrance in intra- and interfamilial phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). In another cluster, F3 or thrombosis factor 3 was prominently associated with its own family members (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). F3 gene encodes coagulation factor 3 which is a membrane-bound glycoprotein is part of the Tissue factor family.

<title>Trends in Region-Specificity for Potential, Novel Microglia Signatures</title>
<p>Cellular localization of microglia is still debatable in human brain development. Notably, the prenatal human brain displays smaller brain size with a higher number of sub-regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), whereas the postnatal brain contains 18 developed sub-regions. Microglia population in the healthy brain is known to be residing primarily in hippocampus, amygdala, substantia nigra, and striatum. However, developmental tracking of human microglial activity in these regions is still elusive. To elucidate the region-specific dynamic regulation of microglial markers, we analyzed the distribution of the identified <italic>in silico</italic> candidates. Our data revealed that in the prenatal and postnatal brain regions, the expression profiles of selected dysregulated gene set (20 + 7) was dynamically regulated as seen by their variable expression across sub-regions. Understanding this variability in their expression pattern would be crucial for building the microglial dynamic map in human brain development.</p>
<p>In the prenatal brain, the expression levels of known biomarker genes like <italic>PLD4, SPHK1</italic> were high in regions of importance like caudal ganglionic eminence, medial ganglionic eminence, lateral ganglionic eminence and lower in regions like posteroinferior parietal cortex, inferolateral temporal cortex, medial frontal cortex (MFC) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). However, <italic>GPCR</italic> associated genes like <italic>GPR183</italic> and <italic>GPR34</italic>, and EFEMP1 were seen to be highly expressed only in the primary visual cortex (V1C) region in the prenatal brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). To highlight, <italic>EFEMP1</italic> mutations are associated with Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy, an autosomal dominant disorder in which there are drusen (lipid) deposits in the macula eventually leading to vision loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). In the postnatal brain, genes such as <italic>GBP2</italic>, astrocyte marker <italic>S100A1</italic> and <italic>MGST1</italic> are highly expressed in the cerebellar cortex region, while genes like <italic>GPR183, EFEMP1</italic>, and <italic>GPR34</italic> are only expressed in MFC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B).</p>

<p>In summary, this analysis revealed consistent high expression of 14 out of 27 microglial markers in regions like hippocampus (HIP), amygdala (AMY), and striatum (STR) during postnatal development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). However, all of these 14 genes are low in expression throughout prenatal development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). Interestingly, amygdaloid complex (AMY) of the prenatal brain showed very low expression of all 27 genes, whereas the same region showed pronounced expression of numerous genes, like <italic>P2RY12, DOCK2, MSR1, B3GNT5, AIF1</italic>, etc. during postnatal development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B).

<title>Age-Specific Correlation of Microglial Signatures During Brain Development</title>
<p>Ontogeny, renewal, and maintenance of microglial population have long been debated. In this direction, we decided to correlate region-specific expression of microglial markers to developmental stages of the human brain. The ABA developmental transcriptome data yielded a humungous gene pool constituting age-wise microglial marker expression specifically in AMY, HIP and STR regions. We, further, focused on the gene regulation status of top 10 upregulated and downregulated gene sets across brain ages encompassing prenatal (8–37 pcw) and postnatal (1–40 years). Furthermore, we built correlation matrices between several important ages, including 13 and 37 pcw, marking the prenatal ages, and 1, 8, 15, 19, and 40 years indicating infant to the adult brain.</p>
<p>The correlation matrices with a correlation coefficient scale (−1, 1) for all three brain regions showed positive correlation at varying degrees. The representative correlogram for prenatal stages of <italic>HIP</italic> showed moderately positive correlation (<italic>R</italic> = 0.65) between 13 and 37 pcw and aged brain stage of 40 years (<italic>R</italic> = 0.70) (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref> in Supplementary Material). Interestingly, a very strong correlation was also noticed between the early adult ages of 8 years and later ages like 18 and 40 years (<italic>R</italic> = 0.90) in the <italic>HIP</italic> region. Respective correlogram for <italic>STR</italic> displayed increasing correlation (0.77) between 13 and 37 pcw and all adult ages, and notably, highest correlation score was observed between 19 and 40 years of age (<italic>R</italic> = 0.97) (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref> in Supplementary Material). In case of <italic>AMY</italic>, we noticed very strong correlation between the postnatal ages of 1, 5, 15, and 40 years (<italic>R</italic> = 0.88).

Interestingly, the <italic>in silico</italic> age dynamics study has projected <italic>SPHK1</italic> as a key marker to be consistently upregulated at 37 pcw, specifically in <italic>AMY</italic> and <italic>HIP</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). It is already evident that <italic>SPHK1</italic> plays crucial roles in microglia-dependent neuroinflammatory cascades. Additionally, we also found <italic>PTX3</italic>, which is another marker of microglia involved in regulation of phagocytic activity to be consistently downregulated across DDM of the human brain, specifically in <italic>AMY</italic> and <italic>HIP</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Based on these findings, we further tried to elucidate expression of <italic>SPHK1</italic> and <italic>PTX3</italic> in long-term culture of human microglia.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Albeit microglia constitute approximately 10% of the total cell population in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>), there are major lacunae in the knowledge regarding their expression across human brain ages and regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>). Many critical questions involving their ontogeny, localization, and self-renewal still need to be addressed. Discovery of novel microglial biomarkers and elucidation of their specific roles in brain developmental processes will shed light on the onset of neurological disease and progression.</p>
<p>Studies involving human microglia-derived transcriptomics and proteomics are still in its infancy, and given the low scope of availability of healthy/diseased human brain tissue, it is imperative to perform high-throughput data analysis to be able to identify and narrow down crucial microglia signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In this direction, using available tissue based transcriptomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>) as well as induced microglia microarray data generated from pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), we analyzed the differentially regulated gene sets pertinent to microglia biology and homeostasis, which resulted in a novel catalog of microglial biomarkers. Further using GSEA on the ascertained list, we have identified different clusters of gene sets specific to human microglia, which revealed several crucial clusters such as metalloproteinases, GPCRs, proteoglycans, immunoeffectors, gap junction family genes, and synaptosomal receptors, etc. These prominent gene clusters explained multidimensional roles and biological activity of microglia. This GSEA map acted as a primer for further downstream analyses. Correlation analysis further explained the differential expression behavior of many genes between the human brain cell types and induced microglia data sets, <italic>viz</italic>., <italic>primary</italic> and <italic>secondary</italic> data sets, respectively. Another interesting inference indicates that there might be different gene subsets required for maintaining microglial homeostasis and activity in the human brain, while enforced microglial differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> requires an exclusive set of gene regulators. To understand the protein–protein interactions among the shortlisted candidates, we constructed a primary protein neighborhood network and performed pathway analysis. The study highlights some novel pathways associated with microgliasuch as Glycosaminoglycan metabolism, RAP1, Phospholipase C/D, <italic>PPAR</italic>, Fatty acid CoA signaling pathways. Upon assessment of the DDM across brain age groups, we have identified the top 20 altered genes as molecular signatures to developmentally track microglia in fetal, infant, child, adolescent, and adult brains.</p>
<p>Both GSEA and correlation analysis pointed out three possible hypotheses which might play roles in microglia-NPC crosstalk. The first hypothesis suggests that enhanced expression of <italic>PTGS1/2</italic> is linked to <italic>EP2</italic> receptors in microglia and might be the key to crosstalk with the qNSCs that express specifically <italic>PGE2</italic>. The second hypothesis discusses the interaction between microglia and qNSCs through plausible crosstalk between <italic>DOCK2</italic> and S1P, as evidence suggests qNSCs specifically express S1P as biomarker and microglia express SPHK1, <italic>DOCK2</italic>, and <italic>S1PR1/5</italic> (S1P receptor 1/5). The third hypothesis suggests that <italic>GPR183</italic> acts a conditioned rheostat for NSC quiescence and activity in <italic>NOTCH1</italic> dependent pathway. Since differential expression analysis showed high expression of <italic>GPR183</italic> in microglia, and <italic>NOTCH1</italic> regulates self-renewal of hippocampal NSCs, there can be possible molecular crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies from past few decades have indicated both specific and context-dependent localization and activity of microglia during neuroinflammatory circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). However, hardly any study exists which could track their activity throughout brain development. Another major roadblock that is faced is the unavailability of human brain cells. To address such issues, we established a cellular model of the human microglial cell population and deciphered the expression of existing biomarkers, especially <italic>CD68, AIF1 (IBA1), SPHK1</italic>, and <italic>PTX3</italic>. Earlier findings have indicated that SPHK1 is found to be abundantly expressed in several rat brain cell types, including neurons in the hippocampus, cerebellar granule cells, and astrocytes and also in the amoeboid microglial cells of the corpus callosum of the postnatal brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>). The <italic>in silico</italic> data strongly corroborated with this existing evidence, which suggested that <italic>SPHK1</italic> expression is significantly upregulated in microglia-dense regions, namely hippocampus and amygdala (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The <italic>in vitro</italic> long-term culture study also supported these findings and suggested that human microglia precursors from post 26DIV showed consistent expression of <italic>SPHK1</italic> in late microglial precursors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>B). The results have also represented another unique marker, <italic>PTX3</italic> in the in cultured human microglial precursor cells, which is known to regulate the phagocytic activity of microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). This observation supported the DDM data which has shown <italic>PTX3</italic> to be consistently downregulated across different ages in HIP and AMY of healthy brains. In summary, our <italic>in vitro</italic> study has validated the emergence of the microglial signatures in hESC-derived human microglial precursors and also represented a robust human microglial model for future investigations involving microglial biology and activity.</p>
<p>Microglia has been associated with onset, aggravation, and progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, Dementia, and Glioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>). This is primarily due to dysregulated microglial activity during development as well as disease leading to severe neurocognitive impairments and neuronal dysfunction. Overall, this study has unraveled fundamental information underlying the labyrinthine molecular circuitry in microglia functioning, physiology, homeostasis, and genetics across brain developmental stages and regions.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our study has introduced a novel integrative biology approach for tracking human microglia signatures across 25 developmental stages spanning fetal, infant, adolescence, and adult, and delineated their localized expression in microglia-dense regions. The <italic>in vitro</italic> data have also validated the expression of some of the biomarkers in human microglial precursors. Precisely, tracking of microglia transcriptomic dynamics based on brain anatomy and age could establish an essential DDM comprising highly altered gene clusters. This map can be further utilized to develop set of putative prognostic markers in accordance with the age of the human brain. One of the interesting readouts of the DDM was the dynamic expression associated with 37 pcw, i.e., a transition period between prenatal and postnatal brain. To highlight, the study has led to the discovery of microglia age-specific gene signatures, including <italic>EFEMP1, GJA1, PTX3, KLHL6, SPHK1, FCAR</italic>, and <italic>CAPNS2</italic>, which can be further explored for understanding their roles in microglial biology in the human brain.</p>

<title>Future Perspectives</title>
<p>In essence, this study has established a repertoire of microglia-specific signatures involved in the developing human brain. Characterization of mechanistic roles of these gene fingerprints in experimental models would further bridge the gap in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in microglia ontogeny, renewal, and maintenance. Age-wise expression profiling of these novel signatures (DDM) in both pre- and postnatal brain stages can act as guidance cues for designing future prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers against neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, the data associated with age and region-specificity can pave the way to personalized medicine interventions for debilitating neurological diseases.</p>
