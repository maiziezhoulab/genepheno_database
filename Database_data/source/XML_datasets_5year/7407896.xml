<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Recently, dysbiosis in the human gut microbiome and shifts in the relative abundances of several bacterial species have been recognized as important factors in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, these studies have been carried out mainly in developed countries where CRC has a high incidence, and it is unclear whether the host-microbiome relationships deduced from these studies can be generalized to the global population. To test if the documented associations between the microbiome and CRC are conserved in a distinct context, we performed metagenomic and metabolomic association studies on fecal samples from 30 CRC patients and 30 healthy controls from two different locations in India, followed by a comparison of CRC data available from other populations. We confirmed the association of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and other bacterial taxa with CRC that have been previously reported in other studies. However, the association of CRC with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Flavonifractor plautii</named-content> in Indian patients emerged as a novel finding. The plausible role of <italic>F. plautii</italic> appears to be linked with the degradation of beneficial anticarcinogenic flavonoids, which was also found to be significantly correlated with the enzymes and modules involved in flavonoid degradation within Indian CRC samples. Thus, we hypothesize that the degradation of beneficial flavonoids might be playing a role in cancer progression within this Indian cohort. We also identified 20 potential microbial taxonomic markers and 33 potential microbial gene markers that discriminate the Indian CRC from healthy microbiomes with high accuracy based on machine learning approaches.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is among the most frequently diagnosed cancers worldwide and is a major cause for mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). CRC shows the highest incidence in developed countries, such as in the United States and Japan, and is also on the rise in East Asian countries. Mutations in several tumor suppressor genes, such as APC, MSH2, MLH1, PMS2, DPC4/Smad4, and p53, and activation of oncogenes, such as Î²-catenin, COX-2, and K-RAS, have been implicated as one of the many causes of colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The human colon is a unique organ that harbors thousands of bacterial species comprising â¼10<sup>12</sup> to 10<sup>â14</sup> microbes, which play a prominent role in human health, likely implicated in the etiology of several human diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular and other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Similar associations of an altered gut microbiome with CRC have also been revealed in recent studies in Chinese, Austrian, French, and American populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In the majority of the studies, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Fusobacterium nucleatum</named-content> and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp. have been observed to be consistently associated with tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond taxonomic profiling, a few recent metagenomic studies have also focused on the identification of potential fecal biomarkers for the improved detection of CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In the Chinese population, Yu et al. identified 20 microbial gene markers differentiating the CRC and healthy gut microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Another study, from a European population, also identified potent taxonomic biomarkers, which showed similar diagnostic accuracy as that of the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) for both early- and late-stage CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). When the two approaches were combined, an improvement of &gt;45% in sensitivity of machine learning models was observed compared to FOBT, while maintaining their specificity for CRC detection, suggesting that microbial biomarkers hold the potential to supplement the existing diagnostic techniques for early-stage and noninvasive detection of CRC.</p>
<p>The previous microbiome studies have mostly emphasized the identification of global CRC markers, as opposed to population-specific microbial biomarkers. However, most of these studies also focus on developed countries and/or populations with high incidences of CRC, which may share environmental or lifestyle factors that influence both CRC and the microbiome. It is, therefore, unclear how universal the reported associations between CRC and the gut microbiome are. Due to the significantly distinct lifestyles and dietary characteristics of different populations worldwide, it is important to identify both country-specific and global markers of CRC.</p>
<p>India is among the few countries in the world where CRC shows the lowest incidence. Low rates of CRC in India are often linked to vegetarianism, use of spices such as curcumin (turmeric), and other food additives having apparent anticancer properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Given the profound role of diet in shaping the gut microbiome, these unique dietary traits are likely to affect the gut microbiome. A cross-population comparison carried out in one of our recent studies also showed that the Indian population forms a distinct cluster from other world populations (China, United States, and Denmark), driven by the predominance of <italic>Prevotella</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). If the gut microbiome does mediate CRC disease progression, these unique gut microbial traits may explain the low incidence of CRC in India. However, no study has yet been carried out in the Indian population to examine these relationships. Therefore, to gain novel insights into the role of the gut microbiome in CRC in India, and to identify population-specific bacterial markers of CRC, we performed a comprehensive gut microbiome analysis of CRC patients in India and compared that microbiome with healthy Indian individuals. Specifically, we profiled the fecal metagenome using shotgun metagenomic sequencing along with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based profiling of the fecal metabolome in a cohort of 60 individuals (30 CRC patients and 30 healthy controls) from two distinct locations (north-central and southern India).</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<p>Shotgun metagenomic sequencing in <italic>n</italic> = 60 individuals from both Bhopal and Kerala cohorts (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">TableÂ S1</xref> in the supplemental material) yielded a total of 641 million high-quality sequencing reads with an average of 10.7âÂ±â5.1 million reads/sample (average Â± SD). We then constructed a gene catalogue containing a set of 2,364,248 nonredundant genes for the Indian cohort. For maximum quantification of microbial genes, the Integrated Gene Catalogue (IGC) and the India-specific gene catalogue were combined to construct a nonredundant Updated Gene Catalogue (UGC), which comprised 11,118,467 genes (an addition of 12.5% genes in the current IGC) including 9,879,896 genes from the IGC and 1,238,571 genes unique to the Indian population. The UGC was used for mapping of metagenomic reads from the 60 Indian samples and resulted in 54.47%âÂ±â7.84% (average Â± SD) mapping of reads and in the identification of 3,824,855 million genes in the Indian cohort.</p>

<title>Variations in the CRC-associated gut microbiome in the Indian cohort.</title>
<p>Rarefaction analysis showed that the gene richness approached saturation in both groups (healthy and CRC) and was higher in CRC than in healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.Â 1A</xref>). The increased gene richness was further validated by calculating the within-sample diversity (Î±-diversity) using the Shannon index, which measures within-sample gene diversity. It was observed that the individuals with CRC had a more significantly diverse gene pool than healthy controls (Wilcoxon rank sum test; <italic>q</italic> value = 0.0052) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.Â 1B</xref>). Interindividual distances in gene composition, as determined by Bray-Curtis distance metrics, showed that CRC individuals are much more dissimilar than healthy controls (Wilcoxon rank sum test; <italic>q</italic> value = 0.0003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.Â 1C</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest distinct differences in the diversity of functions carried out by gut microbial communities in the CRC-associated gut compared to the healthy controls.</p>

<p>To compare the gene contents among all 60 samples, a set of genes commonly present in at least 3 samples (5% of the total samples) was constructed, which comprised 1,988,680 genes. Using these 1.9 million genes, gene abundance profiles were generated for each of the 60 samples. The variations in microbial community composition between samples were first scored to examine the effect of each of 8 covariates (health status, location, age, gender, body mass index [BMI], stage, histopathology, and localization) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">TableÂ 1</xref>) by performing permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) on the gene abundance profiles. It was observed that health status explained the maximum variation (<italic>P</italic> valueâ=â0.0009, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.04) compared to the other covariates. The location also showed a significant effect but explained less variation than the health status (<italic>P</italic> value = 0.009, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.03).</p>

<p>To further dig into the covariates explaining variation in the gene profiles across cohorts, principal-component analysis (PCA) based on the gene profiles was performed. The first and the second principal component explained 7.2% and 6.8% of the total variations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.Â S1</xref> in the supplemental material) and were significantly associated with health status (polyserial correlation; <italic>q</italic> value &lt; 10<sup>â15</sup>) and location (polyserial correlation; <italic>q</italic> value = 0.00004), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS2">TableÂ S2</xref>). CRC and healthy samples clustered separately along PC1, corroborating significant functional microbiome differences explained mainly by the health status followed by location of the samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS2">TableÂ S2</xref>).</p>

<title>Taxonomic variations in the CRC-associated gut microbiome.</title>
<p>Taxonomic differences in the gut microbiome of CRC and healthy individuals were examined to identify the microbial taxa associated with the patterns observed in the previous analysis. For this analysis, three different methods were used: (i) reference-based Human Microbiome Project-National Center for Biotechnology Information (HMP-NCBI) species, (ii) <italic>de novo</italic> clustering-based metagenomic species (MGS), and (iii) clade-specific-marker-based metagenomic OTU (mOTU) species and Metaphlan species (see Materials and Methods). On performing correlation analysis, 158 HMP-NCBI-mapped species, 147 MGS, 61 species-level mOTUs, and 45 Metaphlan species were observed to be significantly associated with CRC or healthy samples (Wilcoxon rank sum test; <italic>q</italic> value &lt; 0.01; mean abundance &gt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS3">TableÂ S3</xref>). To improve the robustness of taxonomic marker identification in CRC, the taxonomic species that were identified by all the three strategies simultaneously (HMP-NCBI species, MGS, and any one of the clade marker-based approaches, i.e., mOTUs or Metaphlan) were considered for further analysis. A total of 20 taxonomic markers were identified based on their significant association with the health status using the above methods. Among these 20 marker species, six species, namely, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Eubacterium rectale</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Prevotella copri</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bifidobacterium adolescentis</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Megasphaera elsdenii</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Lactobacillus ruminis</named-content>, were observed to be highly associated with the gut microbiome of healthy Indian subjects. These species have also been associated with a healthy phenotype in previous studies, and significant reductions in their proportion were observed in CRC in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).

<p>Remarkably, a few gut bacteria that have not yet been associated with colorectal cancer in the previous reports were also observed to be significantly associated with Indian CRC samples. Among these, a novel and striking finding was the presence of <italic>Flavinofractor plautii</italic>, which was significantly associated (Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>q</italic>â&lt;â0.00001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.Â 2</xref>) with CRC samples in this study. Additionally, the predictive power of taxonomic association using Random Forest (RF) analysis on HMP-NCBI species abundance also showed <named-content content-type="genus-species">Flavonifractor plautii</named-content> as the most important species in separating Indian CRC samples from the healthy controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">TableÂ 2</xref>). The high abundance of this flavonoid-degrading bacterium in Indian samples is intriguing, as the diet of Indian populations is rich in polyphenols, with flavonoids being the most abundant dietary polyphenol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Additionally, a few gut bacteria not associated with colorectal cancer in the previous reports were also observed to be highly associated with CRC; these included <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacteroides intestinalis</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Methanobrevibacter smithii</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptococcus parasanguinis</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Veillonella parvula</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.Â 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Further, PERMANOVA showed that only health status (<italic>q</italic> value = 0.004) and location (<italic>q</italic> value = 0.004) significantly explained variation in species abundance based on the four methods used to identify species. All other covariates were not significant (<italic>q</italic> value &gt; 0.09) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS4">TableÂ S4</xref>). In order to derive associations between microbial markers, a species cooccurrence network was generated from pairwise correlations using sparCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.Â 3</xref>). <named-content content-type="genus-species">Flavonifractor plautii</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacteroides fragilis</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacteroides intestinalis</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Parabacteroides distasonis</named-content>, which have been previously reported to be associated with CRC, showed higher degrees of association with each other and also with microbes such as <named-content content-type="genus-species">Peptostreptococcus stomatis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Parvimonas micra</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).

<title>Global comparative metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) meta-analysis.</title>
<p>To demonstrate the utility of CRC-associated taxonomic markers in the CRC-associated gut microbiome between cohorts, we selected a similar group of 75 CRC cases and 53 healthy control samples from a Chinese cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and a group of 46 CRC cases and 57 healthy control samples from an Austrian cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) for the comparative analysis. Using data sets from multiple countries, a meta-analysis was performed to identify global variations in the CRC microbiome. In order to control the variations arising due to uneven sequencing depths from other studies, we used a rarefied table for performing meta-analysis. We performed multivariate distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) with health status (CRC and healthy) and country (India, China, and Austria) as metainformation. The multivariate analysis was constrained using these two pieces of information, and the most important axes explaining maximum variations between samples were extracted. The projection shows all the CRC and healthy samples from the three countries, with country-/study-wide differences on the <italic>x</italic> axis and differences due to CRC status on the <italic>y</italic> axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.Â 4</xref>). It was observed that the Indian population differed significantly from the Austrian and Chinese cohorts (<italic>P</italic> value &lt; 10<sup>â15</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.Â 4</xref>). The Indian CRC samples showed marked differences in microbial composition and were separated from the other country samples, thus revealing the unique microbial community composition in Indian gut microbiomes. The MGS/CAGs that showed maximum contributions in driving the separation of Indian CRC samples included <named-content content-type="genus-species">Flavonifractor plautii</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Veillonella parvula</named-content>, and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Parabacteroides distasonis</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.Â 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Functional characterization of microbiome associated with CRC.</title>
<p>A metagenome-wide association analysis was performed to gain functional insights on the CRC-associated gut microbiome. Out of the total of 1.9 million genes, which were present in at least 5% of the samples, 228,299 genes were found to be significantly associated with the disease status (Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>q</italic>â&lt;â0.01). These CRC-associated genes were functionally annotated using the KEGG database. Using the stringent criteria of <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;0.01 and log odds ratio (LOR) of &gt;|2|, 473 KEGG orthologues (KOs) were found associated with health status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS6">TableÂ S6</xref>). The top-ranked enzymes (KOs) include invasins, multidrug resistance protein, and enzymes involved in secretion and the transport system, which points toward a pathogenic and invasive environment with high cross-talk between host and microbes. Specifically, the high abundance of invasins has also been associated with the colorectal cancer-associated gut microbiome in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), as they help the bacteria to gain entry into host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p>

<p>The pathways associated with CRC were identified using reporter feature analysis, which takes into consideration the significance and enrichment of all the genes present in the pathway. It was observed that out of the 12 pathways, âABC transportersâ (<italic>q</italic> value = 0.013) could pass the stringent cutoff being significantly enriched in CRC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS7">TableÂ S7</xref>). It was interesting that pathways related to the biosynthesis of six amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, lysine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and valine) out of the nine essential amino acids were observed to be significantly high in healthy controls compared to the CRC cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS7">TableÂ S7</xref>), suggesting depletion of essential amino acids in the gut microbiome of CRC individuals.</p>

<p>Further, to gain additional functional insights, we identified KEGG modules which were significantly associated with health status. For this, only those modules for which at least 90% of the moduleâs enzymes are present in the samples were considered, and these modules were also found associated with health status with a <italic>q</italic> value of &lt;0.001 (Wilcoxon rank sum test). Using these stringent criteria, a total of 46 modules could qualify, of which 12 modules were found higher in CRC cases than in the healthy controls. A module with the function of âCatechol ortho cleavageâ was observed to be significantly associated with the CRC cases. This module is involved in the degradation of catechols such as 3,4-dihydroxypheynlacetic acid, which are generated by degradation of flavonoids by the gut bacterium <named-content content-type="genus-species">Flavonifractor plautii</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). On performing the Spearman correlation between these 46 modules and the 20 taxonomic species selected above, the âCatechol ortho cleavageâ module was observed to correlate significantly (<italic>r</italic>â=â0.63, <italic>P</italic>â=â3.6 Ã 10<sup>â7</sup>) with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Flavonifractor plautii</named-content> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.Â S2</xref>).</p>

<title>Insights from comparative metabolomic profiling.</title>
<p>The principal-component analysis revealed marked variations in the metabolomic profiles of CRC and healthy individuals. These differences could be attributable to the host physiological changes and the microbial metabolism, which depends on the type of microbes inhabiting the gut. The first and the second principal components explained 71.55% and 10.66% of the total variations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.Â 5A</xref>), respectively. The peaks annotated to metabolites 4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvic acid, butanoic acid, valeric acid, <sc>l</sc>-valine, and cyclohexene were observed to be significantly enriched (<italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05; log fold change &lt; â2) in CRC individuals compared to the healthy group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.Â 5B</xref>). Among these, the higher level of 4-hydroxyphenyl derivates can be directly corrected with the flavonoid-metabolizing ability of the CRC microbiome, which is dominated by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Flavonifractor plautii</named-content> (formerly <named-content content-type="genus-species">Clostridium orbiscindens</named-content>), a microbe involved in the degradation of quercetin flavonoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). A higher abundance of compounds such as valerate, isovalerate, and isobutyrate (which are salts or esters of valeric acid and butanoic acid [butyric acid]) in CRC individuals has also been reported in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Taken together, these observations indicate significant differences in the metabolic profiles in CRC individuals compared to the healthy group, which correlates with the flavonoid-metabolizing ability of the CRC microbiome in the Indian patient cohort. However, detailed studies to gain insights on the functional contribution of respective microbes for production of these metabolites and their impact on host health are needed to confirm these results.</p>

<title>CRC gene biomarker discovery.</title>
<p>We divided our 60 samples into two sets, cohort A comprising 48 samples and cohort B comprising 12 samples, by random selection from the two locations and health status (see Materials and Methods). To identify potential CRC-associated biomarkers, a robust feature selection method was followed using the 102,168 health status-associated genes from the samples of cohort A. From these genes, we identified a subset that were highly correlated with each other (Pearson correlations Ï &gt; 0.9) and chose the longest gene from each correlated group to construct a statistically nonredundant set of 13,982 genes. Further, we used the âCfsSubsetEvalâ method from Weka to identify a subset of 36 genes that are highly correlated with the health status while having low intercorrelation with each other. The genes from this subset were further validated using the Boruta algorithm, which uses Random Forest to perform a top-down search for relevant features by comparing original attribute importance with importance achievable at random, and we eliminated irrelevant feature to stabilize the test. As a result, 33 out of 36 genes were confirmed as markers using this algorithm and 3 were predicted as tentative markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig.Â S3</xref>). The principal-component analysis using these 33 genes showed clear separation between CRC and healthy samples, and the first two principal components explained 40.5% variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.Â 6A</xref>), which is a significant improvement compared to the separation observed using raw data (11.4% variation explained using first two principal components [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.Â S1</xref>]). Most importantly, the first three principal components were observed to be significantly (adjusted <italic>P</italic> values: PC1â=â7.5âÃâ10<sup>â10</sup>, PC2â=â1.97âÃâ10<sup>â8</sup>, PC3â=â0.0005) associated only with the health status with the stringent <italic>P</italic> value cutoff less than 0.001 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">TableÂ 3</xref>). PERMANOVA showed that only CRC status explained the variation in the 33 marker gene abundances significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.19) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">TableÂ 4</xref>). These results suggest that the 33 gene markers identified using the approach are strongly associated with health status and not with any other covariate. Further, to evaluate the predictive power of these marker genes in predicting the CRC status, the Random Forest method was used, which resulted in the perfect classification of the two classes (area under receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve, area under the curve [AUC]â=â1) using 10-fold cross-validation. On performing the Spearman correlation of these 33 gene markers with the 20 taxonomic markers identified above, it was observed that the 16 genes enriched in CRC cases were highly correlated with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Flavonifractor plautii</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacteroides fragilis</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.Â 6B</xref>). These results further validates that these two species could play a role in Indian CRC samples.</p>

<title>Gene marker validation in independent metagenomic cohorts.</title>
<p>To test the accuracy and robustness of these gene markers, we evaluated the predictive power of these 33 genes on cohort B (6 CRC samples and 6 healthy samples) from this study and from a cohort with a different genetic background: 75 CRC samples and 53 healthy samples from China and 46 CRC samples and 57 healthy samples from Austria. The relative gene abundances of China and Austria data sets were constructed by mapping their genes on the Updated Gene Catalogue constructed in this study. On cohort B, the Random Forest (RF) model using the 33 genes resulted in an accuracy of 91.67% with 11 out of 12 samples being correctly predicted (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 83.33%). However, using the same gene markers on the Austria and China data sets resulted in lower average accuracy of 65.05% and 51.56%, respectively. A CRC index using the log relative abundances of the 33 gene markers was also calculated as mentioned in the study by Yu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The CRC index clearly separated the samples from the Indian population (CRC index patients = 4.04; CRC index healthy = â4.65) with a <italic>P</italic> value of 3 Ã 10<sup>â1.</sup> However, it could not significantly differentiate between the CRC cases and healthy controls for the other two populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig.Â 6C</xref>).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Recently, gut microbiome dysbiosis has emerged as a key factor that triggers an inflammatory response in the host and is proposed to lead to an initiation of colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). However, most of our understanding comes from developed countries with high incidences of CRC. India harbors a unique gut microbiome and also has one of the lowest incidences of CRC. Thus, we expected to find a distinct relationship between the gut microbiome and CRC in an Indian cohort. Our results showed a clear distinction between the healthy and CRC-associated gut microbiomes. We also identified multiple potential microbial taxonomic and gene biomarkers associated with CRC. While some of these biomarkers have been reported in other global populations, others were unique to our cohort. Therefore, our study is one of the first to emphasize the importance of utilizing population-specific microbiome biomarkers in studies of CRC.</p>
<p>Interestingly, gut microbiome diversity was higher in Indian CRC samples than in healthy controls. A similar observation was made in Austrian CRC cases, which showed an increased microbiome diversity; however, reduced microbial diversity was observed in a Chinese cohort, pointing toward a contrasting trend, perhaps due to population-specific variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The higher diversity in the Indian CRC microbiome can be explained by the fact that the Indian gut microbiome is highly skewed, with most (30% to 75%) of the community dominated by <italic>Prevotella</italic>, as observed in our recent study that examined the gut microbiome in a cohort of 110 Indian individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In this study, we observed a much lower proportion of <italic>Prevotella</italic> in CRC samples (12.7%) than in the healthy samples (45.31%). Thus, the apparent â¼3.5-fold reduction in this most predominant taxon in CRC patients is likely to result in an increased diversity due to more opportunities for other bacterial taxa to flourish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Another consequence of this dysbiosis appears to be the reduction in pathways related to the biosynthesis of six essential amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, lysine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and valine) out of the nine essential amino acids in CRC cases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS6">TableÂ S6</xref> in the supplemental material), which makes it tempting to speculate on a dysbiosis-mediated mechanism of CRC in the Indian population.</p>
<p>The most interesting key finding of this study was the identification of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Flavonifractor plautii</named-content> as the key bacterium associated with CRC, which also emerged as one of the 20 taxonomic markers identified using three different strategies. Though its presence in the gut microbiome is not unique to India, and it was present in other CRC data sets (used in this study), it showed a differential abundance only in the CRC gut microbiome of the Indian cohort. In addition to being significantly abundant, it also emerged as the most important species in separating CRC samples from healthy samples in the Indian cohort. Also, the high correlation of <italic>F. plautii</italic> with the 16 CRC-associated gene markers highlights it as a potential key species in the CRC-associated Indian gut microbiome. Among other species that showed a strong association with CRC, the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacteroides intestinalis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Methanobrevibacter smithii</named-content> species were observed to be associated with Indian CRC cases and were not previously reported in other CRC microbiome studies<italic>. B. intestinalis</italic> is a gut commensal bacterium known to convert primary bile acids to secondary bile acids via deconjugation and dehydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). These secondary bile acids may have carcinogenic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). <italic>M. smithii</italic> is a methanogenic archaeon and a dominant methanogen in the distal colon of both healthy and diseased individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). To date, no direct mechanistic link has been established between gut-associated diseases and methanogens; however, colonization by archaea has been suggested to promote a number of gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases such as colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>F. plautii</italic> can degrade flavonoids by cleaving the C-ring of the flavonoid molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Flavonoids are important constituents of the human diet and are mainly comprised of polyphenolic secondary metabolites with broad-spectrum pharmacological activities. Accumulating evidence from epidemiological, preclinical, and clinical studies supports a role of these polyphenols in the prevention of cancer, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cognitive dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Flavonoids are proposed to affect the composition of the gut microbiota and could therapeutically target the intestinal microbiome by promoting beneficial bacteria and inhibiting potentially pathogenic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Several common Indian foods such as tea, coffee, apple, guava, <italic>Terminalia</italic> bark, fenugreek seeds, mustard seeds, cinnamon, red chili powder, cloves, turmeric, and pulses contain large amounts of flavonoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Medium levels (50 to 100âmg) are found in Indian gooseberry, omum, cumin, cardamom, betel leaf, and brandy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Small but significant amounts are also present in food items of high consumption such as kidney beans, soybeans, grapes, ginger, coriander powder, millets, and brinjal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Given the significance of flavonoids, the high consumption of beneficial flavonoids in the Indian diet has been correlated with low rates of CRC occurrence in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).</p>
<p>However, extensive degradation of flavonoids by gut microflora may result in lower overall bioavailability of intact flavonoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Thus, in the Indian CRC samples it is reasonable to associate the high abundance of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Flavonifractor plautii</named-content>, a key flavonoid-degrading bacterium, with higher rates of flavonoid degradation that minimizes the potential beneficial effects and bioavailability of flavonoids in CRC. Further, the high association of <italic>F. plautii</italic> with the catechol cleavage pathway (catechols are generated by degradation of flavonoids) also indicates a potential role of this species in flavonoid degradation in the gut. In addition, the enzyme enoate reductase, which performs the first step of flavonoid degradation, was also found to be significantly abundant in CRC cases compared to healthy samples (Wilcoxon rank sum test; <italic>P</italic> value = 0.045). Taken together, these observations underscore a potential role of this bacterium in degradation of flavonoids in CRC cases.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Fusobacterium nucleatum</named-content> has been associated with the CRC microbiome in the past in the major studies from other populations. The meta-analysis performed in this study also found <named-content content-type="genus-species">F. nucleatum</named-content> as the top bacterium in the global CRC-associated microbiome studies. However, this bacterium was not present in the list of the 20 taxonomic markers identified in this study. Although its abundance was significantly higher in CRC cases than in healthy controls, the proportional abundance was below the minimum abundance criterion (&gt;0.1%) selected in this study, and hence, it was not included in the list of taxonomic markers. Further, its presence was almost negligible (0.05%) in the Indian samples in comparison to its basal levels in Austrian and Chinese CRC data sets. Hence, it could not appear as a taxonomic marker for Indian CRC samples.</p>
<p>The results of the study also have translational applications in CRC diagnosis. Survival rates in CRC are reported to increase if the cancer is diagnosed and treated at an early stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). The standard colonoscopy method used to diagnose CRC is invasive and also expensive, due to which many high-risk individuals are not screened at their initial stages of cancer. The available noninvasive tests, such as the fecal occult blood test, fecal immunochemical test, and DNA-based Cologuard test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), lack sensitivity and detection of early-stage disease, may provide false-positive results, and also need confirmation due to nonspecific diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Similarly, the molecular subtyping method which is commonly used in cancer research, where cancer subclasses are based on clinically relevant gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), does not show clear results in CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Thus, the apparent limitations in the diagnosis of CRC prompt the need for the development of alternative diagnosis methods such as the microbial biomarkers identified in this study and other similar previous studies. The 33 potential gene markers associated with the Indian microbiome samples and their high accuracy (91.67%) in classifying Indian CRC samples from the healthy samples provide a proof of concept for the development of an affordable diagnostic test using fecal microbial gene markers. However, due to the lack of a significant number of samples to represent each of the four stages of CRC, a correlation analysis of the 33 gene markers with the stage of the cancer could not be performed in this study, which would be helpful to identify the early-stage CRC markers. In addition, the robustness of these candidate markers should be further validated on other Indian cohorts with larger numbers of samples and on similar cohorts in other populations, which is presently a limitation of this study and provides impetus for further studies.</p>

<title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<sec id="s4.1">
<title>Cohort design and subject enrollment.</title>
<p>A considerable sample size consisting of 60 samples (30 cases and 30 controls) was recruited from two different locations (Bhopal and Kerala) in India. For constructing a balanced data set, 15 cases and 15 controls were selected from both the locations. The two selected locations represent different geographies (2,000âkm apart) and lifestyles in order to remove the confounding effect of diet and making the observations generalizable for the Indian cohort. Bhopal is a city located in central India and is populated with people from all over the country; hence, samples from here can act as a proxy to represent the diversity of the country. Samples from Kerala were specifically chosen because, among all the other states of India, Kerala has the highest rate of colorectal cancer incidence. The fecal samples were collected only from CRC cases, and those from healthy subjects were taken from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Each fecal sample was collected and immediately transported to the lab at 4Â°C for further processing. Diagnosis of all the cases was carried out by experienced oncologists at the hospitals through biopsy and colonoscopy. The study exclusion criteria for patients were any previously diagnosed serious medical conditions and recent use of antibiotics, to avoid the effect of confounding factors. Patients with incomplete medical information were also removed from the selected set. Fecal samples were collected prior to colonoscopy in sterile containers.</p>

<title>Fecal metagenomic DNA extraction.</title>
<p>Metagenomic DNA was isolated from all the fecal samples using the QIAamp stool minikit (Qiagen, CA, USA) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. DNA concentration was estimated by the Qubit HS double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) assay kit (Invitrogen, CA, USA), and quality was estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis. All the DNA samples were stored at â80Â°C until sequencing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4.3">
<title>Shotgun metagenome sequencing.</title>
<p>The extracted metagenomic DNA was used to prepare the sequencing libraries using the Illumina Nextera XT sample preparation kit (Illumina Inc., USA) by following the manufacturerâs protocol. The sizes of all the libraries were assessed on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the Agilent high-sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and were quantified on a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer using the Qubit HS dsDNA kit (Life Technologies, USA) and by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using Kapa SYBR Fast qPCR master mix and Illumina standards and primer premix (Kapa Biosystems, MA, USA) according to the Illumina suggested protocol. The shotgun metagenomic libraries were loaded on an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform using the NextSeq 500/550 v2 sequencing reagent kit (Illumina Inc., USA), and 150-bp paired-end sequencing was performed at the Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Facility, IISER, Bhopal, India.</p>

<sec id="s4.4">
<title>Preprocessing of the metagenomic reads.</title>
<p>A total of 150 Gbp of metagenomic sequence data (mean = 1.36âGb) was generated from 60 fecal samples. The metagenomic reads were filtered using the NGSQC (v2.3.3) toolkit with a cutoff of <italic>q</italic> of â¥20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). The high-quality reads were further filtered to remove the host-origin reads (human contamination) from bacterial metagenomic reads, which resulted in the removal of an average of 1% of reads. The reads from each sample were assembled into contigs at a k-mer size of 63âbp using SOAPdenovo (v2.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). The singletons resulting from each sample were pooled, and <italic>de novo</italic> assembly was repeated on the combined set of singleton reads from all samples. The open reading frames (ORFs) from each contig (length of â¥300âbp) were predicted using MetaGeneMark (v3.38) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Pairwise alignment of genes was performed using BLAT (v2.7.6), and the genes which had an identity of â¥95% and alignment coverage of â¥90% were clustered into a single set of nonredundant genes, from which the longest gene was selected as the representative ORF to construct the nonredundant gene catalogue.</p>
<p>The Integrated Gene Catalogue (IGC), which represents 1,297 human gut metagenomic samples comprising HMP, MetaHIT and Chinese data sets, was retrieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). The gene catalogue constructed from Indian samples was combined with the IGC to construct a nonredundant gene catalogue (using â¥95% identity and â¥90% alignment coverage) and is referred to as âupdated IGCâ in the subsequent analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4.5">
<title>Quantification of gene content.</title>
<p>The quantification of gene content was carried out using the strategy performed by Qin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>) in which the high-quality reads were aligned against the updated IGC using SOAP2 (v2.21) in the SOAP aligner with an identity cutoff of â¥90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Two types of alignments were considered for sequence-based profiling: (i) the entire paired-end read mapped to the gene and (ii) one end of the paired-end read mapped to a gene and other end remained unmapped. In both cases, the mapped read was counted as one copy. Further, the read count was normalized based on length of the gene as <italic>b<sub>i</sub></italic> = <italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic>/<italic>L<sub>i</sub></italic>.</p>
<p>The relative abundance of a gene within the sample was calculated as follows:<disp-formula id="uFD1"><alternatives><graphic orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="mSystems.00438-19-m0001.jpg"></graphic><mml:math id="um1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" mathsize="140%"><mml:mo>â</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mo>â</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">bj</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" mathsize="140%"><mml:mo>â</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mo>â</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">xj</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">Lj</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></disp-formula>where <italic>a<sub>i</sub></italic> is relative abundance of gene in sample <italic>S</italic>, <italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic> is number of times that gene <italic>i</italic> was detected in sample <italic>S</italic> (the number of mapped reads), <italic>L<sub>i</sub></italic> is length of gene <italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic> is all the genes, and <italic>b<sub>i</sub></italic> is copy number of gene <italic>i</italic> in sequenced data from sample <italic>S</italic>.</p>

<title>Construction of updated gene catalogue for gut profiling.</title>
<p>To construct the gene catalogue for gut microbiome profiling, the high-quality sequencing reads were subjected to a de Bruijn graph-based assembly which resulted in 2,143,541 contigs of &gt;300âbp in length with a total contig length of 1.52âGb. To capture low-coverage genomic regions or low-abundance genomes, all unassembled reads were extracted and combined with the singletons from each sample to further assemble into an additional 1.2 million contigs (&gt;300 bp) with a total assembled length of 0.76âGb. The gene prediction on all assembled contigs resulted in 4,591,809 genes, out of which 2,36,4248 genes were nonredundant and which represents the gene catalogue of the Indian population. We incorporated these genes to update the currently available Integrated Gene Catalogue (IGC), which contained 9.8 million genes from 1,267 gut metagenomes from three continents (Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">â</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], and China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]), as it lacked information on genes specific to the Indian population. The Updated Gene Catalogue (UGC) comprised 11,118,467 genes (an addition of 12.5% genes in the current IGC) with 1,238,571 genes unique to the Indian population.</p>
<p>On this updated gene catalogue, reads from each sample were mapped and the genes present in the Indian population were identified. On average, 54.47%âÂ±â7.84% (average Â± SD) of high-quality reads mapped from each sample to UGC and resulted in the identification of 3.8 million genes present in the Indian cohort. Taxonomic assignment and functional annotation were performed for these 3.8 million genes present using 4,097 reference genomes (HMP and NCBI species) and KEGG and eggNOG databases. A total of 2.41 million genes (62.9%) could be successfully assigned a taxonomy at genus level. The remaining genes are expected to be from currently unidentified microbial species. At the functional level, 8,312 KEGG orthologues and 59,303 eggNOG orthologue groups were identified in the updated gene catalogue. Additionally, 24% of the genes which were not mapped to the orthologue groups could be clustered into 649 novel gene families, which did not have any assigned function but were still included in the analysis as novel eggNOG groups.</p>

<title>Diversity and rarefaction analysis.</title>
<p>Estimation of total gene richness, Î±-diversity (within-sample diversity), and Î²-diversity (between-sample diversity) in the set of 60 metagenomic samples was performed by randomized sampling and replacement, and estimates were compared to a different group of samples. Rarefied matrices were obtained by rarefying at 6 million reads per sample. In total, we performed 10 repetitions, and in each of these, we measured richness, Î±-diversity (by using the Shannon index), and Î²-diversity (by using Bray-Curtis distance) for each sample. The median values were taken as the respective measurement for each sample. Intersample distances were calculated using the Bray-Curtis distance matrices. The significance of the association with health status was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.</p>

<sec id="s4.8">
<title>Phylogenetic assignment of reads.</title>
<p>A total of 4,097 reference microbial genomes were obtained from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) on 5 December 2015. The databases were independently indexed into two Bowtie indexes using Bowtie 2 (v2.3.4.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). The metagenomic reads were aligned to the reference microbial genomes using Bowtie 2. The mapped reads from the two indexes were merged by selecting the alignment having the higher identity (â¥90% identity). The percent identity was calculated using the formula: % identity = 100 Ã (matches/total aligned length). The normalized abundance of a microbial genome was calculated by summing the total number of reads aligned to its reference genome, normalized by the genome length and the total number of reads in the data set. For reads showing hits to the two indexed databases with equal identity, each genome was assigned an 0.5 read count. The relative abundance of each genome was calculated by adding the normalized abundance of each genome divided by the total abundance. The Calinski-Harabasz index (CHI) was used to calculate the variance between the clusters compared to the variance within clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). A clade-specific-marker-based taxonomic assignment of reads was also done using the mOTUs (v2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>) approach and Metaphlan (v2.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>).</p>

<title>Construction of metagenomic species for MGWAS.</title>
<p>The gene cohort and its abundance from 291 samples belonging to India (60), Austria (103), and China (128) were combined and used for determining MGS/CAGs. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) cutoff of â¥0.9 was used for considering association between genes, and only genes having an abundance of &gt;0 in at least 30 samples were considered for association analysis. Furthermore, the genes for which â¥90% abundance was obtained from a single sample were discarded. To determine the taxonomic origin of each MGS/CAG (metagenomic cluster), all the genes were aligned against reference microbial genomes of 4,097 genomes from HMP and NCBI at nucleotide level using BLASTN. The alignment hits were filtered using an E value of â¤10<sup>â6</sup> and alignment coverage of â¥80% of the gene length, and 2,687,688 genes showed alignments against the reference genomes. The remaining genes were aligned against the UNIREF database (UniRef50) at protein sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). The multiple best hits with equal identity and scores were further assigned taxonomy based on the lowest common ancestor (LCA) method. The genes were finally assigned to taxa based on comprehensive parameters of sequence similarity across phylogenetic ranks as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). The identity threshold of â¥95% was used for assignment up to species level, â¥85% identity threshold was used for assignment up to genus level, and â¥65% identity was used for phylum-level assignment using BLASTN. The taxonomic assignments of MGS/CAGs were performed with the criterion that â¥50% of genes in each MGS should map to the same lowest phylogenetic group. So, if a particular species is assigned â¥50% genes out of the total, the assignment will be carried out at species level rather than at the level of genus or higher orders. The relative abundance of MGS/CAGs in each sample was estimated by using relative abundance values of all genes from that MGS/CAG. A Poisson distribution was fitted to the relative abundance values of the data. The mean estimated from Poisson distribution was assigned as the relative abundance of that MGS. The profiles of MGS/CAGs were generated and used for further analysis. The MGS/CAGs associated with CRC in the Indian population were scored using log odds ratio, and <italic>P</italic> values were calculated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test between CRC and healthy individuals. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was adjusted for multiple comparisons using false-discovery rate (FDR) adjustment. The MGS having <italic>P</italic> values of &lt;0.05 and log odds ratio of &gt;2 (CRC) or â¤2 (healthy) were considered enriched in CRC or healthy groups, respectively.</p>

<title>Fecal metabolomic sample preparation and derivatization.</title>
<p>In order to identify the metabolic potential of microbes, metabolomics profiling of a subset of individuals (<italic>n</italic>â=â18; CRC patients = 9, healthy = 9) was performed. Lyophilized fecal samples were used to achieve better metabolite coverage, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).

To remove the residual water molecules from the samples, 100âÎ¼l of toluene was added to the dry residue and evaporated completely at 50Â°C under nitrogen gas. The extracted metabolites were first derivatized with 50âÎ¼l of methoxyamine hydrochloride (MOX) in pyridine (20âmg/ml) at 60Â°C for 2âh, and the second derivatization was performed with 100âÎ¼l of <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<italic>N</italic>-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) in 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) at 60Â°C for 45âmin to form trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives. Finally, 150âÎ¼l of the TMS derivatives was transferred into a GC glass vial insert and subjected to GC-time of flight MS (TOFMS) analysis.</p>

<title>GC-MS analysis.</title>
<p>GC-MS was performed on an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph with a 5975âC MS system. An HP-5 (25-mâbyâ320-Î¼m by 0.25-Î¼m-inside-diameter [i.d.]) fused silica capillary column (Agilent J&amp;W Scientific, Folsom, CA) was used with the open split interface. The injector, transfer line, and ion source temperatures were maintained at 220, 220, and 250Â°C, respectively. Oven temperature was programmed at 70Â°C for 0.2âmin and increased at 10Â°C/min to 270Â°C, where it was sustained for 5âmin, and further increased at 40Â°C/min to 310Â°C, where it was held for 11 min. The MS was operated in the electron impact ionization mode at 70âeV. Mass data were acquired in full scan mode from <italic>m/z</italic> 40 to 600 with an acquisition rate of 20 spectra per second. To detect retention time shifts and enable Kovats retention index (RI) calculation, a standard alkane series mixture (C<sub>10</sub> to C<sub>40</sub>) was injected periodically during the sample analysis. RIs are relative retention times normalized to <italic>n</italic>-alkanes eluted adjacently. The injector port temperature was held at 250Â°C, and the helium gas flow rate was set to 1âml/min at an initial oven temperature of 50Â°C. The oven temperature was increased at 10Â°C/min to 310Â°C for 11âmin, and mass data were acquired in full scan mode from <italic>m/z</italic> 40 to 600 with an acquisition rate of 20 spectra per second.</p>

<sec id="s4.12">
<title>Metabolomic analysis.</title>
<p>The raw peaks were processed for peak identification and alignment using the XCMS package in R. Initially, prior to alignment the parameters used for peak picking and retention time correction were optimized using the IPO package in R. The package using iterative modes and a range of values optimizes the best parameter settings for the GC-MS experiment. Using the centwave algorithm, the peaks were detected from 18 samples and were further corrected for retention time corrections using a âbinwidthâ of 1. The parameters optimized for preprocessing of the peaks from the GC-MS experiment are as follows: minimum peak widthâ=â3, maximum peak widthâ=â18.75, parts per million [ppm]â=â575, difference in <italic>m/z</italic> valuesâ=â0.004588, signal-to-noise ratio [S/N] thresholdâ=â10, bin width sizeâ=â1. The peaks were annotated using NIST/Massbank databases.</p>
<p>The most prominent features of the GC-MS data which could be annotated were used for differential analysis. In total, 234 features that were well annotated and showed prominent peaks were used. The differential analysis of peaks was performed using the MetaboDiff package in R. The concentrations of fecal metabolites in CRC and healthy subjects were quantified from peak intensities and were further normalized.</p>

<title>Meta-analysis.</title>
<p>In order to define a non-reference-based approach of assigning genetic markers to a particular condition (CRC in this case), we used the MGWAS approach, which uses correlations among genes to generate clusters of genes. Various methods have been described for clustering genes in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). We here used a recently published method of determining clusters of genes using MGS-canopy-based correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). The approach uses a matrix of gene abundance across samples and the correlation coefficient cutoffs used to identify fine-grained clusters of genes belonging to single species or closely related species.</p>
<p>The gene cohort and its abundance from 291 samples belonging to India (60), Austria (103), and China (129) were combined and used for determining MGS/CAGs. The PCC cutoff of â¥0.9 was used for considering association between genes, and only genes having an abundance of &gt;0 in at least 30 samples were considered for association analysis. Furthermore, the genes for which â¥90% abundance was obtained from a single sample were discarded. To determine the taxonomic origin of each MGS/CAG (metagenomic cluster), all the genes were aligned against reference microbial genomes of 4,097 genomes from HMP and NCBI at nucleotide level using BLASTN. The alignment hits were filtered using an E value of â¤10<sup>â6</sup> and alignment coverage of â¥80% of the gene length, and 2,687,688 genes showed alignments against the reference genomes. The remaining genes were aligned against the UNIREF database (UniRef50) at protein sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). The multiple best hits with equal identity and scores were further assigned taxonomy based on the lowest common ancestor (LCA) method. The genes were finally assigned to taxa based on comprehensive parameters of sequence similarity across phylogenetic ranks as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). The identity threshold of â¥95% was used for assignment up to species level, an â¥85% identity threshold was used for assignment up to genus level, and â¥65% identity was used for phylum-level assignment using BLASTN. The taxonomic assignments of MGS/CAGs were performed with the criteria that â¥50% of genes in each MGS should map to the same lowest phylogenetic group. So, if a particular species is assigned â¥50% genes out of the total, the assignment will be carried out at species level rather than at the level of genus or higher orders. The relative abundance of MGS/CAGs in each sample was estimated by using relative abundance values of all genes from that MGS/CAG. A Poisson distribution was fitted to the relative abundance values of the data. The mean estimated from Poisson distribution was assigned as the relative abundance of that MGS. The profiles of MGS/CAGs were generated and used for further analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4.14">
<title>Global comparative analysis.</title>
<p>The MGS/CAG abundance table was rarefied for 100 times at a lowest sequencing depth of 220,000 sequences/sample. The average of these rarefied counts from 100 iterations was calculated and used for further analysis. The principal-component analysis was performed on the MGS abundance table, and the components were correlated with covariates (country and status) using polyserial correlation. PCA with polyserial correlations showed countrywide variations as a major factor correlated with PC1.</p>
<p>Since variations between countries were higher than those between CRC patients, we performed multivariate analysis distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA). Canberra distances were selected based on the highest rank index for performing db-RDA. The metainformation used was the status (CRC/healthy) and country/study from which the data set came (India, China, and Austria). The Bray-Curtis distances were used for constrained ordinations and were constrained for country and status. The function âcapscaleâ was used for performing ordinations with country and status separately, and the ordinations were plotted on a PCA plot.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4.15">
<title>Identifying global taxonomic patterns.</title>
<p>In order to identify global CRC MGS/CAG, we performed univariate testing for differential abundance of MGS/CAG. Since countries and populations are stratified and have variations between them, we controlled for population variations by applying block. The independence test was performed using ytrafo = rank for Wilcoxon rank sum test and teststat = âscalarâ using the COIN package in R. The population variations were controlled, and differential abundances of MGS/CAGs were calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4.16">
<title>Gene biomarker identification.</title>
<p>For gene biomarker identification, the 60 samples were divided into two cohorts: cohort A and cohort B. Cohort A comprised 48 samples and cohort B comprised 12 samples, by randomly selecting from each location and health status. Using the samples of cohort A, a group of genes that were highly correlated with each other (Pearson correlation Ï &gt; 0.9) were identified, and the longest gene from each correlated group was used to construct a statistically nonredundant set. Further, we used the âCfsSubsetEvalâ method from Weka to identify a subset of genes that are highly correlated with the health status while having low intercorrelation with each other. The genes from this subset were further validated using the Boruta algorithm, which uses Random Forest to perform a top-down search for relevant features by comparing original attribute importance with importance achievable at random and eliminates irrelevant features to stabilize the test. To test the accuracy of these markers, a Random Forest model was constructed using these genes and was used for making the prediction on samples from cohort B.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4.17">
<title>CRC index.</title>
<p>To compare the performances of markers, we computed a CRC index, as defined by Yu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), for each of the individuals on the basis of 33 gene markers identified using the methodology mentioned above.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4.18">
<title>Supervised learning.</title>
<p>Predictive models were built using supervised machine learning algorithm Random Forest (RF). The models were optimized using 10,000 trees and default settings of mtry (number for variables used to build the model). The mean 3-fold cross-validation error rates were calculated for each of the binary trees and the ensemble of trees. The mean decrease in accuracy, which is the increase in error rates on leaving the variable out, was calculated for each prediction and tree and was used to estimate the importance score. The variables showing a higher mean decrease in accuracy of prediction were considered important for the segregation of the data sets into groups based on the categorical variable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4.19">
<title>Network plot.</title>
<p>In order to derive associations between microbial markers, a species cooccurrence network was generated from pairwise correlations using sparCC, which takes into account the compositional data and estimates the correlations between species. The species associations with correlation coefficients of &gt;0.3 were considered for construction of networks and inferring associations among species.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4.20">
<title>Statistical analysis.</title>
<p>All the statistical comparisons between groups were performed using a nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test with FDR-adjusted <italic>P</italic> values to control for multiple comparisons. The correlations between two variables and the correlations within the variable were calculated using Spearmanâs correlation coefficient with adjusted <italic>P</italic> values. The correlations between categorical and numeric variables were performed using polyserial correlation/biserial correlations. To identify the enrichment of enzymes/species associated with a host, odds ratio was used as a measure of the enrichment of an enzyme in a host. The odds ratio was calculated as OR (<italic>k</italic>) = [â<italic><sub>S</sub></italic><sub>â=âLOC1</sub>
<italic>A<sub>Sk</sub></italic>/â<italic><sub>S</sub></italic><sub>â=âLOC1</sub> (â<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>
<sub>â </sub>
<italic><sub>k</sub> A<sub>Si</sub></italic>)]/[â<italic><sub>S</sub></italic><sub>â=âLOC2</sub>
<italic>A<sub>Sk</sub></italic>/â<italic><sub>S</sub></italic><sub>â=âLOC2</sub> (â<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>
<sub>â </sub>
<italic><sub>k</sub> A<sub>Si</sub></italic>)], where <italic>A<sub>Sk</sub></italic> denotes abundance of enzyme <italic>k</italic> in sample <italic>S</italic>. Apart from that, the Reporter features algorithm was used for gene-set analysis of significant pathways associated with different groups of samples. The algorithm takes the adjusted <italic>P</italic> values and fold changes (log odds ratio) as input for each KO. The gene statistic is calculated based on the significant association of KO and its direction of change through which the pathway is scored by calculating the global <italic>P</italic> value. All the graphs and plots were generated using the ggplot2 package in R.</p>
