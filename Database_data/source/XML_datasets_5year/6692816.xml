<abstract>
<p>Genetic factors have been postulated to be involved in the etiology of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), but their identity remains mostly unknown. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic search for genetic variants influencing DPN risk using two well-characterized cohorts. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) testing 6.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms was conducted among participants of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) clinical trial. Included were 4,384 white case patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prevalent or incident DPN (defined as a Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument clinical examination score &gt;2.0) and 784 white control subjects with T2D and no evidence of DPN at baseline or during follow-up. Replication of significant loci was sought among white subjects with T2D (791 DPN-positive case subjects and 158 DPN-negative control subjects) from the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation in Type 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D) trial. Association between significant variants and gene expression in peripheral nerves was evaluated in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database. A cluster of 28 SNPs on chromosome 2q24 reached GWAS significance (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>) in ACCORD. The minor allele of the lead SNP (rs13417783, minor allele frequency = 0.14) decreased DPN odds by 36% (odds ratio [OR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.55–0.74, <italic>P</italic> = 1.9 × 10<sup>−9</sup>). This effect was not influenced by ACCORD treatment assignments (<italic>P</italic> for interaction = 0.6) or mediated by an association with known DPN risk factors. This locus was successfully validated in BARI 2D (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.42–0.80, <italic>P</italic> = 9 × 10<sup>−4</sup>; summary <italic>P</italic> = 7.9 × 10<sup>−12</sup>). In GTEx, the minor, protective allele at this locus was associated with higher tibial nerve expression of an adjacent gene (<italic>SCN2A</italic>) coding for human voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2 (<italic>P</italic> = 9 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). To conclude, we have identified and successfully validated a previously unknown locus with a powerful protective effect on the development of DPN in T2D. These results may provide novel insights into DPN pathogenesis and point to a potential target for novel interventions.</p>

<body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)—the most common cause of neuropathy worldwide—is a frequent complication of diabetes that significantly contributes to the increased morbidity and mortality associated with this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Up to one-fourth of the annual U.S. expenditure on diabetes is due to DPN, a large proportion of which is secondary to type 2 diabetes (T2D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The most common presentation of DPN is a distal symmetric polyneuropathy resulting from small and large fiber dysfunction leading to loss of sensory, proprioception, temperature, and pain discrimination, along with symptoms of numbness, tingling, burning, and shooting pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Signs and symptoms begin distally and spread proximally.</p><p>Known risk factors for DPN include duration and severity of hyperglycemia, age, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, height, and smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Because these exposures fail to fully explain interindividual differences in the risk of developing DPN, genetic factors have been postulated to be involved in the etiology of DPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), although formal heritability estimates, such as those available for other diabetic complications, including cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (narrow-sense heritability up to 39%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), are not available for DPN. Knowledge of the genetic factors that modulate DPN risk may provide insights into the molecular pathways linking the diabetic milieu to nerve damage, which may in turn suggest new pharmacological targets for preventing or treating DPN. However, although many genetic studies have been performed for other diabetic complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), data on the genetic determinants of DPN are scant. A few candidate gene studies have been performed, but these were small and not followed by replication attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). A locus on chromosome 8p21.3 was recently found to be associated with painful DPN in a genome-wide association study (GWAS), but this finding did not reach genome-wide significance and is still to be replicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Here we report the results of a GWAS for DPN conducted among participants with T2D in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) clinical trial. Our findings, which were replicated in the population of the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D) trial, point to a locus on chromosome 2q24 as a powerful determinant of DPN risk that may act by affecting a nearby voltage-gated sodium channel, NaV1.2, expressed in peripheral nerves. This is the first GWAS of DPN yielding a genome-wide significant signal with independent replication and biological plausibility of the leading candidate gene in the associated region.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study Population</title><sec id="s4"><title>Discovery Set: ACCORD Study</title><p>The ACCORD clinical trial investigated whether cardiovascular event rates could be reduced by intensively targeting hyperglycemia to HbA<sub>1c</sub> &lt;6.0% (42 mmol/mol) compared with a standard target of HbA<sub>1c</sub> between 7 and 7.9% (53–63 mmol/mol). For this purpose, 10,251 participants with T2D and high cardiovascular risk were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive intensive or standard glycemic control therapy at 77 clinical sites across the U.S. and Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The study also investigated the effect of intensive versus standard blood pressure control and fibrate versus placebo therapy on cardiovascular events through the ACCORD blood pressure and lipid subtrials in a double two-by-two factorial design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In addition, ACCORD had a rich follow-up of study participants and collected data on other diabetic complications, including DPN, at baseline and during follow-up. Of the 10,251 ACCORD participants, 8,174 consented to genetic studies. To minimize confounding by race, our GWAS for discovery of genetic predictors of DPN was restricted to 5,360 whites. Among them, DPN data were collected from 5,168 participants at baseline and/or during follow-up by means the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) clinical examination score.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Validation Set: BARI 2D Study</title><p>BARI 2D was a two-by-two factorial clinical trial enrolling 2,368 participants with T2D and established coronary artery disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). For glycemic control, participants were randomly assigned to insulin sensitization or insulin provision strategy to reach the same HbA<sub>1c</sub> target of &lt;7.0% (53 mmol/mol). For coronary artery disease, participants were randomly assigned to undergo coronary revascularization procedures (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery) or medical therapy. The aim was to investigate the cardiovascular event reduction by both treatment strategies. As in ACCORD, other secondary outcomes were obtained in BARI 2D, including DPN, which was evaluated with the same MNSI clinical examination score at baseline and follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). A total of 1,030 whites consented to genetic studies in BARI 2D; 949 had genetic data that passed internal quality control (QC) and also had information about the presence of DPN at baseline and follow-up. Because participants were recruited in the two studies during the same time period (January–June 2001 and February 2003–October 2005 for ACCORD, and January 2001–March 2005 for BARI 2D) and both studies upheld participation in another clinical trial as an exclusion criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), the chances of a person being included in both studies were deemed to be negligible.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Outcome Definition</title><p>The ACCORD and BARI 2D trials both defined neuropathy as an MNSI clinical examination score &gt;2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>)—a criterion that has been extensively validated as being highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of DPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The MNSI clinical examination includes a focused examination of the feet to assess skin and structural abnormalities, along with assessment of distal vibration perception with a 128-Hz tuning fork and ankle reflexes. For the purpose of the genetic association study, DPN case subjects were defined as participants having an MNSI &gt;2.0 at study entry and/or at any time during follow-up (4.9 and 5.3 years on average in ACCORD and BARI 2D, respectively), whereas DPN control subjects were defined as participants having an MNSI ≤2.0 at study entry and for the entire duration of follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>DNA Extraction and Genotyping</title><sec id="s8"><title>Discovery Set: ACCORD Study</title><p>Detailed DNA extraction, genotyping, QC methods, and imputation in ACCORD can be found in the supplementary material of the article in which the GWAS was first reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In brief, genotyping was performed in two centers using different platforms and chips: 6,085 DNA samples (ACCORD UVA Set) were genotyped at the University of Virginia (UVA) on Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome-8 (v1.0) chips containing 951,117 SNPs; 8,174 samples (ACCORD UNC Set) were genotyped at the University of North Carolina (UNC), on Affymetrix Axiom Biobank1 chips containing 628,679 probes. The ACCORD UVA set included subjects who had given consent to genetic studies by any investigator; the ACCORD UNC included the subjects in the ACCORD UVA set plus those who had given consent only to studies by ACCORD investigators. After extensive QC of the individual genotyping sets and harmonization of genotypes for those samples and SNPs that were in common between the two genotyping sets, data were organized in two nonoverlapping data sets: ANYSET (<italic>n</italic> = 5,971), including subjects from the ACCORD UVA set, genotyped at either UVA or UNC at a total of 1,263,585 individual SNPs, and ACCSET (<italic>n</italic> = 2,113), including subjects from the ACCORD UNC set minus those in the ACCORD UVA set, genotyped only at UNC at a total of 572,192 SNPs. Imputation was conducted independently in the ANYSET and ACCSET data sets by means of IMPUTEv2.3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) using the full 1000 Genomes Phase 3 (October 2014) panel as the reference. After discarding imputed SNPs with an information content &lt;0.3, the total (genotyped + imputed) SNPs were 25,017,489 in ANYSET and 25,012,865 in ACCSET.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Validation Set: BARI 2D Study</title><p>DNA was isolated and purified from whole blood using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA purification kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).

GWAS analyses were conducted separately in ACCSET (3,554 case subjects/830 control subjects) and ANYSET (600 case subjects/184 control subjects) using SAS 9.4 software on the Harvard Medical School computing cluster, Orchestra. After filtration for minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥5%, 6,847,206 genotyped or imputed SNPs formed the GWAS panel in each data set. For each common variant, minor allele dosage (ranging from 0 to 2) was inferred from the genotypes or computed from the imputed posterior probabilities. The association between minor allele dosage of each variant and DPN was tested by logistic regression, assuming an additive genetic model and adjusting for assignment to interventions, seven clinical center networks, and top three principal components (PC1–PC3). After using genomic control corrections (λ = 1.014 for ANYSET and λ = 1.032 for ACCSET), the GWAS results from the ACCSET and ANYSET sets were meta-analyzed in METAL (Abecasis Laboratory, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), through a fixed-effects inverse-variance approach. Genome-wide significance was defined as a <italic>P</italic> value &lt;5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, and suggestive (notable) significance as <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−6</sup>.

Logistic regression was used for this purpose with adjustments by the following covariates: country of origin, top three principal components, assignments to cardiovascular treatment strata (early medical therapy vs. early revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting), and assignments to glycemic control strata (insulin sensitization vs. insulin provision).

Of these, 28 reached genome-wide significance (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>), as summarized in the Manhattan and QQ plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. These variants lie in the same region of chromosome 2q24 and are in strong LD with each other in whites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). When the analysis was conditioned on the lead SNP (rs13417783), the effects of all the other genome-wide significant variants disappeared (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db19-0109/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>), indicating that all 28 variants captured the same genetic effect. The lead SNP had a MAF of 0.15 and was associated with a 36% decrease in the odds of DPN per minor allele copy (odds ratio [OR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.55–0.74; <italic>P</italic> = 1.9 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).

An association of similar strength was found between this locus and DPN in BARI 2D. In both cohorts, the 2q24 minor allele conferred protection from DPN, being more frequent in DPN-negative control subjects than in DPN case subjects and the general population. In further support of these findings, the same allele was found to be associated with higher tibial nerve expression of a nearby gene (<italic>SCN2A</italic>) coding for the α subunit of NaV1.2, providing a possible functional basis for the genetic effect observed at the population level. This is the first report of a DPN locus that reaches genome-wide significance in a GWAS and is replicated in an independent study.</p><p>The fact that almost identical effects on DPN were found for this locus in the discovery (OR 0.63) and replication (OR 0.57) is remarkable and makes this finding especially robust. Such a high degree of concordance reflects the use of the same DPN definition (clinical examination MNSI &gt;2) in studies and the high sensitivity, specificity, and correlation with abnormal nerve conduction characteristic of this DPN outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Other contributing factors include the similar clinical characteristics of the two cohorts with regard to height, BMI, diabetes duration, blood pressure, and smoking status, and the similar incidence of DPN, despite the administration of different interventions.</p><p>There are scant data in the literature to which our findings can be compared because only one other GWAS of DPN has been published to date. That study, based on the GoDARTS data sets, found suggestive evidence (<italic>P</italic> = 1.8 × 10<sup>−7</sup>) for a DPN locus on chromosome 8p21 near <italic>GFRA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). We could not replicate that finding in our study, and conversely, no significant evidence for the locus 2q24 that we identified in ACCORD and BARI 2D was reported in the GoDARTS study. In addition to the possibility of the 8p21 locus being a false positive, given the lack of genome-wide significance and previous replication, there are important differences between the two GWASs that could explain these discrepancies. First, the outcome considered by the GoDARTS study was painful DPN, defined as a prescription history of at least one of five drugs indicated for the treatment of neuropathic pain along with a positive monofilament test for sensory neuropathy, which is known to have low specificity. By contrast, in our GWAS, DPN was defined by means of a validated instrument (MNSI clinical examination) that does not include pain in its assessment. Thus, the two studies captured different aspects of DPN involving different components of the peripheral nervous system (predominantly small fibers in the case of painful DPN vs. large fibers in the case of MNSI-diagnosed DPN).</p><p>Second, both ACCORD and BARI 2D were clinical trials, with close follow-up, standardized outcome acquisition by trained professionals, and strict adjudication, whereas the GoDARTS study was based on medical record data collected as part of routine medical care.</p><p>Finally, ACCORD and BARI 2D participants were characterized by a long duration of diabetes (15 years on average by the end of the study), which helped minimize misclassification of control subjects—an essential feature for the identification of protective effects on DPN, such as that associated with the 2q24 locus. Although diabetes duration was not specified in the GoDARTS report, it was likely to be shorter owing to the population-based nature of that cohort.</p><p>The DPN locus that we have identified may allow clinicians to focus prevention efforts on patients at higher risk of DPN. However, the real relevance of this finding lies in the great potential for improving our understanding of DPN biology and for identifying novel targets for preventive interventions. It is noteworthy in this regard that the newly identified DPN locus is located in close vicinity to a cluster of genes coding for the α subunits of NaVs, which are responsible for multiple aspects of neuron excitability, including thresholds for depolarizing responses and the amplitude of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). From the most proximal to the most distal from the top variant, these genes include <italic>SCN7A</italic>, <italic>SCN9A</italic>, <italic>SCN1A</italic>, <italic>SCN2A</italic>, and <italic>SCN3A</italic>, which code for NaVx, NaV1.7, NaV1.1, NaV1.2, and NaV1.3, respectively. In the GTEx database, the protective allele of the 2q24 locus was significantly associated with higher expression of one of these genes (<italic>SCN2A)</italic> in the tibial nerve, supporting the hypothesis that increased activity of the corresponding NaV1.2, which is expressed in DRG and tibial nerve, may guard against the detrimental effects of the diabetic milieu on peripheral nerves. <italic>SCN2A</italic> mRNA is expressed by human and murine DRG neurons but not by Schwann cells or other cell types that are found in the tibial nerve (mousebrain.org), which suggests that the <italic>SCN2A</italic> mRNA in the tibial nerve is contributed by sensory nerve axons.</p><p>Rare mutations in the <italic>SCN2A</italic> gene have been implicated in the etiology of neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism spectrum disorder (loss of function mutations) and infantile seizures (gain of function mutations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), but the effect of these variants on susceptibility to DPN has never been investigated due to the their rarity, nor has the effect of NaV1.2 loss or gain of function been studied in animal models of DPN. A relationship with DPN etiology has been instead clearly established for NaV1.3 and NaV1.7 (coded by <italic>SCN3A</italic> and <italic>SCN9A</italic>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), but no differences in their expression were found among 2q24 genotypes in the GTEx database. Whether this was due to the small size and/or the lack of exposure to diabetes of the samples in the GTEx database, or is related to the fact that NaV1.3 and NaV 1.7 are preferentially expressed in small fibers mediating pain transmission, whereas the MNSI score mainly tests large fibers mediating vibration sense and tendon reflexes, remains to be determined.</p><p>Altogether, these findings highlight the need for further studies of the SCN genes in the 2q24 region as functional mediators of the DPN locus and potential targets of novel preventive interventions. These studies would include testing of the association between the 2q24 genotype and the expression of these genes in peripheral nerve samples specifically collected from subjects with diabetes, along with studies assessing the impact of overexpressing or knocking down these genes in peripheral nerves of animal models of DPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The noncoding gene <italic>AC019181.2</italic> (<italic>LOC101929633</italic>), which also showed evidence of association with the 2q24 locus in the GTEx database, should be included in these studies given the potential role of noncoding RNAs as regulators of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).</p><p>The genomic mechanisms linking this locus to differences in gene expression are unclear at this time. The index SNP and the other 27 variants reaching GWAS significance are in a noncoding region with quite subtle epigenetic marks. The index SNP was found by ENCODE to be located in a weak enhancer (as indicated by an H3K4m1 mark) in human embryonic stem cells, but whether this regulatory element is also active in neural cells remains to be determined. Of the other 27 SNPs, the 2 highest ranking in RegulomeDb are rs12993796 and rs16852735. The first SNP is located in a DNA segment that binds BATF (a transcription factor involved in the differentiation of immune cells) in a lymphoblastoid cell line (GM12878). The second SNP is placed in a region showing evidence of binding to REST (RE1 silencing transcription factor) in a neuroectodermic cell line (PFSK-1). REST is a transcription factor that represses neuronal genes, including NaVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Because REST is expressed in peripheral nerves (as shown by GTEx data) and in DRG, one can speculate that the higher expression of <italic>SCN2A</italic> associated with the 2q24 protective allele in these tissues may be due to decreased binding of this repressor to the DNA segment where rs16852735 is located. The other 25 SNPs showed minimal evidence of being functional in the summary provided by RegulomeDb. Resequencing of the LD block in which the GWAS-significant SNPs are located in large series of case and control subjects, followed by ad hoc functional studies, will be necessary to identify the causal variant(s) and understand its (their) impact on genomic function.</p><p>Although the association with DPN was strongest at 2q24, another locus placed on chromosome 15q25 yielded notable GWAS significance in the ACCORD GWAS as well as in the meta-analysis with BARI 2D. Especially interesting is the vicinity of this locus to the <italic>NTRK3</italic> gene coding for the receptor of neurotrophin 3, which, by prompting the extension of fibers from proprioceptive DRGs to the muscle spindle and the ventral horn of the spinal cord, is responsible for inducing the synaptic connection between sensory and motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). On the basis of this evidence, this locus should be considered as a prime candidate for future studies, although the available GTEx data do not suggest an association between the index SNP at 15q25 and <italic>NTRK3</italic> expression.</p><p>Strengths of our study include the advantages of clinical trials, such as the rigorous and standardized protocols for data acquisition, the regular follow-up, and access to rich phenotype data, as well as the systematic GWAS approach based on genotyped and imputed data of excellent quality and wide coverage. As discussed above, the use of a validation cohort having very similar clinical characteristics to the discovery cohort was another critical strength.</p><p>Nonetheless, some limitations should be acknowledged. Because ACCORD and BARI 2D were both designed to include participants with T2D at high risk of cardiovascular disease, whether our findings could be generalized to individuals with different characteristics or with type 1 diabetes remains to be determined. Similarly, our study was limited to white subjects, and it is not known whether these findings also apply to individuals of other races, although the limited data on African American individuals from ACCORD suggest that this might be the case. Also, our study, while larger than most of the genetic studies of DPN published thus far, was powered to detect only relatively large genetic effects and the fact that control subjects were slightly younger and had slightly shorter diabetes duration than case subjects may have biased results toward the null hypothesis. Therefore, other loci having smaller yet functionally relevant effects may have gone undetected. Finally, because the GWAS was limited to common polymorphisms (MAFs &gt;5%), the existence of additional genetic effects due to less frequent variants cannot be excluded.</p><p>In summary, we have identified and successfully validated a locus on chromosome 2q24 having a powerful protective effect on the development of DPN in T2D. Tissue expression analysis suggests that this effect may be mediated by higher expression of the NaV1.2 in the tibial nerve, which is known to increase neuronal excitability. These results may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of DPN and point to a potential new target for interventions aimed at preventing or treating this complication of diabetes.</p></sec>
