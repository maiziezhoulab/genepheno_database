<abstract>
<p>It has recently become clear that ribosomes are much more heterogeneous than previously thought, with diversity arising from rRNA sequence and modifications, ribosomal protein (RP) content and posttranslational modifications (PTMs), as well as bound nonribosomal proteins. In some cases, the existence of these diverse ribosome populations has been verified by biochemical or structural methods. Furthermore, knockout or knockdown of RPs can diversify ribosome populations, while also affecting the translation of some mRNAs (but not others) with biological consequences. However, the effects on translation arising from depletion of diverse proteins can be highly similar, suggesting that there may be a more general defect in ribosome function or stability, perhaps arising from reduced ribosome numbers. Consistently, overall reduced ribosome numbers can differentially affect subclasses of mRNAs, necessitating controls for specificity. Moreover, in order to study the functional consequences of ribosome diversity, perturbations including affinity tags and knockouts are introduced, which can also affect the outcome of the experiment. Here we review the available literature to carefully evaluate whether the published data support functional diversification, defined as diverse ribosome populations differentially affecting translation of distinct mRNA (classes). Based on these observations and the commonly observed cellular responses to perturbations in the system, we suggest a set of important controls to validate functional diversity, which should include gain-of-function assays and the demonstration of inducibility under physiological conditions.</p>
