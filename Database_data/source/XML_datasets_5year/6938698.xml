<p>In short, this study reveals the complicated interplay between TRPM2 and β-Cat/SP5 signaling during heat stress.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Temperature homeostasis is critical for fetal development. The heat sensor protein TRPM2 (transient receptor potential channel M2) plays crucial roles in the heat response, but its function and specific mechanism in brain development remain largely unclear. Here, we observe that TRPM2 is expressed in neural stem cells. In hyperthermia, <italic>TRPM2</italic> knockdown and knockout reduce the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and, accordingly, increase premature cortical neuron differentiation. In terms of the mechanism, TRPM2 regulates neural progenitor self-renewal by targeting SP5 (specificity protein 5) via inhibiting the phosphorylation of β-catenin and increasing β-catenin expression. Furthermore, the constitutive expression of TRPM2 or SP5 partly rescues defective NPC proliferation in the TRPM2-deficient embryonic brain. Together, the data suggest that TRPM2 has a critical function in maintaining the NPC pool during heat stress, and the findings provide a framework for understanding how the disruption of the <italic>TRPM2</italic> gene may contribute to neurological disorders.</p>

<body><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The cerebral cortex is the most evolved and complicated structure in the mammalian brain and has many physiological functions, such as attention, cognition, learning, and memory. The functions rely on the detailed cortex structure, which includes a six-layered architecture formed by migrating neurons in an inside-out pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). These plentiful neurons are generated from various neural progenitor cells (NPCs). The primary progenitor cells are radial glial (RG) cells, which are mainly responsible for self-renewal and result in the expansion of the cortex, the differentiation of neurons, and the production of postmitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>). The process of neuronal production, also known as neurogenesis, plays crucial roles in cerebral development and can affect the function of the neocortex. Generally, each process in neurogenesis, including self-renewal, differentiation, and the maturation of neurons, is strictly regulated, and any disturbance leads to severe disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>). The entire process is regulated by numerous extracellular and intracellular signals and factors. Any stress or unusual stimulus may lead to abnormalities in brain function.</p><p>During pregnancy, various stimuli can lead to abnormal neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>). Among them, heat stress is an important stimulus for both the mother and fetus during pregnancy, and maternal thermal homeostasis is critical for fetal survival and ontogenesis. For example, maternal fever during the gestation period is associated with congenital heart defects and neural tube defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>). However, it is largely unknown whether heat stress, such as hyperthermia, disturbs neurogenesis and cortical development.</p><p>A series of thermally activated ion channels has been reported to detect the entire thermal range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>). Among them, transient receptor potential channel M2 (TRPM2) is a plasma membrane calcium-permeable cation channel and is a unique member of the TRP family that is sensitive to various signals. Recently, studies have reported that TRPM2 can be activated by heat and that the deletion of TRPM2 in mice results in a remarkable deficit in their perception of nonpainful warm stimuli in the range of 33° to 38°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). TRPM2 has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental/neurological disorders including bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain, and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>). In addition, TRPM2 has been shown to participate in various biological processes, including insulin secretion, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cell apoptosis, and brain damage following ischemic insults in adult and neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>). Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the precise functions and molecular mechanisms of the hyperthermia-related protein TRPM2 and characterize the protein’s role in the regulation of brain development during heat stress and maternal hyperthermia.</p><p>Several pieces of evidence have demonstrated that canonical Wnt signaling, including β-catenin, which acts as a core downstream effector, determines the transition from neuronal proliferation to differentiation during cortical neurogenesis. In the early stages of neurogenesis, the overexpression of β-catenin in NPCs promotes their proliferation, whereas a deficiency in β-catenin in NPCs facilitates neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>). The precise signal transductions that modulate neurogenesis are unclear and need further elucidation. The transcription factor SP5 (specificity protein 5) is a member of the SP transcription factor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>), and previous studies have shown that SP5 plays a crucial role in governing mouse embryonic stem cell pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>) and neural crest specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>). During vertebrate development, SP5 acts downstream of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in neuroectoderm patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>). In addition, the hypermethylation of SP5 has been implicated in schizophrenia, a neuropsychiatric disorder associated with the dysregulation of neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>). However, the role of SP5 in hyperthermia during neurogenesis has never been reported.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that the thermo-sensor protein TRPM2 is enriched in the embryonic cerebral cortex and that its expression gradually increases during heat stress. We also show that TRPM2-deficient mice exposed to heat show reduced NSC proliferation and a premature shift in RG differentiation. Mechanistically, this study identifies an important role of TRPM2 in modulating SP5 expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of β-catenin in sustaining neural progenitor self-renewal during heat stress. In addition, the heat-induced proliferation defects caused by TRPM2 knockdown or knockout can be partially rescued by the overexpression of SP5. Collectively, these findings reveal that the heat sensor protein TRPM2 has a previously unidentified role in modulating cortical neurogenesis during hyperthermia conditions. These findings provide previously unknown insights to further elucidate neurological disorders associated with heat stress and reveal previously unidentified strategies for treatment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Thermal stimuli affect NSC proliferation and cell positioning</title><p>To determine the effect of heat stress on the developing cortex, we performed stress experiments in which pregnant mice were placed in a thermostatic biochemical incubator (fig. S1A) set to 38°C for 2 hours from embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) to E15.5; the control group was kept at room temperature. After heat stress, E15.5 brain slices were stained with an antibody against mitotic index PH3. Compared with that in the control group, the number of PH3-positive cells residing at both the apical and basal positions was notably augmented, indicating that heat stress promoted mitotic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, A to C</xref>). Consistently, double staining for bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) with PAX6 (one type of neural progenitor marker) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>) and TBR2 (an intermediate progenitor marker) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, F and G</xref>) revealed that the number of cells in the proliferative state was increased in hyperthermia. Collectively, these results indicate that heat stress promotes neural progenitor self-renewal. In a second group of pregnant mice, similar heat stress was induced at E13.5 to E16.5; then, in utero electroporation (IUE) was performed to analyze embryonic brain development. When embryos were electroporated with a green fluorescent protein (GFP)–encoding plasmid, which was used as a control plasmid on E13.5 and collected on E16.5, the hyperthermia group showed an abnormal distribution, which manifested as an increase in the number of cells in the ventricular zone/subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ) and a reduction in the number of GFP-positive cells in the cortical plate (CP) compared with those in the room temperature group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, H and I</xref>). In our research, the control mice were maintained in the vivarium at room temperature. We also conducted IUE experiments when mice were maintained in an incubator or in the vivarium at room temperature and found that the stress experienced by the mother due to moving to a new environment did not play a role in the observed phenotypes (fig. S1, B and C). Together, these results demonstrate that heat stress may disturb neurogenesis during embryonic brain development.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Heat stress affects embryonic brain development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> to <bold>C</bold>) E15.5 brain sections from the room temperature and hyperthermia groups were immunolabeled with the mitotic marker PH3 and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).

To verify heat sensitivity, we housed pregnant mice with E13.5 fetuses at 38°C for 2 hours for 3 days. Control pregnant mice were kept at room temperature. After 3 days (i.e., E15.5), RNA was extracted from the cerebral tissues of fetal mice. We detected the RNA levels of several receptors associated with heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>) and observed that in mice subjected to heat stress, the mRNA levels of only <italic>TRPM2</italic>, among the numbers of the TRP family, increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>). Molecular markers of heat-sensitive neurons within the preoptic hypothalamus were also affected. <italic>BDNF</italic> and <italic>PACAP</italic> mRNA levels increased (fig. S1D), which is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>). To examine the specific expression pattern of TRPM2 in the early embryonic brain, we conducted immunofluorescence and colocalization analyses. In vivo, the brain sections of E13.5 and E15.5 mice were collected and stained with antibodies against TRPM2 and the two neural progenitor markers, namely, NESTIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>) and SOX2 (sex-determining region Y–related HMG box 2). TRPM2 was observed to be colocalized with NESTIN-positive and SOX2-positive progenitor cells and resided in the VZ/SVZ of the cerebral cortex in both E13.5 and E15.5 brain sections from mice housed at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref> and fig. S1E). In addition, in vitro, we observed that TRPM2 was coexpressed with NESTIN and SOX2 in primary mouse NSCs derived from E12.5 cerebral tissues and cultured in proliferation medium for 2 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1L</xref>). Next, to investigate TRPM2 expression at different developmental stages, we harvested cerebral tissues from E13.5, E15.5, and E18.5 and analyzed them using Western blotting. The results revealed that TRPM2 expression gradually increased from E13.5 to E18.5 (fig. S1, F and G). We also investigated TRPM2 transcription in vivo using cortical tissues and in vitro using NPCs cultured under differential or proliferative conditions. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on RNA extracted from the tissues or the NPCs. All data indicated that the mRNA levels of TRPM2 showed an obvious up-regulation as embryonic development proceeded (fig. S1, H to J). In addition, another group of pregnant mice was housed at 38°C for 2 hours for 3 days at E15.5. Heat-treated mice showed a marked augmentation of TRPM2 expression in the VZ/SVZ of the neocortex compared with that in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, M and N</xref>). Overall, these findings suggest that TRPM2, especially during heat stress, plays an important role in modulating NSC neurogenesis during embryonic cortical development.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>TRPM2</italic> knockdown leads to abnormal cell distribution during heat stress</title><p>On the basis of the distinctive expression pattern of TRPM2 in NSCs, we explored whether TRPM2 plays a unique role in neurogenesis during embryonic brain development. We generated a <italic>TRPM2</italic>-targeting short hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmid and a <italic>TRPM2</italic>-overexpressing lentiviral-based vector to effectively silence and augment TRPM2 expression, respectively, in neural progenitors. In NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>, and fig. S1M), N2A cells (fig. S1, L and O), and 293FT cells (fig. S1N) treated with our constructs, Western blotting confirmed TRPM2 knockdown or overexpression. To verify our strategy, we further confirmed <italic>TRPM2</italic> shRNA knockdown efficiency by real-time PCR analysis in NSCs, and the analysis showed that TRPM2 levels were effectively suppressed (fig. S1K). Next, we investigated whether TRPM2 disturbs cell distribution in vivo using IUE. In E13.5 mice, brains were injected and electroporated with the <italic>TRPM2</italic> shRNA or control plasmid, and the mice were sacrificed at E16.5 for phenotypic analysis. We observed no obvious change in the distribution of GFP-positive cells across the cerebral cortex (fig. S2, A and B). However, the more interesting observation was that when maternal mice were placed in a 38°C temperature-controlled incubator for 2 hours from E14.5 to E16.5, <italic>TRPM2</italic> knockdown resulted in an obvious reduction in the number of GFP-positive cells in the VZ/SVZ and a corresponding increase in the number of GFP-positive cells in the CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>). When a 39°C temperature-controlled incubator was used, similar results were obtained (fig. S2, C and D). To observe more long-term effects, we performed IUE at E13.5 to E17.5 and comparable GFP-positive cell distributions were observed (fig. S2, E and F). In addition, we also sought to determine whether the knockdown of <italic>TRPM2</italic> has a possible effect on cell migration. IUE experiments are frequently used to monitor cell migration during embryonic cerebral development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><italic>25</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27"><italic>27</italic></xref>). Then, we performed an E15.5-to-E19.5 IUE experiment in mice at room temperature and an E14.5-to-E18.5 IUE experiment in mice exposed to heat (fig. S2, G to I) and found that there was nearly no difference in GFP distribution from the VZ/SVZ to the CP between the control and <italic>TRPM2</italic> knockdown groups. These results jointly eliminated the influence of <italic>TRPM2</italic> depletion on cell migration. Thus, the data suggest that TRPM2 may take part in regulating neurogenesis during heat stress.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title><italic>TRPM2</italic> knockdown leads to abnormal cell distribution and the enhanced differentiation of NSCs during heat stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis confirmed the knockdown (empty pSicoR shRNA was used as a control) of <italic>TRPM2</italic> in cultured NSCs. β-Actin was used as a control.

In addition, when immunostaining for TRPM2 together with NESTIN or TUJ1 was performed on E16.5, we found that the expression of NESTIN was decreased, while the level of TUJ1 was observably augmented after the deletion of <italic>TRPM2</italic> in hyperthermia (fig.

Consistently, when mice were housed at 38°C for 2 hours per day from E14.5 to E18.5, more neurons expressing CUX1 were observed in the CP in <italic>TRPM2</italic> knockout brain slices both on postnatal day 0 (P0) and P6 (fig.

However, in brain slices obtained from embryos of mothers who had been housed at room temperature, we did not find an obvious difference in TUJ1 staining at P0 between the wild-type and <italic>TRPM2</italic> knockout groups (fig.

In addition, NSCs obtained from E12.5 <italic>TRPM2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> embryos formed smaller neurospheres than those of controls in hyperthermia, but not room temperature conditions, suggesting that the loss of <italic>TRPM2</italic> inhibits NPC proliferation during hyperthermia (fig.

To validate the function of TRPM2 during cortical neurogenesis in times of hyperthermia, we electroporated the brains of fetal <italic>TRPM2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>TRPM2</italic>
<sup>−/−</sup> mice with control plasmids and brains of fetal <italic>TRPM2</italic>
<sup>−/−</sup> mice with TRPM2 overexpression plasmids on E13.5. Then, on E16.5, we collected brain samples from mice that had been exposed to heat stress for 2 hours from E14.5 to E16.5. By staining with an anti-TUJ1 antibody, we found that <italic>TRPM2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice not only exhibited an aberrant distribution of GFP-positive cells in three cortical layers but also showed a prominent increase in the proportion of GFP– and TUJ1–double positive cells compared with that in <italic>TRPM2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice, which is reminiscent of <italic>TRPM2</italic> knockdown mice subjected to heat stress. Moreover, forced expression of TRPM2 in <italic>TRPM2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice in hyperthermia could rescue the abnormalities evoked by the ablation of <italic>TRPM2</italic>, i.e., both the distribution and ratio of GFP<sup>+</sup> TUJ1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, K to M</xref>). In addition, we also compared the distribution and ratio of GFP<sup>+</sup> TUJ1<sup>+</sup> cells between <italic>TRPM2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice at room temperature and <italic>TRPM2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice in hyperthermia groups. The results revealed that, upon exposure to hyperthermia, <italic>TRPM2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice displayed a significant increase in the number of GFP-positive cells in the CP and the percentage of TUJ1<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (fig.

In addition, the consistent phenotype of <italic>TRPM2</italic> knockout excludes the possibility of potential off-target effects of <italic>TRPM2</italic> shRNA in knockdown experiments. To investigate the effect of <italic>TRPM2</italic> deficiency on differentiating neurons in hyperthermia, we conducted an in vitro experiment using cultured primary neurons. The neurons were isolated from P0 hyperthermic <italic>TRPM2</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>TRPM2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> embryos and cultured in differentiation medium for 3 days. By staining with an antibody against TUJ1, we observed no obvious difference between the wild-type and <italic>TRPM2</italic> knockout groups in terms of neurite length or number of branches (fig.

Total RNA was acquired from the cortical tissue of E16 <italic>TRPM2</italic> knockout and wild-type mice with mothers that were housed at 38°C for 2 hours per day from E14.5 to E16.5. Sequencing was repeated twice for each sample to increase the reliability of the sequencing results. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that down-regulated genes were associated with cell proliferation and temperature stimuli, including the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, neuronal stem cell division, the detection of temperature stimuli involved in sensory perception, and the negative regulation of cell differentiation. The up-regulated genes were associated with neurogenesis, the regulation of neuronal development, and cell fate commitment (fig. S9A).

Consistently, SP5 was expressed in vivo in NESTIN-positive NSCs in the VZ/SVZ of the E13.5 cortex (fig. S9H). Furthermore, shRNAs targeting SP5 were constructed, and they effectively silenced the expression of SP5 (fig. S10A).

Protein was obtained from E16 cortical tissue from <italic>TRPM2</italic> knockout and wild-type mice that were housed at 38°C for 2 hours per day from E14.5 to E16.5. Western blot analysis showed an obvious reduction in SP5 and β-catenin expression levels. We also found that the phosphorylation levels of β-catenin were augmented in <italic>TRPM2</italic> knockout mice exposed to hyperthermia. In addition, decreases in expression of the proliferative markers PH3 and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and an increase in the expression of the neuronal marker TUJ1 in <italic>TRPM2</italic> knockout mice clarified the role of TRPM2 in embryonic neurogenesis in hyperthermia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).

We did not observe such an obvious change under room temperature conditions (fig. S6J). Intrigued by the altered phosphorylation levels of β-catenin in <italic>TRPM2</italic> knockout mice exposed to hyperthermia, we tested the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), which is a serine/threonine kinase associated with β-catenin phosphorylation. On the basis of the fact that GSK3β activity requires the autophosphorylation of Tyr<sup>216</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><italic>30</italic></xref>), we evaluated protein levels and protein modifications.

The constitutive overexpression of TRPM2 during hyperthermia intensifies GSK3β activity (fig. S10K). In addition, Western blot analysis showed an increase in the expression of TRPM2, total β-catenin, and SP5 and a decrease in the phosphorylation of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>).

However, when cells were transfected with the <italic>TRPM2</italic>-sh1 plasmid with red fluorescent protein (RFP), intracellular calcium decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4K</xref>), suggesting that TRPM2 modulates intracellular calcium. Calmodulin (CAM) is a target of calcium ions within the cell, and once bound to calcium ions, CAM is activated and serves as part of the calcium signal transduction pathway by modulating interactions with various target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33"><italic>33</italic></xref>). In our study, we found that CAM interacted with GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>), and Western blotting showed that phosphorylated β-catenin levels were reduced, while total β-catenin expression was slightly increased when CAM was overexpressed during heat stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4L</xref>). Therefore, these findings suggest that thermal stimuli activate TRPM2, which increases intracellular calcium. Calcium ions can then bind to CAM, thus inhibiting the levels of phosphorylated β-catenin and simultaneously activating the expression of β-catenin.</p><p>On the basis of these results, we suggest that β-catenin may enter the nucleus, bind to the SP5 promoter, and modulate the expression level of SP5 during heat stress. To test this hypothesis, we used a luciferase plasmid containing −2 kb of the SP5 promoter and measured luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). We also generated a vector that overexpressed β-catenin with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag and characterized its efficiency by Western blotting (fig. S10J). At 39°C, we observed more than twofold increase in luciferase activity in cells treated with the β-catenin vector compared with cells treated with the empty vector, demonstrating that β-catenin binds to the SP5 promoter to exert its function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>′). To further determine the specific binding site, we used a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). At 39°C, in cells in which β-catenin was constitutively expressed, the binding of β-catenin −0.5 kb from the SP5 promoter increased, and binding decreased as the distance to the transcription start site increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>′). These differences were not observed at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>″). In addition, we analyzed the promoters of other β-catenin target genes, such as <italic>Axin2</italic> and <italic>CyclinD1</italic>, in hyperthermia and observed that there was almost no binding of β-catenin (fig. S10, L and M), suggesting specificity for SP5.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>TRPM2 regulates cortical neurodevelopment through the enhancement of β-catenin enrichment on the SP5 promoter during heat stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow chart of the luciferase assay in which the SP5 promoter was cloned into the psiCHECK-2 vector.

Together, our data supported the notion that, during heat stress, TRPM2 increases SP5 levels via the stabilization of β-catenin enrichment on the SP5 promoter, thus enhancing NPC proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Cortical neurogenesis is a very sophisticated process that is strictly controlled by a great deal of signaling molecules. If any step of this process goes wrong, abnormal brain functions, and thus neurodevelopmental disorders, result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34"><italic>34</italic></xref>). Temperature homeostasis is essential for embryo survival, and heat stress disturbs numerous aspects of fetal development and brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35"><italic>35</italic></xref>). TRPM2, which has been recently identified as a heat activation protein, plays an important role in the heat response. TRPM2 is also a calcium-permeable channel in the plasma membrane, and a growing body of evidence has shown that calcium signaling heavily affects neural progenitor proliferation during embryonic neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36"><italic>36</italic></xref>). However, no details as to whether or how TRPM2 affects brain neural development under conditions of heat exist. Here, we used <italic>TRPM2</italic> shRNA and knockout mice to investigate the specific functions of TRPM2 in NPC proliferation and differentiation, cortical neuronal morphology, and the mechanisms guiding embryonic neurogenesis under hyperthermic conditions.</p><p>In our study, we first confirmed the thermal sensitivity of TRPM2 and then observed that TRPM2 is expressed in NSCs. When expressed during heat stress, TRPM2 augments NPCs in the E15.5 cerebral cortex, providing clues regarding its effect on neurogenesis during hyperthermia. Furthermore, we found that heat stress changes cellular distribution and facilitates NSC proliferation. Previous studies have shown that at room temperature, <italic>TRPM2</italic> loss of function leads to increased axonal growth to promote neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37"><italic>37</italic></xref>). Here, we demonstrated that TRPM2 can exert its function earlier, specifically at E13.5, and that during heat stress, the loss of <italic>TRPM2</italic> has a more powerful effect on facilitating cortical neurogenesis. However, at room temperature, the phenotype is not obvious. Our data indicate that <italic>TRPM2</italic> deficiency in hyperthermia results in a change in cell distribution and proliferation defects with a sharp drop in the NSC pool. We also found that the depletion of <italic>TRPM2</italic> during heat stress increases cell cycle exit and premature cell terminal mitosis, ultimately promoting neurons to a more differentiated state. Both proliferation defects and abnormalities in neuronal morphogenesis lead to severe brain illness, such as autism and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>). In addition, we were able to eliminate the influence of cell migration and apoptosis during hyperthermia by knocking out <italic>TRPM2</italic>. However, why the <italic>TRPM2</italic> knockdown phenotype observed during heat stress is more obvious than the phenotype observed under room temperature conditions still needs to be explored.</p><p>To investigate the mechanisms underlying the unique phenotype caused by the loss of <italic>TRPM2</italic> and hyperthermia, we searched for downstream targets using RNA-seq analysis and found that SP5 expression was decreased upon <italic>TRPM2</italic> knockout and hyperthermia. SP5 is a member of the SP1 family of transcription factors, but its function in embryonic brain development is still unclear.</p><p>Our research shows that SP5 is abundant in NPCs and that, under conditions of heat, <italic>TRPM2</italic> deficiency inhibits SP5 expression from E13.5 to E16.5. This leads to a decrease in the number of GFP-positive cells residing in the VZ/SVZ and results in the promotion of neuronal differentiation. To further decipher how TRPM2 enhances SP5 expression in hyperthermia, we analyzed some signaling molecules and found that total β-catenin expression was significantly down-regulated, while the phosphorylation of β-catenin was obviously increased upon <italic>TRPM2</italic> deficiency and heat stress. β-Catenin, which functions in canonical Wnt signaling, is abundant in NSCs and contributes to the modulation of NSC expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>). However, specific mechanisms of the protein are not entirely clear. Previous studies have indicated that Wnt/β-catenin is associated with intracellular Ca<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32"><italic>32</italic></xref>). Given that TRPM2 is a calcium-permeable channel, we investigated calcium ions during heat stress, and our data showed a decrease in intracellular Ca<sup>+</sup> levels upon <italic>TRPM2</italic> knockout. Moreover, the overexpression of CAM inhibited the phosphorylation of β-catenin and augmented the expression of β-catenin. Using a luciferase and ChIP assay, we also confirmed that β-catenin binds to the SP5 promoter during heat stress. Unexpectedly, our results indicated that the overexpression of SP5 ameliorates the defects evoked by <italic>TRPM2</italic> loss of function in hyperthermia. However, in the future, the current hyperthermia model needs to be further improved because in human, such as fever response, immune system component may take part in this model.</p><p>In summary, our findings uncovered a novel mechanism by which TRPM2, a thermo-sensor protein, governs embryonic neural development during heat stress. Furthermore, the neuronal morphology abnormalities in <italic>TRPM2</italic> knockout mice exposed to hyperthermia during embryonic development may provide novel insights into neurological disorders associated with heat stress, including maternal fever, and reveal new strategies for treatment. In terms of the mechanism, we found that when TRPM2 is activated by heat and intracellular calcium binds to CAM, the phosphorylation of β-catenin is inhibited. Accumulating β-catenin then binds to the SP5 promoter to ultimately enhance NPC proliferation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animals</title><p>Pregnant ICR mice were obtained from Vital River Laboratories.
