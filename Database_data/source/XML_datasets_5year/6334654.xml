<p id="P3">Enhancers function as DNA logic gates and may control specialized functions of billions of neurons. Here we show a tailored program of noncoding genome elements active <italic>in situ</italic> in physiologically distinct dopamine neurons of the human brain. We found 71,022 transcribed noncoding elements, many of which were consistent with active enhancers and with regulatory mechanisms in zebrafish and mouse brains. Genetic variants associated with schizophrenia, addiction, and Parkinson’s dis- ease were enriched in these elements. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis revealed that Parkinson’s disease-associated variants on chromosome 17q21 <italic>cis</italic>-regulate the expression of an enhancer RNA in dopamine neurons. This study shows that enhancers in dopamine neurons link genetic variation to neuropsychiatric traits.</p>

<body>
<p id="P4">To date the majority of disease- and trait-associated variants emerging from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of neurologic and psychiatric diseases lie within non-protein coding sequence. Several lines of evidence suggest the involvement of a proportion of such variants in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, including modulation of enhancer elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Many regulatory elements are cell-type preferential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and therefore sequence variants with functional consequences are expected to manifest their effects more strongly in cell type most relevant to a specific disease phenotype.</p>
<p id="P5">Here we focused on systematically identifying all noncoding regulatory elements transcriptionally active in a morphologically, functionally, and biochemically distinct neuronal archetype --- dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta in human midbrain. We hypothesized that genetic variation associated with diseases involving dopaminergic neurotransmission exert their effects through modulation of enhancers functionally active in this particular type of neurons. Perturbations of the dopaminergic system are important in the pathogenesis and treatment responses of many increasingly prevalent complex genetic diseases, including 0.5 million people with Parkinson’s disease (PD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, 2.2 million with schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, and 23.5 million people with addiction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> in the United States alone. In healthy people, these dopaminergic neurons shape how we conduct our everyday lives, encoding activities related to motivation and reward. Signals from these neurons to the striatum have a profound impact on action learning and automatic movements, while projections to hippocampus and prefrontal cortex influence memories and behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">Our analysis is powered by an integrated hardware-software solution for comprehensively detecting noncoding transcription in one single and minuscule RNA sample, and mapping the variation in noncoding transcription to genetic variation within dopamine neurons across multiple individuals. This method combines the base-pair resolution and a comprehensive genome-wide view afforded by ultra-deep, total RNA sequencing, with the positional and cytoarchitectural precision afforded by traditional light microscopy.</p>

<title>Identification of noncoding elements actively transcribed in dopamine neurons of human brain</title>
<p id="P7">To systematically identify noncoding elements actively transcribed in dopamine neurons of human brain we used <italic>l</italic>aser-<italic>c</italic>apture microdissection total RNA sequencing (lcRNAseq). Beyond traditional messenger (mRNA) sequencing, <italic>all</italic> polyadenylated <italic>and</italic> non-polyadenylated transcripts were ultra-deeply sequenced using ribo-depleted RNAs from ~40,400 neurons laser-captured from 99 human post-mortem brains and seven non-neuronal cell-type samples with an average 178 million reads per sample yielding 2.0 × 10<sup>10</sup> pair-ended RNA-seq reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Melanized neurons from the midbrain substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of 86 high-quality human brains (dopamine neurons), pyramidal neurons from layers V/VI of the middle temporal cortex of ten brains and from the primary motor cortex of three brains (pyramidal neurons) were laser-captured as described Ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Human fibroblasts from four and peripheral blood mononuclear white cells (non-neuronal cells) from three individuals were analyzed in the same pipeline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Cumulatively, we found that at least 64.4% of the human genome is transcribed to produce detectable RNAs in dopamine neurons of the human brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <bold>Online Methods</bold>) consistent with observations from ENCODE in <italic>cultured</italic> cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. More than half of these reads (54.7%) mapped to intergenic or intronic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) indicating a massive hidden layer of active non-coding transcription in human brain neurons.</p>
<p id="P8">Enhancer RNA (eRNA) expression is a marker for active enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and can be used to estimate enhancers active in a particular cell type at given time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Genetic enhancer elements control the cell type-specific activation of gene expression. We designed a sophisticated method for the systematic identification of noncoding elements including known and novel candidate enhancers that are significantly expressed in dopamine neurons, pyramidal neurons, and non-neuronal cells, respectively using a stringent six-step filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, see <bold>Online Methods</bold> for detail). We required aggregated reads for each cell type to achieve local peak read densities (“summit”) with detection <italic>P</italic>-value of 0.05 compared to randomly sampled background; without overlap with exons from annotated genes and TSS-proximal regions; with a minimal element length of 100 bp; without splicing junction reads (to avoid multi-exon non-coding RNAs (ncRNA)). We then rigorously determined the statistical significance of each of these candidate transcribed noncoding elements across <italic>multiple independent</italic> samples of the same cell type (e.g. across 86 independent samples for dopamine neurons) with a family-wise adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value less or equal than 0.05 taken as evidence of statistical significant expression.</p>
<p id="P9">We discovered 71,022, 37,007, and 19,690 transcribed non-coding elements (TNEs) in dopamine neurons, pyramidal neurons, or non-neuronal cells, respectively, with detection <italic>P</italic> values equal or better than the Bonferroni-corrected significance thresholds of 7.0 × 10<sup>−7</sup>, 5.1 × 10<sup>−7</sup>, 6.6 × 10<sup>−7</sup> for each of the three cell types, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The length distribution of TNEs peaked around 400 bp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>), consistent with that of the enhancer RNAs previously reported by FANTOM5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> and of activity-regulated enhancer RNAs found in mouse cortical neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Unlike promoter regions, TNEs showed a GC content distribution similar to random genomic background regions and this is inconsistent with PCR bias (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). The vast majority of TNEs (92%) localized to intronic regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>) and they tended to be positionally biased towards the 5′ end of gene body; a pattern opposite to that of partial RNA degradation, which preferentially degrades 5′ ends (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). TNEs accounted for 31.42% and 32.35% of reads transcribed in dopamine and pyramidal neurons, respectively, compared to 21.08% in peripheral cells. 26.38% of dopamine neuron TNEs were also presented in pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>; Fisher’s exact test <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>, odds ratio = 3.22), but only 7.85% in peripheral cells. Subprograms of protein-coding mRNAs and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) expressed in dopamine neurons, pyramidal neurons, and non-neuronal cells were also characterized (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>, and <bold>Online Methods</bold> for detail).</p>

<title>Transcribed noncoding elements (TNEs) identify putative enhancers active in dopamine neurons</title>
<p id="P10">23,625 of 71,022 (33%) TNEs active in dopamine neurons coincided with enhancers defined by one or more genomic or epigenetic features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>; see <bold>Online Methods</bold>). These features included DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, characteristic histone modifications (such as high H3K27ac, high H3K4me1, and low H3K4me3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, capped analysis of gene expression (CAGE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>-defined enhancers, transcriptional coactivator P300<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> binding sites, transcription factor ‘hotspots’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and sequence conservation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. 20,505 of 71,022 TNEs coincided with chromatin state-defined putative active enhancers from Roadmap Epigenomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and 1,212 TNEs coincided with CAGE-defined putative active enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. The overlap was significantly higher than expected by chance alone with <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup> by permutation test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">We performed two experiments to directly benchmark TNE to putative enhancers predicted by two <italic>other</italic> methods applied to the <italic>same</italic> source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). 44.1% of TNE (14,904 of the 33,762 TNE) called by our pipeline in the human cortex data set from PsychENCODE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> overlapped with a strong ATAC-seq peak (which maps chromatin accessibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>) identified in the same samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This was a significantly higher than expected by chance with <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup> by permutation test. In SK-N-SH cells, 21.7% of called TNEs (11,465 of 52,733) overlapped with putative enhancer features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>; e.g. H3K27ac, H3K4me3, transcriptional regulator CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), P300 ChIP-Seq, DNase I hypersensitivity, and transcription factor hotspots) delineated by ENCODE in this cell line with <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup> by permutation test, similar to the 25% overlap previously reported between CAGE-defined and chromatin state-predicted putative enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P12">We grouped 71,022 dopamine TNEs into three classes according to the presence or absence of supporting features (see <bold>Online Methods</bold>). Specifically, 11,835 TNEs coincided with multiple supportive features (designated class I TNE), that is a known DHS site plus at least one of five additional external features (chromHMM, CAGE-enhancer, P300 peak, transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) hotspot, highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) between human and zebrafish; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">d</xref>). A second set of 11,790 TNEs was supported by at least one of the five external features, but lacked additional DHS evidence (designated class II TNEs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">d</xref>). A third set of 47,397 TNEs had no previously reported supporting external features (termed class III TNE; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">d</xref>). Bi-directional transcription of select dopamine TNEs was seen using CAGE in substantia nigra of four of the same brains used for lcRNAseq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Moreover, transcription factor binding sites were enriched in TNE sites based on <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of ChIP-seq peaks and motif scanning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Note</xref>).</p>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Replication of TNEs in independent cohorts.</title>
<p id="P13">We replicated pyramidal neuron-TNE in three independent cohorts representing 36, 498, and 795 human brain samples, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), and additionally confirmed select TNE with two secondary methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Out of the 37,007 pyramidal neuron-TNE discovered, 34,077 (92.1%) were replicated in an independent cohort of pyramidal neurons laser-captured from layer V/VI of 36 new human autopsy brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, BRAINcode-replication subset). 14,679 (39.7%) and 10,718 (29%) of 37,007 pyramidal neuron-TNEs were identified from ribo-depleted total RNA-seq data of frontal cortex (PsychENCODE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>) and four cortex areas (Accelerating Medicines Partnership–Alzheimer’s Disease Consortium (AMP-AD)), respectively <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Select brain cell type-specific TNE were confirmed with a secondary method, qPCR, in laser-captured dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). As expected, qPCR analysis of control samples lacking template or reverse transcriptase showed no expression of TNE. Finally, we confirmed a subset of dopamine neuron TNE by performing CAGE on four substantia nigra homogenate samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>, see <bold>Online Methods).</bold></p>

<p id="P14">57.5% (40,846 of 71,022) of the detected TNEs were exclusively expressed in human dopamine neurons. They were not detected in pyramidal neurons or non-neuronal cells. 39% (14,487 of 37,007) of pyramidal neuron-TNEs were exclusive to this cell type; 64% (12,601 of 19,690) of non-neuronal TNEs were exclusively expressed in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). A signature based on cell type-exclusive TNE clustered 106 individual samples with 99.1% accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) — similar to the classification accuracy afforded by mRNAs and ncRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).

TNE sequences were inserted into a modified pGL4.10 vector (as in ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>), e.g. upstream of an EF1a basal promoter separated by a synthetic polyA signal/transcriptional pause site in order to avoid promoter effects. 11 of the 15 TNEs (73%) significantly increased reporter activity in neuronal cells compared to control inserts representing random background sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Eight TNEs induced more than a twofold increase in reporter signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) and all but one TNE exhibited considerably higher enhancer activity in the neuronal cells compared to HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). <italic>VMP1</italic>-TNE (chr17_57863430_57864538) is located in intron 7 of the human <italic>VMP1</italic> gene, a key regulator of autophagy.

<title>Variants associated with diseases of the dopamine system are over-represented in TNE actively transcribed in dopamine neurons</title>

On average 23 eSNPs associated with expression changes in one TNE.

To distinguish coincidental co-localizations of GWAS and eQTL associations, we used regulatory trait concordance (RTC) scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, which assess whether a <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL and a trait association are tagging the same underlying functional effect. Applying a stringent RTC threshold of 0.85, we identified 23 disease-associated TNE-eQTLs for which the trait and TNE expression associations may be tagging the same effect in dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Table 10</xref>). 17 and 1 disease-associated eQTLs were identified for ncRNAs and mRNAs, respectively.</p>

The corresponding RTC scores were 0.91–1.00, indicating that the GWAS-derived disease variants explain the eQTL observation.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P23">eRNA expression is a feature of active enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and can be used as a marker to estimate their activity in a particular cell type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Genome elements with enhancer chromatin marks that are transcribed into eRNAs have significantly higher validation rates in <italic>in vitro</italic> enhancer assays than enhancers defined exclusively by chromatin-states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Moreover, in transgenic mouse reporter assays, over half of putative enhancers identified on the basis of deep RNA sequencing functioned as enhancers with reproducible activity in the predicted tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Many chromatin-defined enhancers are not regulatory active in a particular cellular state, but may be active in other cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> or are pre-marked for fast regulatory activity upon stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P24">We show a highly specific program of enhancer elements that are actively transcribed in physiologically and morphologically distinct, disease-relevant dopamine and pyramidal neurons --- <italic>in situ</italic>, in human brains. 64.4% of the genome were cumulatively transcribed in dopamine neurons, including 71,022 noncoding elements many of which consistent with histone-state and CAGE-defined active enhancers, and with <italic>in vivo</italic> regulatory functions in zebrafish and mouse neurons. We provided mechanistic evidence that some of these elements function as enhancers of transcription in zebrafish brain, in the midbrain of mice, and in human cultured neuronal cells using genetics and reporter assays. Moreover, multiple independent lines of evidence—including chromatin state, CAGE expression, and transcription factor binding analyses— supporting the view that these transcribed noncoding elements are putative enhancers specifically active in dopamine neurons.</p>
<p id="P25">Variants associated with eleven diseases or medications perturbing the dopamine system were enriched in dopamine neuron-specific TNE sites --- much more so than in promoters and or exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">b</xref>). Risk alleles associated with major disorders of dopaminergic neurotransmission, schizophrenia, PD, addiction as well as with bipolar disorder over-localized to active TNE sites. Compellingly, even pharmacogenetic variants linked to treatment response were enriched in active enhancers. These observations suggest that GWAS variants might modulate enhancers active in dopamine neurons and thereby regulate the transcriptional program underlying susceptibility for these neuropsychiatric diseases. Finally, risk alleles associated with sleep-related phenotypes were enriched in TNE sites with <italic>P</italic> = 2.6 × 10<sup>−55</sup>. Indeed, dopamine neurons have a role in sleep regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and REM sleep behavior disorder is an early sign of PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P26">eQTL analysis for putative eRNAs was for the first time performed across cell type-specific transcriptomes from 84 human brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). It uncovered transcribed noncoding elements in synapse genes as a main cell-autonomous effector of <italic>cis</italic>-acting genetic variation in dopamine neurons. Importantly, the number of TNE-eQTLs greatly surpassed the number of mRNA-eQTLs and ncRNA-eQTLs identified.</p>
<p id="P27">The second most significant GWAS locus for sporadic PD is located on chromosome 17q21. This locus shows unequivocal evidence for association with PD. The regulated gene has not been established, but <italic>MAPT</italic> has been commonly assumed to be the prime candidate. Using expression quantitative trait locus analysis we provide surprising evidence pointing at regulation of a putative enhancer RNA expressed from intron 2 of the <italic>KANSL1</italic> gene as a novel gene-regulatory mechanism for this susceptibility locus. The <italic>KANSL1</italic> locus is important for normal brain function. Microdeletions cause Koolen de Vries syndrome, a neurologic disease with severe learning disability and developmental delay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. The <italic>KANSL1</italic>-TNE1 eQTL association was confirmed by cell type-specific qPCR and replicated in an independent cohort. By contrast, eQTL associations for <italic>MAPT</italic> did not reach statistical significance in dopamine neurons (<italic>P</italic> = 0.32). Long-read sequencing and larger data sets will be required to comprehensively illuminate the relation between structural variation and transcriptional function in this complex locus.</p>
<p id="P28">The <italic>KANSL1-TNE1</italic> eQTL appears to be a “super-eQTL” of variants associated with eight dopaminergic, radiographic, pulmonary, and dermatologic traits all localized to the same LD2 block on chromosome 17q21 and all associated with <italic>KANSL1</italic>-TNE1 up-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>, LD2). Six of these seemingly disparate traits are clinically implicated in multisystem features of PD. Progressive supranuclear palsy (trait 2), leads to neurodegeneration of dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 10</xref>). Men with early-onset male pattern baldness (trait 3) have a 28% higher risk of developing PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Genetic variants for intracranial volume (traits 4 &amp; 5) are related to PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> and PD patients are prone for reduced bone mineral density (trait 6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Thus, PD and seven clinically related traits with variants localizing to an LD block on chromosome 17q21 are associated with <italic>KANSL1-TNE1</italic> expression through a uniform gene-regulatory mechanism.</p>
<p id="P29">This study is powered by innovations both in wet and dry lab methods and provides a valuable online resource of mRNAs, ncRNAs, and TNE expression in dopamine and pyramidal neurons as well as dopamine neuron-specific mRNA-, ncRNA-, and TNE-eQTLs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.humanbraincode.org/">www.humanbraincode.org</ext-link>). The method allows detecting the full complement of mRNAs, ncRNAs, and active enhancers in one single and minuscule RNA sample and combines the base-pair resolution and a comprehensive genome-wide view afforded by ultra-deep, total RNA sequencing, with the positional and cytoarchitectural information afforded by traditional light microscopy. It can be transferred to other morphologically or regionally defined brain and peripheral cells of critical relevance to health and disease. Moreover, the three-in-one approach (detecting three types of RNAs: TNEs, mRNAs, and ncRNAs) offers simplicity and noise-reduction compared to approaches relying on separate methodologies, experiments, and source material for assaying enhancers and mRNAs. LcRNAseq offers advantages to RNA sequencing of brain region homogenates (a suspension of all types of glial, neuronal, immune, and vascular cells resident in a tissue block) or of sorted nuclei without precise information on the 3-D origins in human brain and morphological features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.

<title>Defining exclusive vs. shared TNEs</title>
<p id="P51">TNEs were further annotated into “shared” and “exclusive” classes depending on whether they overlap (i.e. at least 1nt) with TNEs detected in the other cell types.

<title>Characterization of TNEs using regulatory annotations</title>
<p id="P52">To explore the possible role of TNEs in gene regulation, we characterized TNEs with various known regulatory data in human brain (if available) or cell lines. For example, we used chromHMM ‘enhancer’ states in any of the ten human brain tissues in the Roadmap Epigenomics Project for histone-defined enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Enhancer is marked as the E6, E7 or E12 state from the 15-state chromHMM segmentation defined by five core marks, e.g. H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K36me3, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3. The ten brain tissues are Hippocampus Middle, Substantia Nigra, Anterior Caudate, Cingulate Gyrus, Inferior Temporal Lobe, Angular Gyrus, Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, Germinal Matrix, Fetal Brain Female, and Fetal Brain Male. We used DNase-seq peak called in fetal brain of the Roadmap Epigenomics Project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> for DNase hypersensitivity sites. For TF binding, we used the TF ChIP-seq peak clusters (wgEncodeRegTfbsClusteredV3 from UCSC Genome Browser) from the ENCODE project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>, which contains the most comprehensive TF ChIP-seq repository (so far).

<p id="P53">By converting these features into binary codes (1 or 0) according to their presence or absence in TNE regions, we further built a simple classifier using these binary codes. For example, we defined a presence of TF binding hotspot if at least 5 distinct TFs ChIP-seq peaks found in a region. Epigenomic enhancer is presented if either of chromHMM ‘enhancer’ states (E6|E7|E12) is overlapped with the region. For conservation, we overlapped TNEs with HCNEs (highly conserved noncoding elements) defined in Ancora<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and defined “being conserved” if a TNE overlaps with a HCNE between human and zebrafish with at least 70% similarity and 50nt in length.

For TNEs, the expression distribution is close to a normal distribution and thus quantile normalization was not indicated. Moreover, our TNE identification method already selects for TNE pervasively expressed across multiple individuals. We then performed surrogate variable analysis (SVA) with the sva R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> to adjust the effects of known covariates, including batch, age, gender, RIN, PMI, and reads length. Adjusted expression values extracted from fsva() function were used for downstream eQTL analysis. We used RLE (relative log expression) plots to visually inspect the effects of covariates adjustment. We also filtered out SNPs with missing values or with MAF ≤ 0.05 in the 84 subjects. Matrix-eQTL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> was applied for <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL analysis, with the <italic>cis</italic> window defined as 1 megabase between the SNP and the nearest end of a gene or TNE. Nominal <italic>P</italic>-values were generated for SNP-gene pairs in linear regression mode. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 13b</xref> for detail.</p>

<title>TNE-host gene function enrichment analysis</title>
<p id="P64">151 cis-regulated TNEs physically localized to introns of 102 host genes. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the C5 gene sets (GO terms) implemented in the MSigDB database using the hypergeometic test. Each gene set contains genes annotated to the same GO term. For each gene set, the hypergeometric test was performed for k-1, K, N - K, n; where k is the number of TNE host genes genes that are part of a GO term gene set; K is the total number of genes annotated to the same GO term gene set; N is the total number of all known human genes; and n is the number of genes in the query set. The top 50 GO terms enriched in these TNE host genes are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 8</xref> (all with a FDR q value &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p id="P65">We also evaluated whether there is a specific enrichment among <italic>cis</italic>-regulated TNEs in genes associated with brain disorders. We used diseases in MeSH C10 (Nervous System Diseases) or F03 (Mental Disorders) for brain disorders, and associated disease to genes using GenDisNet database. The disease-gene association was extracted from DisGeNet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.disgenet.org/">http://www.disgenet.org/</ext-link>) filtered with GDA score &gt; 0.1.

<title>TF binding motif enrichment analysis</title>
<p id="P66">For TFs with ENCODE ChIP-Seq, we extracted their peak coordinates from the wgEncodeRegTfbsClusteredV3 file downloaded from UCSC Genome Browser, which contains 4,380,444 TF binding peaks from 161 TFs in total. We also downloaded 579 non-redundant TF motifs in vertebrate from JASPAR (version 2018)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup> and then scanned the whole genome with the motifs using the program FIMO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup> (default parameters with <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 10<sup>−4</sup>) to get 418,034,884 putative binding sites. For each TF, Fisher’s exact test was performed to see if observed occurrences of TF peaks (for ENCODE ChIP-Seq) or binding sites (for JASPAR motifs) in TNEs are significantly enriched than expected. In brief, for each TF in JASPAR, we assigned the full set of putative binding regions of JASPAR motifs to one cell of the 2×2 table, according to if a region is bound by the TF or not, and if it’s overlapped with TNE or not. So, each TF has a 2×2 table for Fisher’s exact test. This is similarly done for ENCODE TF ChIP-seq peaks.</p>
<p id="P67">We also tested the TF motif enrichment against random genomic sequences that are GC- and length-matched. We first extracted the GC- and length- matched random genomic background regions using the GC_compo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://opossum.cisreg.ca/GC_compo/">http://opossum.cisreg.ca/GC_compo/</ext-link>) and then tested motif enrichment using the AME program in MEME suite for all 579 non-redundant TF motifs in vertebrate from JASPAR CORE 2018.</p>

<title>Causality analysis for TNE-, ncRNA-, and mRNA-eQTLs</title>
<p id="P68">We used the Relative Trait Concordance (RTC) method to integrate QTL and GWAS data to detect potential disease-causing <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory effects according to the method described in Ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Using this method, an RTC score of 1 or near 1 indicates a potentially causal <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory effect.</p>
<p id="P69">In order to reduce the redundancy in the output of the RTC analysis due to SNPs in strong LD, we pruned the result using the following rules. If multiple eSNPs shared the same LD block with a GWAS SNP, we only took the eSNP with best RTC score for each GWAS variant-transcript pair. If multiple eSNPs achieved the exact same top RTC score and they included the GWAS-derived variant itself, we selected the GWAS variant as top eSNP. If multiple variants achieved the exact same top RTC score (but did not include the GWAS-derived variant itself), then we arbitrarily picked one of these top-scoring eSNPs as representative eSNP. The pruned result is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 10</xref>.</p>
<p id="P70">Three haplotype blocks were defined for the chr17q21 locus by plink2 (plink --blocks --blocks-max-kb 1000) using the CEU subpopulation (n = 99) in the 1000 Genome Project.</p>

<title>Confirming TNE and mRNA expression by qPCR</title>

Primer sequences are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 6</xref>. In order to confirm the expression of lcRNAseq-derived TNE and mRNAs in dopamine neurons and pyramidal neurons, relative abundances of target TNE or mRNAs were evaluated by qPCR in linearly amplified laser-captured, microdissected samples from human substantia nigra or temporal cortex, as well as in linearly amplified human fibroblast and PBMC samples (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). TNE and mRNA expression was further confirmed in SK-N-MC human neuroblastoma cells and Human Universal Reference RNA (not shown). The human reference gene <italic>GUSB</italic> was used to normalize for RNA loading. Control samples lacking template and those lacking reverse transcriptase showed virtually no expression of these target TNEs and mRNAs indicating that primer dimers or DNA contamination did not materially influence results. Expression values were analyzed using the comparative threshold cycle method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.

<title>Evaluation of the chromosome 17q21 eQTL in a second, independent cohort of 31 individuals by qPCR</title>
<p id="P73">Postmortem brain samples from 31 individuals were analyzed. These individuals were without a clinical or neuropathological diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease and met the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in the "Sample collection and processing" section. These new brain samples were obtained from Banner Sun Health Institute, Brain Tissue Center at Massachusetts General Hospital, and University of Kentucky ADC Tissue Bank. Pyramidal neurons were laser-captured from the middle temporal gyrus of each of the 31 individuals and linearly amplified as described in the "Sample collection and processing" section.x These samples showed exceptional quality as documented by a median RNA integrity number 7.7 and a median post-mortem interval of 2.9 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Table 12</xref>). Relative expression abundances of the two target transcripts, <italic>KANSL1</italic>-TNE1 and <italic>LRRC37A4P,</italic> were assayed using SYBR Green qPCR (Life Technologies). The geometric mean of two reference genes, <italic>EIF4A2</italic> and <italic>RPL13</italic>, was used to control for RNA loading.

<title>Post-mortem brain CAGE methods</title>
<p id="P75">Four human post-mortem brains (healthy controls) were obtained from University of Maryland, University of Washington, and McLean Hospital, with the same inclusion/exclusion criteria as described above. Substantia nigra tissue samples were utilized for Cap Analysis Gene Expression (CAGE). 5 μg of total RNA was exacted from each sample using the RNeasy RNA Kit (Qiagen) with an RNA integrity number (RIN) &gt; 6. Use of postmortem samples for expression analysis was approved by the IRB of Brigham &amp; Women’s Hospital.</p>
<p id="P76">Libraries were constructed using a published CAGEseq protocol adapted for next-generation sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. Briefly, complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from total RNA using random primers, and this process was carried out at high temperature in the presence of trehalose and sorbitol to extend cDNA synthesis through GC-rich regions in 5′ untranslated regions. The 5′ ends of messenger RNA within RNA-DNA hybrids were selected by the cap-trapper method and ligated to a linker so that an EcoP15I recognition site was placed adjacent to the start of the cDNA, corresponding to the 5′ end of the original messenger RNA. This linker was used to prime second-strand cDNA synthesis. Subsequent EcoP15I digestion released the 27-base pair (bp) CAGEseq reads. After ligation of a second linker, CAGEseq tags were polymerase chain reaction amplified, purified, and sequenced on the HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) using standard protocol for 50 bp single end runs.</p>
<p id="P77">CAGEseq data were filtered for CAGEseq artifacts using TagDust<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup> (version 1.12), removal of reads mapping to known ribosomal RNA genes and low quality reads, mapping to the human genome (hg19) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (version 0.5.9) for short reads. Reads mapping to autosomes were used to minimize gender and normalization biases for subsequent analysis. Normalization was done based on the amount of reads per million sequence reads.</p>

<title>Data collection, statistical analysis and data presentation</title>
<p id="P78">Sample sizes were based on the total number of available high-quality brain samples that met inclusion and exclusion criteria. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes are consistent with those recommended by the Genotype-Tissue Expression Consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. No randomization of data collection was performed in this study. Brains were selected based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria (see above). Sample outliers were rationally identified as described in the Section on Sample QC based on RNA-seq data. TNE were defined in a rigorous six-step process as detailed in the Section Definition of TNE regions. Data were not excluded based on arbitrary post-hoc considerations.

<title>Identification of noncoding elements actively transcribed in dopamine neurons of human brain.</title>
<p id="P90"><bold>a</bold>, <italic>L</italic>aser-<italic>c</italic>apture microdissection total RNA sequencing (lcRNAseq) was used to systematically identify noncoding elements transcribed in dopamine neurons and pyramidal neurons of human brains. Dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta from 89 high-quality autopsy brains were analyzed. Pyramidal neurons from temporal cortex from ten and motor cortex from three brains were evaluated. Moreover, fibroblasts from four and peripheral blood mononuclear white cells (non-neuronal cells) from three individuals were analyzed. <bold>b</bold>, Cumulatively, 64.4% of the human genome were transcribed in dopamine neurons of human brain. <bold>c</bold>, 54.7% of reads mapped to intergenic or intronic genome sequence. <bold>d</bold>, Schematic of the method for identifying transcribed noncoding elements (TNEs): a stringent six-step filter was applied to the RNA-seq reads aggregated from dopamine neurons, pyramidal neurons, and non-neuronal cells, respectively. Briefly, a putative TNE site was defined as a genomic region with RNA-seq reads density higher than the background transcriptional level (black dashed line) and the “summit” RPM (vertical arrow) achieving a local detection <italic>P</italic> value ≤ 0.05. TNE were required to exceed 100 bp; known genes and splice junctions were excluded. Finally, TNE were required to achieve Bonferroni-corrected expression <italic>P</italic> value ≤ 0.05 across <italic>all samples</italic> of one cell type (indicated by multiple copies of the schematic) compared to length-matched, randomly selected background regions using a binomial distribution.

<title>Transcribed noncoding elements (TNEs) identify putative enhancers active in dopamine neurons</title>
<p id="P91"><bold>a</bold>, TNEs in dopamine neurons are, in part, supported by epigenetic and genetic features of active enhancers. The aggregation plot visualizes normalized signals for DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHS), histone modification marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3), transcription factor binding sites ‘hotspots’ (nTFBS), CAGE signals (forward and reverse strand), and sequence conservation score (phyloP) in the [−1000, +1000]bp regions centered on the DHS peak (if any) or middle position of TNEs. TNE with multiple supportive enhancer features are shown as red line (class I); TNE with one supportive feature are shown with a pink line (class II), and TNE previously not identified by published histone- or CAGE-enhancers are shown light pink (class III). The black line indicates the aggregation plot for all three TNE classes combined. <bold>b</bold>, TNEs significantly overlapped with putative enhancers predicted by other methods applied to the <italic>same</italic> human brain samples and to the same human dopaminergic SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell line (P &lt; 2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup> by permutation test). <bold>c</bold>, 71,022 dopamine neuron-TNEs were clustered into three classes (rows) according to the presence or absence of supporting features of active enhancers (columns) such as DHS, P300 peak, enhancer chromatin state (chromHMM), transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) hotspot, CAGE-enhancer, sequence conservation from external databases as described above. <bold>d</bold>, The heatmaps visualize TNEs with distinct combinations of epigenetic and genetic enhancer features. The relative abundance of TNEs (rows) in dopamine neurons as measured by lcRNAseq (red, relative abundance is color-coded) and physically co-localizing signals of supportive epigenetic and genetic enhancer features (the relative abundance of each supportive enhancer features is color-coded) is shown for the same [−1000, +1000]bp window as above.</p>

<title>Putative enhancers active in dopamine neurons link genetic variation to neuropsychiatric disease</title>
<p id="P99"><bold>a</bold>, GWAS diseases and traits with variants significantly enriched in dopamine TNEs, exons, promoters, and random background regions. Variants for 61 diseases and traits were enriched within TNE-defined putative active enhancers in dopamine neurons with <italic>P</italic> values below the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of 9.64 × 10<sup>−6</sup> by one-sided Fisher’s exact test compared to 71,022 random genomic background regions (see Online Methods). The largest share of traits (<italic>N</italic> = 11) enriched within putative active enhancers clustered around perturbations of the dopamine system (strawberry color). By contrast, only 43 traits were enriched in promoters (including two involving the dopamine system), 11 in exons, and none in random background regions.</p>
<p id="P100"><bold>b</bold>, Diseases and traits significantly enriched in TNE-defined putative enhancers in dopamine neurons. Variants associated with eleven diseases or medications perturbing the dopamine system (horizontal strawberry colored bars) were dramatically over-localized in dopamine neuron TNE. The number of disease-variants colocalizing to dopamine TNEs for each trait as well as odds ratios (in parenthesis) are shown next to each bar. x-axis, <italic>P</italic>-values by one-sided Fisher’s exact test (-log<sub>10</sub> scale); y-axis, diseases and traits. ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; ASD, autism spectrum disorder; MDD, major depressive disorder; ANCA, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody; ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder; QRS duration, a feature on an electrocardiogram.</p>
<p id="P101"><bold>c</bold>, Expression quantitative trait locus analysis reveals transcribed noncoding elements in synapse genes as main cell-autonomous effector of <italic>cis</italic>-acting genetic variation in human brain dopamine neurons. Manhattan plots for TNE-eQTLs (top), ncRNA-eQTLs (middle), and mRNAs (bottom) are shown. Diamonds indicate eSNPs with RTC scores ≥ 0.85, colors indicate different groups of diseases. Gene symbols of the host loci for these eSNPs are shown (n.a., intergenic regions). Y-axis, <italic>P</italic>-values of eSNP-transcript associations from Matrix-eQTL linear regression model (N = 84). A false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 was considered significant (indicated by the red dashed line); QT interval, another feature on an electrocardiogram.</p>
<p id="P102"><bold>d</bold>, Parkinson’s disease-associated variants <italic>cis</italic>-regulate a noncoding element in the <italic>KANSL1</italic> gene in dopamine neurons. The locus plot visualizes <italic>P</italic> values (y-axis) and chromosomal location (x-axis) of genetic variants associated with susceptibility for PD in the chromosome 17q21 GWAS peak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> (chr17:43,000,000–45,300,000 in hg19). A red diamond visualizes the lead susceptibility variant rs17649553; other PD-associated variants in the locus are represented by circles (r<sup>2</sup> with the lead SNP is color-coded). 45 Refseq genes are physically localized under this GWAS peak (box). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks are shown as red horizontal bars. <italic>P</italic>-values extracted from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdgene.org/">www.pdgene.org</ext-link> for GWAS meta-analysis of 13,708 PD cases and 95,282 controls are shown.</p>
