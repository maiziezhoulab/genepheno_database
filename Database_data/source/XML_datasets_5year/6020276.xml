<title>Background</title>
<p>UK Biobank is a well-characterised cohort of over 500 000 participants that offers
unique opportunities to investigate multiple diseases and risk factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec_a2">
<title>Aims</title>
<p>An online mental health questionnaire completed by UK Biobank participants was expected
to expand the potential for research into mental disorders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec_a3">
<title>Method</title>
<p>An expert working group designed the questionnaire, using established measures where
possible, and consulting with a patient group regarding acceptability. Case definitions
were defined using operational criteria for lifetime depression, mania, anxiety
disorder, psychotic-like experiences and self-harm, as well as current post-traumatic
stress and alcohol use disorders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec_a4" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>157 366 completed online questionnaires were available by August 2017. Comparison of
self-reported diagnosed mental disorder with a contemporary study shows a similar
prevalence, despite respondents being of higher average socioeconomic status than the
general population across a range of indicators. Thirty-five per cent (55 750) of
participants had at least one defined syndrome, of which lifetime depression was the
most common at 24% (37 434). There was extensive comorbidity among the syndromes. Mental
disorders were associated with high neuroticism score, adverse life events and long-term
illness; addiction and bipolar affective disorder in particular were associated with
measures of deprivation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec_a5" sec-type="conclusion">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The questionnaire represents a very large mental health survey in itself, and the
results presented here show high face validity, although caution is needed owing to
selection bias. Built into UK Biobank, these data intersect with other health data to
offer unparalleled potential for crosscutting biomedical research involving mental
health.</p>

<body>
<p>UK Biobank is a very large, population-based cohort study established to identify the
determinants of common life-threatening and disabling conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref> Most of these conditions, such as heart disease, stroke and mental disorders, are
multifactorial, involving multiple genes of small effect and complex relationships with
environmental exposures. This means that large samples are required to study associations
between these exposures and disease, and to identify targets for treatment and
prevention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref> The utility of traditional epidemiological study designs is often limited by their
focus on single disorders or exposures and their relatively modest sample sizes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref> UK Biobank is an open-access resource providing detailed characterisation of over half
a million people aged 40–69 years at recruitment, with proposed long-term follow-up.
Recruitment was completed in 2010, and consent was obtained for future contact and linkage to
routinely collected health-related data, such as those produced by the National Health Service
(NHS). Baseline measures were extensive, from family history to sensory acuity (a searchable
breakdown can be found at <uri xlink:href="http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk" xlink:type="simple">www.ukbiobank.ac.uk</uri>), and the resource continues to grow. Genotyping of the whole
cohort was completed earlier this year, blood biomarkers are due next year, and multimodal
imaging is underway for 100 000 participants. Information on local environmental factors, such
as air pollution, is also available. The design of UK Biobank offers the opportunity to
examine a wide range of risk factors and outcomes in a sample large enough to provide the
power to detect small effects, making UK Biobank a highly efficient resource for observational
epidemiology.</p>
<p>The effect of mental disorders on disability and quality of life is considerable,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref> accounting for the equivalent of over 1.2 million person years lost to disability from
mental and substance use disorders in England alone in 2013.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref> Recent work has also highlighted the potential detrimental effect of mental disorders
on both onset and outcome of physical disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref><sup>–</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref> Having mental health phenotypes available, in conjunction with the wealth of other
data in the UK Biobank, would offer considerable opportunities to study aetiological and
prognostic factors. The UK Biobank baseline data collection involved limited assessment of
mental health, consisting of several questions about mood and a neuroticism scale, expanded
for the past 172 729 recruited participants with questions to allow provisional categorisation
of mood disorder;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref> however, there was considerable scope for further characterisation of mental disorders
among participants.</p>
<sec disp-level="2" id="sec1-1">
<title>Outcome ascertainment</title>
<p>Characterising mental disorders in a cohort such as UK Biobank poses several challenges.
First, most mental disorders manifest before 30 years of age and have fluctuating
courses,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> so a ‘snapshot’ of disorder status at one point in time, as identified by most
screening tools, is likely to be less useful than a lifetime history. Second, traditional
diagnostic approaches to mental disorders, relying upon clinician assessment at interview,
would be prohibitively expensive in a cohort of this size. Third, using self-report of
diagnosis or data from record linkages relies upon recognition of illness and reflects
healthcare usage patterns, whereas many people with mental disorders never seek or receive
treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref> In response to these challenges, we developed a dual approach: secondary care
record linkage for identification of more severe illnesses such as schizophrenia,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref> and self-report of symptoms of common mental disorders, which might not have come
to clinical attention. As part of our mental health phenotyping programme, we therefore
developed an online mental health questionnaire (MHQ) for participants to complete
regarding lifetime symptoms of mental disorders. The MHQ aimed to exploit the efficiency
of ‘e-surveys’<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> and provide enough detail to identify mental health disorders without the need for
a clinical assessment.</p>
<p>The present paper aims to describe the development, implementation and results of this
questionnaire. We provide descriptive data on the numbers of UK Biobank participants
meeting diagnostic criteria for specific disorders, and on the frequency of exposure to
risk factors. We also evaluate the likely representativeness of respondents by comparing
respondent sociodemographic characteristics to those of the UK population using census
data, and by comparing self-reported mental disorder diagnosis with the Health Survey for
England (HSE) data.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref> This will assist researchers considering or undertaking epidemiological research
to evaluate the potential and power of using UK Biobank to look at mental health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="sec2-1">
<title>Questionnaire development</title>
<p>A mental health research reference group formed of approximately 50 individuals (see
Supplementary Appendix 1, available at <uri xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2018.12" xlink:type="simple">https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2018.12</uri>) participated in discussions about a strategy
for mental health phenotyping in UK Biobank, including a workshop in January 2015. From
this, a smaller steering group was established and led the development of the MHQ. The
group recommended that the MHQ should concentrate on depression, as it was likely to
represent the greatest burden in the cohort, with some questions about other common
disorders, including anxiety, alcohol misuse and addiction, plus risk factors for mental
disorder not captured at participants' baseline assessment.</p>
<p>The intention was to create a composite questionnaire from previously existing and
validated measures, taking into account participant acceptability (time, ease of use and
ensuring questions were unlikely to offend), scope for collaborations with international
studies (e.g. the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium) through making results comparable, and
the need to balance depth and breadth of phenotyping. The basis of the questionnaire was
the measurement of lifetime depressive disorder using the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview Short Form (CIDI-SF),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref> modified to provide lifetime history, as used to identify cases and controls for
some existing studies in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. The CIDI-SF uses a branching
structure with screening questions and skip-rules to limit detailed questions to the
relevant areas for each participant. Other measures were then added to this, as summarised
in Supplementary Table SM1. Where the group were unable to find existing measures that
fulfilled these criteria, questions were written or adapted, as indicated in SM1. These
sections have not been externally validated, but the questions can be seen, along with the
full questionnaire, on the UK Biobank website (<uri xlink:href="http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=22" xlink:type="simple">http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=22</uri>) for researchers to evaluate
how they wish to use them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-2">
<title>Testing and ethical approval</title>
<p>The use of branching questions in the MHQ means that those with established and multiple
mental disorders have a longer, more detailed, questionnaire. To improve acceptability in
this group, we worked with a patient advisory group at the National Institute of Health
Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS
Foundation Trust in designing the questionnaire and invitation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref> We then piloted the questionnaire among an online cohort of 14 836 volunteers aged
over 50 and living in the UK, who completed the questionnaire as part of signing up to
take part in the Platform for Research Online to investigate Genetics and Cognition in
Ageing (PROTECT).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref> Of those who started the questionnaire, 98.8% completed it, taking a median time
of 15 min. Some PROTECT participants commented that they wanted the opportunity to explain
why they felt they had experienced symptoms of depression. In response to this, we added a
question to the depression section on loss or bereavement, and a free-text box – neither
were designed to change diagnostic algorithms, but may add to future analyses.</p>
<p>The questionnaire was approved as a substantial amendment to UK Biobank by the North West
– Haydock Research Ethics Committee, 11/NW/0382.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-3">
<title>Administration to UK Biobank participants</title>
<p>We incorporated the final MHQ into the UK Biobank web questionnaire platform and
presented it to participants as an online questionnaire entitled ‘thoughts and feelings’.
We sent participants who had agreed to email contact a hyperlink to their personalised
questionnaire. The invitation explained the importance of collecting further information
about mental health and emphasised that UK Biobank was unable to respond to concerns
raised by the participant in the questionnaire, instead directing them to several sources
of potential support. Participants could skip questions they preferred not to answer, and
they could save answers to return to the questionnaire later. We sent reminder emails at 2
weeks and 4 months to those who had not started or had partially completed the
questionnaire. The MHQ will continue to be available on the participant area of the UK
Biobank website, and the annual postal newsletter contains an invitation to log on to the
participant area and complete the MHQ, to reach those for whom no email contact was
possible. Data from this questionnaire will therefore continue to accrue. The current
numbers and aggregate data can be accessed from the public data showcase (<uri xlink:href="http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/label.cgi?id=136" xlink:type="simple">http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/label.cgi?id=136</uri>). More detail on the roll
out and associated communications can be found on the UK Biobank website (<uri xlink:href="http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=22" xlink:type="simple">http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=22</uri>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-4">
<title>Defining cases from the MHQ</title>
<p>Case definitions for the evaluation of the responses to the MHQ are detailed in
Supplementary Appendix 2. They arose either from the instruments used in the MHQ or by
consensus criteria agreed by the working committee who wrote the MHQ. Diagnostic criteria
were evaluated for depression (major depressive disorder), hypomania or mania, generalised
anxiety disorder, alcohol use disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Addiction to substances and/or behaviour was defined based on self-report alone. Unusual
experiences (describing potential symptoms of psychosis) and self-harm were also defined
as phenomena that are important for phenotyping, but not disorder specific. We combined
outcomes to divide the cohort into five mood disorder groups, as shown in Supplementary
Figure MD1.</p>
<p>Fulfilling the diagnostic criteria based on a self-report questionnaire did not allow us
to rule out other psychiatric disorders, or psychological or situational factors that
might better explain the symptoms and may have been elicited in a clinical evaluation.
Therefore, we regarded any case classification arising from the MHQ as ‘likely’ rather
than confirmed psychiatric disorder. The issue becomes particularly problematic for
disorders that are less common in the population, such as bipolar affective disorder,
where the literature shows that using questionnaires to screen the population may
over-estimate prevalence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref> Therefore, although we reported the presence of hypomania/mania symptoms for the
whole population, we only made the likely diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder in
people with a history of depression, a sub-population where the prevalence of bipolar
affective disorder is higher, and therefore screening questionnaires have better positive
predictive values.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">

<title>Analysis and data sharing</title>
<p>Data were supplied by UK Biobank on 8th August 2017 under application number 16577. We
used R version 3.4.0 and MS Excel for analyses. We reported numbers and proportions within
the sample and did not attempt to give population prevalence estimates. The large sample
size meant that all 95% confidence intervals were less than 0.3 away from percentage
proportions and are therefore not shown.</p>
<p>The data for tables can be found in online Supplementary materials. The code is available
from Mendeley Data (<uri xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/kv677c2th4.1" xlink:type="simple">http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/kv677c2th4.1</uri>). Raw data are

</xref> For the MHQ study, 339 092 participants were sent an email invitation, and 157 366
(46% of those emailed) fully completed the questionnaire by August 2017 – which means that
the MHQ currently has 31% coverage of the UK Biobank cohort. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref> shows a flow chart of the UK Biobank participants who
completed the MHQ. The median time for completion was 14 min, and 82% of respondents
completed the questionnaire in under 25 min. <fig id="fig01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of UK Biobank participants from invitation to completion of mental health

<p>Supplementary Table SM2 shows participant characteristics for all UK Biobank participants
and those who completed the MHQ, compared with population-level data for UK residents in the
same age range. Participants were different from the whole UK Biobank cohort and the general
population in that they were better educated (e.g. 45% held a degree <italic>v.</italic> 32%
of UK Biobank participants <italic>v.</italic> 23% in the census), of higher socioeconomic
status according to job type, and healthier (longstanding illness or disability 28%
<italic>v.</italic> 32% <italic>v.</italic> 37%), with lower rates of current smoking.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab01">Table 1</xref>, 34% of respondents reported
they had received at least one psychiatric diagnosis from a professional at some time, and
12% had received two or more. The most commonly reported diagnosis was depression, followed
by ‘anxiety or nerves’. Data were compared with the HSE, because this annual survey aims to
report data that is a representative estimate for the population in England through its
sample and weighting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref> The comparison shows that the pattern and prevalence of diagnosis is similar; for
example, a depression diagnosis was self-reported by 21% of individuals in both samples,
eating disorders by around 1%, and bipolar-related disorders by around 0.5%. The definition
in the MHQ differed from that in the HSE for anxiety (MHQ definition was broader) and
addiction (MHQ did not require professional diagnosis), and the higher overall prevalence in
the UK Biobank MHQ compared with the HSE (35% <italic>v.</italic> 28%) may be due to those
wider definitions. <table-wrap id="tab01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Self-reported previous physician diagnosis<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tfn1_2">

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab02">Table 2</xref>, 35% of participants met

depression at 24%, followed by anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder (both 7%), PTSD
(6%), unusual experiences (5%) and self-harm (4%). Hypomania/mania was the least common, for
2% of respondents. As shown in Supplementary Table SM3, women were more likely than men to
have a history of one or more of the defined syndromes (39% <italic>v.</italic> 30%),
particularly depression, anxiety or PTSD. Men were more likely than women to have an alcohol

also shows the substantial comorbidity of defined syndromes. Notably, around three-quarters
of participants who met criteria for lifetime anxiety disorder also met criteria for
lifetime depression, while individuals with PTSD had at least a two-fold increase in

than those without to live in areas of higher deprivation, especially if they had bipolar
disorder or reported addiction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab03">Table 3</xref>). They
were also more likely to have had adverse life events and to have met criteria for
loneliness and, to a lesser extent, social isolation. They were more likely to have smoked
cigarettes and/or used cannabis, and to have had a ‘longstanding illness’ at baseline
(although the presence of a mental disorder may have been the illness to which the
participants referred in some cases). Achieving recommended levels of physical activity did

<p>The Supplementary materials have a section on mood disorder, showing the results of
analyses of MHQ participants by likely disorder categories (Supplementary Figure MD1).
Supplementary Table MD1 shows the features of these groups. The characteristics of people
who meet diagnostic criteria for depression appear to be shared by those with subthreshold
depressive symptoms. Supplementary Table MD2 shows comorbidity, and demonstrates a gradient
effect in the presence of a non-depression syndrome rising from 7% in no depression to 43%
in recurrent depression. Supplementary Table MD3 shows an association between the presence
of lifetime unipolar depression or bipolar affective disorder and worse scores for current
mental health.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This paper has described the development, implementation and principal descriptive findings
from the UK Biobank MHQ. The implementation of this questionnaire demonstrates that a
web-based questionnaire is an acceptable means of collecting mental health information at
low cost and large scale. Although the data collection methods might result in more limited
data acquisition than conventional interview methods, with associated uncertainties in true
diagnostic categorisation, we suggest that the survey achieved an acceptable trade-off
between depth of phenotypic information and scale of sample size.</p>
<p>The MHQ achieved a participation rate of 31% of the original UK Biobank participants and
46% of those emailed. This response rate is substantially higher than previous UK Biobank
questionnaires, largely owing to the attention paid to ensuring the acceptability of the
invitation and questionnaire and the efficient use of reminders. Those who completed the MHQ
appeared to be better educated and to have higher socioeconomic employment status than those
recruited into UK Biobank overall, and the UK population. Despite this, we found that rates
of self-reported diagnoses were similar to population estimates from the HSE. The patterns
of association between disorders and demographics were also broadly as predicted by previous
research, which adds to the face validity of the questionnaire. For example, depression and
anxiety were more common in women, while addiction and alcohol misuse were more common in
men, and all disorders were less common in respondents older than 65 years. The decrease in
prevalence of lifetime disorder with increasing age has been previously noted in
cross-sectional studies, although the causes and implications are not clearly
understood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">

<p>The ‘healthy volunteer’ selection bias within the UK Biobank has previously been
explored.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref> The influence of selection biases on disease prevalence are likely to be
particularly strong for mental disorders, where disorder status or symptoms may influence
participation in research,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">

<sup>25</sup>
</xref> and non-participation has also been associated with many risk factors for these
disorders, including polygenic risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref> Therefore, the results of the MHQ should not be used to provide prevalence
estimates. However, the pattern of the measured risk factors among the participants with
mental disorders in the MHQ, including neuroticism, trauma, loneliness and housing tenure,
was in accordance with established literature, supporting the use of the data to study the
relationships between exposures and outcomes. Previous work on health surveys with selection
bias due to non-participation, including UK Biobank, have indicated that although they can
be used to give estimates of association,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">

</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">
<sup>29</sup>
</xref> For example, the relative under-participation of unskilled workers in the MHQ
(around 21% of that expected) could mask an association with a variable that was related to
unskilled work.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1">
<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>We developed a questionnaire through a consensus approach with clear aims of capturing
enough data to characterise participants as having a lifetime history of depression and
other phenotypes. Validated instruments were used where possible. The consortium working
on the questionnaire included mental health researchers and members of the UK Biobank team
working in collaboration to develop the optimum approach. The derived variables of likely
categorical diagnoses will be added to the UK Biobank resource, facilitating those less
familiar with mental health to use the results efficiently.</p>
<p>The ‘healthy volunteer’ effect may limit applications of the data. Owing to restrictions
of time and space, the questionnaire was limited in the topics it could cover. The focus
of the questionnaire was on categorical diagnoses rather than dimensional traits, which
will tend to confirm conventional ICD/DSM nosology of psychiatric disorder and may not
suit some research.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">
<sup>30</sup>
</xref> In particular, tools were chosen that are based on DSM-IV disorders, which
reflects current practice (for example, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
guidelines on depression and anxiety use DSM-IV definitions).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">
<sup>31</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">
<sup>32</sup>
</xref> Of the disorders with operational classification, all would generalise to DSM-5,
except PTSD,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">
<sup>33</sup>
</xref> and the concepts are valid for ICD-10 disorders, although the threshold of
disorder may be different, e.g. depression is diagnosed with fewer symptoms in DSM than in
ICD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">
<sup>31</sup>
</xref> The questionnaire was heavily reliant on participant report, which may be affected
by the stigma of reporting psychiatric symptoms, and tends to underestimate lifetime
prevalence through forgetting or re-evaluating distant events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">

<sup>21</sup>
</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">
<sup>34</sup>
</xref> We hope that some of these shortcomings can be addressed in the future by a more
fine-grained analysis of the MHQ data, supplemented with other data from UK Biobank to
create a richer picture of mental health in the cohort.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>UK Biobank offers a unique opportunity to research common disorders in a
well-characterised longitudinal cohort of UK adults. A detailed MHQ has now been completed
by 157 366 participants, including self-report, operationally defined lifetime disorder
status, and detailed phenotype information on mood disorder. The proportion of cases and
the patterns of participants experiencing symptoms and disorders was as expected, despite
a ‘healthy volunteer’ selection bias. Future work on mental health phenotyping for UK
Biobank will include validation of Hospital Episode Statistics for mental health
diagnoses, validation of general practice records, and triangulation of health record and
questionnaire data. Examples of existing projects utilising the UK Biobank MHQ can be seen
in Supplementary Appendix 3, with a searchable database of approved research (<uri xlink:href="http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/approved-research/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/approved-research/</uri>).</p>
<p>This study also demonstrates the substantial burden of mental disorders. Given the known
effects of mental health on physical health, mental health data should interest
researchers from every biomedical specialty looking at associations with health and
disease. This study suggests that UK Biobank could be a powerful tool for such studies,
and, since it is open to all <italic>bona fide</italic> health researchers for work in the
public good, we hope this study will inspire both existing and new users of UK
Biobank.</p>
