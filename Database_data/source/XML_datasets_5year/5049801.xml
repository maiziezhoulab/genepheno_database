<abstract>
<p>Dysfunction of RBFOX3 has been identified in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, cognitive impairments and epilepsy and a causal relationship with these diseases has been previously demonstrated with <italic>Rbfox3</italic> homozygous knockout mice. Despite the importance of RBFOX3 during neurodevelopment, the function of RBFOX3 regarding neurogenesis and synaptogenesis remains unclear. To address this critical question, we profiled the developmental expression pattern of <italic>Rbfox3</italic> in the brain of wild-type mice and analyzed brain volume, disease-relevant behaviors, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and synaptogenesis in <italic>Rbfox3</italic> homozygous knockout mice and their corresponding wild-type counterparts. Here we report that expression of <italic>Rbfox3</italic> differs developmentally for distinct brain regions. Moreover, <italic>Rbfox3</italic> homozygous knockout mice exhibited cold hyperalgesia and impaired cognitive abilities. Focusing on hippocampal phenotypes, we found <italic>Rbfox3</italic> homozygous knockout mice displayed deficits in neurogenesis, which was correlated with cognitive impairments. Furthermore, RBFOX3 regulates the exons of genes with synapse-related function. Synaptic plasticity and density, which are related to cognitive behaviors, were altered in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of <italic>Rbfox3</italic> homozygous knockout mice; synaptic plasticity decreased and the density of synapses increased. Taken together, our results demonstrate the important role of RBFOX3 during neural development and maturation. In addition, abnormalities in synaptic structure and function occur in <italic>Rbfox3</italic> homozygous knockout mice. Our findings may offer mechanistic explanations for human brain diseases associated with dysfunctional RBFOX3.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>RBFOX3/NeuN belongs to the RNA-binding Fox (Rbfox) family of proteins and the whole family of proteins regulate alternative RNA splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref001">1</xref>]. <italic>Rbfox3</italic> is exclusively expressed in neurons and dysfunctional RBFOX3 has been observed in various human brain disorders such as epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref002">2</xref>], autism spectrum disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref003">3</xref>], neurodevelopmental delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref004">4</xref>], and cognitive impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref005">5</xref>]. We previously used <italic>Rbfox3</italic> homozygous knockout mice to demonstrate a causal relationship between RBFOX3 and these diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref006">6</xref>]. However, the function of RBFOX3 in the brain remains poorly understood. A recent study suggests RBFOX3 regulates neuronal differentiation by alternative splicing of <italic>Numb</italic> pre-mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref007">7</xref>] and our recent finding showed RBFOX3 is required for hippocampal circuit balance and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref006">6</xref>]. These two findings indicate RBFOX3 is critical for brain development but it is unclear how <italic>Rbfox3</italic> is developmentally regulated and whether RBFOX3 could contribute to normal brain and synaptic structure.</p>
<p>Cognitive deficits identified in persons with dysfunctional RBFOX3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref005">5</xref>] are similar to spatial learning deficits identified in <italic>Rbfox3</italic> homozygous knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref006">6</xref>]. Evidence also suggests the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) may also play a role in cognition, through adult neurogenesis, which affects learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref009">9</xref>] and adult synaptogenesis, which affects learning behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref011">11</xref>]. The spatial learning deficits exhibited by <italic>Rbfox3</italic> homozygous knockout mice and persons with dysfunctional RBFOX3 suggest RBFOX3 may play a role in adult neurogenesis and synaptogenesis.</p>
<p>To investigate the role of RBFOX3 during brain development with emphasis on neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, we first profiled the developmental expression pattern of <italic>Rbfox3</italic> in wild-type mice. We then used <italic>Rbfox3</italic> homozygous knockout (<italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>) mice as an animal model to determine the effects of RBFOX3 on brain volume, disease-relevant behaviors, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity and synaptogenesis. We found that expression of <italic>Rbfox3</italic> differs developmentally in distinct brain regions. In addition, <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice displayed cold hyperalgesia and impaired cognition. Consistent with hippocampal DG circuit dysfunction, <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice had defective synaptic plasticity and density in the hippocampal DG. Moreover, RBFOX3 regulates the exons of genes with synapse-related function. Our findings indicate the potential contributions of RBFOX3 to the pathogenesis of brain diseases with disrupted <italic>RBFOX3</italic>.</p>

<title>Mice</title>
<p><italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (full strain nomenclature is C57BL/6N-<italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>tm1a(EUCOMM)Hmgu</italic></sup>, EM: 04705) were purchased from the Mary Lyon Centre of MRC Harwell (Oxford, UK); detailed information about these mice can be obtained in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref006">6</xref>]. Mice were group-housed in ventilated cages, given food (PicoLab<sup>®</sup> Rodent Diet 20, 5053) and water <italic>ad libitum</italic> and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights off at 8 pm). Male <italic>Rbfox3</italic> heterozygous knockout mice were mated to female <italic>Rbfox3</italic> heterozygous knockout mice to obtain <italic>Rbfox3</italic> homozygous knockout mice and littermate control wild-type mice. The National Taiwan University College of Medicine and the College of Public Health Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all procedures in this study. All experiments in this study were performed in accordance with the approved guidelines.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Tissues were isolated and extracted from different brain regions and developmental stages. The brain hemispheres were taken randomly. Protein extracts were obtained by homogenizing tissues in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8, 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, Halt<sup>™</sup> Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (1:100, Thermo Scientific, 78440)) and protein concentration was determined with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, 23227). Total protein lysates (40 μg) were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was performed using mouse anti-NeuN (1:1,000, Millipore, MAB377) and mouse anti-beta-actin (1:5,000, Sigma, A1978) primary antibodies. Primary antibodies were detected with their corresponding secondary antibody: IRDye680 donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (1:15,000, LI-COR, 926–68072). Protein bands were visualized using an Odyssey<sup>®</sup> Fc Dual-Mode Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). The intensities of protein bands were analyzed using the Image Studio<sup>™</sup> software (LI-COR Biosciences, version 4.0.21). To control for protein loading, each protein level was normalized to beta-actin levels detected in each sample.</p>

<title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) volumetric analysis</title>
<p>Adult male mice (P56) were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused transcardially with 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB) with heparin (30 U/ml Heparin, Sigma, H-4784) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PB, pH 7.4. Mouse brains were removed, post-fixed overnight, and cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PB for two days. We determined the volumes of the whole brain and different brain regions with MRI volumetry using a Biospec 4.7T 40-cm bore horizontal MRI system. The FSE T2WI parameters are below. TR = 6000 ms, TE = 60 ms, NEX = 10, FOV = 2x2 cm, slice-thickness = 0.5 mm, matrix size = 256x256, scanning time = 32 min.</p>

<title>Behavioral measures</title>
<p>All behavioral assessments were performed with two cohorts of WT and <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> male mice. The first cohort of mice (12 WT mice and 9 <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice) was derived from 14 litters and used for gait analysis, grip force test, and prepulse inhibition test. The second cohort (8 WT mice and 8 <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice) was derived from 9 litters and used for the rotarod test, hot/cold plate test and novel object recognition test. Testing began when mice were 7–11 weeks of age (1<sup>st</sup> cohort) and 8–13 weeks of age (2<sup>nd</sup> cohort). Mice were sacrificed immediately at the end of behavioral measures and were not further used for any biochemical measures in this study.</p>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Rotarod test</title>
<p>Mice were evaluated for balance and motor coordination on an accelerating rotarod (Ugo Basile). Revolutions per minute (rpm) were set at an initial value of 3 rpm, with a progressive increase to a maximum of 30 rpm across 5 min, the maximum trial length. Test sessions consisted of 3 trials, with 1 min between each trial. Latency to fall, or to rotate off the top of the turning barrel, was determined by the rotarod timer.</p>

<title>Gait analysis</title>
<p>Mice were placed individually in an enclosed Catwalk walkway, which consisted of a glass plate plus two Plexiglas walls. The mice were allowed to walk freely and traverse from one side to the other of the walkway glass plate. Two infrared light beams were used to detect the arrival of the mouse and to control the start and end of data acquisition. The recordings were carried out when the room was completely dark. During the experiment, the crossing of the mice was captured by a high-speed video camera. The footprints and gait were automatically detected in an enclosed walkway with the CatWalk gait analysis system (Noldus Information Technology) and analyzed by CatWalk XT software. Paw pressure (light intensity), paw print area (complete surface area contacted by the paw during a stance phase) and interlimb coordination (measured as regularity index, which is the percentage of normal step sequences) were analyzed.</p>

<sec id="sec009">
<title>Grip force test</title>
<p>Grip-strength of forelimbs was measured by the Grip force test system (UGO Basile). When pulled by the tail, the mice instinctively grasp anything to stop backward movement. Mice were placed over a base plate before a grasping bar. The bar was fitted to a force transducer connected to the peak amplifier. Using this device, mice were pulled by the tail and maximal grip force (g) was measured within 20 seconds. Test sessions consisted of 3 trials, with 10 min between each trial.</p>

<sec id="sec010">
<title>Hot/cold plate test</title>
<p>Hot/cold plate test measures thermal nociception. The hot plate apparatus (Ugo Basile) was maintained at 55.0±1°C. Mice were placed into a glass cylinder of 20 cm diameter on the heated surface, and the time between placing of the mouse on the hot plate and the occurrence of licking of hind paws or jumping off the surface was recorded as response latency (s). A 50 s cut-off was used to prevent tissue damage. The cold plate test used the same instrument and procedures as the hot plate apparatus (Ugo Basile), however the surface was maintained at 0.0±1°C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec011">
<title>Prepulse inhibition measurements</title>
<p>Prepulse inhibition (PPI) was determined with the acoustic startle measure, which is based on the reflexive whole-body flinch, or startle response, following exposure to a sudden noise. Mice were tested with the Startle reflex test system (San Diego Instruments SR-LAB). Briefly, mice were placed in a small Plexiglas cylinder within a larger, sound-attenuating chamber (San Diego Instruments). The cylinder was seated upon a piezoelectric transducer, which allowed vibrations to be quantified and displayed on a computer. The chamber included a houselight, fan, and a loudspeaker for the acoustic stimuli (bursts of white noise). Background noise levels (70 dB) and calibration of the acoustic stimuli were confirmed with a digital sound level meter (San Diego Instruments). Each test session consisted of 56 trials, presented following a 4-min habituation period. There were four different types of trials: no-stimulus trials, trials with the acoustic startle stimulus (40 ms; 115 dB) alone, and trials in which a prepulse stimulus (20 ms; either 77 or 86 dB) had onset 100 ms before the onset of the startle stimulus. The different trial types were presented in blocks of four, in randomized order within each block, with an average inter-trial interval of 15 sec (range: 10 to 20 sec). Measures were taken of the startle amplitude for each trial, defined as the peak response during a 65-msec sampling window that began with the onset of the startle stimulus. The percentage PPI of the startle response was calculated as 100 –[(SRPP/SR) x 100], where SR means the startle response to the pulse stimulus and SRPP means the startle response to the pulse with the prepulse stimulus.</p>

<title>Novel object recognition test</title>
<p>The novel object recognition test measures recognition memory. The test was carried out in an open field box measuring 47 cm x 26 cm x 21 cm. Mice were habituated to the test box for 10 min for the first 2 days with no objects present in the environment (the habituation phase). On the third day, mice were placed in the test box and after a 10-min habituation period, two identical objects were introduced in two corners (approximately 20 cm apart from each other). The objects used in this study were 4 cm x 4 cm x 4 cm plastic blocks (the familiarization phase). The total time spent exploring each object was recorded using a 20s criterion for exploration time. Then the mice were returned to their home cage. After 24-hr the mice were placed in the test box once again and the test phase began. The test box contained one of the familiar objects used in the previous training session and a novel object. Since mice showed no preference for particular objects or locations, the novel objects were introduced on the right side of the test box. The time spent exploring the familiar and the novel object during the testing phase was represented as <italic>a</italic>, and <italic>b</italic>, respectively. The discrimination index was calculated as (<italic>b</italic>-<italic>a</italic>)/(<italic>a</italic>+<italic>b</italic>). Two different cohorts were conducted for the novel object recognition test. We normalized the discrimination index for each cohort of data before combining the two cohorts.</p>

<title>Neurogenesis analysis</title>
<p>Adult mice (P80) were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused transcardially with 0.1M PB, pH 7.4 with heparin (30 U/ml Heparin, Sigma, H-4784) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PB, pH 7.4. Mouse brains were removed, post-fixed overnight, and cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PB for two days. Coronal sections of the hippocampus were cut at a thickness of 40 μm on a sliding microtome. Sections were mounted on SuperFrost slides and dried overnight. Subsequently, slides were incubated in 0.01 mol/L citrate buffer for 40 min at 90°C, 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 10 min, rinsed in PBS, and incubated overnight at room temperature in a goat polyclonal antibody to DCX (1:400, Santa Cruz, sc-8066) or a mouse monoclonal antibody to Ki67 (1:3000, Vector Lab, VP-K451). The following day, sections were stained with biotinylated secondary antibodies (standard IgG ABC kit, Vector Lab, PK-6105 for DCX; PK6101 for Ki67) followed by incubation for 5–10 min in 3’3’-diaminobenzidene (Sigma). Sections were then counterstained with cresyl violet and mounted with DPX (Sigma, 06522). Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 microscope with a 10X/0.3 NA objective. DCX- and Ki-67-positive cells were counted in every eighth section throughout the entire rostrocaudal extent of the DG hemilaterally (6 sections per mouse brain). The DCX- and Ki-67-positive cells in all focal planes through the 40-μm section were included. The total number of labelled cells per section was determined and multiplied by section selection ratio (eight) and the number of DG per mouse brain (two) to obtain the total number of labelled cells in the DG.</p>

<title>Hippocampal slice preparation</title>
<p>Mice (P48 to P51) were anaesthetized with 5% isoflurane in oxygen-enriched air and decapitated.

Hippocampal slices were cut coronally at 350 μm in dissection buffer using a vibroslicer (VT 1200S, Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL). Prior to recording, slices were allowed to recover by incubating for 30 min in 30°C artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) consisting of (mM): 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 20 glucose (pH, 7.4; 295 mOsmol) and gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. And then maintaining in a moist air-liquid (ACSF) interface chamber at room temperature for 60 min. Individual slices were transferred to an immersion-type recording chamber mounted on an upright microscope (Axio Examiner D1, Zeiss) and continuously perfused with oxygenated ACSF at a rate of 2–3 ml/min and maintained at 30–32°C. Neurons were viewed using Nomarski optics.</p>

<title>Field potential recordings</title>
<p>Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in coronal hippocampal slices with borosilicate glass electrodes (1.5-mm outer diameter, 0.32-mm wall thickness; Sutter, Novato, CA, USA) with a resistance of approximately 2–3 MΩ when filled with ACSF. Both recording electrode and bipolar stainless steel electrode (CBCMX75 (ST1)), FHC, Inc., Bowdoinham, ME, USA) were posed in the medial perforant path of the molecular layer. fEPSPs were recorded in the presence of 5 μM SR95531 (Abcam, ab120042), 3μM CGP54626 (Tocris, 1088) and 1μM Strychnine (Abcam, ab120416) and were evoked every 20 s. In each experiment, an input-output (I-O) relationship was plotted by the initial slope of the fEPSP versus the fiber volley. Stimulus intensity was adjusted to about 30% amplitude of the maximum fEPSPs. Paired stimuli were delivered between 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 ms apart and paired-pulse ratios (PPR) were measured by dividing the initial slope of the second fEPSP by the initial slope of the first fEPSP. For chemical induced LTD (chemical-LTD) recoding, 50 ms paired stimuli were delivered for inducing fEPSP and monitoring PPR. 30 μM DHPG (Tocris, 0342) was added into bath solution for 20 minute to induce chemical-LTD following 20-min stable baseline recording. In rescue experiments, 100 nM bryostatin-1 (Tocris, 2383) or vehicle was applied in whole recording (from 20 min baseline to 60 min chemical-LTD). Changes in synaptic strength were measured by comparing the average response slopes 45–60 min after conditioning stimulation to the pre-conditioning baseline response (5–20 min).</p>

The details of RNA quality check, cDNA library construction, and differential gene expression analysis have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref006">6</xref>]. For exon usage analysis, DEXSeq, a statistical method to test for differential exon usage in RNA-Seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref012">12</xref>], was applied in this study. We aligned the RNA-Seq reads from WT and KO samples to the mouse genome (Ensembl 69) using BWA. After alignment, we selected the exons with 10 reads mapped to further DEXSeq analysis, and a false discovery rate of 1% was set to find significant differential exon usage. For binding pattern recognition, we fetched seq of the 500 bp upstream and downstream of each exon of the mouse ref genome (Ensembl 69) to find the TGCATG pattern in these sequences.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Dysfunctional RBFOX3 has been identified in various neurological disorders such as epilepsy, cognitive impairments, developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. How exactly RBFOX3 causes its related brain disorders remains unclear and the role of RBFOX3 in the brain is largely unknown. Our data show that expression of <italic>Rbfox3</italic> differed developmentally for distinct brain regions and deletion of <italic>Rbfox3</italic> resulted in decreased neurogenesis. <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice displayed cold hyperalgesia, impaired cognition and defective synaptic plasticity. Synapse-related genes are downstream targets of RBFOX3 and deletion of <italic>Rbfox3</italic> resulted in increased numbers of excitatory synapses.</p>
<p>RBFOX3 expression peaked at P14 in the hippocampus and amygdala and at P21 in the cerebral cortex, striatum and cerebellum. The peak of RBFOX3 expression is within the course of maturation for these distinct brain regions: at least 28 days in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref027">27</xref>], amygdala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref028">28</xref>], striatum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref029">29</xref>], and cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref032">32</xref>]; and at least 30 days in the cerebral cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref034">34</xref>]. This developmental match indicates the important role of RBOFX3 during brain development. In addition, this developmental expression of <italic>Rbfox3</italic> is consistent with previous findings for developmental expression patterns of <italic>Rbfox3</italic> in the whole brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref035">35</xref>]. In our current study, we not only detected cognitive deficits in <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice with alternate behavioral tests of learning (novel object recognition test) but also examined other behavioral phenotypes related to changes in brain structures and autistic phenotypes. The observation of cold hyperalgesia in <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice is indicative of a sensory abnormality, similar to abnormalities of pain experienced by persons with autism spectrum disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref018">18</xref>]. Therefore, it will be important to conduct additional studies to determine how RBFOX3 contributes to this phenotype. Our previous finding showed a reduction in anxious behavior in <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref006">6</xref>]. The circuitry for fear and anxiety is associated with the amygdala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref036">36</xref>], and although not significant, the observation of a trend toward a decreased volume in the amygdala is consistent with the anxiety behavior in <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice. This suggests further investigations of the role of RBFOX3 in fear and anxiety should be explored.</p>
<p>Postnatal neurogenesis occurs throughout adult life in the subgranular layer of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and has been suggested to play a critical role in cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref037">37</xref>]. Postnatal neurogenesis is a dynamic process, which is regulated by an enriched external environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref040">40</xref>] and the complex heterogeneous cellular environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref041">41</xref>]. The hippocampal subgranular layer contains constituent cell types, which include progenitor and dividing cells, immature granule cells, astrocytes and GABAergic interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref041">41</xref>]. Among these different cellular inputs, activity-dependent regulation by GABA neurotransmission has been shown to influence key steps of adult hippocampal neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref043">43</xref>]. <italic>Rbfox3</italic> is only expressed in postmitotic neurons and our results show that decreased hippocampal neurogenesis occurs in <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. This suggests that RBFOX3 may contribute to the complex heterogeneous cellular environment for hippocampal neurogenesis through GABAergic interneurons. It would be interesting to further investigate whether RBFOX3 could affect other neurogenic areas such as the subventricular zone (SVZ), to verify whether the effect on neurogenesis through RBFOX3 is universal or brain region-specific. For instance, neuronal stem cells in the olfactory bulb originate from all rostrocaudal areas of the SVZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref044">44</xref>], therefore, it would be interesting to examine the SVZ of <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice to determine if there is a deficit in neurogenesis and an alteration of olfactory phenotypes. However, because Ki67 is a marker for proliferative cells, and the variation of its number may include changes in the number of glial cells in addition to DCX-positive cells, we can not exclude the possibility that decreased neurogenesis in <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice is accompanied by a decrease in gliogenesis. Unfortunately, examining gliogenesis was out of the scope of this study and was not investigated it further.</p>
<p>In our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref006">6</xref>], we showed that RBFOX3 regulates excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity, dendritic complexity, spine density as well as affecting synapse-related behavior. The current study demonstrates RBFOX3 also affects synaptic number and chemically-induced long-term plasticity (DHPG-LTD). Electrically and chemically-induced long-term depression use different receptors and upstream mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref022">22</xref>], therefore, the findings in this study suggest RBFOX3 downstream targets could control both upstream molecules. Importantly, since abnormal synaptic transmission and plasticity were also observed in other brain regions such as hippocampal CA1 of <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref006">6</xref>], our observations of deficits of neurogenesis in the DG do not fully explain abnormal synaptic formation and plasticity in the DG of <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice. Moreover, the functions of the downstream targets of RBFOX3 are predominantly synapse-related. The exon usage of those synapse-related genes was affected in <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice, also indicating alterations in synapse-related genes and abnormal patterns of synaptic markers are not fully due to disrupted neurogenesis. Future studies should determine how RBFOX3 regulates its synapse-related targets and which targets can rescue phenotypes in <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice.</p>
<p>Our earlier study observed increased spine density in the granule cells of <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref006">6</xref>], and although synapses are built on dendritic spines which are correlated with synapses, immature spines do not represent synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref046">46</xref>]. Therefore, to validate our previous findings, we examined the synaptic number with synaptic protein markers. There were significant increases in the number of synapses in <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice, confirming our previous results, which strongly suggest RBFOX3 plays an important role in synaptic formation, maturation, function and plasticity. It has been shown that excitatory/inhibitory synaptic imbalance contributes to autistic features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref047">47</xref>] and seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0164164.ref048">48</xref>]. Therefore, the increased number of excitatory synapses in <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice could disturb the balance of excitatory and inhibition synaptic input, which could provide a potential explanation of autistic features and seizures observed in persons with disrupted RBFOX3.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results show that RBFOX3 contributes significantly to neural and synaptic maturation and function. Our observations of developmental expression of <italic>Rbfox3</italic> suggest RBFOX3 plays a crucial role during brain development. Our data also suggest RBFOX3 plays an important role in maintaining an environment for normal neurogenesis. Deficits of short-term and long-term plasticity in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice indicate RBFOX3 is essential for synaptic function. The combined data showing downstream targets of RBFOX3 are synapse-related and excitatory synapses increase in <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice suggest RBFOX3 plays a role in the mediation of synaptic formation and function. It will be important to conduct additional studies to better quantify the trend towards a decrease in amygdala volume in <italic>Rbfox3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice. Future studies are needed to precisely determine how presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins function under the control of RBFOX3. Understanding these relationships could lead to the development of therapeutic agents, which could be used to target areas affected by dysfunctional RBFOX3 in persons with RBFOX3 neurodevelopmental brain disorders.</p>
