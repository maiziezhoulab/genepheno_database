<abstract>
<p>Nervous wreck (Nwk), a protein that is present at Type 1 glutamatergic synapses that contains an SH3 domain and an FCH motif, is a <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of the human srGAP3/MEGAP protein, which is associated with mental retardation. Confocal microscopy revealed that circles in Nwk reticulum enclosed T-shaped active zones (T-AZs) and partially colocalized with synaptic vesicle (SV) markers and both exocytosis and endocytosis components. Results from an electron microscopic (EM) analysis showed that Nwk proteins localized at synaptic edges and in SV pools. Both the synaptic areas and the number of SVs in the readily releasable (RRPs) and reserve (RPs) SV pools in <italic>nw</italic>k<sup>2</sup> were significantly reduced. Synergistic, morphological phenotypes observed from <italic>eag</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> neuromuscular junctions suggested that Nwk may regulate synaptic plasticity differently from activity-dependent Hebbian plasticity. Although the synaptic areas in <italic>eag</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> boutons were not significantly different from those of <italic>nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>, the number of SVs in the RRPs was similar to those of Canton-S. In addition, three-dimensional, high-voltage EM tomographic analysis demonstrated that significantly fewer enlarged SVs were present in <italic>nw</italic>k<sup>2</sup> RRPs. Furthermore, Nwk formed protein complexes with <italic>Drosophila</italic> Synapsin and Synaptotagmin 1 (<italic>D</italic>Sypt1). Taken together, these findings suggest that Nwk is able to maintain synaptic architecture and both SV size and distribution at T-AZs by interacting with Synapsin and <italic>D</italic>Sypt1.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Normal development, maintenance and plasticity of neuronal circuits and synaptic architectures are critical for proper brain functions in humans and other animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Defects in one or more genes involved with neuronal wirings or with synapse formation, development, differentiation, plasticity or transmission have been identified as the causes of many neurological disorders, including mental retardations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Fragile X-syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Rett syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> autism,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Angelman syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> and mild learning disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> The causative mutations may induce abnormal development of neuronal connections or synaptic architectures by perturbing one or more molecular or cellular mechanisms underlying homeostatic regulatory mechanisms, Hebbian plasticity or both.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> Hebbian plasticity is the idea that strengthening or weakening synaptic efficacy in neuronal circuits is mainly determined by correlated presynaptic and postsynaptic activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Increased neuronal excitabilities can strengthen neuronal circuits by increasing the sizes of synapses, and decreased neuronal activities can eliminate synaptic connections. Activity-dependent Hebbian plasticity may explain how long-term potentiation or depression is accomplished without extensive genetic instruction. Nevertheless, without a homeostatic regulatory mechanism keeping neuronal circuits from runaway excitation or quiescence, Hebbian plasticity may not be sufficient to explain how synaptic architectures and neuronal circuits in the brains maintain excitability within physiological limits during learning and development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> Homeostatic regulatory mechanisms are considered to have important roles in maintaining some consistency in neuronal properties despite the changes induced by activity-dependent Hebbian plasticity by altering preneuronal and/or postneuronal properties, such as synaptic vesicle (SV) release probability, synapse sizes, neurotransmitter receptor localization or retrograde signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because the basic functional unit in the brain is a single synapse,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> in order to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and the molecular and cellular etiologies underlying neuronal disorders, identifying the molecular components localizes at synapses and investigating their roles <italic>in vivo</italic> are among the major foci in modern molecular neuro-genetics. The basic molecular components and neuronal signaling pathways in excitatory synapses in the human brains have been shown to be faithfully conserved at Type 1 glutamatergic synapses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Therefore, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity have been intensively investigated in Type 1 glutamatergic synapses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval NMJs, the best-characterized synapses. A plethora of studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval NMJs have shown that homeostatic regulatory mechanisms and Hebbian plasticity are present and actively participate in regulating the development, differentiation and plasticity of neuronal circuits and synapse architectures. Genetic alterations in neuronal activity have resulted in either increased or decreased synapse sizes in larval NMJs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> accompanied by alterations in the localization and composition of synaptic molecular components that form postsynaptic or presynaptic terminal macromolecular complexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Synaptic macromolecular complexes harbor synaptic scaffolding proteins, cell adhesion molecules, ion channels, various protein kinases and neurotransmitter receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> In addition, SVs are linked to active zones (including exocytosis and endocytosis machineries) by proteins regulating the trafficking of SVs from the reserve pool (RP) to readily releasable pool (RRP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> The <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of evolutionary conserved molecular components present at synapses were revealed by studies using available mutant alleles in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Discs large (DLG), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of membrane-associated guanylated kinase (MAGUK) family proteins, are critical for the proper targeting and localization of Shaker type K<sup>+</sup> channels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell adhesion molecule, Fasciclin II (FasII),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> at synapses. Mutations in various K<sup>+</sup> channels are resulted in increased sizes of synapses at larval NMJs, a typical example of Hebbian plasticity. In addition, hyperpolarization of muscle resting potentials via transgenic expression of inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channel Kir2.1 induced increased presynaptic release of neurotransmitters to produce normal levels of depolarization, a typical example of homeostatic regulatory mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Furthermore, CaMKII and cAMP-dependent protein kinase have been shown to be involved with homeostatic regulatory mechanisms via regulating retrograde signaling that alters the physiological properties at the presynaptic terminals.</p>
<p>Nervous wreck (Nwk), a SRC homology 3 (SH3) domain and Fes/Cip4 homology-Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs167 (F-Bar) domain containing protein present at Type 1 glutamatergic synapses in reticular structures, is a <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of human SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase activating protein 3 (srGAP3)/mental disorder associated GTPase-acting protein (MEGAP), which has been linked to severe mental retardation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup>
<italic>nwk</italic> was identified as a negative regulator of structural and functional synaptic plasticity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Key morphological phenotypes in NMJs in <italic>nwk</italic> loss-of-function mutants, such as increased numbers of synaptic bouton, were similar to those observed from mutations inducing increased neural activity, a classical example of Hebbian plasticity. However, the existence of other phenotypes, such as smaller synaptic boutons and synapses that were different from NMJs in hyperexcitability mutants suggested that <italic>nwk</italic> may not participate in canonical activity-dependent Hebbian plasticity. In this study, we provide genetic, anatomical and biochemical evidence supporting our hypothesis that ‘Nwk regulates synaptic plasticity by regulating synapse architecture and maintaining SV sizes and pools’.</p>

Donkey anti-mouse Alexa-488 and anti-rabbit-Alexa 568 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were used as secondary antibodies. The numbers of synaptic boutons on muscles 6 and 7 in the abdominal segment 2 were counted under epifluorescence microscopy. The lengths of synaptic branches and sizes of synaptic boutons were measured using measure functions in NIH Image J (Bethesda, MD, USA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> A Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkorchen, Germany) was used to acquire images of samples.

<p>The relative intensities of anti-FasII immunoreactivity were calculated from single-slice confocal images of synaptic boutons on muscles 6 and 7 in the abdominal segment 2 processed with the anti-FasII antibody 1D4 under similar conditions. Briefly, the longitudinal axis of the synaptic boutons were decided and lines at an angle of approximately 0°, 90°, 180° and 270° from that axis were traced from the center of the synaptic bouton to the outer limit occupied by FasII immunoreactivity. Then the maximum intensity along lines (on a linear scale of 0–255) was determined using the Plot Profile function of Scion Image analysis program (version 1.62). To quantify FasII immunoreactivity at synaptic boutons, 57 synaptic boutons in <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup>, 83 in CS, 70 in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup>, 79 in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>Df</italic> or 60 in <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> from 4 independent NMJs processed simultaneously were used for quantification.

<p>Third-instar wandering-tage control and mutant larvae were dissected in ice-cold Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free saline and then fixed with 0.005% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 <sc>M</sc> PB for 1 h. Body wall muscle preparations were marked and processed in the same well. After washing three times with 0.1 <sc>M</sc> PB with 0.2% Triton-X 100 (PBT), samples were incubated with rabbit anti-Nwk antibodies (diluted 1:2,000) overnight at 4 °C. After being blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin and 4% normal goat serum in 0.1 <sc>M</sc> PB, tissues were incubated with anti-rabbit-IgG conjugated to 1 nm gold (1:200 diluted; Nanoprobes.com, Yaphank, NY, USA). After washing three times with PBT, silver enhancement of nano-gold particles was performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendation (Nanoprobes) for 10 min. After washing with H<sub>2</sub>O for 5 min, samples were incubated with gold enhancement solution for 5 min. Gold enhancement was used to prevent silver deposits from etching. Silver- and gold-enhanced tissues were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 <sc>M</sc> PB overnight. Tissues were washed three times with dH<sub>2</sub>O, fixed with 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> in 0.1 <sc>M</sc> PB for 1 h and then dehydrated in serial EtOH and 100% Propylene-oxide (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, USA). Tissues were embedded with Spurr’s resin (Ted Pella Inc.) and polymerized at 60 °C overnight. The membrane-coated one-slot grids were used to collect serial thin sections (100 nm) and observed under a Jeol 1011 (Jeol Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Only Type 1b synaptic boutons on muscle 6 and 7 in the abdominal segment 2 were used for examination.</p>

<p>Ten wandering-stage third-instar larvae were dissected in ice-cold Ca<sup>2+</sup> free saline and homogenized in ice-cold radio-immuno-precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (150 m<sc>M</sc> NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% Na-oxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 50 m<sc>M</sc> Tris, pH 8.0; Sigma-Aldrich) with protease inhibitors (Halt protease inhibitor cocktail, ThermoFisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). After being centrifuged at 14 000 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris, the amount of protein in each supernatant was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). A total of 20.0 μg of protein from each sample was separated on a 10% tris-glycine polyacrylamide SDS gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The membranes were probed with rabbit anti-Nwk antibodies. Mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody was used as a loading control.</p>

<p>Twenty wandering-stage third-instar larvae were dissected in ice-cold Ca<sup>2+</sup> free saline and homogenized in ice-cold RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors (Halt protease inhibitor cocktail, ThermoFisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Supernatants were collected by spinning down at 14 000 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein A+G agarose beads (SantaCruz Biotech., San Jose, CA, USA) were blocked with RIPA buffer with 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h with rolling at 4 °C. After being washed three times with RIPA buffer, protein A+G agarose beads were mixed with the supernatants, which contained 20 μl of Mab-Synapsin and were rocked overnight at 4 °C. Protein A+G agarose beads were harvested by centrifugation at 14 000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C, washing three times with RIPA buffer and then boiling with 1 × SDS sample buffer.

The specimens were tilted from−60° to+60° and imaged at 1° steps (121 images per view) using a high-voltage electron microscope (HVEM; Jeol) operated at 1 MV. Tilted images were aligned using the IMOD software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> to visualize three-dimensional (3D) structures of synapses and active zones.

<title>Nwk reticulum localizes at the peri-synaptic area and SVs</title>
<p>The precise localization patterns of Nwk at Type I glutamatergic boutons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval NMJs were examined by performing anti-Nwk immunocytochemistry. The specificity of anti-Nwk in immunocytochemistry was confirmed by using <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> null mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Nwk signals were observed mainly at the presynaptic terminals of Type I boutons and did not overlap with DLG signals in wild-type CS NMJs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). DLG has been shown to be present mainly at the postsynaptic terminals of Type I boutons that have elaborated and convoluted membrane structures, named subsynaptic reticulum (SSR).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> However, the outer boundaries of Nwk immuno-reactivity overlapped with anti-HRP signals, indicating neuronal membrane structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> and suggesting that Nwk is distributed within the presynaptic terminals of Type I boutons at the confocal microscopic level. No detectable Nwk signals were observed from NMJs or muscles of <italic>nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1C2</xref>), even though anti-DLG and anti-HRP signals appeared to be normal in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> NMJs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1C1</xref>).</p>
<p>The localization patterns of Nwk at synapses in Type 1b boutons in CS were further revealed by serial double-labeling confocal microscopy employing antibodies targeting Nwk and other synaptic or cytoskeletal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Nwk signals, indicated in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, were distributed at the presynaptic terminals in reticular structures that were formed of several interlinked circles and termed Nwk reticulum. Nwk reticulum at the presynaptic terminal was observed from the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) through the center of synaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1a and c–n</xref>). Narrow passages clear of Nwk signals are present in the middle of boutons indicated by gray arrow heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and c–e</xref>). A single-slice confocal image taken from the midline of a bouton double-labeled for anti-Nwk and the T-AZ marker, Mab-Brp,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> indicated that Nwk circles were present at the peri-active zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Double-labeling with a postsynaptic density maker (Mab-<italic>D</italic>GluRIIA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> showed that Nwk circles directly faced the edges of postsynaptic densities. There was a hole at the center of <italic>D</italic>GluRIIA signals corresponding to T-AZs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>) indicated by a white arrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). When another postsynaptic density marker, anti-<italic>Drosophila</italic> p-21 activated protein kinase (<italic>D</italic>pak, red), was used for double-labeling with Mab-Brp (green), T-AZs were localized at the center of postsynaptic density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>). FasII, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of cell adhesion molecule has been shown to be localized on both the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes in Type I glutamatergic NMJs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Anti-Nwk and Mab-FasII double-labeling experiments showed that Nwk reticulum and FasII signals are not overlapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). FasII signals were observed surrounding circles in the Nwk reticulum but were not present on the inner sides of Nwk circles. In addition, FasII was present at the narrow passages in the middle of synaptic boutons that were clear of Nwk signals pointed by gray arrow heads. In addition, FasII signals did not colocalize with Mab-Brp signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>). These distribution patterns suggested that Nwk circles are closer to T-AZs than FasII signals at the presynaptic membranes and may regulate synapse stability. Double-labeling with a postsynaptic terminal maker (anti-DLG) showed that the Nwk reticulum was restricted to within the presynaptic terminals of Type Ib boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p>
<p>Distribution patterns of Nwk reticulum at the presynaptic terminals were further analyzed by using SV markers, such as Mab-Synapsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), anti-<italic>D</italic>Sypt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) or Mab-<italic>D</italic>csp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>); molecular components of exocytosis compartments, such as n-syb-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>), and endocytosis markers, such as anti-LAP180 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>) and anti-Dap 160 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). Nwk reticulum was partially colocalized with SV markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1e–g</xref>), n-syb-GFP signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>) and LAP-180 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>), as indicated by the yellow colors clearly visible in the merged images. Interestingly, anti-Dap160 and anti-Nwk signals partially colocalized at Type Ib boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). Previous studies in <italic>dap160</italic> loss-of-function mutant showed that Nwk localizations at boutons was impaired, even though Dap160 localization at <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> boutons was not clearly perturbed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>To understand how Nwk reticulum is linked to the cytoskeleton in the presynaptic terminals, the microtubule marker Mab-Futsch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1k and l</xref>) and Actin-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1m</xref>) were used to reveal cytoskeleton networks in the boutons. Presynaptic Futsch–microtubule structures traversed the synaptic boutons that were not undergoing division or sprouting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>). However, synaptic boutons undergoing division or sprouting were usually present at the end of synaptic branches and did not have Futsch–microtubule cytoskeleton loops. Instead, Futsch–microtubule signals were diffuse and present at the center of Nwk circles, indicating that the destabilization of Futsch–microtubule loop structures is a critical process for dividing or sprouting synaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> These results suggested that Nwk reticulum is not directly linked to microtubules. However, Nwk reticulum at the bouton midline were partially colocalized with Actin-GFP signals, reinforcing previous reports that interactions between Nwk and the Actin cytoskeleton are important for structural and functional synaptic plasticity at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval NMJs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Neuroglian, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> L1 homolog shown to be involved with axon pathfinding, was present on both the presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals but was not colocalized with Nwk in Type 1b boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1m</xref>). In addition, Nwk reticulum partially colocalized with Hiw, shown to be related with FasII-independent synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1o</xref>). Western blots from larval body wall muscle extracts of CS, <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> and <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>/Df</italic> were probed sequentially with anti-Nwk or Mab-α-Tubulin (12G10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1p</xref>). Two strong NWK bands of approximately 110 Kda that were clearly seen from CS body wall muscle extracts were not present in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> or <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>/Df</italic> body wall muscle extracts, even though similar intensities of α-Tubulin bands were detected. At least two abundant alternate splicing NWK variants are present in synapses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval NMJs. These precise and comparative localization patterns of Nwk reticulum suggest that NWK may be important for regulating synapse sizes and the trafficking of SV pools.</p>

<title>Localization of Nwk at synapse edges and reserve SVs were revealed by immuno-EM</title>
<p>Anti-Nwk immuno-EM analysis was performed to obtain further information regarding subsynaptic localization patterns of Nwk at synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Most silver- and gold-enhanced anti-Nwk particles were distributed at the edge of synapses (46.2%) or within SV pools (44.6%) in Type 1b synaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Two different types of SV pools at the presynaptic terminals of <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs have been suggested.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> The SVs involved with exocytosis present near the T-AZs are called the RRP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> In contrast, SVs that are broadly distributed inside synaptic boutons are called the RP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> At the EM levels, SVs near the T-AZs were considered as RRP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> Therefore, the localization of Nwk particles in either the RRP or RP was further characterized. In this study, SVs present within 200 nm from the stub of T-AZs were considered to be in the RRP and were otherwise considered be in the RP. Among the 29 particles localized at the SV pools, 5 particles were present in the RRP and 24 particles in the RP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2c–e</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Synaptic terminals of Type Ib boutons in <italic>nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> NMJs processed simultaneously with CS NMJs showed significantly reduced numbers of NWK particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Even though three times more thin sections obtained from <italic>nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> NMJs than those of CS NMJs were examined, only three Nwk particles were observed at the presynaptic terminals and five particles at the postsynaptic terminals or muscles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These immuno-EM results reinforced the subsynaptic distribution patterns of NWK at the edge of synapses and SV pools and suggesting possible roles of NWK in regulating synapse stability and transmission.</p>

<title>Synergistic phenotypes in the bouton numbers and branch extension in eag<sup>1</sup>;nwk<sup>2</sup> NMJs</title>
<p>Consistent with localization patterns of Nwk at the presynaptic terminals of Type 1 glutamtergic NMJs, several morphological phenotypes, including increased numbers of synaptic boutons, extended length of synaptic branches and reduced sizes of synaptic bouton area, were observed from <italic>nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> null mutant NMJs when those phenotypes from CS NMJs were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3b1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">31–3k</xref>). The numbers of synaptic boutons in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> NMJs were significantly increased compared with those in CS NMJs (CS, 112.0±3.27; <italic>nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>, 148.2±3.22; <italic>nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>/<italic>Df</italic>, 150.1±4.63) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>). The increased numbers of synaptic boutons have been considered evidence of activity-dependent Hebbian plasticity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Mutations in <italic>eag</italic>, one of the voltage gated K<sup>+</sup> channels, induce hyperexcitability in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c1</xref>). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> The bouton number for <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> NMJs (146.6±6) was not statistically distinguishable from that for <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> NMJs but was significantly increased compared with that for CS NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3b1 and i</xref>). Similar phenotypes between <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> and <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> mutant NMJs raised possibilities that <italic>eag</italic> and <italic>nwk</italic> might be present in the same signaling pathway regulating the development of synaptic boutons. To test this possibility, <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> NMJs were generated and examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3d1 and i</xref>). <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> NMJs showed significantly increased bouton numbers (<italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup>2</sup>, 181.4±5.06; <italic>eag</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>/<italic>Df</italic>, 179.5±5.56) compared with those in <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup>or <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3d1 and i</xref>). Synergistic phenotypes observed in <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> NMJs suggested that <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> and <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> are present in parallel or different signal transduction pathways regulating bouton numbers at Type1 glutamatergic NMJs. This notion is supported by additional morphological phenotypes observed from <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> NMJs, such as elongated synaptic branches or decreased areas of boutons, that were not observed in <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3j and k</xref>). The synaptic branch lengths in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> or <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>Df</italic> NMJs (<italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup>, 754.9±29.9 μm; <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>Df</italic>, 768.8±23.8 μm) were significantly increased compared with those of CS NMJs (CS, 617.4±25.1 μm). However, the synaptic branch length in <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> NMJs (683.3±28.7 μm) was not significantly different from those of either CS or <italic>nwk</italic> mutant NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j</xref>). The length of <italic>eag</italic> and <italic>nwk</italic> double-mutant NMJs (<italic>eag</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>, 852.9±31.6 μm; <italic>eag</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>/<italic>Df</italic>, 882.7±28.7 μm) was significantly different from that of <italic>nwk</italic> NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3d1 and j</xref>).

<title>Smaller synaptic boutons in nwk<sup>2</sup> and eag<sup>1</sup>;nwk<sup>2</sup> NMJs</title>
<p>Another morphological phenotype in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> NMJ was reduced bouton sizes. Bouton sizes in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> NMJs (4.095±0.225 μm<sup>2</sup>, <italic>n</italic>=124; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3b2 and k</xref>) were significantly smaller than those of CS (7.051±0.499 μm<sup>2</sup>, <italic>n</italic>=103; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a2 and k</xref>) or <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> NMJs (8.127±0.507 μm<sup>2</sup>, <italic>n</italic>=103; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3c2 and k</xref>) but similar to those of <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> NMJs (3.650±0.154 μm<sup>2</sup>, <italic>n</italic>=154; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3d2 and k</xref>). Consistently, typical transmission EM images taken from across the midlines of boutons in CS, <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup>, <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> or <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> NMJs showed that bouton sizes in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> or <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> were significantly smaller than those in CS or <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a–d</xref>). Further morphometric analysis by based on serial transmission EM images revealed that the average synaptic bouton length in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> NMJs (3.18±0.25 μm, <italic>n</italic>=9) was similar to those in CS NMJs (3.99±0.26 μm, <italic>n</italic>=7) but significantly smaller than those of <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> NMJs (4.43±0.41 μm, <italic>n</italic>=7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). The bouton surface area in <italic>nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>NMJs (17.04±1.87 μm<sup>2</sup>) was significantly decreased, &lt;70% of CS (29.90±4.46 μm<sup>2</sup>) or &lt;60% of <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> (25.93±2.19 μm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). The bouton volume in <italic>nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> NMJs (6.39±1.09 μm<sup>3</sup>) was reduced to &lt;40% that in CS (17.37±4.07 μm<sup>3</sup>) or &lt;50% that in <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> NMJs (12.81±1.3 μm<sup>3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Compared with <italic>nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> NMJs, the bouton length and volume in <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> NMJs were statistically identical, but the average bouton surface area (length=2.39±0.24 μm, surface area=9.74±1.81 μm<sup>2</sup>, volume=3.38±0.82 μm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>n</italic>=9) was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4e–g</xref>).

<title>Reduced synapse areas in nwk<sup>2</sup> and eag<sup>1</sup>;nwk<sup>2</sup> synaptic boutons</title>
<p>Synapses are electron-dense parallel membrane structures usually harboring T-AZs surrounded by SVs at the presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a–d</xref>). The area of total synapses in CS (0.364±0.022 μm<sup>2</sup>, <italic>n</italic>=133) was similar to that in <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> (0.383±0.023 μm<sup>2</sup>, <italic>n</italic>=113). In addition, the average total synaptic area was similar in <italic>nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> (0.229±0.015 μm<sup>2</sup>, <italic>n</italic>=83) and <italic>eag</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>boutons (0.213±0.019 μm<sup>2</sup>, <italic>n</italic>=64), even though they were significantly smaller than those in CS or <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). Previous studies in synapses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval Type 1b boutons suggested that synapses are ever changing structures undergoing emerging, strengthening, maturing, weakening or other processes. Studies in <italic>brp</italic> (<italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of human active zone protein ELSK/CAST/ERC) loss-of-function mutants showed that T-AZs at synapses were essential for maintaining activity-dependent release of SVs, rather than spontaneous release of SVs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> These studies suggested that synapses without a T-AZ may be silent, while one or more T-AZs may be active synapses undergoing activity-dependent SV exocytosis. Therefore, the synapses in each genotype were further divided by the numbers of T-AZs present. In this analysis, 25% of CS synapses, 22% of <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> synapses, 18% of <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> synapses and 34% of <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> synapses lacked a T-AZ and were considered silent synapses, while 63% of CS synapses, 65% of <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> synapses, 64% of <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> synapses and 59% of <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> synapses were with one T-AZ. In addition, 11% of CS synapses, 12% of <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> synapses, 19% of <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> synapses and 6% of <italic>eag</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> synapses had two or more T-AZs. The areas of silent synapses in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> (0.090±0.009 μm<sup>2</sup>) and <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> (0.096±0.012 μm<sup>2</sup>) boutons were &lt;50–60% of those in CS (0.163±0.017 μm<sup>2</sup>) and <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> (0.187±0.024 μm<sup>2</sup>) boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). However, the area of synapses with one T-AZ in <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> (0.252±0.022 μm<sup>2</sup>) boutons was only significantly different from those in CS (0.352±0.02 μm<sup>2</sup>) or <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> (0.348±0.02 μm<sup>2</sup>) boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>).

These results suggested that <italic>fasII</italic><sup>e76</sup> and <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> mutations mutually suppressed the opposing phenotypes when 10% of the normal level of FasII was expressed. Only the length of synaptic branches of <italic>fasII</italic><sup><italic>e76</italic></sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> (732.8±40.4 μm) was similar to those of <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> NMJs. When FasII expression was reduced to 55% of CS, the bouton numbers of <italic>fasII</italic><sup><italic>e76</italic></sup>/+<italic>;nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> (132.6±4.73) and <italic>fasII</italic><sup><italic>e76</italic></sup>/+<italic>;nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup><italic>/Df</italic> (131.4±6.92) NMJs were similar to those of <italic>fasII</italic><sup><italic>e76</italic></sup>/+ and <italic>nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3f1 and i</xref>). However, the synaptic branch lengths of <italic>fasII</italic><sup><italic>e76</italic></sup>/+<italic>;nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> (781.0±54.8 μm) and <italic>fasII</italic><sup><italic>e76</italic></sup>/+<italic>;nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup><italic>/Df</italic> (821.4±34.1 μm) were similar to those of <italic>nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> mutants. In addition, the bouton midline areas of <italic>fasII</italic><sup><italic>e76</italic></sup>/+<italic>;nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> (6.638±0.41 μm<sup>2</sup>, <italic>n</italic>=128) were similar to those of <italic>fasII</italic><sup><italic>e76</italic></sup>/+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3f2 and k</xref>).</p>
<p>Our NMJ morphology analysis results suggested that three morphological aspects examined in this study could be regulated by different signaling mechanisms. We can suggest that FasII is downstream of Nwk in regulating the numbers and sizes of synaptic boutons but either is upstream in the regulation of synaptic branch length or does not participate in this process. Further studies with other mutants showing altered morphologies will reveal more details of the signaling mechanisms.</p>

<title>nwk synapses showed impaired RRPs at T-AZs</title>
<p>The localization of Nwk with SVs at the confocal microscopic level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and EM level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) suggested that Nwk may have important roles in regulating SV trafficking or transmission. Electrophysiological studies showed that the quantal contents of <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> NMJs were ~50% less than those of CS, although the amplitude of miniature excitatory junctional currents or quantal sizes were slightly increased without changes in frequency of miniature excitatory junctional currents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Even though the ~50% decrease in the numbers of synapses and T-AZs in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> boutons may contribute to reduced synaptic transmission in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> NMJs, the numbers of synaptic boutons in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> NMJs were increased by ~40%. These results suggested that other defects caused by loss of Nwk at synaptic terminals may exist. Thus we further examined whether SV pools in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup>, <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> or <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> boutons were altered.</p>
<p>First, we examined whether Mab-Synapsin signals in <italic>nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> boutons were altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6a–d</xref>). When <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup>, <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> or <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> boutons were compared with CS, only <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> boutons appeared to have reduced Synapsin immunoreactivity. <italic>eag</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> boutons showed stronger signals and <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>; nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> boutons showed signals similar to those of CS. These results suggested that Nwk may be critical for maintaining normal SV pools at the presynaptic terminals.</p>
<p>Next, we examined whether RRP and RP were altered in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> boutons by performing EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6e–h</xref>). In this study, the RRP and RP were defined as SVs within 200 nm or at 200–400 nm, respectively, from the stub of T-AZs. The numbers of SVs in the RRP (6.44±0.27) or RP (10.83±0.53) in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> were significantly less than those of CS (RRP, 11.49±0.28; RP, 24.115±0.77). The RRPs of <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> (12.72±0.38) and <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> (12.43±0.30) were significantly increased compared with that of CS. However, only the RP of <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup> (28.21±0.91) was significantly increased compared with that of CS. The RP of <italic>eag</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> (23.26±0.82) was similar to that of CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>). These results suggested that Nwk is critical for maintaining the RRP and RP. In addition, the reduction in SVs induced by the loss of Nwk at the presynaptic terminals might be offset by increased neural activity, which is known to strengthen synaptic connections.</p>

<title>Nwk formed a protein complex with DSypt1 and Synapsin</title>
<p>Reduced Synapsin immunoreactivities together with reduced RRP and RP at <italic>nwk</italic> mutant synapses suggested that NWK and Synapsin may present at the same protein complexes. To investigate this possibility, we performed Mab-Synpasin immunoprecipitation and proved precipitates with rabbit anti-Nwk or anti-DSypt1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6j</xref>). There were clear one Nwk and two <italic>D</italic>Sypt1 bands when Mab-Synapsin precipitates were separated. Consistent with a previous report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> three Synapsin bands were clearly detected. These results suggested that NWK formed a protein complex with <italic>D</italic>Sypt1 and Synapsin and regulates SV trafficking and transmission.</p>

<title>3D HVEM tomography revealed T-AZ architectures of CS and nwk<sup>2</sup> synapses at high resolution</title>
<p>To investigate SV localization patterns and synaptic architecture at three dimensions, CS and <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> synapses in Type 1b boutons were analyzed by 3D HVEM tomography. Examples of unprocessed HVEM images of CS and <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> synapses are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7a and b</xref>. Using 121 tilted images, 3D ultrastructures of synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7c and d</xref>) and T-AZs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7e and f</xref>) of CS and <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> were generated by IMOD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Because fewer SVs with enlarged sizes were observed from <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup>, we further quantified the 3D distribution patterns of SVs in RRPs. Consistent with conventional EM results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6e–h</xref>), significantly fewer SVs presented at RRP (CS, 138.0±9.0; <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup>, 91.0±6.8, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01). The graphs showing SVs numbers based on distances from the stub of T-AZs suggested that no SVs were docked to T-AZs in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup>. However, more SVs localized from 100 to 140 nm from T-AZs in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> than in CS. In addition, SV size distribution results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7i</xref>) revealed that SVs in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> were significantly larger than those in CS (<italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup>, 42.69±0.45; CS, 39.40±0.315 nm, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). The 3D ultrastructural differences at synapses and T-AZs between CS and <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> were clearly visualized by 3D rotation videos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Video Clips 1</xref>). Significantly fewer but enlarged SVs were present in the RRPs in <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> synapses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In order to investigate the unknown <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of proteins containing SH3 and F-BAR domains in synaptic plasticity and transmission, we took advantage of <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs and available <italic>nwk</italic> mutants. Nwk is a <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of MEGAP, one of the proteins responsible for mental retardation in humans; Nwk was initially discovered by temperature-sensitive paralysis behavior of adult flies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Although genetic and physical interactions between Nwk and components of endocytosis, such as Dap160 and Dynamin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> and actin cytoskeleton regulators, such as Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> and CDC42,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> have been reported, the localization patterns of Nwk at synaptic boutons appear to be different from localization patterns of the above-mentioned proteins. Thus we hypothesized that Nwk may directly or indirectly interact with other synaptic or cytoskeletal components. In addition, by performing immunohistochemistry to confirm partial colocalization of Nwk with DAP160 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> we also observed via confocal microscopy that Nwk partially colocalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1e and f</xref>) and formed protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6j</xref>) with Synapsin and <italic>D</italic>Sypt1. Furthermore, we found that Synapsin immunoreactivities at <italic>nwk</italic> synaptic boutons were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6a–d</xref>). These findings are highly intriguing because recent studies have shown that Synapsin, the most abundant presynaptic phosphoprotein in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, has a pivotal role in regulating SV trafficking at synaptic terminals by forming protein complexes with Dap160<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> in glutamatergic NMJs. The defects of RRP and RP in <italic>nwk</italic> mutant synapses were further confirmed by performing transmission EM analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6e–i</xref>) and HVEM 3D tomography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7a–i</xref>). Thus it is possible that Nwk is actively participating in SV trafficking at RRP and RP via interactions with Synapsin, <italic>D</italic>Sypt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>), Dap160,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> Dynamin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> and other interacting proteins that have yet to be identified.</p>
<p>Another phenotype in <italic>nwk</italic> loss-of-function mutants that was able to be identified by this study’s use of HVEM 3D tomography was that of enlarged SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7a–i</xref>). Because we used 1 μm thick sections for examining size and distribution of SVs at <italic>nwk</italic> mutant and control synapses and as 20 nm gold particles were used to create a list of fiducial points and size standards for SVs, our HVEM 3D analysis results did not contain biased data originating from measuring diameters of sectioned SVs when 50–100 nm of thin sections were used for conventional transmission EM analysis as described by Kim <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> Recently, it has been shown that an F-BAR domain in Nwk binds to and remodels membranes to form concave membrane structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> Therefore, it is possible that Nwk may regulate SV recycling both directly, by interacting with synaptic membranes, and indirectly, through its binding partners, such as Synapsin, <italic>D</italic>Sypt1, Dap160 and Dynamin. Thus loss of Nwk at synapses might induce enlarged SVs compared with control synapses.</p>
<p>In addition to regulating SV size and trafficking, our NMJ and synapse morphometric analysis results provided several lines of evidence supporting that Nwk regulates synaptic plasticity of glutamatergic NMJs in a manner different from activity-dependent Hebbian plasticity. Previous studies have shown one of the classical examples of Hebbian plasticity, in which increased neuronal activity in NMJs reduces FasII localization at synaptic boutons, resulting in both an increase in the number of synaptic boutons and branch elongation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> However, the findings of this study, which supported that genetically increased neuronal activity in <italic>nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> mutant NMJs resulted in significantly more synaptic boutons and branch elongations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and that the levels of FasII in <italic>nwk</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> mutants were significantly higher than those of CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), suggested that Nwk may exist in a different signaling pathway from that of Hebbian plasticity.</p>
<p>The evidence presented in this study is important because most psychiatric and neurological diseases, ranging from autism and mental retardation to dementia, are reported to be accompanied by altered synaptic structures and functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> The association of MEGAP and mental retardation has been revealed in the process of identifying genes that are linked with distal chromosome 3p deletion syndrome (3p-syndrome) patients with severe mental retardation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> Similar to Nwk, MEGAP expression was observed in the embryonic central nervous systems of mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> and high expression was found in the hippocampus, amygdala, piriform cortex, posterior parietal associative area and the dentate gyrus of adult mouse brains.<sup>3</sup> In addition, similar to Nwk, MEGAP binds strongly to the phosphoinositide-rich membrane and is involved in the formation of filopodia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> In the synaptogenesis stage, MEGAP has an important role in synapse selection, and consequently, the loss of MEGAP function results in a decrease in the number of neuron spines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> Thus, although it has not been elucidated to date whether MEGAP expresses at presynaptic or postsynaptic terminals or both, it is possible that MEGAP may regulate SV size and distribution in neuron spines at glutamatergic synapses of the mouse central nervous system, especially at the hippocampus, resulting in mental retardation phenotypes in human patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> and mouse knockout models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup> Thus further studies in Nwk and MEGAP will reveal unknown molecular and cellular functions of SH3 and F-BAR domain proteins in synaptic plasticity and mental retardation.</p>

<p>Nwk reticulum at synaptic boutons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval Type 1b boutons in neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). To reveal the precise localization patterns of Nwk at the presynaptic terminals of Type 1 glutamatergic NMJs, Nwk antibodies (red) were counter-stained with antibodies targeting other identified synaptic molecular components or cytoskeleton components (green). All images are single-slice confocal images taken from a midline (<bold>a</bold>, <bold>c</bold>–<bold>n</bold>) or a surface of synaptic boutons (<bold>b</bold>). (<bold>a</bold>) T-AZs labeled with Mab-Brp (green) were localized at the center of circles in Nwk reticulum (red) clearly seen from a merged image. (<bold>b</bold>) A postsynaptic density marker, Mab-DGluRIIA (green) and anti-Nwk (red) indicated that PSDs localized at the center of circles in Nwk reticulum clearly seen in the merged image. (<bold>c</bold>) Mab-FasII (green) signals in a midline of synaptic bouton surrounded the Nwk reticulum (red) and localized at the Nwk-negative narrow passage indicated by white arrow heads. (<bold>d</bold>) Double labeling with Mab-DLG, a postsynaptic terminal structure marker (green) and anti-Nwk (red) revealed that Nwk reticulum is present at the presynaptic terminals. (<bold>e</bold>, <bold>g</bold>, <bold>h</bold>) Antibodies of SV proteins (green), such as Mab-synapsin(<bold>e</bold>), anti-<italic>D</italic>Sypt1 (<bold>g</bold>) or Mab-<italic>D</italic>csp2 (<bold>h</bold>) were present at the center of circles in Nwk reticulum (red) but not in the Nwk-negative narrow passages indicated by white arrow head. (<bold>f</bold>) When n-Syb-GFP was expressed using the pan-neuronal C155-Gal4 driver, n-Syb-GFP (green) was partially colocalized with Nwk reticulum (Red). (<bold>i</bold>) Anti-LAP180 (green) was partially colocalized with Nwk reticulum. (<bold>j</bold>) Mab-Hiw partially colocalized with the Nwk reticulum. Particularly strong Hiw signals were present at the center of Nwk circles (red). (<bold>k</bold>, <bold>l</bold>) Mab-Futsch revealed microtubules in boutons. In the stable synaptic boutons, microtubule–Futsch loops traversing the middle of synaptic boutons were clearly visible (<bold>k</bold>). Synaptic boutons undergoing sprouting or dividing did not have microtubule–Futsch loop structures (<bold>l</bold>). Instead, microtubule–Futsch signals were present at the centers of circles in NWK reticulum. (<bold>m</bold>) <italic>Drosophila</italic> L1 homolog, Neuroglian (Mab-BP104, green), did not colocalize with Nwk reticulum at the synaptic boutons. (<bold>n</bold>) When Actin-GFP was expressed in the neurons using C155-Gal4, Actin-GFP proteins (green) was partially colocalized with Nwk reticulum. (<bold>o</bold>) Nwk reticulum partially colocalized with Hiw. (<bold>p</bold>) A western blot from larval body wall muscle extracts of CS, <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup> and <italic>nwk</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>/Df</italic> was probed sequentially with anti-Nwk or Mab-α-Tubulin (12G10).
