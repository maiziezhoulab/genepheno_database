heterozygous loss-of-function mutation of the gene
<italic>SCN1A</italic>, which encodes the type 1 neuronal
voltage-gated sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) channel α subunit
Na<sub>v</sub>1.1. Prior studies in mouse models of Dravet syndrome
(<italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice) indicate that, in cerebral cortex, Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 is
predominantly expressed in GABAergic interneurons, in particular in
parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking basket cell interneurons (PVINs). This
has led to a model of Dravet syndrome pathogenesis in which Nav1.1
mutation leads to preferential dysfunction of interneurons, decreased
synaptic inhibition, hyperexcitability, and epilepsy. However, such
studies have been implemented at early developmental time points. Here,
we performed electrophysiological recordings in acute brain slices
prepared from male and female <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic>mice as well as age-matched wild-type littermate controls and
found that, later in development, the excitability of PVINs had
normalized. Analysis of action potential waveforms indirectly suggests a
reorganization of axonal Na<sup>+</sup> channels in PVINs from
<italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice, a finding supported by immunohistochemical data showing
elongation of the axon initial segment. Our results imply that transient
impairment of action potential generation by PVINs may contribute to the
initial appearance of epilepsy, but is not the mechanism of ongoing,
chronic epilepsy in Dravet syndrome. Significance Statement: Dravet
syndrome is characterized by normal early development,
temperature-sensitive seizures in infancy, progression to
treatment-resistant epilepsy, developmental delay, autism, and sudden
unexplained death due to mutation in <italic>SCN1A</italic> encoding the
Na<sup>+</sup> channel subunit Nav1.1. Prior work has revealed a
preferential impact of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 loss on the function of
GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. However, such data derive exclusively
from recordings of neurons in young <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice. Here, we show that impaired action potential generation
observed in parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons (PVINs) in
<italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice during early development has normalized by postnatal day
35. This work suggests that a transient impairment of PVINs contributes
to epilepsy onset, but is not the mechanism of ongoing, chronic epilepsy
in Dravet syndrome.</p></boxed-text>

<title>Commentary</title>
<p>Dravet syndrome (DS) is a catastrophic developmental and epileptic encephalopathy
with cognitive, behavioral, and motor impairments, as well as a high risk of sudden
unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1535759718822038">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1535759718822038">2</xref></sup> Most DS patients have <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in
<italic>SCN1A</italic>, encoding the α subunit of the voltage-gated sodium
channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, resulting in haploinsufficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1535759718822038">3</xref></sup> Exciting new research shows evidence for therapeutic rescue of seizures and
SUDEP in a DS mouse model following selective activation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1
channels by a spider venom peptide, providing hope for patients with DS and their
families. However, other recent work demonstrates that there may be only a
transient, developmental window of fast-spiking interneuron dysfunction in DS mouse
brain, suggesting that drugs targeting Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 activation may be effective
only during a defined time window in early postnatal brain development, while
potentially producing adverse effects at later time points.</p>
<p>Catterall and colleagues were the first to develop a mouse model of DS, demonstrating
that <italic>Scn1a</italic> haploinsufficiency in mice results in seizures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1535759718822038">4</xref></sup> They showed that postnatal day (P) 14-16 <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> hippocampal bipolar neurons, but not pyramidal neurons, had significantly
reduced sodium current density, resulting in reduced interneuron firing frequency.
Further work showed that <italic>Dlx1/2</italic>Cre-mediated inactivation of
<italic>Scn1a</italic> in parvalbumin-positive (PV+) fast-spiking interneurons
phenocopied the severe seizures and SUDEP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1535759718822038">5</xref></sup> This work led to the hypothesis that pathophysiology in DS could be explained
by disinhibition, or dysfunctional inhibitory circuits, that involved PV+
fast-spiking interneurons.</p>
<p>Dravet syndrome is pharmacoresistant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1535759718822038">6</xref></sup> Moreover, traditional antiepileptic drugs that inhibit the activity of pan
sodium channels in brain, for example, carbamazepine or phenytoin, can exacerbate
seizures in patients with DS. Taking a novel approach to drug discovery in DS,
Petrou and colleagues turned to natural products to test a selective
Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 activating agent. Venom from the tarantula <italic>Heteroscodra
maculate</italic> contains a toxin called δ-theraphotoxin-Hm1a (“Hm1a”).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1535759718822038">7</xref></sup> Previous work from other investigators, and confirmed in the Petrou study,
showed that Hm1a administration to heterologous cells or primary neurons selectively
activates Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 via a mechanism that delays fast inactivation and
enhances the level of persistent sodium current.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1535759718822038">7</xref></sup> The Petrou group showed that application of Hm1a to mouse brain slices
rescued hippocampal CA1 PV+ fast-spiking interneuron function in
<italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> DS mice but, surprisingly, had no effect on CA1 inhibitory neuron firing
in WT littermate mice or on excitatory CA1 pyramidal neurons in DS mice.
Importantly, acute introcerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of Hm1a into the brains of
<italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> DS mice that showed epileptiform activity at P19, prior to infusion,
reduced whole-brain hyperexcitability, measured as mean spike frequency by
electrocorticography, postadministration. A 4-day ICV infusion of Hm1a beginning at
P18 into the brains of <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> DS mice in which 2 or more seizures had been recorded prior to infusion
resulted in significantly reduced or abolished seizure frequency and significantly
reduced mortality. Remarkably, 6 of 9 DS mice were rescued after 3 days of Hm1a
infusion. In contrast, by day 3, all vehicle-treated DS mice were dead. Hm1a-treated
<italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> animals were not monitored longer than 4 days, thus it is not yet known
whether the beneficial effects of Hm1a persisted. The authors did not test the
safety profile of Hm1a infusion into the brains of WT mice or
<italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> that did not exhibit seizures. A potential caveat to the development of
Hm1a as a therapeutic agent is that activation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels by this
toxin is not selective to the brain. If delivered systemically, the toxin can
activate Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels all over the body, for example, mechanosensitive
nociceptors in the gut, resulting in acute pain and mechanical allodynia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1535759718822038">7</xref></sup> illustrating the tissue-specific complexity of sodium channel gene expression
and sodium channel pharmacology.</p>
<p>While the work from the Petrou group is encouraging, growing evidence suggests that
Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 activating drugs may be beneficial in the brain only during a
short developmental window of time, at least in mice. The Catterall group showed
selective reduction of interneuron sodium current and firing rate at P14 in
<italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic>mouse hippocampus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1535759718822038">4</xref></sup> However, in subsequent work, George, Kearney, and colleagues demonstrated
that sodium current density was increased in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> hippocampal pyramidal neurons, but not in GABAergic interneurons, at P21-24.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1535759718822038">8</xref></sup> In addition, <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic>P21-24 pyramidal neurons exhibited spontaneous firing and
hyperexcitability. This work suggested that compensatory overexpression of one or
more sodium channel genes may occur in DS brain in response to
<italic>Scn1a</italic> haploinsufficiency by P21, contributing to the mechanism
of epileptogenesis. To add to this complexity, new work by Goldberg and colleagues
examines fast-spiking PV+ interneuron excitability over the life time of
<italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> animals. They show that during early postnatal development (P10), there
are no differences in excitability between <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> fast-spiking PV+ interneurons in layer 2/3 of the somatosensory cortex. At
P18-20, they observed similar hypoexcitability of <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> layer 2/3 fast-spiking PV+ interneurons as reported by the Catterall group
in the hippocampus of P14-16 mice. Surprisingly however, in adult mice (P35-56), no
changes in layer 2/3 fast-spiking PV+ interneuron excitability between genotypes
could be detected, suggesting that interneuron excitability normalizes in DS mouse
brain with development. A caveat to the Goldberg et al work is that only ∼50% of
<italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice on the (C57BL/6J × 129S6/SvEvTac)F1 strain develop the DS phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1535759718822038">9</xref></sup> By P35, a large percentage of <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice that have developed seizures have died. It is likely that the cohort
of mice that showed seizure activity by P18-19, as defined in the Petrou et al
study, would have died by P35 and thus are not represented in the Goldberg et al
study. Thus, the 2 research studies may not have analyzed similar subpopulations of
<italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> DS mice, in spite of similar breeding strategies. Nevertheless, it would
be interesting to test whether ICV infusion of Hm1a in DS brains beginning at P21
would normalize the compensatory sodium channel overexpression and hyperexcitability
reported by George and Kearny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1535759718822038">8</xref></sup> or whether this treatment would exacerbate hyperexcitability and worsen the
disease.</p>
<p>Finally, mice and humans develop on very different time scales. In patients with DS,
symptoms typically present toward the end of the first year of life, which for mice
is approximately equivalent to the time of weaning (∼P21-P28). According to the work
of George and Kearney,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1535759718822038">8</xref></sup> compensatory overexpression of other sodium channel genes has occurred by
this time point. Is it too late to administer Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 activating drugs or
to perform genetic manipulations to increase Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 expression? Could
this type of pharmacological intervention in pediatric patients with DS older than 1
year be detrimental? An essential experiment that is missing from the literature is
to reactivate <italic>Scn1a</italic> gene expression after the critical period of
brain development in <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> DS mice. Can the pathophysiology be rescued? Are compensatory changes that
occur in the brain in response to <italic>Scn1a</italic> haploinsufficiency
reversible? A problem with this proposed experimental strategy is that the short
time span from disease onset to SUDEP in the <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic>mouse model on the (C57BL/6J × 129S6/SvEvTac)F1 strain may not allow
sufficient time to reactivate <italic>Scn1a</italic> expression between disease
onset and death. New DS models will be needed to test this hypothesis and to gain
this critical information for effective therapeutic discovery in DS.</p>
