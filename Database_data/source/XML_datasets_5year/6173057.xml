<title>Summary</title>
<p>Synapses are fundamental units of communication in the brain. The prototypical synapse-organizing complex neurexin-neuroligin mediates synapse development and function and is central to a shared genetic risk pathway in autism and schizophrenia. Neurexin’s role in synapse development is thought to be mediated purely by its protein domains, but we reveal a requirement for a rare glycan modification. Mice lacking heparan sulfate (HS) on neurexin-1 show reduced survival, as well as structural and functional deficits at central synapses. HS directly binds postsynaptic partners neuroligins and LRRTMs, revealing a dual binding mode involving intrinsic glycan and protein domains for canonical synapse-organizing complexes. Neurexin HS chains also bind novel ligands, potentially expanding the neurexin interactome to hundreds of HS-binding proteins. Because HS structure is heterogeneous, our findings indicate an additional dimension to neurexin diversity, provide a molecular basis for fine-tuning synaptic function, and open therapeutic directions targeting glycan-binding motifs critical for brain development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="p0030">Synaptic junctions as modifiable functional units play an essential role in information processing in the brain. Neurexin (Nrx) synaptic organizing proteins are thought to be central effectors of synaptic properties that shape the activity of neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Südhof, 2017</xref>). The most well-known ligand for Nrx is neuroligin (NL). Together, Nrx and NL recruit proteins to developing synapses and promote multiple aspects of synapse assembly, maturation, and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krueger et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reissner et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Südhof, 2017</xref>). <italic>Nrxn</italic> and <italic>Nlgn</italic> genes function in overlapping patterns in essentially all brain circuits and are necessary for mouse survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Missler et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Varoqueaux et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0035">Considerable heterogeneity contributes to functional selectivity of different Nrx-NL complexes. Mammals have 3 Nrx genes, each of which uses two promoters to generate longer α and shorter β forms, and 6 sites of alternative splicing to generate altogether &gt;1,500 forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Südhof, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schreiner et al., 2014</xref>). There are 4 NL genes in mice and 5 in humans, also regulated by alternative splicing, with NL1 selective for excitatory glutamatergic and NL2 selective for inhibitory GABAergic and glycinergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krueger et al., 2012</xref>). Nrx also acts through postsynaptic partners other than NLs, primarily LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roppongi et al., 2017</xref>), as well as Cbln1-Gluδ2 in cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Uemura et al., 2010</xref>), interactions that are regulated by Nrx splicing.</p>
<p id="p0040">These interactions of Nrx with postsynaptic ligands are thought to be mediated purely by protein domains. The peptide interaction mode between Nrx and NL is well accepted based on crystal structures and mutagenesis studies from multiple labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourne and Marchot, 2014</xref>). The acetylcholinesterase-homology domain of each NL in a dimer binds the laminin neurexin sex hormone binding (LNS) domain common to α and β Nrx with KD values in the 10<sup>−8</sup>–10<sup>−5</sup> M range.</p>
<p id="p0045">There is strong evidence implicating altered Nrx and NL function in human psychiatric disorders. Autism-associated mutations in multiple human <italic>NRXNs</italic> and <italic>NLGNs</italic> are consistently found, including copy number variations, microdeletions, and truncating nonsense and function-altering missense mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huguet et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Südhof, 2017</xref>). Although rare (in &lt;1% of patients), <italic>NRXN1</italic> mutations are also among the most frequent single-gene mutations in both schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rees et al., 2014</xref>) and Tourette’s Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0050">Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are also implicated in synaptic function and autism, yet the molecular mechanisms remain uncertain. In addition to well-studied roles in brain development, HSPGs are implicated in activity-induced synaptic plasticity and regulation of oscillatory activity in mature brain networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farhy Tselnicker et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Minge et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>EXT1</italic> and <italic>HS3ST5</italic>, which encode an essential HS biosynthetic enzyme and an HS sulfotransferase, respectively, have both been associated with autism susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Late postnatal deletion of <italic>Ext1</italic> in a subset of neurons leads to deficits in synaptic function and autism-like social, communication, and stereotypy behaviors in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Irie et al., 2012</xref>) through unknown mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p0055">Here, we shed light on the links between HSPG and Nrx pathways by establishing that Nrxs are themselves HSPGs. HS glycan modification of Nrx is critical for high-affinity interactions with NLs and LRRTMs, mediates interaction with additional ligands, and is essential for normal synapse development at <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junctions and at mouse hippocampal mossy fiber CA3 synapses. Thus, HS is a critical component of Nrx, a component that further expands the diversity of Nrx structure and molecular interactions, providing a molecular basis for fine-tuning Nrx function.</p>

<title>Nrxs Are Evolutionarily Conserved HSPGs</title>
<p id="p0060">We demonstrate by multiple lines of evidence that Nrxs are HSPGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>A), joining a superfamily of 17 known HSPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sarrazin et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu and Esko, 2014</xref>). First, brain immunoblots for Nrx show molecular weight shifts upon cleavage of HS chains with heparinases I, II, and III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>B). HS chains contribute 20–100 kDa, with a heterogeneous chain length and structure even for a single-protein backbone. We estimate that approximately 80% of α Nrxs and 66% of β Nrxs are HS modified in adult mouse brain, and this fraction changes little throughout development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>A). Second, native brain Nrx and recombinant Nrx-1,2,3 α and β are all recognized by the anti-HS antibody 3G10, which recognizes the HS stub remaining after heparinase treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">David et al., 1992</xref>) and recognized all heparinase-treated immunoprecipitated Nrx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>C–1E). Using this assay on Nrx1β deletion and point mutants lacking splice inserts, we mapped the HS modification site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>C; confirmed in Nrx-1,2,3 β in cultured neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>E). Third, purified recombinant Nrx1α ectodomain analyzed by strong anion exchange HPLC following heparinase treatment confirmed multiple HS disaccharides, which were not present for the Ser→Ala point mutant of the HS modified residue, Nrx1αΔHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>F). Further, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) following protease and heparinase digestion revealed a molecular ion mass corresponding to the Nrx1α modified peptide bearing the HS stub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>G). This signal was detected only in Nrx1α, and not in Nrx1αΔHS. Conversely, unmodified peptide lacking glycosylation at this position was detected only in Nrx1αΔHS, and not Nrx1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>D). Thus, four independent methods support the conclusion that all Nrxs are HSPGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>A).<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Nrxs Are HSPGs and Mediate Presynaptic Induction by HS Binding Factors</p><p>(A) Schematic outline for identification of Nrxs as HSPGs.</p><p>(B) Native Nrx shows molecular weight shifts upon cleavage of HS with heparinase (Heps). Prominent Nrx α and β bands are indicated.</p><p>(C) Immunoprecipitated native Nrx shows molecular weight shifts with heparinase and is recognized by an HS antibody; 3G10 recognizes the HS stub remaining after heparinase cleavage (intact HS is not well recognized by western blot and the heparinase treatment helps condense the bands to improve detection). Anti-synaptophysin (syp) was used as a control for immunoprecipitation.</p><p>(D) All recombinant V5-tagged α Nrx expressed in neurons show molecular weight shifts with heparinase and are recognized by an HS antibody.</p><p>(E) Point mutation of each V5-tagged β Nrx lacking splice inserts confirms the HS modification site in neurons; Nrx1,2,3βΔHS Ser→Ala mutants lack HS modification; Con used empty vector. The untreated V5-Nrxβ signal may appear diffuse due to modification with HS chains of varying length; the signal collapses to one band upon heparinase treatment. These assays were done in neurons as Nrx is poorly modified in cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>B).</p><p>(F) HPLC following heparinase cleavage confirms the presence of HS disaccharides in purified Nrx1α but not Nrx1αΔHS ectodomain. ΔUA, Δ<sup>4,5</sup>-unsaturated uronic acid; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; GlcNS, N-sulfoglucosamine; 2S, 2-O-sulfation; 6S, 6-O-sulfation; ND, not detected.</p><p>(G) Identification of HS modified peptide from Nrx1α recombinant protein. Selected Isotopic Chromatograph of m/z 611.2532 (10 ppm mass tolerance) corresponding to the glycopeptide ‘LVAS(Pentose-Hexose-Hexose-Uronic Acid)AE’ from NRx1α, which is consistent with the Xylose-Galactose-Galactose-Glucuronic Acid tetrasaccharide that would remain attached to the protein backbone of an HSPG following digestion with heparinase. The fragmentation ions from this glycopeptide were weak in intensity, most likely due to the poor modification of Nrx in HEK293 cells and the relative complexity of the starting material coupled with the necessity to remove all disaccharides to allow for ionization and detection by nanospray MS. No signal was detected within 20 ppm mass tolerance corresponding to ‘LVAS(Pentose-Hexose-Hexose-Uronic Acid)AE’ or ‘LVAA(Pentose-Hexose-Hexose-Uronic Acid)AE’ from NRx1αΔHS, consistent with this mutation abolishing HS modification.</p><p>(H and I) The position of the conserved HS modification in Nrx is shown on the red serine in this sequence between the LNS and transmembrane domains, as identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figures S1</xref>C, S1E and in (E) and (G); for Dnrx, we did not distinguish whether all or a subset of these serines are modified.</p><p>(J–M) Clustering of presynaptic marker synaptophysin (Syp), a component of synaptic vesicles (SVs), and of Nrx induced by polylysine-coated beads was reduced by Nrx knockdown (shNrx) in comparison to control (shCon) at or below levels associated with uncoated (Con) beads. Measures are integrated intensity of puncta per contact area of beads with tau-positive axons lacking contact with microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)-positive dendrites to exclude native synapses (AU, arbitrary units). <sup>∗∗∗∗</sup>p &lt; 0.0001 by Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s tests compared to shCon polylysine beads, n = 18–33 cells or 16–30 beads from 2–3 independent experiments.</p><p>(N) Recombinant pleiotrophin (PTN) bound to immature neurons expressing V5-Nrx, but not V5-NrxΔHS. Immature neurons were used because Nrx is not well modified in cell lines and the low levels of native Nrx were insufficient to mediate detectable binding to untransfected cells. <sup>∗∗∗</sup>p &lt; 0.001 and <sup>∗∗∗∗</sup>p &lt; 0.0001 by Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s tests compared to Nrx, n = 17–38 cells from 2 independent experiments.</p><p>(O–Q) Beads coated with pleiotrophin induced clustering of native Nrx with vesicular glutamate transporter VGluT1 or with vesicular GABA transporter VGAT in contacting axons at sites lacking postsynaptic PSD-95 or gephyrin, respectively.

Crude synaptosome fraction was prepared from mouse brain at the postnatal ages indicated (in days, e.g., P1 is postnatal day 1) and treated or not with heparinase. The extent of Nrx HS modification at each age was estimated from the Nrx immunoblot. For example for P400, the fraction of α-Nrx lacking HS modification was estimated as the integrated signal of unmodified α-Nrx in the untreated sample (blue box) divided by total α-Nrx (red box, condensed band for unmodified α-Nrx after heparinase). Similarly, for P400 the fraction of β-Nrx lacking HS modification was estimated as the integrated signal in the purple box divided by the integrated signal in the green box. In the graph shown, values are reported as fraction of α-Nrx or β-Nrx bearing HS modification. Two-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of postnatal age (p &lt; 0.05) but posthoc Bonferroni’s pairwise comparisons were not significant, n = 3. Error bars represent SEM.</p><p>(B) Nrx is poorly HS modified in HEK293 cells in comparison with neurons.

<title>HS Modification of Nrx Mediates Presynaptic Differentiation by Polylysine Beads and Novel Ligands</title>
<p id="p0070">Polylysine-coated beads, long thought to non-specifically induce presynaptic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burry, 1980</xref>), were recently found to do so by aggregating axonal HSPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lucido et al., 2009</xref>). Syndecan-2 was aggregated and was suggested to be the HSPG responsible for polylysine-bead-induced presynaptic differentiation, but functional evidence was lacking. We find that polylysine beads aggregate axonal Nrxs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>J–1L and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2</xref>A). Furthermore, efficient knockdown of all Nrxs with an adeno-associated viral vector expressing multiple short hairpin RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figures S2</xref>B and S2C) revealed that Nrxs are required for polylysine-bead-induced presynaptic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>J–1M).

<p id="p0090">Two simple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>F) could explain why HS modification of Nrx is essential for Nrx ligand-induced presynaptic differentiation: (i) HS may stabilize Nrx on the axon surface, or (ii) HS may enhance ligand binding. To test the first possibility, we assessed surface expression of recombinant Nrx but found no difference between Nrx1β and Nrx1βΔHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figures S3</xref>A and S3B). To test the second possibility, whether HS modification affects the interaction between Nrx and its ligands, we did cell-based recruitment and binding assays.

We propose that the binding site involves a series of basic residues aligned in leucine-rich repeats 5–7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>A) and that this interaction, together with the binding of a region involving leucine-rich repeat 9 to the Nrx LNS domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siddiqui et al., 2010</xref>), mediates high-affinity interaction of LRRTM2 with Nrx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>B). In support of this hypothesis, recombinant LRRTM2 ectodomain bound strongly to a heparin column, and binding was diminished by mutating five Arg or Lys (pink in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>A) to Ala in LRRTM2-RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>C).

<title>Binding of Nrx Ligand NL to HS Is Required for its Role in Synapse Development</title>
<p id="p0100">The major role of Nrx HS modification in synaptic development, particularly for inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>B and 2D), is unlikely to be mediated solely through LRRTMs, which localize specifically to excitatory synapses, where they cooperate functionally with NLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roppongi et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, although it initially seemed unlikely to us that LRRTMs and NLs independently evolved binding sites for HS, as well as for the Nrx LNS domain, our interaction data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>G–3J) supported this possibility. Thus, we considered the hypothesis that NLs, the best-characterized evolutionarily conserved <italic>trans</italic>-synaptic partners of Nrx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krueger et al., 2012</xref>), directly bind HS.</p>
<p id="p0105">Based on electrostatic potential analyses of the NL crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>), we propose that NLs bind HS via positively charged residues that line a canyon formed above the dimerization interface between NL cholinesterase-like domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>A and 5B). A single HS chain fits well the dimensions of this canyon in which key charged residues are conserved from <italic>C. elegans</italic> to human (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Table S3</xref>). Indeed, recombinant mouse NL1 ectodomain bound to a heparin column, and binding was abolished by mutating three Arg or Lys (orange in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>B) to Ala in NL1-RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>C). This RA mutation did not affect NL1 dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>D) nor binding of NL1 to the Nrx LNS domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figures S5</xref>A–S5C), thus specifically disrupting the heparin/HS interaction. We next tested the significance of HS binding for the synaptogenic activity of all NLs by testing NL1-4 RA mutants in the co-culture assay. The ability of NL1-4 to recruit native Nrx on contacting neurons and to induce presynaptic differentiation was greatly reduced by the RA mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>E–5F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">S5</xref>D–S5G).<fig id="fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>NL Binding to HS Is Required for its Synapse Promoting Activity</p><p>(A) The NL1-Nrx1β LNS domain complex (PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="intref0145" xlink:href="pdb:3VKF">3VKF</ext-link>), side view.

<p id="p0110">To test the effect of NL1 HS interaction at endogenous synapses, we used sparse knockdown of NL1 in hippocampal cultures, as global loss of function has little effect on excitatory synapse numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kwon et al., 2012</xref>). NL1 knockdown resulted in a significant reduction in excitatory synapse density, an effect that was rescued by RNAi-resistant NL1<sup>∗</sup>, but not NL1<sup>∗</sup>-RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>G and 5H). To address how NL1-RA influences synapse maturation and function <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used a similar knockdown and replacement strategy by in utero electroporation into layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal cells. When co-expressed with the NL1 knockdown vector, the NL1<sup>∗</sup>-RA mutant resulted in a reduction in spine density relative to NL1<sup>∗</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>I–5K). Furthermore, to assess synaptic function while controlling for variability in expression patterns, we performed whole-cell recordings and determined the ratio of mEPSC frequency and amplitude in transfected cells relative to neighbor untransfected cells for each mouse. The NL1<sup>∗</sup> group had higher mEPSC frequency relative to the NL1<sup>∗</sup>-RA group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>L–5N; frequency was also higher by individual cell analyses, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figures S5</xref>H and S5I). Thus, NL1 requires HS binding for full Nrx interaction and for its function in controlling synapse numbers and function in developing cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>O).</p>

<title>HS Modification of a Core Synaptic Organizer: A Critical Role in Brain Development</title>
<p id="p0160">We have demonstrated that HS functions centrally as an integral part of the core synaptic organizing complexes Nrx-NL and Nrx-LRRTM. Until now, HSPG functions in the brain were thought to be mediated by members of nine known families of HSPGs, including the membrane-associated syndecans and glypicans and a few secreted HSPGs such as agrin and perlecan, acting mainly as co-receptors and bridging proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farhy Tselnicker et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Condomitti and de Wit, 2018</xref>). In complement to such roles, our finding that HS is a critical component of Nrxs places HS in a central role in synapse development and function. Furthermore, we show that at least one function previously thought to be mediated by syndecans, presynaptic differentiation triggered by polylysine-coated beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lucido et al., 2009</xref>), is actually mediated by Nrxs. Our data indicate that the contribution of Nrxs to roles ascribed to other HSPGs needs to be re-evaluated, particularly with respect to synaptic functions.</p>
<p id="p0165">To the best of our knowledge, the <italic>Nrxn1ΔHS</italic> mouse is the first example of a mouse model in which mutation of a specific HS modification site on one protein impairs mouse survival and synapse development. More generally, glycan modifications of synaptic organizing proteins are typically regulatory and not essential. For example, N glycosylation at splice site B of NL1 regulates interaction with selective forms of Nrx, allowing interaction with β-Nrx, but not α-Nrx, to modulate synapse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krueger et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we find that HS modification of Nrx is evolutionarily conserved and is essential for normal synapse development in both flies and mice. Electrophysiological recordings, confocal imaging, and SBFSEM at hippocampal mossy fiber CA3 synapses revealed contributions of Nrx1 HS modification to frequency and amplitude of spontaneous transmission, probability of release, synapse numbers, and pre- and postsynaptic structure. These phenotypes, along with the reduced prenatal and postnatal survival of <italic>Nrxn1ΔHS</italic> mice, contrast with the viability and mild phenotypes of mice lacking Nrx1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Etherton et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Missler et al., 2003</xref>) or Nrx1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2015</xref>), indicating a more critical combined function of Nrx1α+β and, importantly, a critical function of Nrx1 HS modification.</p>

<title>Integral Glycan and Protein Binding Mode for Canonical Synaptic Organizing Complexes</title>
<p id="p0170">A surprising finding of this study is that Nrx interactions with its major postsynaptic ligands NL and LRRTM are mediated by HS glycan domains in addition to protein domains. While both the protein and glycan domains of many HSPGs are functionally important, in most cases, this involves binding of one set of ligands to the protein domain and another set of ligands to the glycan domain. Yet here, we find that both domains are involved in the Nrx-NL interaction: the previously identified Nrx LNS protein domain binds the NL acetylcholinesterase-homologous domain, and the newly identified Nrx HS glycan domain binds the NL basic canyon. Based on the effects of mutations in Nrx or NL at either binding site, this dual or cooperative interaction mode involving protein-protein and glycan-protein interfaces between these two transmembrane proteins is required for physiologically relevant function (and, similarly, for Nrx-LRRTM). It is remarkable that the structurally unrelated Nrx ligands NLs and LRRTM1,2 both evolved binding sites for the protein LNS domain and the HS glycan of Nrx. This dual or cooperative interaction mode involving protein-protein and glycan-protein interfaces with a single ligand may not be unique to Nrx, as it may also occur for agrin-laminin and Dally-Decapentaplegic/BMP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cotman et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kirkpatrick et al., 2006</xref>). This model is distinct from the role of HSPGs as co-receptors facilitating ligand binding via their glycan domains to separate protein receptors.</p>
<p id="p0175">It will be important to determine whether Nrx HS modification may positively, or negatively, modulate its interaction with other ligands that bind Nrx protein domains including cerebellins, calsyntenin-3, and C1q-like proteins (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Südhof, 2017</xref>), with further implications for functional interplay among HS-binding or non-HS-binding Nrx ligands. Conversely, our findings that NL1 and LRRTM2 bind HS raise the further possibility that NLs and LRRTM1,2 may bind HSPGs other than Nrx. Such a possibility may be relevant in the context of soluble NL3 ectodomain promotion of glioma growth, where the relevant NL3 receptor is yet to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Venkatesh et al., 2015</xref>). Genetic interactions observed among Nrx, NL, an HS-binding growth factor, and an HS modifying enzyme in the control of angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rissone et al., 2012</xref>) also point to roles of Nrx as an HSPG and NL as an HS-binding protein outside of their typical synaptic contexts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3.3">
<title>Expanding the Neurexin Interactome</title>
<p id="p0180">The identification of Nrxs as HSPGs potentially expands the neurexin interactome to hundreds of known HS binding proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc2">Table S2</xref>). We show that one such HS binding protein, the soluble growth factor pleiotrophin, binds Nrx solely by its HS chain and this interaction can be sufficient to trigger presynaptic differentiation. In mouse models, pleiotrophin regulates synaptic plasticity, spatial learning, and anxiety-like behaviors, at least in part through enhancement of GABAergic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pavlov et al., 2006</xref>), supporting a proposed role for the pleiotrophin-Nrx interaction in regulating synaptic function. Mechanistically, HS-mediated binding of Nrx to such additional ligands may confer key traditional functions of proteoglycans on Nrx, such as to tether soluble molecules, mediate directed diffusion, promote oligomerization, regulate proteolysis, and act as a scaffold and allosteric regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu and Esko, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0185">Other synaptic HS-interacting proteins, and thus potential Nrx binding proteins, include type IIA protein tyrosine phosphatases, ephrins, integrins, latrophilin, fibroblast growth factors and their receptors, and glial-derived thrombospondin, which all cooperate with Nrx to promote synaptic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christopherson et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hruska et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park and Goda, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Südhof, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takahashi and Craig, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Terauchi et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, thrombospondin was recently directly isolated as a major Nrx binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Traunmüller et al., 2016</xref>). Many such brain-signaling proteins may thus interact with Nrx through their HS modification, unifying synaptic organizing pathways.</p>

<title>Implications for Brain Function and Dysfunction in Neuropsychiatric Disorders</title>
<p id="p0190">Given the central role of <italic>NRXN</italic>s and <italic>NLGN</italic>s in a genetically identified synaptic risk pathway in autism, schizophrenia, and a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, our findings have implications for human health. Our data tie mutations in the HSPG pathway into this synaptic pathway. Mutations were found in the essential HS biosynthetic enzymes <italic>EXT1</italic> in autism and <italic>EXTL3</italic> in association with reduced HS concentrations in developmental delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oud et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Volpi et al., 2017</xref>). Mutations not just in the core HS synthetic enzymes but also in HS modifying enzymes are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. Following initial synthesis of an HS chain, variable deacetylation, epimerization, and N-, 2-O-, 6-O-, and 3-O-sulfation generates diversity, generating thousands of structurally different epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu and Esko, 2014</xref>). HS structural modifications can be cell-type selective; for example, nine HS sulfotransferases are enriched in distinct GABAergic neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paul et al., 2017</xref>). Genes encoding HS-modifying enzymes include <italic>NDST3</italic> implicated in schizophrenia by a genome-wide association study supported by expression profiling, <italic>NDST1</italic> in which a compound heterozygous mutation was found in developmental delay, and <italic>HS3ST5</italic> associated with autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lencz et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Specific HS modification regulates synaptic function in animal models; for example, 6-O-sulfation bidirectionally controls the strength of synaptic transmission at the fly neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dani et al., 2012</xref>) and controls synaptic plasticity and behavior in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kalus et al., 2009</xref>). HS structural motifs generated by HS-modifying enzymes presumably control a range of physiological functions through specific molecular interactions, as demonstrated for some HS motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu and Esko, 2014</xref>). Thus, our findings raise an important direction for future studies, to delineate HS structural motifs on Nrx, uncover cell-type regulation and effects on binding to Nrx ligands, and ultimately, to understand how such HS motifs may contribute to refine synaptic transmission in circuits relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders. Whereas protein-protein interactions are difficult to target therapeutically, the interactions of specific HS structural motifs can be targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu and Esko, 2014</xref>). Thus, our findings raise the possibility of targeting glycan-binding motifs to correct imbalances in the synaptic pathway in neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>Nrxn1ΔHS</italic> mice</title>
<p id="p0210">The <italic>Nrxn1ΔHS</italic> knock-in mouse line was custom generated by Taconic Inc. using homologous recombination. Nrx1 serines 316, 322 and 333 were changed to alanines, corresponding to the SSSAAA mutation described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>C, by mutation of <italic>Nrxn1</italic> exon 22. The targeting construct was delivered into C57BL/6NTac embryonic stem cells through selection with G418 and Puromycin. Recombination of the targeted allele in ES cells was validated by Southern blot on both 5′ and 3′ ends. Mouse genotyping was performed by PCR analysis and the point mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Initial FRT and LoxP flanked regions were deleted, leaving a single loxP site in the intron 618 base pairs upstream of exon22 in addition to the 3 mutated serines in exon 22.</p>
<p id="p0215">Primers used for routine genotyping are 13140_35: TGAAGCAACTATAATGTCAGAGAGG and 13140_36: TTTCTACGTGTAGAAATGAAGCAG. The size of the product is 209 bp from wild-type and 267 bp from <italic>Nrxn1ΔHS</italic> knock-in mice. <italic>Nrxn1ΔHS</italic> mice in the C57BL/6NTac background were crossed with C57BL/6J mice (Charles River) for 3 to 6 generations before all the experiments. Due to a low Mendelian ratio from a cross between two heterozygous mice, breeding of homozygous parents was used to generate enough numbers of homozygous mice for analysis. The wild-type mice generated from the same initial <italic>Nrxn1ΔHS</italic> heterozygous crosses were bred in parallel to generate age-matched controls for all experiments. All mice were housed in the Centre for Disease Modeling at the University of British Columbia. Mice were housed in breeding pairs or in same-sex groups of 2-5 with a 12-h light/dark cycle and free access to food and water under specific pathogen-free conditions. Survival rates were not significantly different between males and females and data were pooled. Mice were procedure- and test-naive for all experiments. For consistency, male mice were used for the electrophysiology (P15-17) and electron microscopy (P28-29) assays and female mice for the light microscopy (P21) assays. All procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University of British Columbia.</p>

<title>Electroporated mice</title>
<p id="p0220">For in utero electroporation, E15.5 timed-pregnant female C57BL/6 mice were directly purchased from Charles River, Massachusetts, United States. Pups were housed with dam until P17-20 when they were used for electrophysiology or imaging experiments. Mice were procedure- and test-naive for all experiments. Data from male and female mice was pooled as gender differences were not found. All procedures for animal surgery and maintenance were performed following protocols approved by the Harvard Standing Committee on Animal Care and in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines.</p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p id="p0225">Primary rat hippocampal or cortical neuron cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 rat embryos using previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaech and Banker, 2006</xref>). Male and female embryos were pooled for sufficient material. Briefly, 300,000 hippocampal neurons per 60 mm culture dish were grown on coverslips inverted over a glial feeder layer in serum-free media. Cytosine arabinoside (5 μM) was added to hippocampal neuron culture dishes at 2 days <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) to prevent overgrowth of glial cells.</p>
<p id="p0230">COS7 and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) or bovine growth serum (BGS). COS7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651) are a fibroblast-like cell line derived from male African green monkey kidney tissue. HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) are thought to be derived from an epithelial or neuronal lineage from female embryonic human kidney tissue. Our cell lines have not been authenticated.</p>

<title>Method Details</title>
<sec id="sec4.4.1">
<title>Cell culture and co-culture assays</title>
<p id="p0235">Polylysine bead, pleiotrophin bead and co-culture experiments were initiated at DIV 13. For co-culture experiments, neurons were treated with 100 μM DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) beginning on DIV 7 to limit excitotoxicity.</p>
<p id="p0240">For knockdown and rescue of Nrx, hippocampal neurons were transfected at DIV 0 using nucleofection (AMAXA Biosystems, Lonza). A mixture of shRNA-resistant CFP-P2A-V5-Nrx1α and V5-Nrx1β at 10:1 ratio was used (Nrx<sup>∗</sup>), or the same amount of shRNA-resistant CFP-2A-V5-Nrx1αΔHS and V5-Nrx1βΔHS at 10:1 ratio (Nrx<sup>∗</sup>ΔHS), or CFP only, all in the same backbone vector pLL3.7-hSyn. For AAV mediated knockdown experiments, neurons on coverslips were exposed to 10<sup>10</sup> genomic copies of AAV per coverslip for 4 hours at DIV 3 and then returned to their home dishes. The AAV infection was repeated once at DIV 6. mIPSCs were recorded at DIV 13 while mEPSCs were recorded at DIV 14. Neurons were fixed at DIV 14 to investigate endogenous synapse numbers.</p>
<p id="p0245">For knockdown and rescue of NL1 in neuron culture, plasmids were transfected into primary rat hippocampal neurons at DIV 3 using Lipofectamine 2000. Analysis was performed at DIV 14.</p>
<p id="p0250">For biochemical experiments in neurons, rat cortical neurons were transfected with V5-Nrx 1, 2, or 3 alpha or β driven by the hSyn promoter using nucleofection. Cortical neurons were plated on six-well plates coated with poly-L-lysine at an approximate density of 900,000 cells/well and cultured in the same medium as hippocampal neurons without addition of cytosine arabinoside. Lysate was harvested at DIV 14.</p>
<p id="p0255">For co-cultures using COS7 cells or biochemical experiments using HEK293 cells, transfection of those cell lines was performed using TransIT-LT1 Transfection Reagent (Mirus) or 1% Polyethylenimine “Max” from Polysciences, Inc. (24765-1). In co-culture experiments, COS7 cells were trypsinized 24 hours post-transfection and plated onto neurons after two washes with DMEM/FBS, and the co-cultures were maintained for 24 hours before fixation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4.4.2">
<title>DNA constructs</title>
<p id="p0260">All Nrx constructs used for neuron expression and mapping HS modification sites lacked inserts at splice sites 4 and 5, for consistency and to allow co-culture activity with LRRTM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siddiqui et al., 2010</xref>). For the biochemical experiments in HEK293 cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>B, Nrx1α-CFP, Nrx2α-CFP, Nrx3α-CFP and Amigo-CFP were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siddiqui et al., 2010</xref>). Mouse cDNA of Nrx1β-GFP, Nrx2β-GFP, and Nrx3β-GFP in pEGFP-N1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Uemura et al., 2010</xref>) were generous gifts from Dr. Takeshi Uemura (Shinshu University, Nagano, Japan). These mouse Nrxβ plasmids were used to clone the following regions between HindIII and SpeI in pBluescript SK(-) to generate pSK(-)-pan-Nrxn 1, 2 or 3 plasmids for preparing <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization probes: Nrx1 (GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="intref0120" xlink:href="ncbi-n:NM_001346961.1">NM_001346961.1</ext-link>) nucleotides 1430 – 1828, Nrx2 (GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="intref0125" xlink:href="ncbi-n:NM_001205235.1">NM_001205235.1</ext-link>) nucleotides 4306 – 4710, and Nrx3 (GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="intref0130" xlink:href="ncbi-n:NM_001252074.2">NM_001252074.2</ext-link>) nucleotides 1603 – 1989. These regions were chosen as constitutively expressed regions common to Nrx α and β with minimal homology (22%–43%) between Nrx 1, 2 and 3. For the domain mapping in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>C, Nrx1β-CFP and deletion mutants Nrx1β-ΔLNS-CFP, Nrx1β-ΔCHO-CFP, Nrx1β-ΔCHObeg-CFP, and Nrx1β-ΔCHOend-CFP were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graf et al., 2004</xref>). Nrx1β-SA(316)-CFP, Nrx1βSSAA(332,333)-CFP, and Nrx1β-SSSAAA(316,332,333)-CFP were based on the plasmid above and made by site-directed mutagenesis.</p>
<p id="p0265">For neuron expression, the cDNAs of Nrx1α-CFP and Nrx3α-CFP were modified by replacing their C-terminal region with the mouse sequence from Nrx1β or Nrx3β. A V5 tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) was inserted after the signal peptide of all Nrx constructs and C-terminal CFP or GFP tags were removed. The resulting V5-Nrx1 α and β fragments were inserted into the pLentiLox3.7-hSyn vector to generate pLL3.7-hSyn-V5-Nrx1α and pLL3.7-hSyn-V5-Nrx1β.

To analyze endogenous synapse formation in neurons, anti-VGluT1 (mouse IgG1, 1:4000; NeuroMab, N28/9) and anti-PSD-95 (mouse IgG2a, 1:500; Thermo Scientific, clone 6G6-1C9; recognizes PSD-95, PSD-93, SAP102 and SAP97) were used to label excitatory synapses while anti-VGAT (guinea pig, 1:3000; Millipore, AB5905) and anti-gephyrin (mouse IgG1, 1:300; Synaptic Systems, 147021) were used to label inhibitory synapses. Dendrites were identified using anti-MAP2 (chicken polyclonal IgY, 1:8000; Abcam, ab5392) and axons were labeled by anti-tau (mouse IgG2a, 1:2000; Millipore, PC1C6; recognizes dephosphorylated tau).</p>
<p id="p0405">For all the secondary antibodies, we used highly cross-adsorbed, Alexa-dye conjugated secondary antibodies generated in goat toward the appropriate species and monoclonal isotype (1:1000; Invitrogen; Alexa 488, Alexa-568, and Alexa-647 labeled secondary antibodies). Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Fc fragment specific) (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch; 109-585-008) was used to visualize the bound recombinant hFc tagged proteins. AMCA conjugated anti-chicken IgY (donkey IgG; 1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch; 703-155-155) was used for visualizing dendrites.</p>
<p id="p0410">Cultures were randomized prior to imaging and quantification so the experimenter was blind to the treatment group. Sets of cells used for quantification were stained simultaneously and imaged with identical settings. Images of cultured cells were acquired on a Zeiss LSM700 or Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with 63x/1.4 NA, 40x/1.4 NA and 25x /1.25 NA oil objectives, a Photometrics Sensys cooled CCD or Hamamatsu Orca-Flash4.0 CMOS camera, and custom filters.</p>
<p id="p0415">For quantification of bassoon, synaptophysin, VGluT1, VGAT or synapsin signals in co-culture or polylysine or pleiotrophin bead assays, cells were selected based on expression of the transfected construct and substantial neurite contact in the phase contrast or DIC channel. Regions were created corresponding to the expressing COS7 cell or bead that excluded MAP2-positive dendrites areas, and the intensity and area of all puncta in the bassoon, synaptophysin, VGluT1, VGAT or synapsin channel were measured. Presynaptic inducing activity was reported as integrated intensity of punctate bassoon per COS7 cell area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>C, or integrated intensity of punctate synaptophysin per tau-positive axon contact area with beads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>M, or integrated intensity of punctate VGluT1 or VGAT per bead area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>Q, or integrated intensity of punctate synapsin per tau-positive axon contact area on COS7 cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>F.</p>
<p id="p0420">For quantification of endogenous synapse numbers from primary hippocampal neurons, regions were chosen randomly based on health in the phase contrast channel. Synapses were identified as clusters with pixel overlap between the separately thresholded VGluT1 and PSD-95 channels (excitatory) or VGAT and gephyrin channels (inhibitory). The number of synapses was normalized to the area of MAP2 positive dendrites that were randomly selected from two separate regions per neuron.</p>

Neurons were voltage clamped at −60 mV, and recorded with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Records were filtered at 2 kHz, and acquired with pCLAMP 10 software (Molecular Devices). The series resistance in the recordings varied between 6 to 8 MΩ, and recordings where series resistance varied by more than 10% were rejected. Cells that demonstrated a change in “leak” current of more than 10% (usually less than 50 pA) were rejected from the analysis. No electronic compensation for series resistance was employed. mEPSCs or mIPSCs recorded in a 2 min period were analyzed using Mini 6.0 software (Synaptosoft). The threshold for detection of events was set at approximately 3 times higher than the baseline noise.</p>

<title>In utero electroporation and spine imaging</title>
<p id="p0430">To transfect neocortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, E15.5 timed-pregnant female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, Massachusetts, United States) were deeply anesthetized with ∼2% isoflurane. Uterine horns were carefully exposed and ∼1 μL of DNA solution (1 μg/μl/plasmid in PBS) were injected into one lateral ventricle. Fast green (0.005%) was added to the DNA solution in order to monitor injection efficiency. Injections were performed with beveled glass micropipettes with ∼50 μm diameter tips (NARISHIGE, Japan). Embryo heads were electroporated with round plate electrodes (0.5 mm diameter) using a BTX ECM830 electroporator (Harvard Apparatus, USA) with 5 pulses (45V, 50 ms) at 1Hz. Warm PBS was dropped onto embryos periodically to prevent drying. The uterus was placed back into the pregnant mouse, and the anterior muscle and the skin were sutured separately. Pups were housed with dam until P17-20 when they were used for electrophysiology or imaging experiments.</p>
<p id="p0435">Previously electroporated male or female mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer. Brains were fixed for 24 hours at 4°C, washed in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and sectioned (50 μm) coronally using a vibratome (Leica VT1000S). Brain sections were mounted on glass slides, dried and mounted with ProLong antifade reagent containing DAPI (Molecular Probes). Whole brain sections were imaged with an Olympus VS110 slide-scanning microscope. For dendritic spine analysis high-resolution images of electroporated regions of somatosensory cortex were subsequently acquired with a Keyence BZ-X710 fluorescence microscope with 2D pinhole structure illumination. Confocal stacks of secondary dendrites of L2/3 cortical cells were acquired with a 60x objective and 1 μm spacing in Z. Images were processed and analyzed using ImageJ software.</p>

Cerebral hemispheres were removed and sliced in cold ACSF (300 μm coronal slices in Leica VT1200S vibratome). Slices were recovered for 15-20 minutes at 34°C in choline-based recovery solution (in mM): 110 choline chloride, 25 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 7 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25 glucose, 11.6 ascorbic acid, and 3.1 pyruvic acid), and then transferred to a holding chamber with 34°C ACSF that progressively cooled down to room temperature (20–22°C). All recordings were obtained within 1-6 h after slicing and solutions were constantly bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2. Individual slices were transferred to a recording chamber mounted on an upright microscope (Olympus BX51WI) and continuously perfused (1–2 mL per minute) with ACSF at room temperature. Cells were visualized using a 40 × water-immersion objective with infrared DIC optics. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings (room temperature) were made from pyramidal cells in L2/3 somatosensory cortex. Patch pipettes (2–4 MΩ) pulled from borosilicate glass (BF150-86-7.5, Sutter Instruments) were filled with a Cs+-based internal solution containing (in mM) 130 CsMeSO4, 10 HEPES, 1.8 MgCl2, 4 Na2ATP, 0.3 NaGTP, and 8 Na2-phosphocreatine,10 CsCl2, 3.3 QX-314 (Cl−salt), (pH 7.3 adjusted with CsOH; 295 mOsm per kg). For all voltage-clamp experiments, errors due to voltage drop across the series resistance (&lt; 20 MOhm) were left uncompensated. To isolate mEPSCs, cells were held at −70mV and ACSF included 20 μM SR95531 hydrobromide (Tocris), 10 μM (R)-CPP (Tocris) and 1 μM Tetrodotoxin (Tocris). Membrane currents were amplified and low-pass filtered at 3 kHz using Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), digitized at 10 kHz and acquired using National Instruments acquisition boards and a custom version of ScanImage written in MATLAB (Mathworks). Offline analysis of mEPSC frequency was performed using custom routines written in MATLAB and Igor Pro (Wavemetrics). Data from male and female mice was pooled as gender differences were not found. Statistical analyses were done in GraphPad PRISM7 software (GraphPad). mESPC cumulative plots represent the average of 1000 cumulative distributions after random sampling of 80 ISI/Amp values from each recorded cell.</p>

After cryoprotection, brains were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Fine Technical Company, Japan) and cut at 25 μm thickness. Sections were treated with proteinase K (40 μg/ml; Merck). After they were washed and acetylated, sections were incubated with digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled mouse Nrx cRNA probes. The DIG-labeled antisense riboprobes were prepared by transcription of linearized plasmids pSK(-)-pan-Nrxn 1, 2 or 3 using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase and a DIG RNA-labeling kit (Roche). After the sections were washed in buffers with serial differences in stringency, they were incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (1:5000; Roche, Japan). The cRNA probes were visualized with freshly prepared colorimetric substrate (NBT/BCIP; Roche, Japan). Nuclear fast red (Vector Labs., Burlingame, CA) was used for counterstaining.

All brain sections were then stored in PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide at 4°C. For injection, slices were kept in PBS in a customized circuit module built with an electrode connected to a square pulse stimulator (SD9; ETL). Microinjection pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillary tubes (World Precision Instruments) using a pipette puller (P-97, Sutter Instruments) and backfilled with 2 mM Alexa Fluor 594 Hydrazide (dissolved in 200 mM KCl, Thermo Fisher). Glass pipettes were mounted onto a micromanipulator connected to the same stimulator. The pipette tip was slowly advanced into <italic>stratum pyramidale</italic> of area CA3 in the hippocampus. The movement of the pipette was monitored by a Leica MZ16 F stereomicroscope equipped with a light source and fluorescent filters.

The accelerating voltage was 1.31 kV to 1.783 kV. The TrakEM2 plugin built into Fiji was used to assemble images for 3D reconstruction and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cardona et al., 2012</xref>). Randomly chosen dendrites (2 WT and 3 <italic>Nrxn1ΔHS</italic> dendrites) with their thorny excrescence spines (TEs) and contacting mossy fiber boutons (MFs) were traced using the tracing tools in TrakEM2. TEs were identified as dendritic protrusions with a single spine neck and multiple spine heads, contacted by MFs. MFs were identified as axon enlargements filled densely with synaptic vesicles adjacent to TE spines or the dendritic shaft. Only the vesicle-filled region of MFs was included in the volume estimates. Volumes of TEs and MFs were measured after a 3D reconstruction was generated in TrakEM2. The number of spine heads from each TE was manually counted from the 3D reconstruction in TrakEM2. Postsynaptic densities (PSD) were identified as apparent dense structures in the TE spines apposed to vesicle-rich regions of MF boutons. PSD area was estimated by summing the length of the PSD times the section depth for each component section. All analysis and quantification were done using raw image data. For presentation, raw EM images were smoothed by a Gaussian blur (1.0 pixel) and contrast and brightness adjusted. The surface meshes of 3D reconstructions of all objects were exported to Amira 5.6 (Thermo-Fisher) to adjust the color and transparency of the structures for presentation and for making movies.</p>
