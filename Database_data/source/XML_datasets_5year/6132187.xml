<abstract>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects half the US population over the age of 85 and is universally fatal following an average course of 10 years of progressive cognitive disability. Genetic and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified about 33 risk factor genes for common, late-onset AD (LOAD), but these risk loci fail to account for the majority of affected cases and can neither provide clinically meaningful prediction of development of AD nor offer actionable mechanisms. This cohort study generated large-scale matched multi-Omics data in AD and control brains for exploring novel molecular underpinnings of AD. Specifically, we generated whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing and proteome profiling data from multiple regions of 364 postmortem control, mild cognitive impaired (MCI) and AD brains with rich clinical and pathophysiological data. All the data went through rigorous quality control. Both the raw and processed data are publicly available through the Synapse software platform.</p>

<title>Background &amp; Summary</title>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects half the US population over the age of 85 and is universally fatal following an average course of 10 years of progressive cognitive disability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref></sup>. The certain cause of AD is known for 1-3% of early onset disease, which is autosomal dominant and 100% penetrant. Apolipoprotein E ε4 (<italic>APOE ε4</italic>) is a risk gene in 30% of common, late-onset AD (LOAD), but the mechanism linking <italic>APOE ε4</italic> to increased AD risk remains elusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref></sup>. Conventional genetic and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed additional loci associated with LOAD, the most recent of which is <italic>TREM2</italic> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3–7</xref>). However, the current set of established LOAD risk loci are not informative for individual risk of developing LOAD and fail to provide actionable insights for therapeutics. Molecular profiling including whole genome, exome and RNA sequencing are key technologies that hold promise for identifying functional pathways and key targets in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref></sup>. In this study, we generated whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, RNA-sequencing and proteome profiling data from multiple regions of 364 postmortem control, mild cognitive impaired (MCI) and AD brains with rich clinical and pathophysiological data. All the data went through rigorous quality control. Both the raw and processed data are publicly available through the Synapse software platform.</p>

<title>MSBB AD study population</title>
<p>364 human brains were accessed from the Mount Sinai/JJ Peters VA Medical Center Brain Bank (MSBB–Mount Sinai NIH Neurobiobank) cohort, which holds over 2,040 well-characterized brains. This cohort was assembled after applying stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria and represents the full spectrum of cognitive and neuropathological disease severity in the absence of discernable non-AD neuropathology. All neuropsychological, diagnostic and autopsy protocols were approved by the Mount Sinai and JJ Peters VA Medical Center Institutional Review Boards. Neuropathological assessments, cognitive, and medical and neurological status determinations were performed according to previously published procedures as described in detail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref></sup>. Briefly, for each sample, neuropathological assessments was performed according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref></sup> and included assessment by hematoxylin and eosin, modified Bielschowski, modified thioflavin S, and anti-β amyloid (4G8), anti-tau (AD2) and anti-ubiquitin (Dakoa Corp.). A Braak AD-staging score for progression of neurofibrillary neuropathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref></sup> was assigned to each case. Quantitative data regarding the mean of the density of neuritic plaques in the middle frontal gyrus, orbital frontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal cortex and calcarine cortex were also collected as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref></sup>. Clinical dementia rating scale (CDR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref></sup> was conducted for assessment of dementia and cognitive status. Ages for the samples were defined as Age at the time Of Death (AOD). AOD of the present population ranged 61–108, with a mean and standard deviation (s.d.) of 84.7±9.7. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> tabulates a summary of the demographic information of the present study population, including sex, AOD, mean plaque density, and Braak score, stratified by CDR score, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> illustrates the distribution of cognitive and neuropathological characteristics grouped by CERAD neuropathological category. There were 238 female and 126 male samples. Note that the majority (301) of the samples were of European ancestry, while 36 were African American, 25 were Latino, one was Asian, and one was unknown for race. The link to the complete demographic information of the present MSBB AD study population is provided (Data Citation 1 &amp; Data Citation 2).</p>

<title>Human brain tissue preparation</title>
<p>Four specific brain regions, Brodmann areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref></sup>, were selected for molecular profiling primarily based on our recent study of microarray profiling of 19 brain regions in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref></sup>. In that study, we systematically investigated the regional vulnerability to AD at the molecular level by evaluating region-specific expression changes associated with cognitive/neuropathological traits and then rank ordered the 19 brain regions accordingly. The parahippocampal gyrus (Brodmann area 36-BM36) and the inferior frontal gyrus (BM44) were the top two most vulnerable regions and thus were selected for this study. We also chose the superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann area 22-BM22, ranked as the 7<sup>th</sup> most vulnerable region) and the frontal pole (Brodmann area 10-BM10, ranked as the 14<sup>th</sup>) as contrast for studying the selective regional vulnerability to AD.</p>
<p>These four brain regions were dissected while frozen from fresh frozen, never-thawed ~8 mm thick coronal tissue blocks using a dry ice cooled reciprocating saw. The dissected regions were then pulverized to a fine powder consistency in liquid nitrogen cooled mortar and pestle and distributed into 50 mg aliquots. All aliquots were barcoded and stored at −80 <sup>o</sup>C until DNA, RNA or protein isolation.</p>

<title>RNA extraction</title>
<p>Total RNA were isolated from brain tissues using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit from Qiagen (cat#74804) according to the manufacturer's protocol (The RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit Handbook, Qiagen 104945, 02/2009) with these modifications: 1) all brain tissues (pulverized) were kept on dry ice before adding QIAzol Lysis Reagent, 2) tissues were suspended in the lysis reagent by vortexing with tubes placed on ice, and 3) the tissues were homogenized using a Tissue Ruptor (Qiagen, cat# 79656) at full speed for 20–30 s.</p>

<sec disp-level="3">
<title>RNA-seq protocol</title>
<p>RNA-Seq library preparation was performed using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Briefly, rRNA was depleted from total RNA using the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat) (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to enrich for coding RNA and long non-coding RNA. cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers, end-repaired and ligated with appropriate adaptors for sequencing. The library then underwent size selection and purification using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). The appropriate Illumina recommended 6-bp bar-code bases are introduced at one end of the adaptors during PCR amplification. The size and concentration of the RNAseq libraries was measured by Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and Qubit fluorometry (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) before loading onto the sequencer. The Ribo-Zero libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 System with 100 nucleotide single end reads, according to the standard manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA).</p>

Starting from star aligned bam files, Picard tools were used for adding read group information, sorting, marking duplicates and indexing. Next, GATK tool SplitNCigarReads was applied to split reads into exon segments and trim any sequences overhanging into the intronic regions. Then GATK base-quality score recalibration (BQSR) was called to detect systematic errors caused by the sequencer and subsequently adjust the base quality score. After recalibration, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insert/deletions (INDELs) were called jointly with the GATK HaplotypeCaller. Lastly, a series of hard filters were applied to remove low quality variant sites using recommended parameters, including filtering clusters of at least 3 SNPs within a window of 35, Fisher Strand values (FS)&gt;30.0, or Qual By Depth values (QD)&lt;2.0.</p>

<p>We utilized the GATK VariantEval tool to calculate various quality control metrics of the identified variants, including overall and per sample number of variants, transition/transversion (Ti/Tv) ratio, alternate allele heterozygous/homozygous (Het/Hom) ratio and insertion/deletion (Ins/Del) ratio. Overall, there were 399,135 SNPs and 22,967 INDELs identified, including 70,083 (17.6%) and 10,641 (46.3%) novel SNPs and INDELs, respectively. On average, 39,744 (364 novel) SNPs and 3,597 (228 novel) INDELs were detected per individual. The Ti/Tv ratio is a critical metric for assessing the quality of variants calling, with high quality exome sequencing variation dataset expecting to have Ti/Tv ratios between 2.8 and 3.0 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Over the whole study population, the Ti/Tv ratio at the known variant sites was 2.83, close to the standard value of 2.84 in the reference dbSNP dataset. The Ti/Tv ratio at the novel variant sites was 2.12; the slightly lower ratio at new sites is consistent with previously observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref></sup>.

<title>Proteomics data quality control and imputation</title>
<p>6,107 different proteins were identified from the experiment with an average missing rate at 41.8%. By selecting proteins with missing rate smaller than 15%, we obtain protein abundance profiles for 2,962 proteins in total. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3a</xref> illustrated the number of proteins with different missing percentages. In addition, these missing events were not random. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3b</xref> illustrated the abundance dependent missing trend, which is rather common in mass spectrometry-based protein profiling. Moreover, due to the through-put limitation of the proteomics experiments, 306 samples were divided into 8 batches and profiled separately, which led to strong batch effects in the resulting data as samples in different batches were subjected to different experimental noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c and d</xref>). Thus, it is important and necessary to remove batch effects and properly impute the missing values before any meaningful analysis can be effectively carried out. For this purpose, following Chen <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref></sup>, we implement a mixed effects model to remove batch effects and impute missing values while taking into consideration the abundance-dependent missing mechanism in the data.</p>

Here <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>ki</italic></sub> is the missing status, taking value 1 if <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>ki</italic></sub> if missing, and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>With the above model, we can estimate the random effect and impute the missing values by maximizing the likelihood function of the observed data. Specifically, we implement an expectation conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm which iterates between (1) estimating the expectation of missing data and random effect conditional on the observed data and parameter estimated from last step, and (2) maximizing the conditional likelihood given the updated conditional expectation of missing data and random effect to obtain the parameter estimation, until the pre-defined convergence criterion is met.</p>
<p>We performed the above procedure of Batch effect Correction and Missing value Imputation (BCMI) on each protein feature separately. Notice that 18 samples have two replicates measured in both the 7th and 8th batches. We examine correlations between each replicate pair before and after the above procedure. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>, replicate sample correlation increases after BCMI procedure, but decreases after the naïve imputation procedure (imputing the missing data by the median or minimum intensity of the corresponding protein), suggesting better data quality after the BCMI procedure.</p>

<title>Sample matching across different datasets</title>
<p>In the current study, 4 different types of -omics data, including WGS, WES, RNA-seq (from 4 brain regions), and proteomics, have been generated from the same set of postmortem brain donors and brain regions, resulting in more than 1,800 samples of different data types. Quality control (QC) and assessment relating to individual data platform/technique is in place, e.g., phred-score based filtering of low quality sequencing reads and missing data imputation for proteomics. However, during the production and management of large-scale data, sample errors, including incorrect labeling, sample swapping and contamination, are inevitable but harder to detect by the platform specific QC procedure on each type of data. Because sample errors can cause both false-positive and false-negative results, systems approach for QC across multiple -omics datasets are essential for reliable and accurate identification of true biological signals from the integrative data analysis. Given the scale and complexity of such datasets, automatic QC and adjustment methods need to be applied.</p>
<p>Here we developed and applied a robust and efficient computational pipeline to identify consistent assignments across the multiple types of molecular data in the MSBB AD cohort. The pipeline is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>. For the various sequencing data, we first mapped the sequencing reads onto human genome GRCh37 and then called genetic variants following GATK best practices as detailed above. The genetic variants survived standard filtering by GATK were subsequently used to compute basic QC statistics including missing rate, heterozygosity, sex imputation and sample principal components analysis (PCA) using plink<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref></sup>. Variants with missing rate &gt;50%, minor allele frequency&lt;0.01 or Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test P value&lt;0.001 were removed from further analysis. Samples with excessively high or low heterozygosity rate (more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean) in each data type were marked as they suggested either mixture (possibly due to contamination) or inbreeding in these samples. Plink can impute sex from X chromosome inbreeding coefficients and flag individuals for whom the reported sex in the meta table does not match the inferred sex. It is noted that some of the statistics, including heterozygosity rate, sex imputation and PCA, require a relatively large number of independent SNPs and hence the inference is more accurate from WGS than from WES or RNA-seq. On the other hand, gender inference in RNA-seq can be facilitated by using gender-specific marker genes, such as XIST (female-specific), DDX3Y (male-specific) and RPS4Y1 (male-specific). We found 6 sex-mislabeled samples in the MSBB WGS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>), 20 sex-mislabeled samples in RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>), and 16 sex-ambiguous samples in RNA-seq. As in many genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we found top principal components (PCs) from the WGS and WES reflected population structure, in the present case, race information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). As a result, 4 samples were found to be mislabeled for race and 13 samples were ambiguous for race. The quality controlled (QCed) sex and race information is detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>.</p>
<p>Next we estimated pairwise sample kinship using KING<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref></sup> and compared the genetic concordance among all sequencing samples across different data types. Since the sequencing samples from the same brain are expected to have high genetic similarity (in theory identical) while the sequencing samples from different brains are expected to present low genetic similarity, any kinship failure or mismatch suggested sample errors due to either incorrect ID labeling, sample swapping or contamination. We flagged the suspicious sample pairs which should match genetically but did not, and spurious sample pairs which should not match but present very high genetic similarity. Using an iterative procedure coupled with a majority voting scheme, we sequentially tested whether every suspicious or spurious sample was mislabeled and could be unambiguously identified with the correct brain source. Any sample which was inconclusive for its brain source was deemed problematic and discarded from further analysis. In each iteration, one sample with the most suspicious or spurious flags was selected for correction, then the suspicious and spurious flags for all samples was updated because one mislabeling may lead to multiple kinship errors and hence one correction may help resolve multiple errors.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8a</xref> illustrates examples of mislabeled samples identified through the iterative genetic concordance analysis. There were 6 sequencing samples (4 RNA-seq, 1 WES and 1 WGS) generated from the brain 44475 according to the sample annotation. These samples showed a high within-brain genetic concordance, except for hB_RNA_10452 which exhibited a low kinship estimate (&lt;0.1) with the other samples from the same brain, but a high kinship coefficient (&gt; 0.4) with 5 samples from the brain 53661. According to the guideline of KING<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref></sup>, an estimated kinship coefficient &gt;0.354 suggests a duplicate or mono-zygote twin while a kinship coefficient less than 0.1 indicates a 2nd-degree or more distant relationship. Thus, it was likely that sample hB_RNA_10452 was mis-labeled for its brain id and its true brain source should be re-mapped to 53661. Similarly, hB_RNA_10392 from the brain 10730 should be re-mapped to brain id 44475. We further identified that one RNA-seq sample, hB_RNA_10442, from the brain 53661 was also mislabeled. Resolving the true brain source for the samples in these 3 brains resulted in multiple corrections involving 3 more brains (27965, 1465 and 34015) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>. Using the iterative genetic concordance analysis, we identified the brain identities for 10 samples (3 from RNA-seq and from 7 WGS) which were originally unknown, re-mapped the brain identities for 38 samples (29 from RNA-seq, 5 from WES, and 4 from WGS), and excluded 15 samples (8 from RNA-seq, 3 from WES, and 4 from WGS) whose brain identity was unidentifiable. The samples which were re-mapped or excluded are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Figure 9</xref> shows the distribution of kinship coefficients estimated between 3 different sequencing data types before and after sample QC. In each plot, there are two density curves, one showing within-brain kinship coefficients with a peak close to 0.5 and the other showing between-brain kinship coefficients with a peak close to 0. It is noted that, before the sample QC, there was a small proportion of near-zero within-brain kinship coefficients (~4.5% of the pairs with kinship coefficient less than 0.1), which dramatically diminished after the sample QC (~0.36% of the pairs with kinship coefficient less than 0.1).</p>
<p>We used MODMatcher<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref></sup> to match proteomics data with the QCed sequencing data. In this analysis, we considered the sample labels in QCed sequencing data as ground truth. We first computed <italic>cis-</italic> protein QTLs (pQTLs) based on protein expression (after missing data imputation) and WGS genotype data using MatrixEQTL and then inferred genotypes at the cis-SNPs for each proteomics sample separately. With the inferred genotypes, genetic identity similarity scores between proteomics and WGS data were computed. Second, we ran the same pQTLs based genotype imputation analysis using WES genotype data as some proteomics samples had WES genotype but not WGS genotype. In the present analysis, we considered a proteomics sample <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> as properly aligned if (a) the similarity score (<italic>S</italic><sub><italic>ii</italic></sub>) with the supposed self-align WGS/WES sample <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> which had the same brain id was ranked in top 3 among all WGS/WES genotype profiles, or (b) <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>ii</italic></sub> was ranked in top 3 among all proteomics samples with respect to the genotype profile <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. This is slightly different from the original MODMatcher criterion which requires a reciprocal self-alignment. On the contrary, a proteomics profile would be considered mis-aligned with other unmatched genotype sample by reciprocal matching, in which we explored whether a mis-aligned genotype profile <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> has the highest similarity with an unmatched proteomics profile <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> among all proteomics samples, and the unmatched proteomics profile <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> has the highest similarity with <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> among all genotype profiles. If mislabels in proteomics data were identified, the quality of sample alignment was re-assessed according to the updated sample annotation and this process was iterated until convergence. In the present analysis, we obtained a 97.3% self-alignment rate in proteomics samples by using WGS genotype profiles and similarly a 97.1% self-alignment rate using WES genotype profiles. Collectively, we achieved a rate of 98.6% self-alignment combining the results from two genotype profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). We did not observe any reciprocal mis-matched proteomics profile. We also explored a <italic>cis</italic> mRNA-protein mapping procedure similar to the <italic>cis</italic> methylation-mRNA mapping in Yoo <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref></sup> by computing the ranked similarity score between mRNA and protein for pairs of RNA-seq and proteomics samples. However, the self-alignment rate from this approach was only 3.6% (data not shown), which is not surprising as the correlation between mRNA and protein expression is poor (mean and median <italic>cis</italic> mRNA-protein Spearman’s correlations are 0.093 and 0.085, respectively).</p>
<p>The relatively mild correlation between the RNA-seq and proteomics data may be caused in part by the sample processing where the tissues for the transcriptomic and proteomic profilings were dissected from different locations of the same region at different times. Other factors, such as different degradation rates of RNAs and proteins in postmortem brains, may also have some impact. Nevertheless, the mild correlations between RNAs and their corresponding proteins are not unique to this cohort as we observed a similar level of mild correlations between RNAs and proteins in an independent cohort of multi-Omic data from postmortem human brains, the Mayo cohort (doi:10.7303/syn5550404), which utilized the same LC-MS/MS technique for proteomic profiling as the Mount Sinai cohort. After filtering those with more than 15% missing values in the proteomic data followed by normalization and covariates adjustment, there were 2,914 proteins remained, out of which 2,880 had matched mRNA expression data from the same brain regions in the Mayo cohort. The mean and median of the Spearman’s correlations between matched mRNA-protein were 0.116 and 0.104, respectively. Therefore, extreme caution must be taken if one wants to predict protein abundance from RNA expression, or vice versa, in postmortem brain tissues.</p>

<title>Usage Notes</title>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Use case 1: Differential gene and protein expression in relation to AD</title>
<p>The present MSBB AD cohort consists of samples with varying degree of disease severity with respect to 4 different clinical and neuropathological traits in relation to AD. Stratifying samples into different severity groups allows for the differential expression of mRNAs and proteins at early or advanced stage of the disease. Investigators can prioritize genes which are altered in both mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, RNA-seq based mRNA expression was profiled in 4 different brain regions which can help identify region-specific gene signatures implicated in selective vulnerability to AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Use case 2: Identification of gene and protein expression quantitative loci and novel disease associated genetic variants</title>
<p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified more than 30 common genetic variants associate with the disease risk of late onset AD. However, the majority (&gt;75%) of the phenotypic variance remain unexplained by the known markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref></sup>. Massive genome sequencing from the present WGS and WES data offers an unprecedented opportunity to characterize both low frequency and rare variants that may have a profound impact on disease risk but otherwise missed by traditional GWAS. However, we must notice that the sample size is small and hence the power is very limited.</p>
<p>In addition, a joint analysis of WGS/WES genotype, RNA-seq and proteomics profiles can identify variants playing transcriptional or translational regulatory roles by the so-called expression and protein quantitative trait loci (eQTLs and pQTLs) analysis. Together with the genotype-disease association from this cohort and other public datasets, this could help identify variants conferring risk to AD via transcriptional or translational regulatory mechanisms.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Use case 3: Gene and protein integrative network analysis</title>
<p>AD is a complex human disease with a multifactorial nature involving a system of genetic and environmental interactions. Thus, there is a growing interest in applying an integrative network biology approach to model the interconnected relationships among a large network of gene/protein expression traits, genetic variants and clinical/neuropathological outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref></sup>. The network analysis approaches (e.g. WGCNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref></sup>, MEGENA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref></sup>, Bayesian causal networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref></sup> and other similar algorithms) combined with the deep and comprehensive multiscale -omics data can not only help identify gene/protein modules that were enhanced or disrupted in AD but also prioritize network hub regulators driving the key biological process implicated in AD.</p>
