<p id="P3">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate many cellular events during brain development by interacting with hundreds of mRNA transcripts. However, miRNAs operate non-uniformly upon the transcriptional profile with an as yet unknown logic. Shortcomings in defining miRNA-mRNA networks are limited knowledge of <italic>in vivo</italic> miRNA targets, and their abundance in single cells. By combining multiple complementary approaches, AGO2-HITS-CLIP, single-cell profiling, and innovative computational analyses using bipartite and co-expression networks, we show that miRNA-mRNA interactions operate as functional modules that often correspond to cell-type identities and undergo dynamic transitions during brain development. These networks are highly dynamic during development and over the course of evolution. One such interaction is between radial glia-enriched ORC4 and miR-2115, a great ape specific miRNA, which appears to control radial glia proliferation rates during human brain development.</p>

<body>
<p id="P4">Recent studies utilizing single cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize cell-type diversity in tissues have highlighted the need for multi-modal analyses of cellular phenotypes by unbiased classification schemas, particularly in developing systems where complex gene regulatory networks control orthogonal sources of transcriptional variation, including morphology, physiology, maturation, differentiation, and spatial position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. While mRNA expression levels can be used directly to define putative cell types, unbiased clustering methods to infer cell identities and to determine the boundaries of these identities requires either prior knowledge or additional modalities. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an inherently complex network of interactions that can serve as an additional feature of cellular identity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> with important implications for protein expression. miRNAs have a role in fine-tuning signaling pathways related to corticogenesis and their altered expression has been associated with numerous neurological disorders (reviewed in 7). Changes in miRNA expression patterns, often of large magnitude, occur as defining decision nodes during cell differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, suggesting that their cell type- specific abundance may represent an important parameter in cell type classification, and provide insights that extend beyond cell-type classification to the dynamic regulation of differentiation. The increase in miRNA numbers encoded in the genome as a function of organismal complexity implies that the emergence of novel cell types in the primate brain may be associated with increased numbers of cell type specific miRNAs in the brain. Previous studies ablating miRNA-processing enzyme Dicer1 emphasized the pleiotropic roles for this pathway related to tissue specificity, anatomical and cellular compartments, evolutionary relationships, developmental time points, and even specific cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, but the underlying framework for these differences is poorly understood. Profiling of miRNA abundance in developing human brain tissue samples suggested developmental regulation of miRNA expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, but these studies could neither distinguish cell-type specific patterns of miRNA abundance, nor dynamic cell fate transitions during development at the single cell level. To characterize the <italic>in vivo</italic> miRNA-mRNA interactions during human brain development, and to contextualize these networks in the framework of developmental transitions and cell identity, we leveraged three complementary datasets: high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> with an AGO2 antibody, simultaneous single cell profiling of mRNAs and miRNAs, and single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Our study revealed a dynamic network involving cell-type specific enrichment of miRNA expression patterns across diverse cell types, and dynamic miRNA target acquisition and loss in which the population of targeted mRNAs keeps pace with the dynamics of tissue development, cell diversity, and lineage progression during human brain development.</p>

<title>AGO2-HITS-CLIP identifies miRNA-mRNA interactions during prenatal human brain development</title>
<p id="P5">To identify the landscape of miRNA-mRNA interactions occurring in developing human brain <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> with AGO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1</xref>). AGO2 bound profiles were generated for primary samples of the developing human brain from stages corresponding to peak neurogenesis (GW15 and 16.5 – early stage) and early gliogenesis (GW19–20.5 – late stage), nine samples in total were harvested from prefrontal cortex (PFC), motor cortex area one (M1), visual cortex area one (V1) and other regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). AGO2-bound miRNAs and mRNAs were identified after sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1–2</xref>, see Methods for details). In total, 921 human miRNAs were detected and 10505 Ago2 binding sites were identified from both protein-coding genes and non-coding genes, including lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Approximately 43% of sites were in three prime untranslated regions (3’UTR) and 27% of sites were in coding DNA sequence (CDS). For further analysis, we considered only sites identified in the CDS and the 3’UTR, reflecting canonical miRNA-mRNA interactions. We identified 3693 and 2705 genes at early and late stages of development, respectively, actively targeted by miRNAs through CDS or 3’UTR parts of the transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We validated a subset of the canonical AGO site interactions using luciferase reporter assays in human cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Among the detected interactions were previously validated ones, such as miR-9 with FOXG1 and HES1 and miR-210 with CDK7, thereby confirming the strength of the method.</p>
<p id="P6">Unbiased enrichment analysis using the total expressed gene set in human developmental brain as the background, revealed that transcription factors, chromatin modifiers, and signaling pathway components were enriched among miRNA targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Surprisingly, hundreds of <italic>in vivo</italic> miRNA targets we identified were well-established markers of distinct cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, regulators of neurogenesis, migration, axonogenesis, synaptogenesis, and neuronal subtype specification. Broadly, single miRNAs target many mRNAs and single mRNAs are targeted by far fewer miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), representing a bipartite network of interactions between miRNAs and their direct target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Using a bipartite community detection algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, we revealed modules of miRNA-mRNA interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2–3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 5</xref>, see Methods for details). Interestingly, the average abundance of a bound miRNA correlated negatively with the total number of different miRNAs bound in each module (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), suggesting that miRNA targeting utilizes two strategies: (a) target with one or a very few abundant miRNAs; (b) target with multiple low abundance miRNAs. To contextualize these interactions in the framework of cell diversity we projected bipartite graph modules onto cell-type specificity information, calculated from published scRNA-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Our analysis revealed striking enrichment for cell-type specific transcripts among bipartite graph modules, suggesting that miRNAs acquire targets according to the cognate transcriptional landscape of individual cell-types.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Cell-type enrichment of miRNAs revealed by single-cell miRNA profiling</title>
<p id="P7">To further investigate how miRNA-mRNA interactions relate to the emerging diversity of cell types of the developing brain, we used an innovative protocol for combined detection miRNAs and mRNAs in the same single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2</xref>) using an automated microfluidic platform to perform automated cell capture, reverse transcription and targeted preamplification of mRNA and miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 7–8</xref>). In addition to long-established markers of distinct cell types in the developing cortex, we selected mRNA targets according to the specificity of their expression for distinct cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) as determined in Pollen AA et al., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. We profiled single cells isolated from human cortex samples at gestational week (GW) 14 (deep layer neurogenesis) and GW17 (upper layer neurogenesis). To enrich for progenitor cells and newborn neurons, we microdissected samples of the cortical germinal zone (GZ), and to capture maturing neuron populations and interneurons, we microdissected cortical plate regions (CP). In total, we retained data from 312 cells with more than 10 genes detected. Clustering analysis performed based on marker gene abundance revealed 11 clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). We inferred the identities of individual cell clusters as radial glia, intermediate progenitors, upper and deep cortical layer neurons, and interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b-c</xref>). Furthermore, spatial microdissections supported further refinement of our interpretations with respect to neuronal maturation state (newborn neurons captured from the GZ and maturing neurons captured from the CP)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Next, for every miRNA profiled, we quantified the abundance in every cell and calculated an expression enrichment score for every cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Surprisingly, the vast majority of miRNAs we profiled showed significant enrichment in at least one cell type, suggesting robust variation in miRNA abundance across closely related cells of the developing brain. For example, miR-221/222 and miR-92a were found enriched in cortical IPCs, in line with recent reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and consistent with their proposed roles in controlling proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, while miR-124 was enriched in postmitotic neurons, consistent with its proneural role in development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we grouped miRNAs according to the shared pattern of abundance across single cells using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Some of these specific miRNA coexpression modules operate within specific cell types, whereas others are broadly distributed across multiple cell-types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Our analysis revealed dynamic changes in miRNA abundance in concordance with neuronal differentiation and maturation, a critical axis of transcriptional variation in the developing brain.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Dual nature of miRNA-mRNA interactions</title>
<p id="P8">During mouse brain development, miRNAs are involved in regulating cell-type transitions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, but analogous regulatory mechanisms during human brain development have largely not been investigated. To address this limitation, we projected targets of miRNAs found to be co-expressed using sc-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>) onto bipartite co-regulatory modules inferred from HITS-CLIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). This analysis revealed a striking enrichment of targets of co-expressed miRNAs among bipartite network modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Interestingly, we found examples of interactions where miRNAs were enriched in neurons (WGCNA module ‘blue’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), and their targets fell into a regulatory module enriched for neuronal markers (bipartite module ‘yellow’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f</xref>). This interaction includes <italic>DNM1,</italic> a GTPase involved in synaptic vesicle recycling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, and <italic>NOVA1</italic>, a neuron specific RNA binding protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. The presence of miRNAs and target mRNAs in the same cell type was also observed when we correlated the abundance of miRNAs and their targets across single cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>), and is consistent with the idea of cell type-specific interactions as has been reported. For example, enrichment of miR-92 and its direct target EOMES in the same cell type has been reported in the developing cerebral cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P9">In addition, we also found interactions, in which a miRNA co-expression module was enriched in neurons (WGCNA module ‘green’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), but their targets show moderate enrichment for proliferating progenitors (bipartite module ‘lightgreen’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f</xref>). This interaction includes genes such as <italic>H2AFZ</italic>, involved in cell cycle regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, and PHGDH, a radial glia specific gene involved in L-serine biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Another example, miRNA co-expression module ‘turquoise’ is enriched in intermediate progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), whereas their targets are enriched in bipartite modules that include neuronal and radial glia genes, and genes expressed in both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f</xref>). For example, CC2D1B is expressed highly in radial glia and neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, and has been previously implicated in serotonergic signaling in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, but also regulates EGFR expression and could regulate cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P10">Together, these examples highlight dynamic rewiring of miRNA-mRNA interactions during neuronal differentiation and maturation in the developing human cerebral cortex. In particular, co-modularity miRNA-mRNA interactions as contextualized in the framework of gene and miRNA coexpression seems to follow at least two broad patterns: miRNAs are recruited in a cell type to repress genes not normally expressed in that cell type in some cases or miRNAs are expressed in a cell type to regulate the expression of genes expressed in that same cell type. Further refining these dual roles may emerge from higher resolution temporal data that synchronizes single cell developmental transitions with miRNA target degradation kinetics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Dynamic changes in miRNA-mRNA network during development</title>
<p id="P11">Next, we explored the temporal axis of miRNA-mRNA interactions. We compared the abundance of miRNAs at two stages of development - GW15–16.5 and GW19–20.5 (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and found 69 differentially expressed miRNAs between these two stages including recently evolved miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5–11</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). Two miRNAs, miR-449a and miR-449b-5p, which control mitotic spindle orientation during mammalian brain development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> showed the highest overall fold change in expression level between GW15–16.5 and GW19–20.5. We confirmed the expression of miR-2115, miR-449c, miR-455 and miR-362 by in-situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5–7</xref>). In addition, we also identified miRNAs, miR-1286, miR-142 and miR-548aa, as enriched in the occipital lobe compared to the frontal lobe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8–10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) suggesting, in line with recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, that miRNAs may regulate regionally divergent transcriptional states in the developing human cortex.</p>
<p id="P12">By independently performing bipartite network analyses for samples at each of the two stages studied, we found a striking preservation of most co-regulatory modules, as well as a set of distinct interactions present predominantly at one stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 10</xref>). Interestingly, many of these modules were also highly preserved when compared to adult human brain interactions previously surveyed using the same experimental strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11b</xref>). Together, our findings suggest that miRNA-mediated regulation forms a developmentally dynamic network of interactions related to cell type, developmental stage, and cortical area specificity.</p>
<p id="P13">Recent studies suggest that perturbations in miRNA expression may underlie human developmental neuropsychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, but the specific molecular consequences remain poorly understood. Interestingly, genes implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), are enriched in the magenta module (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). In addition, we found that the expression of several miRNAs recently implicated in ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> was biased towards expression in excitatory neurons in the developing mid-gestational human samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>), although their expression patterns may change over the course of brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Genes targeted by miR-137 in developing brain differ greatly from targets identified in adult human brain tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, suggesting that <italic>in vivo</italic> target interactions of these miRNAs may also change substantially during development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 11</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">To explore this observation more broadly, we considered whether individual miRNAs dynamically change their target landscape during development. We intersected cell type specificity of miRNA targets at either stage of development and found miRNAs whose targets are enriched in one cell type during early development, and in a different cell type later in development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). We found many miRNAs, like miR-181d-5p, miR-129–5p, miR-9 and miR-616–5p, whose targets were enriched in different cell types between early developmental stages and late developmental stages thereby indicating changing roles for these miRNAs during brain development. miR-1260a, miR-758–3p and miR-376c-3p targets were enriched in excitatory neurons only in late stages. miR-376c-3p is of interest because it can significantly enhance neural differentiation of <italic>in vitro</italic> pluripotent stem cell models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Targets of miR-92b-3p, let-7–5p, miR-421, and miR-137 were enriched for radial glial markers or excitatory neurons only at early stages. Both miR-92b-3p and miR-130b-5p have been reported to be specifically associated with neural progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. These examples further underscore the dynamic remodeling of miRNA interaction networks during development and suggest that further analysis of these interactions may reveal previously unappreciated cellular vulnerabilities of miRNA-mRNA interactions to disease mutations. Understanding cell-type-specific miRNA expression profiles, and their respective targets may highlight cellular patterns of selective vulnerability to disorders affecting miRNA expression by highlighting gene regulatory networks that might be perturbed in disease states.</p>

<title>Recently evolved miR-2115 regulates cell cycle in human radial glia</title>
<p id="P15">The developmental transition between GW15–16.5 and GW19–20.5 coincides with changes in proliferation rates of radial glia, and depletion of proliferative capacity in the human ventricular zone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Among the top five miRNAs differentially expressed between these stages, a great ape specific miRNA, miR-2115, was prominently upregulated at GW19–20 in the germinal zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5, 7</xref>). Among miR-2115 targets, ORC4, a known regulator of DNA replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, was enriched in radial glia at early stages of development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, and is a member of the turquoise module which is enriched for GW19–20.5 HITS-CLIP interactions within a segment corresponding to a putative miR-2115 response element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). Mutations in ORC4 are linked to Meier-Gorlin syndrome, which is frequently associated with microcephaly, suggesting that this gene may play an important role in normal brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that miR-2115 acts through a radial glia enriched gene regulatory network involving ORC4 to regulate cell cycle dynamics and thereby influences cortical progenitor cell function. To test this hypothesis, we first confirmed the binding of the ORC4 miRNA response element and miR-2115 using a reporter assay and inhibitor studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) as well as a nearly zero p value using the highly stringent target prediction algorithm PACCMIT-CDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Next, we overexpressed a synthetic mmu-miR-2115 (see Methods) in developing mouse cortex and found an increased proportion of radial glia, but fewer radial glia in mitosis, among the electroporated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>). Similarly, manipulation of miR-2115 expression influenced the development of human primary radial glia cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Both overexpression and inhibition of miR-2115 changed the proportion of cells expressing SOX2, indicating a possible role for this miRNA in proliferation or differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 13b</xref>). The phenotype was rescued by the addition of WT-ORC4 reporter construct expressed together with miR-2115 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">To more specifically test for a possible cell cycle phenotype, we performed a cumulative BrdU incorporation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e-g</xref>) in human radial glia using GFP-miR2115 construct. The change in the cell cycle rate caused by miR-2115 overexpression was rescued by the addition of ORC4 protein expression construct (full-length) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). This showed that miR-2115 expression regulates normal cell cycle duration in human radial glia by controlling ORC4 protein levels. Together, these findings suggest that miR-2115 emerged recently in evolution and integrated into post-transcriptional regulatory networks controlling cell cycle dynamics during human cortical development.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P17">Our study revealed several distinct mechanisms by which miRNA regulatory pathways contribute to human brain development. We developed a new single cell profiling approach for combined mRNA and miRNA profiling in the same cell. Using this approach, we examined cell type-specific patterns of miRNA abundance, which revealed highly dynamic changes in miRNA expression, even among the closely related cells of the developing brain. Our findings support the emerging view that many miRNAs are expressed in cell type specific patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. To gain insight into miRNA-mRNA interactome remodeling during cell type transitions, we intersected high throughput profiling of miRNA-mRNA interactions with cell type specific gene expression profiles. Many miRNAs, including those expressed in multiple cell types, regulate the expression of cell type specific genes. Dynamic changes in cellular transcriptomes occurring during developmental lineage progression are likely controlled through a variety of regulatory networks involving transcription factors, signaling pathways, as well as post-transcriptional, epigenetic, and epitranscriptomic mechanisms. Our analysis further emphasizes the contribution of miRNAs to vast majority of such networks, including genes regulating excitatory neuron laminar and projection fates, such as regulators of callosal projection neurons (BHLHE22, SATB2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>), corticothalamic neurons (TBR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>), and interneurons (LHX6, DLX5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>). Dissecting the implications of these interactions for neuronal subtype specification will require highly multiplexed approaches for functional validation.</p>
<p id="P18">Furthermore, by projecting cell-type-specific miRNA and mRNA expression patterns against the modular framework of the bipartite network of miRNA-mRNA interactions, our study revealed dynamic developmental remodeling of miRNA-mRNA interaction networks, involving conserved and recently evolved miRNAs, as well as cell-type-specific miRNA regulatory networks operating in the developing human brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 12</xref>). Comprehensive understanding of cell-type-specific miRNA-mRNA interactions may reveal previously unappreciated patterns of selective vulnerability of cell-types in neurodevelopmental disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders.</p>
<p id="P19">This multi-modal approach to cell-type identity revealed an additional regulatory element introduced into radial glial cells. The expression of a great-ape specific miRNA (miR-2115) targets the more ancient gene (ORC4). By locating the target site in the conserved coding sequence (CDS) without the same necessity for co-evolution of the target site as the presumably less constrained 3’ UTR, greater evolvability of this regulatory interaction is possible. Functional sites have been extensively reported in the CDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> and PAR-CLIP experiments in the human demonstrate that the numbers of CDS and 3′ UTR are similar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, a finding supported by predictive algorithms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. The functional data here on the control of the cell cycle duration in radial glia is consistent with the microcephalic primordial dwarfism phenotype of Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGORS2) due to mutations in ORC4. These individuals have lissencephaly and hypoplastic frontal lobes among other structural abnormalities.</p>
<p id="P20">In addition to specific miRNA coexpression modules associated with specific cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2e</xref>), many miRNAs are expressed across a variety of cell types and in so doing, operate within diverse trans- environments of cell type specific transcriptomes. In these latter cases, some miRNA modules can be broadly distributed across multiple cell-types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). These latter modules may represent shared functionalities across different cell types or poorly resolved intermediate states. Setting boundaries for cell clusters is a statistical matter, which can continue to accrue additional support with more miRNA expression data. miRNA abundance is not easily measured with commonly used single cell RNA sequencing platforms. With more highly resolved single cell quantification novel cell identities may become apparent or cell type boundaries may emerge as less bistable and rather depend upon an analog model.</p>
<p id="P21">The developing primate brain forms a tiered structure through and within which precursor cells migrate and acquire a series of identities ultimately leading to the diverse terminal identities of their progeny. Mitosis is a pivotal event in which the progeny reproduce the parental identity, acquire new identities or produce divergent identities in the two daughter cells. Mitosis wipes the slate of the parental profile and novel cell identities can arise in the daughter cells through transcription factor expression. miRNAs as less potent drivers of cell identity than transcription factors, but as critical tuners of precise and robust identities assume an expression profile tightly linked to cell identity. When serial identities emerge as cells migrate to their architectonic destinations in the absence of mitosis, environmental influences and intrinsic mechanisms drive neurons to their terminal identities. Interestingly, precursors that differentiate in the absence of mitosis must utilize miRNAs differently than in stably differentiated cells in which their prominent role is homeostatic to buffer change. This strategic difference in the role of miRNAs—to foster change rather than stability—suggests further realms of cellular systems control over cell identity.</p>

Mutant reporters were generated as gBlocks from IDT lacking the miRNA response element being tested. After 72 hours in culture, cells were lightly fixed in 4% PFA, followed by imaging of fluorescence using SP5 confocal microscope at constant laser power and detector conditions. Approximately 10 fields of view were considered at random, and all cells in every field of view were used to quantify the average intensity of fluorescence signal (per pixel) across four conditions for every miRNA:mRNA interaction examined: control reporter with wild type MRE, control reporter with wild type MRE together with anti-miRNA inhibitor, reporter lacking an MRE, and a reporter lacking an MRE together with anti-miRNA inhibitor. For wild type and mutant reporter, we calculated the ratio of average fluorescence per pixel with and without anti-miR inhibitor.

This mechanism of mRNA destruction by miRNA binding is both prevalent and implements a more rapid and more readily detectable effect on downstream pathways. Moreover, we chose AGO2 because the data would be suitable for comparison with the previously generated HITS-CLIP data in the adult brain33, which we analyzed to gain insights into the preservation of the miRNA - mRNA interaction modules in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S11b</xref>.

During the reverse transcription step, miRNAs are reverse-transcribed to cDNA using stem loop RT primers from the Megaplex RT primer pool (Life Technologies) that are specific for mature miRNA species and reagents from the Single-cell-to-CT kit (Life Technologies). mRNA species are reverse-transcribed at the same time during this process using mRNA primers which are present in the Single-Cell VILO RT. Megaplex primers and mRNA primers are added at the recommended concentrations. The choice of the sc-PCR microRNA targets was constrained by the pool of miRNA pre-enrichment primers from Life Technologies, and by the cost of Taqman primers.

<title>Preprocessing and Mapping of AGO2-HITS-CLIP Tags</title>
<p id="P44">Barcodes were identified and reads were separated into each sample. Adapter sequences at both ends of reads were removed using Cutadapt <sup>59</sup>. Trimmed reads were mapped to the human genome (hg19) with novoalign (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.novocraft.com/">http://www.novocraft.com/</ext-link>). Identical alignments were collapsed in each sample to remove PCR replicates. Strand specific read coverage was then calculated using the alignments from each sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S23">
<title>miRNA profiling and Differential Expression Analysis</title>
<p id="P45">Adapter-trimmed AGO2 reads from miRNA libraries were mapped to human miRNA precursors from miRBase version 21 by using miRdeep2 <sup>60</sup>. DESeq2 was used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs between 2 developmental stages <sup>61</sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S24">
<title>Peak Calling and Identification of Clusters/AGO Footprint</title>
<p id="P46">Piranha and zero-truncated negative binomial model (ZTNB) were used to calculate the significance of read coverage at each mapped genomic position in each samples <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,62</sup>. In summary, the read heights for each mapped genomic position were assumed to be sampled from an underlying ZTNB distribution, and parameters for ZTNB probability density functions were estimated using read height measured at all positions of the genome. P-values were calculated as the probability of observing a read height as large as the height in question and assigned to each position. We used Fisher’s method to calculate the joined p-values at each genomic position across all samples. Positions with a joined FDR &lt;5% were deemed significant. Significant positions within 50 nts of one another were merged into a single contiguous interval as single AGO binding site, and resulting regions of less than 50 nts were symmetrically extended to 50 nts as accounting for the AGO binding footprint 63. AGO binding sites were then annotated according to their overlapping gene structures from GENCODE annotation Version 19.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S25">
<title>Identification of miRNAs for each AGO binding sites</title>
<p id="P47">In order to identify miRNAs that bind each AGO site on mRNAs and lncRNAs, all types of canonical binding sites including 7mer-1A,7mer-m8 and 8mer <sup>64</sup> for all prenatal brain expressed miRNAs were searched within the full length AGO binding sites defined as above. miRNAs with miRNA recognition elements (MREs) within each AGO binding site were counted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S26">
<title>WGCNA Analysis</title>
<p id="P48">To detect groups of co-expressed miRNAs, we used the WGCNA R package <sup>65</sup>. Cells analyzed using sc-qPCR were included in this analysis. To intersect miRNA co-expression module targets with bipartite network annotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>), for every miRNA co-expression module we took the union of HITS-CLIP predicted targets of the miRNAs in that module.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S27">
<title>Cell-type-specificity and Enrichment Analysis for miRNAs in single-cell data</title>
<p id="P49">We performed one-tailed Wilcox/Mann-Whitney-U Test to detect differential enrichment of each miRNA in each cell-type against the other cell-types. A miRNA is defined to be enriched in a cell-type, if it is expressed significantly higher in that cell-type compared to the other cells in that population (adjusted p&lt;0.05).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S28">
<title>Correlation with target mRNA levels</title>
<p id="P50">To correlate the relative abundance of co-expressed miRNAs and their targets across the major cell-types of the developing brain, we calculated the average module eigen-gene for modules detected in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2</xref> across radial glia, intermediate progenitors, neurons and interneurons. In parallel, we used published scRNA-seq data 38 and the cell-type assignments therein for radial glia, interneurons, intermediate progenitors, and excitatory cortical neurons, to calculate cell-type-wise average expression level of the genes identified as AGO2 bound miRNA targets as well as non-targets. We then correlated the average module eigen-gene with all of the gene targets predicted by HITS-CLIP and non-targets, and we calculated the average correlated for each in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>. To compare the average correlations, we first converted correlation to z-scores using Fisher transformation. The differences between average z-scores (for targets and non-targets) were divided by the joint standard errors and significance was calculated based on normal distribution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S29">
<title>Gene Enrichment Analysis</title>
<p id="P51">Transcriptome data from similar prenatal brain tissues <sup>66</sup> was downloaded and the expressed genes were used as a better background set for gene enrichment analysis. The p-value was calculated with hypergeometric test, and adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method (unless otherwise mentioned). To formally demonstrate that cell-type-specific genes are regulated by miRNAs, we used published scRNA-seq datasets to calculate cell-type-specificity scores using ideal vector correlation for every miRNA target identified by HITS-CLIP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). We defined a gene to be a signature of a cell-type if its Pearson correlation is 3*stdev higher than the mean Pearson correlation score of all genes in all cell types (histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) 15,27.</p>
<p id="P52">To calculate the overlap with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) genes, we used genes associated with ASD annotated by SFARI Gene<sup>67</sup>. A module is defined to be enriched in ASD if the FDR corrected p value of hypergeometric test is less than 0.05 (the total number of expressed genes in prenatal brain tissues is used as the background as well).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S30">
<title>Bipartite Community Detection Analysis</title>
<p id="P53">An unweighted (binary) bipartite network was constructed such that there exists an edge between each miRNA-mRNA pair if and only if such interaction is detected by AGO2-HITS-CLIP. First, this network was shown to be scale-free (P &lt; 0.001), and then by generating random networks while constraining the number of edges and nodes to the original miRNA-mRNA network and calculating Barber`s modularity score <sup>68</sup> (Null distribution), the miRNA-mRNA network shows to be significantly modular (P for permutation test &lt; 2e-16). Label Propagation followed by the Bipartite Recursively Induced Modularity (LP-BRIM) algorithm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> was used for community detection in this bipartite network. Due to stochasticity of this method, we obtained robust communities by repeating LP-BRIM 2500 times and determining the overlap among all the iterations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S31">
<title>Bipartite network construction</title>
<p id="P54">The bipartite networks were generated using all detected target genes (3463 nodes in mode I) and all miRNA (514 nodes in mode II). An edge exists between only one node in mode I and one node in mode II if such interaction is present in HITS-CLIP data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>) (no edge is allowed between nodes in mode I (or mode II)). Hence in this study, three distinct networks were built using GW15–16, GW19–20 and the combined GW15–16/19–20 HITS-CLIP data set with 31859, 20734, and 36176 total edges, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S32">
<title>Bipartite network modularity statistics</title>
<p id="P55">First, the R “bipartite” package 69 was used to show that the constructed network is scale-free. For consistency with the literature definition of scale-free networks, we showed that this network significantly obeys power law, truncated power law, and exponential distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S11 A and B</xref>, P &lt; 0.001). Next to demonstrate that these networks are significantly modular, we first generated a null distribution by randomly shuffling the edges between the nodes and calculating Barber`s modularity score. Finally, we showed that the network is significantly modular using a permutation test (P &lt; 2e-16).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S33">
<title>Bipartite community detection</title>
<p id="P56">We used R “lpbrim” package <sup>70</sup> to detect communities in the described networks. Due to stochasticity of the method, we ran the community detection algorithm 25 times and obtained the best solution among all 25 runs (with maximum Barber`s modularity score). We repeated this procedure 100 times, and found the consensus clustering as follows:
<list id="L1" list-type="order"><list-item><p id="P57">We first defined the Overlap Rate Matrix (ORM) as a symmetric N by N matrix where N is the total number of miRNA and target genes combined. Each entry ORMij shows the probability (or rate) of which target gene (or miRNA) i lies within the same cluster as target gene (or miRNA) j upon 100 runs.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P58">The obtained ORM was further clustered using hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S11 C and D</xref>). Each obtained diagonal block after hierarchical clustering represents one community (contains both target genes and miRNAs that have significant intra-modular interactions compared to their inter-modular interactions with target genes (or miRNAs) in other communities.).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P59">Finally, dynamic branch cutting implemented in “dynamicTreeCut” R package was used for tree cutting and assigning cluster ids to each node (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S11 E and F</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P60">We repeated this procedure to show that the obtained clusters are robust and reproducible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S11 C and D</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p>

<title>Bipartite module preservation analysis</title>
<p id="P61">In order to determine whether each identified module in GW15–16 network is statistically preserved in GW19–20, we first find the closest module in GW19–20 to GW15–16 in terms of the number of shared nodes in that module. Then, using the hypergeometric test, module preservation statistics were obtained and corrected using the BH method for multiple comparison. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>, two homolog modules in GW15–16 and GW19–20 have similar interaction levels suggesting preserved topology of modules as well. Note that names of GW15–16 module colors are used to label <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>.</p>

<title>Inference of evolutionary history of miR-2115</title>
<p id="P62">To infer the evolutionary history of miR2115, we used genome sequences obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser (the most recent genome assemblies used). Alignments were done using the Geneious bioinformatics platform (version 9.1.8). Human SPINK8 gene sequence is annotated with introns, exons, CDS and UTR regions and miR-2115 location according to “NCBI RefSeq” track on the UCSC Genome Browser. SPINK8 gene orthologs were located in chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon genomes using “Other RefSeq” track on UCSC Genome Browser. We excluded Bonobo because of the poor quality of genome assembly at the area of interest. Primate SPINK8 sequences were aligned with human SPINK8 sequences individually using the MUSCLE Alignment algorithm. Primate SPINK8 sequences were annotated with introns, exons, CDS and UTR regions and miR-2115 location according to alignment with the annotated human SPINK8 sequence. Originally primate SPINK8 genes were annotated according to the “Other RefSeq” track on UCSC Genome Browser but this yielded varied and unreliable results. Presence or absence of miR-2115 was determined based on alignment of human miR-2115 to the orthologous primate sequence (with mature transcript and seed region taken into consideration). Annotated human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon SPINK8 intron 3/4 (intron miR-2115 is located in) sequences were aligned together to visualize changes in intron sequences between species. Boundaries of insertions and deletions in SPINK8 intron 3/4 occurring between species defined based off evolutionarily chronological alignments of SPINK8 intron 3/4 sequences (e.g. gibbon and orangutan alignment, orangutan and gorilla alignment, etc.). Evolution of the SPINK8 intron 3/4 was predicted using the fewest number of mutations that would give rise to observed insertions and deletions.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p id="P63">Statistical tests, sample sizes and assumptions are indicated in each corresponding figure legend, except for bipartite network analysis, which is described above. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested.</p>
<p id="P64">Across all experiments and quantification, each tissue specimen was considered a biological replicate. Although we did not use formal methods of randomization, quantification of immunostaining was always performed on ‘blind’, such that identity of sample and condition was not known to the person performing the quantification.</p>
<p id="P65">Across all experiments, specimens with low viability of cells after plating, and specimens that have been contaminated with bacteria, or specimes for which we could not perform the entire experiment were not included in the analysis and not reported. For mouse embryos, we selected embryos with highest quality of electroporation based on visual assessment under a stereotaxic fluorescence microscope. For animal and human embryonic tissue, we did not examine the embryos for sex in these experiments.</p>
<p id="P66">No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications33. Across all experiments, data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested.</p>

<title>Single-cell miRNA Expression Profiling Reveals Patterns of Cell-type Enrichment.</title>
<p id="P76"><bold>(a-c)</bold> sc-qPCR profiling of mRNA and miRNA abundance in the same cell. <bold>(a)</bold> Schematic outlining experimental approach and cell types expected to be enriched in microdissected brain regions. <bold>(b)</bold> Heatmap of mRNA target genes used to interpret cell identities. <bold>(c)</bold> tSNE plot of single-cell data generated using Seurat based on mRNA marker gene abundance. Colors represent unbiased clustering (see Methods for details). <bold>(d)</bold> Heatmap representing cell-type enriched miRNA expressions profiled (one-tailed U-test). Cell type enrichments were calculated for cells captured from 2 biologically independent specimens. <bold>(e)</bold> Weighted gene co-expression network analysis reveals modules of co-expressed miRNAs across single-cells profiled in <bold>a-b</bold>. Network plot shows miRNAs assigned to this network based on correlation of abundance across single cells. Module blue and turquoise are enriched in mDLN and IPC, respectively. As in (d), this calculation was based on values from cells captured from 2 biologically independent specimens. mDLN- maturing deep layer neurons, dIPC – dividing intermediate progenitor cells, nIPC – non-dividing intermediate progenitor cell, nULN- newborn upper layer neuron, IN – interneurons, mULN – maturing upper layer neurons, RG – radial glia, nDLN – newborn deep layer neurons. <bold>(f)</bold> Enrichment of targets of co-expressed miRNAs across bipartite network modules. Co-expression modules were calculated for two biologically independent specimens, while bipartite modules were calculated for n=9 biologically independent specimens. * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001.

<title>Dynamic changes in miRNA regulatory networks during development.</title>
<p id="P77"><bold>(a)</bold> Differential expression analysis identifies miRNAs differentially expressed between GW15–16 and GW19–20 developing human cortex. Red dots indicate primate-specific miRNAs. Heatmap displays the expression z-score of each miRNA in that sample. Each column represents a specimen, and specimens are arranged according to age. <bold>(b)</bold> Validation of differentially expressed miRNAs by <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridization in the developing human neocortex sections. Images show staining in the outer sub-ventricular zone. For every specimen, the experiment was repeated three times in different sections with similar results. <bold>(c)</bold> Module preservation analysis demonstrates significant similarity between most modules obtained for networks generated across GW15–16 and across GW19–20 samples as well as a set of distinct interactions present predominantly at one stage (e.g. association of modules turquoise and lightyellow with GW19–20 and modules brown and blue with GW15–16). GW15–16 module names are used to compare GW15–16 modules with their homologues in GW19–20. <bold>(d)</bold> Stage-specific changes in miRNA targets according to their specificity to distinct cell types of the developing brain identified using single-cell RNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.
