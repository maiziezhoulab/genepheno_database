<p>Aromatic <sc>L</sc>-acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency causes severe motor disturbances in affected children. A putamen-targeted gene therapy improves the motor function of patients. The present study investigated the electrical properties of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra compacta (SNc) of mice with an AADC deficiency (Ddc<sup>KI</sup>). The basal firing of DA neurons, which determines DA release in the putamen, was abnormal in the Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice, including a low frequency and irregular firing pattern, because of a decrease in the after-hyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude of action potentials (APs). The frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) increased and that of spontaneous inhibitory PSCs (sIPSCs) decreased in the SNc DA neurons from the Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice, suggesting an elevation in glutamatergic excitatory stimuli and a reduction in GABAergic inhibitory stimuli, respectively. Altered expression patterns of genes encoding receptors and channels were also observed in the Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice. Administration of a widespread neuron-specific gene therapy to the brains of the Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice partially corrected these electric abnormalities. The overexcitability of SNc DA neurons in the presence of generalized dopamine deficiency likely underlies the occurrence of motor disturbances.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aromatic <sc>L</sc>-acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency (MIM 608643) is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in AADC activity required for the synthesis of dopamine, serotonin, and other monoamines (Brun et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2010</xref>). Patients with a severe AADC deficiency experience hypotonia, hypokinesia, dystonia, oculogyric crisis (OGC), and developmental delays because of a dopamine deficiency in the striatum (Brun et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2010</xref>). Patients also exhibit emotional instability and sleep disturbances because of the serotonin deficiency in the brain and autonomic dysfunction caused by systemic epinephrine and norepinephrine deficiencies (Brun et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2010</xref>). Due to its rarity, there are no approved treatments for AADC deficiency. We have previously developed a gene therapy for children with AADC deficiency using an intraputaminal injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) type 2 vectors expressing the <italic>DDC</italic> cDNA (Hwu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2012</xref>). Patients exhibited dramatic improvements in motor development and moderate improvements in emotional control and cognitive function after gene therapy (Hwu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2012</xref>). However, the underlying cellular mechanism for the motor disturbances of AADC deficiency remains elucidative.</p>
<p>The dopaminergic (DA) system is important for normal motor control. Increase or decrease levels of dopamine in the brain cause a noticeable change in motor performance. A part of the basal ganglia circuitâsubstantia nigra compacta (SNc) has been found to play a key role in motor function (Schultz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2007</xref>). The SNc contains a large population of DA neuron, which displayed regular/irregular spontaneous firing <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> (Grace and Bunney, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1984a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">b</xref>; Grace and Onn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">1989</xref>; Cui et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2004</xref>). Changes in DA neuron firing patterns in SNc may cause the disturbance of information processing in the basal ganglia, resulting in motor-related disorders such as Parkinsonâs disease (Bergman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">1998</xref>). Additionally, the change of firing pattern in mouse models with dopamine deficiency had been described. In DA deficiency mice (<italic>Th</italic><sup>â/â</sup>; <italic>Dbh</italic><sup>Th/+</sup>; DD mice), the firing patterns showed only single-spike pattern without bursting activity (Paladini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2003</xref>). Furthermore, in Parkinsonâs disease-associated mitochondrial dysfunction model with reduced dopamine production (<italic>PINK1-</italic>deficiency mice), the SN DA neurons display hyperexcitability <italic>in vivo</italic> with irregular firing patterns <italic>in vitro</italic> (Bishop et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2010</xref>). These are considered due to the reduction of endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-dependent SK channel function that is mediated by mitochondrial Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (Bishop et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2010</xref>). Because <italic>PINK-1</italic> is predominant in mitochondria (Bishop et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2010</xref>) and the dysfunction of ER-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is explained by mitochondrial dysfunction. We doubt if AADC, the cytosolic enzyme deficiency, underlies the similar mechanism.</p>
<p>The present study investigated the electrical properties of DA neurons in the SNc of a mouse model of AADC deficiency, the Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mouse. We also administered a widespread neuron-specific gene therapy to Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice to confirm the specificity of our findings. The results of this study demonstrated that the alteration of neuronal excitability of SNc DA neurons in the presence of generalized dopamine deficiency likely underlies the occurrence of motor disturbance.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>AADC-deficient mice (Ddc<sup>KI</sup>) with B6/129 hybrid were maintained by heterozygous mating (Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2013</xref>). The mice received care according to IACUC guidelines and were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle. Wild-type (WT) littermates were used as controls. The mice were sacrificed at 4 weeks of age for electrophysiological analyses, immunofluorescence (IF) staining, or biochemical studies in both genders. Mouse brains used for measurements of DA and serotonin levels and AADC activity were fresh frozen in liquid nitrogen after euthanasia and dissection and stored at â80Â°C. For IF, the mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the brains were post-fixed overnight at 4Â°C. Mice were anesthetized by the inhalation of isoflurane inhalation and decapitated as previously described (Ho et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2012</xref>; Jiang-Xie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2014</xref>) to prepare brain slices. Fresh brains were quickly removed into a chilled (0â4Â°C) cutting solution containing 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 110 mM choline chloride, 25 mM glucose, 2 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 7 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11.6 mM sodium ascorbate and 3.1 mM sodium pyruvate. Horizontal brain slices (200â220 Î¼m thick) containing SNc neurons were cut using a microslicer (DTK-1000, Dosaka, Kyoto, Japan). Slices were then allowed to recover for at least 1 h prior to recording in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM glucose, 3 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 125 mM NaCl, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis, brain sections containing substantia nigra were stored at â20Â°C with Trizol<sup>Â®</sup> before analysis. Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol<sup>Â®</sup> reagent and RT were performed according to the manufacturerâs protocol and previous report (Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2013</xref>).</p>

<title>Gene Therapy Injection and Neurotransmitter Analyses</title>
<p>A neuron-specific virus (yfAAV9/3-Syn-I-mAADC; AAVN-AADC) with a viral titer of 2.3 Ã 10<sup>13</sup> vg/ml was bilaterally injected into the lateral ventricles [intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection; 2 Ã 10<sup>10</sup> vg in 2 Î¼l for each hemisphere] of neonatal Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice (&lt;24 h; P0) as previously described (Kim et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2013</xref>; Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2014</xref>). Analyses of DA and serotonin levels in mouse half brain homogenates were performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as previously described methods (Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2015</xref>). Dual IF staining was performed on 30 Î¼m coronal sections. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 1:800; Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and AADC (1:800; a gift from Professor Ichinose, Tokyo Institute of Technology) double staining was also performed, followed by incubations with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 594-labeled anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (both from Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Sections were viewed and photographed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 Meta Confocal Microscope, Zeiss, Germany).</p>

<title>Electrophysiological Studies</title>
<p>A horizontal single slice was transferred to the recording chamber, held in position using stainless steel grids with a nylon net, and immersed in a continuously flowing solution at a rate of 2â4 ml/min, as previously described (Jiang-Xie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2014</xref>). Neurons were visualized under an infrared-DIC camera using an upright microscope (BX51WI, Olympus). Whole-cell recordings were performed at room temperature (22â24Â°C) using a patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Patch electrodes (5â8 MÎ©) were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries using a micropipette puller (P97, Sutter Instrument) and filled with a solution containing 140 mM K-Glu, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>GTP and 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine at pH 7.2 (adjusted with KOH). Data were acquired using a digitizer and pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Signals were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. SNc DA neurons were characterized by the presence of a large hyperpolarization-activated current (<italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub>) in response to a hyperpolarizing pulse, as described previously (Grace and Onn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">1989</xref>). In some recordings 0.2% w/v biocytin was contained in the internal solution, and conducted immunohistochemistry of TH after experiments. The interspike interval (ISI) and ISI coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated within the first 5 min after the establishment of the whole-cell configuration (current-clamp mode; Dufour et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2014</xref>). Six previously described action potential (AP) properties were measured: AP threshold, AP rise slope, AP decay slope, AP half width, AP amplitude, and after-hyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude (Dufour et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2014</xref>). Cells were voltage-clamped at â70 mV in the presence of a GABA receptor antagonist (100 Î¼M picrotoxin) in ACSF to obtain the AMPA receptor-mediated spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs). KCl was substituted for K-Glu, and the cell was voltage-clamped at â70 mV in the presence of NMDA and AMPA receptor antagonists, DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) 50 Î¼M and cyanquixaline (CNQX) 25 Î¼M, respectively, in ACSF to obtain spontaneous inhibitory PSCs (sIPSCs). For investigating the neuronal excitability, 20 Î¼M NMDA was used. Data were acquired using a digitizer and pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). The signals were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. Spontaneous events were detected and analyzed using the MiniAnalysis Program (Synaptosoft Inc.).</p>

<title>The Manifestations of Ddc<sup>KI</sup> Mice Were Corrected by Gene Therapy</title>
<p>We previously demonstrated that Ddc<sup>KI</sup> (KI) mice exhibit a profound DA deficiency, poor weight gain, and early death (Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2013</xref>); possibly due to reduced food intake and followed by essential compounds deficiency including tryptophan that further worsen the serotonin deficiency; and gene therapy rescues these deficits (Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2015</xref>). Gene therapy-treated and untreated mice were used in the present study. The current study administered ICV injections of a neuron-specific vector (yfAAV9/3-Syn-I-mAADC; AAVN-AADC) to mice within 24 h of birth. The AAVN-AADC-treated Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice (KI-AAVN mice) exhibited better survival (<italic>p</italic> = 0.023) and higher body weight at 4 weeks of age (<italic>p</italic> = 0.028) than the untreated Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A,B</xref>). DA levels in the brains of the treated mice increased to the levels observed in WT mice (<italic>p</italic> = 0.83, <italic>U</italic> = 4, treated vs. WT mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), and serotonin levels exhibited a 50% increase compared to the levels in WT mice (<italic>p</italic> = 0.05, <italic>U</italic> = 0, treated vs. WT mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Double IF staining revealed widespread expression of DDC in neurons throughout the brain, including SNc DA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1EâJ</xref>).</p>

<title>Irregular Basal Firing in SNc DA Neurons of Ddc<sup>KI</sup> Mice</title>
<p>DA neurons within the SNc fire spontaneously in a highly regular pattern (i.e., tonic or basal firing). We first analyzed the basal firing pattern of SNc DA neurons in Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice using whole-cell patch clamp recordings. DA neurons were identified based on their morphology and confirmed by their characteristic <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> current. Furthermore, in some experiments we filled biocytin in the internal solution and performed TH (a marker for DA neurons) IF staining after recording to confirm DA neurons identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). This current was not different between WT and Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2AâD</xref>). In addition, membrane input resistance is similar in WT and Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice DA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results indicate that in the absence of AADC, the basic electrophysiological characteristics of DA neurons were identical between Ddc<sup>KI</sup> and WT mice. DA neurons from WT mice exhibited a regular firing pattern in the recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Some neurons in Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice exhibited regular firing, but other neurons exhibited a slow, irregular firing pattern. The ISI histogram revealed a wide distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). An analysis of the relationship between firing frequency and the CV revealed that the CV of slow firing neurons was larger than fast firing neurons, indicating that the slow firing was more irregular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Analysis of the correlations between CV and cell numbers in the Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice revealed two populations of neurons with different firing patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).

<title>Abnormalities in APs of SNc DA Neurons in Ddc<sup>KI</sup> Mice</title>
<p>We then analyzed the AP properties of basal firing using six parameters: amplitude, threshold, half width, rise slope, decay slope, and AHP amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). We first compared the regular APs from the WT mice with the regular APs from the Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice and found that the APs of regularly firing neurons in the Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice exhibited a smaller AHP than those in the WT mice (<italic>t</italic><sub>(17)</sub> = 3.893, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), and the gene therapy with AAVN-AADC corrected this abnormality (<italic>t</italic><sub>(20)</sub> = â3.277, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>).

The irregular firing of DA neurons in WT mice is very rare. Therefore, we chose regular firing DA neurons from WT mice to compare with Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice irregular firing DA neurons. A comparison of the regularly APs from the WT mice with the APs of the irregularly firing neurons from the Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice revealed that the APs of the irregularly firing neurons in Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice exhibited a faster rise (<italic>t</italic><sub>(19)</sub> = â3.706, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). We also compared DA neurons with regular and irregular firing from Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice. Our results showed that the irregular firing neurons form Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice have higher APs amplitude (<italic>t</italic><sub>(18)</sub> = â2.349, <italic>p</italic> = 0.030), rise slope (<italic>t</italic><sub>(18)</sub> = â3.774, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), decay slope (<italic>t</italic><sub>(18)</sub> = 3.008, <italic>p</italic> = 0.008) and AHP (<italic>t</italic><sub>(18)</sub> = â2.310, <italic>p</italic> = 0.033) than regular firing neurons.

<title>Abnormalities in the Electrical Activity of SNc DA Neurons in Ddc<sup>KI</sup> Mice</title>
<p>In the present study, the SNc DA neurons in Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice were divided into two groups based on basal firing patterns: regular and irregular/slow firing. The AHP amplitude of regular basal firing DA neurons was low. Additionally, the frequency of sEPSCs increased and that of sIPSCs decreased in the SNc DA neurons from the Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice, suggesting an elevation in glutamatergic excitatory stimuli and a reduction in GABAergic inhibitory stimuli, respectively. The administration of a widespread gene therapy to the brain corrected these electric abnormalities, confirming the specificity of these findings. These electric abnormalities in SNc DA neurons likely underlie the occurrence of motor disturbances in patients with an AADC deficiency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4-2">
<title>External Stimulation of SNc DA Neurons From Ddc<sup>KI</sup> Mice</title>
<p>SNc DA neurons are known to receive several hundred monosynaptic inputs from different brain regions (Watabe-Uchida et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2012</xref>). Although DA neurons lost their afferent activity in <italic>ex vivo</italic> brain slice. Previous studies revealed that occasionally single quantal release of glutamate or GABA could influence the interneuron regular firing in cerebellar slices (Carter and Regehr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2002</xref>). Furthermore, spontaneous glutamatergic or GABAergic neurotransmission has been shown to regulate DA neurons firing (Xiao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2009</xref>; Xie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2012</xref>). In the present study, we observed an increase in spontaneous glutamatergic neurotransmission for the SNc DA neurons from the Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice. Glutamatergic afferents to the SNc primarily arise from the subthalamic nucleus, prefrontal cortex, and pedunculopontine nucleus (Watabe-Uchida et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2012</xref>; Zakharov et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2016</xref>), and hyperactivation of the motor cortex was described in patients with PD and animal models of PD (Bezard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">1997</xref>; Yu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2007</xref>). Approximately 70% of the afferents to SNc DA neurons are GABAergic, and most of these afferents arise from the neostriatum, the external globus pallidus, and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). Tonic inhibitory signals from GABAergic afferents (primarily mediated through GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors) prevent burst firing (Paladini and Tepper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2017</xref>). Our data revealed a significant decrease in spontaneous GABAergic neurotransmission of the SNc DA neurons in Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice, likely because of a DA deficiency in the striatum. Dopamine D2-receptors on the cell bodies of SNc DA neurons primarily bind to Kir 3.2 (GIRK2)-containing channels, and the activation of GIRK channels leads to potassium efflux, which hyperpolarizes DA cells and impairs firing (Beckstead et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2004</xref>). D2-mediated inhibition must be lacking in the presence of a DA deficiency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4-3">
<title>Correlation Between the Low AHP and Slow, Irregular Basal Firing Pattern in Ddc<sup>KI</sup> Mice</title>
<p>We observed a low AHP in the APs of regular basal firing SNc DA neurons in the Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice, and gene therapy with AAVN-AADC reversed this abnormality. The opening of small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels following an AP emission generates AHP, which serves as a feedback mechanism to reduce the AP duration and defines a time-window that is refractory to the emission of a new AP (Faber et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2005</xref>). Glutamate stimuli decrease AHP by inactivating the SK channel and trigger burst firing from neurons (Park et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2010</xref>; Paladini and Tepper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2017</xref>). However, pharmacological inhibition of SK channels increases the variability of basal firing (Iyer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2017</xref>), and a mutation of the SK channel increases basal firing irregularity (Soden et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2013</xref>). In the current study, the mRNA expression level of Kcnn3 also decreased (<italic>p</italic> = 0.05).</p>
<p>Interestingly, a reduction in AHP and an increase in irregular firing were also observed in other animal models of DA deficiency, including the <italic>PINK-1</italic> and <italic>HrtA2/Omi</italic>-deficient mouse model of PD (Bishop et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2010</xref>) and TH-deficient mice (Paladini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2003</xref>). Therefore, an increase in glutamatergic excitatory stimulation and a decrease in GABAergic and D2 inhibitory stimuli likely cause over-inhibition of SK channels in the presence of a generalized dopamine deficiency, resulting in irregular firing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4-4">
<title>A Proposed Mechanism for Motor Disturbances</title>
<p>Tonic DA release in the striatum, which is driven by pacemaking basal firing, is required to maintain the DA levels necessary for motor activity (Goto et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2007</xref>). A hypothesis for cyclic motor disturbance in patient with AADC deficiency may be explained by low-irregular firing worsens the status of DA deficiency in the putamen in subjects with an AADC deficiency, which leads to the motor disturbances, such as severe dyskinesia and dystonia. In addition, an increase in burst firing caused by excessive glutamatergic stimulation may also contributes to dopamine depletion in the putamen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). In the present study, both abnormal firing pattern and the hyperactive glutamatergic signal of DA neuron in Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice are significantly decreased after gene therapy. One possible reason for the restoration may be associated with an increment in dopamine level in the brain. Furthermore, we have previously reported that gene therapy is effective and improves motor function in patient and mouse with AADC deficiency (Hwu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2012</xref>; Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2015</xref>). These results suggest that replenished dopamine level in the brain by gene therapy restored motor function and cellular homeostasis in AADC deficiency.</p>

<p>Proposed mechanism of motor disturbances. Excitation/inhibition imbalance, loss of autoinhibition, and SK channels downregulation disturbs cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in AADC deficiency SNc DA neurons (KI). Basal firing slows, the DA deficiency in the putamen worsens, and motor disturbances occur. Gene therapy treatment (KI-AAVN) reverses these electric abnormalities and relieves the symptoms of mice. However, the insufficient levels of serotonin may gradually, and repeatedly, influence the DA neurons and cause irregular firing patterns, which then lead to motor disturbance [rhythmic oculogyric crisis (OGC)].</p>

</fig>
<p>Interestingly, we have previously noted that a special movement disorder, OGC, showing limited improvement in patients treated with gene therapy. These patients displayed a significantly decrease in the severity of OGC episodes but did not change the recurrence of OGC (Hwu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2012</xref>). OGC episodes are composed of repeated movements of the eyes and mouth as well as an increase in dystonia and secretion, and each episode can last for a few hours and recur 3â4 days later (Brun et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2010</xref>). The etiology for OGC is not clear and proposed mechanisms for OGC include an imbalance between striatal DA and cholinergic tones, hypersensitivity of striatal dopamine receptors, neurodegeneration of striatal interneurons, dysfunction of striatal GABAergic interneurons, and maladaptive synaptic plasticity (Barow et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2017</xref>). In the current study, we found that decrement of Ddc significantly reduced GABAergic transmission onto SNc DA neurons. Although, we were unable to identify the sources of GABA afferent input to the SNc DA neuron from the brain slice available for our study. Injection of the GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist into the SNr to inhibit GABA neurons activity result in irrepressible saccadic eye movements in a monkey (Hikosaka and Wurtz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1985</xref>). Therefore, it seems plausible that the downregulation of GABAergic neuron activity in SNr may contribute to the severity of OGC but not frequency. Because the frequency of OGC in patients did not change significantly during the study (Hwu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2012</xref>), which we postulated the abnormal firing pattern, hyperactive glutamatergic transmission, and hypoactive GABAergic state should be improved. Other signaling pathways may contribute to the OGC rhythmic repetition. A possible explanation for this is that the insufficient serotonin levels in the brain. We found that despite the serotonin levels also increased in the Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice after gene therapy treatment, the levels were still lower (~50%) than those in the WT mice. Serotonin has been extensively studied in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus for its essential role in rhythmic neuronal activity regulation (Jiang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2000</xref>). In addition, serotonin also plays roles in the regulation of DA neuronal firing activity both in a tonic and phasic manner by cooperating with D2 receptors (Olijslagers et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2006</xref>). Therefore, the effect of insufficient serotonin levels may induce firing changes in DA neurons. This process seems more gradual; thus we were unable to obtain the changes in acute brain slices electrophysiological recording.</p>

<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>SNc DA neuron burst firing was not analyzed in the present study because burst firing can only be recorded <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice are very fragile, and we were not able to obtain a sufficient number of animals for <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. We are preparing an AADC-deficient mouse model that exhibits better survival, which may be suitable for <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in the future. In this Ddc<sup>KI</sup> mice model we used had been observed a phenomenon of compensatory elevation of brain dopamine and serotonin level at 8 weeks of age (Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2013</xref>). To avoid this, we choose mice age at 4 weeks for our study.</p>
