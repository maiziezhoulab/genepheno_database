<p>Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) chromatin remodelers regulate transcription and DNA repair. They govern cell-fate decisions during embryonic development and are often deregulated in human pathologies. <italic>Chd1-8</italic> show upon germline disruption pronounced, often developmental lethal phenotypes. Here we show that contrary to <italic>Chd1-8</italic> disruption, <italic>Chd9</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>animals are viable, fertile and display no developmental defects or disease predisposition. Germline deletion of <italic>Chd9</italic> only moderately affects gene expression in tissues and derived cells, whereas acute depletion in human cancer cells elicits more robust changes suggesting that CHD9 is a highly context-dependent chromatin regulator that, surprisingly, is dispensable for mouse development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Normal organismal development requires accurate transcriptional control. This is achieved by myriad of transcription factors and chromatin regulators that act in concert to control expression of the right genes at the right time. Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding enzymes belong to the superfamily of chromatin remodelers that control nucleosomal structure and phasing to regulate gene expression and DNA repair. They contain hallmark amino-terminal double chromodomains and central SNF2 helicase-like ATPase domains, allowing nucleosome recognition and remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref001">1</xref>]. Different accessory domains facilitate these actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref001">1</xref>]. The CHD enzymes have limited DNA-specificity and rely on specific histone modifications and transcription factors for recruitment to target loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref002">2</xref>]. Based on their constituent domains, they are classified into three subfamilies: subfamily I (CHD1 and CHD2), subfamily II (CHD3, CHD4 and CHD5) and subfamily III (CHD6, CHD7, CHD8 and CHD9).</p>
<p>In addition to the hallmark domains, members of the subfamily III contain SANT–like and tandem brahma kismet domains (BRK), implicated in DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref003">3</xref>] and CTCF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref004">4</xref>] binding, respectively. These enzymes are homologs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kismet (KIS-L), a <italic>Trithorax</italic> family protein that counteracts gene repression by <italic>Polycomb</italic> group proteins during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref005">5</xref>]. It regulates early stages of RNA Polymerase II elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref006">6</xref>] and is involved in key developmental signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref007">7</xref>]. Importantly, <italic>kismet</italic> loss-of-function causes specific segmentation defects and homeotic transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref008">8</xref>] resulting in lethality. Most of these functions have been conserved in the mammalian homologs.</p>
<p>Subfamily III members are found in both promoter and enhancer regions, regulating different stages of RNA Polymerase I and II transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref009">9</xref>]. Subfamily III members have limited DNA affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref010">10</xref>], and their recruitment to target loci is mediated through interaction with methylated histone tails [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref011">11</xref>] and transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref002">2</xref>]. Despite their high sequence similarity, these enzymes display different substrate specificities and remodeling activities <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>CHD enzymes appear to have non-redundant functions in murine embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref012">12</xref>]. <italic>Chd7</italic> knockout animals survive up to embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref013">13</xref>], whereas homozygous deletion of <italic>Chd8</italic> is embryonic lethal at E5.5–7.5 due to widespread p53-mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref014">14</xref>]. These enzymes act in a dose-dependent manner and mice heterozygous for <italic>Chd7</italic> or <italic>Chd8</italic> faithfully recapitulate features of human CHARGE syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref015">15</xref>] and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref016">16</xref>], respectively.</p>
<p>Subfamily III enzymes are often deregulated or mutated in human cancers. In aggressive breast cancers, <italic>CHD7</italic> amplification and overexpression correlates with poor prognosis. In contrast, heterozygous loss of <italic>CHD9</italic> is observed in 55% of breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref017">17</xref>]. Low expression is also associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref018">18</xref>]. In addition, a number of studies reported frequent mutations in human cancers: <italic>CHD6</italic> in bladder cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref019">19</xref>], <italic>CHD7</italic> in medulloblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref021">21</xref>], whereas <italic>CHD8</italic> harbors mutations in many cancer types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>CHD9 (also known as PRIC320 and CReMM) is the least characterized member of the subfamily. It was identified as transcriptional regulator in rat liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref023">23</xref>] and mesenchymal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref024">24</xref>]. Biochemical studies revealed CHD9 interaction with H3K4me2/3, H3K9me2/3 and H3K27me3 modified histones and illustrated its capacity to reposition nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>CHD9 associates with nuclear receptors and contributes to glucocorticoid receptor–mediated gene expression regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref025">25</xref>] and might be involved in loosening the chromatin structure in mouse oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref026">26</xref>]. Recent landmark study in mouse ES cells revealed that CHD9 chromatin occupancy correlates with gene expression levels and the presence of the H3K4me3 mark at a subset of loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>While these studies address biochemical and functional properties of CHD9, the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of CHD9 have remained unresolved. Here, we describe the first <italic>Chd9</italic> knockout mice and study its contribution to development and lymphomagenesis, a tumor subtype in which insertional mutagenesis experiments suggested a potential role of CHD9.</p>

<title>CHD9 is dispensable for murine development and knockout does not display overt phenotypic aberrations</title>
<p><italic>Chd9</italic> is ubiquitously expressed in murine tissues with the highest levels observed in brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref023">23</xref>]. Previous studies implicated CHD9 in stem cell biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref028">28</xref>], osteogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref029">29</xref>] and steroid-hormone signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref025">25</xref>], whereas insertional mutagenesis screens suggested an oncogenic driver role in murine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref031">31</xref>] and human lymphomagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref032">32</xref>]. To explore the contribution of CHD9 to development and tumorigenesis, we generated <italic>Chd9</italic> knockout mice.</p>
<p>The vast majority of <italic>Chd</italic> family knockouts are embryonic lethal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref034">34</xref>]. The reported allele targeting strategies for <italic>Chd1-8</italic> employed gene-trap reporter constructs, the deletion of critical exons or the removal of functional domains ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref012">12</xref>] and references therein). In the case of <italic>Chd9</italic> this was a particular challenge. <italic>Chd9</italic>, encoding a protein of 320 kD with a diversity of functional domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233394.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), contains several translation-initiation sites downstream from the first ATG codon, raising the possibility of translation of shorter, truncated protein isoforms that might exhibit dominant-active or dominant-negative functions. To circumvent this, we deleted all protein coding exons of the locus by flanking the <italic>Chd9</italic> open reading frame (ORF) with two <italic>loxP</italic> sites by homologous recombination in mouse ES cells (ESC)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233394.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233394.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

<title>CHD9 depletion has a moderate effect on gene expression during murine embryogenesis</title>
<p>Absence of overt phenotypes in <italic>Chd9</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice could be due to activation of compensatory transcriptional programs or functional redundancy with other CHD enzymes. Additionally, CHD9 might exert its functions during embryonic development rather than in adult tissues with a concomitant greater potential for compensatory mechanisms to kick in. In adult mice <italic>Chd9</italic> is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels in brain (our data and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref023">23</xref>]). During murine embryogenesis, we observed high <italic>Chd9</italic> mRNA levels at E13.5 and E15 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233394.s008">S8 Fig</xref>).

To explore the role of CHD9 in gene expression regulation during development, we performed gene expression analyses of knockout tissues (E15 liver and brain) and derived primary cells.</p>
<p>RNA–seq of <italic>Chd9</italic> knockout embryonic (E15) liver and brain revealed only a handful of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (adjusted p–value≤ 0.05, log<sub>2</sub>FC ≥ ±1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233394.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233394.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Chd9</italic> was the only downregulated mRNA in both tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233394.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233394.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Moreover, both liver and brain show concordant upregulation of an uncharacterized pseudogene <italic>Gm4322</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233394.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233394.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Despite high <italic>Chd9</italic> expression in the developing brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233394.s003">S3B Fig</xref>), only marginal upregulation of the <italic>Hoxa</italic> (a7), <italic>Hoxb</italic> (b6, b7, b9) and <italic>Hoxc</italic> (c5, c6) homeotic gene clusters was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233394.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of <italic>Chd9</italic> knockout brain revealed global downregulation of genes involved in complement and coagulation cascades (KEGG: hsa04610), recently emerging as important regulators of the developing brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref036">36</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233394.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). This might point to underlying transcriptional perturbations in embryonic brain in the absence of CHD9, albeit without overt phenotypic consequences. In the knockout embryonic liver, GSEA showed upregulation of genes involved in Peroxisome functioning (KEGG: hsa04146) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233394.s012">S12 Fig</xref>), in agreement with its previously identified role as peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) interactor in liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>RNA-seq analysis of knockout MEFs revealed only downregulation of <italic>Chd9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233394.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) and upregulation of the high mobility group protein B2 (<italic>Hmgb2</italic>) pseudogene <italic>Gm13237</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233394.s004">S4A Fig</xref>).

<p>Conversely, in derived <italic>Chd9</italic><sup>–/–</sup>ESCs maintained in serum–free 2i media with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), more profound gene expression changes were seen. In total, 63 upregulated and 212 downregulated genes were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233394.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233394.s004">S4B Fig</xref>).

<p>Flow cytometric analysis (FACS) of bone marrow (BM) of <italic>Chd9</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice showed a reduction in the lineage-negative (Lin<sup>-</sup>) adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell population (HSPCs), although this was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.055), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233394.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

Notably, <italic>Chd9</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>animals displayed a reduced frequency of the long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC, p–value = 0.06) and statistically significant expansion of short-term hematopoietic stem cell (ST-HSC, p–value = 0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233394.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Depletion of CHD9 might affect cell–intrinsic programs (transcriptional or metabolic) or interaction with local stem cell niches, impeding self–renewal of LT-HSCs. In turn, this may lead to a compensatory increase of the ST-HSCs compartment, thereby maintaining hematopoietic homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref040">40</xref>]. However, there was no significant effect on frequency and number of bone marrow multipotent progenitors (MPPs), common lymphoid (CLP) and common myeloid progenitors (CMP), and their more differentiated progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233394.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

Contrary to observations in <italic>Chd9</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mouse models, RNA-seq analysis in these cell lines revealed profound gene expression changes 48 hours upon CHD9 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233394.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233394.s011">S11 Fig</xref>).

We have only observed modest expansion of ST-HSC in bone marrow, however, without discernible effect on other progenitors and mature populations. Moreover, although several murine and human studies suggested a role for <italic>Chd9</italic> in solid tumors and lymphomas, CHD9 depletion did neither accelerate nor impair <italic>EμMyc</italic>-driven lymphomagenesis. Likewise, CHD9 is not required for proliferation or oncogenic transformation of primary MEFs. Nevertheless, a complex protein of 320 kD with multiple functional domains and highly conserved in evolution should have an important role. The lack of phenotype we noted is especially remarkable given the pronounced phenotype of nearly all other CHD proteins. However, if the role of CHD9 has evolved during evolution for specific neuronal functions, that are not required or do not become apparent in the routine monitoring taking place in dedicated mouse facilities, it might be not too surprising that our analyses did not reveal such functions. Future detailed studies will be required to elucidate this.</p>

<title>Animal study design and ethics statement</title>
<p>The study was performed in accordance with the Dutch and European regulations on care and protection of laboratory animals. All animal experiments were approved by the local Animal Ethics Committee—Dierexperimentencommissie (DEC) of The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI)- (OZP ID: 05029). All animal strains used in this study were generated or obtained through The Netherlands Cancer Institute Animal Facility. The number of animals required for each of the analyses performed in this paper are indicated either in the main text, figure panels or figure legends. The comparison of survival curves between experimental animal cohorts is done using log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test using GraphPad Prism8. For all calculations of p-values, significance threshold alpha was set at 5% (p&lt; 0.05).</p>
<p>Since no previous knowledge on CHD9 role in murine development/lifespan is available, duration of the experiment was set for the maximum period of three years as to be able to show an effect on longevity in case this would be influenced by CHD9. Previous studies show that <italic>EμMyc</italic> mice succumb to lymphomas at average of 5 months. <italic>EμMyc;Chd9</italic> mice were monitored for the maximum period of two years, as it was not known whether <italic>Chd9</italic> loss would accelerate or decelerate tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Animals were kept in standard husbandry conditions (open-cages, standard condition of bedding and enrichment, feeding, light, and temperature, with free access to food and water). Animals were monitored daily by trained animal technicians at the NKI Animal Facility. Any symptoms of disease or poor health (weight loss, abnormal sedentary behaviour, difficulty breathing, uncoordinated or impaired movement) were considered grounds for euthanasia. Moribund animals were promptly euthanised with CO<sub>2</sub>, confirmed by lack of response to firm toe pinch, and necropsy was performed to identify macroscopic changes and, when deemed needed, tissue samples were processed for immunohistopathology to document microscopic abnormalities. No animals died prior to meeting the criteria for euthanasia. No anaesthesia, analgesia or special techniques were required or applied during the experiments.</p>

<title>Generation of the Chd9 conditional knockout mouse strain</title>
<p>The endogenous <italic>Chd9</italic> locus on chromosome 8 was flanked by <italic>loxP</italic> sites on both sites of the gene in order to excise the whole coding potential of the locus upon <italic>Cre</italic>-mediated recombination. The 5’ <italic>loxP</italic> site was introduced upstream of the exon 3 (containing ATG translation initiation site), whereas at the 3’ end a second <italic>loxP</italic> site was introduced downstream of the exon 38. Targeting was performed in E14 ES IB10 cells of 129P2 genotype using the recombineering-based method for generating conditional knockout mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233394.ref045">45</xref>]. Since ES cells were targeted at two sites 117 kb apart, the original method had to be adapted for two-step targeting strategy.</p>

<title>Generation of the <italic>Chd9</italic> knockout allele by sequential targeting and Cre-mediated deletion.</title>
<p>(A) Representation of the targeting strategy whereby recombineering–generated cassettes with loxP sites were introduced sequentially by homologous recombination at the 5’ and 3’ region of the <italic>Chd9</italic> allele. <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase excision removed 5’ NEO cassette to allow subsequent 3’ targeting with FRT–loxP-NEO cassette, and Flp–mediated removal in-vivo. Heterozygous mice were generated by breading with universal β-actin <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase strain, resulting in the excision of the intervening 117kb genomic DNA and removal of the coding potential of the locus (exon 3—exon 39). Southern blot hybridization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233394.g001">Fig 1</xref>. detects DNA fragment of 6.7kb in the wild-type, and 7.4kb in <italic>Chd9</italic>–null allele following Cre–mediated deletion. loxP sites (red triangle), FRT sites (blue triangle), Neomycin selection cassette (grey rectangle labelled <italic>Neo</italic>), <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase (Cre), <italic>Flp</italic> recombinase (Flp).

(Right) Volcano plots represent significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two shRNA hairpins targeting CHD9 and control hairpin targeting Luciferase. The DEGs with FDR &lt; 0.05 and log2 (fold change) &gt; ±1 are shown, 20 most significant genes are highlighted (down-blue, up-red); CHD9 gene is highlighted in orange. The DEGs are enumerated at the top of each plot. (Bellow) Proliferation curve representing relative growth of knockdown (shRNA#1 and shRNA#2 hairpins against CHD9) and control (Luciferase hairpin) cells. Cells were treated with 1μg/ml doxycycline (DOX) two days before seeding for proliferation assay. Doxycycline was kept throughout duration of the experiment. In case of K562, cell number was measured on cell counter, whereas for SNB19 glioblastoma relative cell growth was determined by crystal-violet assay. Data represented as average ± standard error mean (SEM), p-value was calculated using two-way ANOVA (for K562 cells p-value = 0.0902, for SNB19 cells p-value = 0.1977, ns = not significant).
