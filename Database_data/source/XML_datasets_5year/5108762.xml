<abstract>
<p>Balance orientation depends on the precise operation of the vestibular end organs and the vestibular ganglion neurons. Previous research on the assemblage of the neuronal network in the developing fetal vestibular organ has been limited to data from animal models. Insights into the molecular expression profiles and signaling moieties involved in embryological development of the human fetal inner ear have been limited. We present an investigation of the cells of the vestibular end organs with specific focus on the hair cell differentiation and innervation pattern using an uninterrupted series of unique specimens from gestational weeks 8–12. Nerve fibers positive for peripherin innervate the entire fetal crista and utricle. While in rodents only the peripheral regions of the cristae and the extra-striolar region of the statolithic organs are stained. At week 9, transcription factors PAX2 and PAX8 were observed in the hair cells whereas PAX6 was observed for the first time among the supporting cells of the cristae and the satellite glial cells of the vestibular ganglia. Glutamine synthetase, a regulator of the neurotransmitter glutamate, is strongly expressed among satellite glia cells, transitional zones of the utricle and supporting cells in the sensory epithelium. At gestational week 11, electron microscopic examination reveals bouton contacts at hair cells and first signs of the formation of a protocalyx at type I hair cells. Our study provides first-hand insight into the fetal development of the vestibular end organs as well as their pattern of innervation by means of immunohistochemical and EM techniques, with the aim of contributing toward our understanding of balance development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The human inner ear consists of both the vestibular and cochlear parts that form organs for balance and hearing. They start to develop during embryogenesis from the primordial surface ectoderm into the membranous labyrinth during the third gestational week (O'Rahilly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1963</xref>). This surface ectoderm differentiates into the otic placode, otic primordium, and finally the otic vesicle. The otic vesicle finally separates into the primordium of the endolymphatic duct system, which consists of the vestibular portion, the cochlea, and the endolymphatic sac (Arnold and Lang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2001</xref>). The membranous labyrinth in the inner ear contains a secluded epithelial layer that is diversified into specific regions containing sensory elements of the hair cells and supporting cells, and transmits information to local neurons ensheathed by Schwann cells and satellite glia. All the cells of the inner ear are derived from the otic placode with the exception of the Schwann cells (Alsina et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2009</xref>), satellite glia, strial intermediate cells (neural crest), and potential cells belonging to the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). The embryogenic developmental studies of the human inner ear, especially the vestibular organ, are hindered by the lack of insight regarding the developmental consequences (neural tube signals/cell fate determination) of the activation and inactivation of specific genes which have been linked to development of the inner ear in murine embryogenic models. Also, there is a lack of comparative studies regarding the activation of these specific marker genes and their influence during the development of the vestibular organ and the cochlea. Here, we used different molecular markers to characterize sensorineural progression from gestational week 8–12 in human embryogenesis.</p>
<sec>
<title>Innervation-peripherin and class III β-tubulin</title>
<p>Peripherin is a type III neuronal intermediate filament protein found to selectively stain for the type II SGNs of the adult human cochlea (Liu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2010</xref>; Barclay et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2011</xref>). It has also been found in the sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and is widely expressed during rat embryogenesis (Escurat et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">1990</xref>). Studies carried out on mice embryonic models have shown the presence of peripherin in the ninth day embryonic of development, and the pattern of staining indicates that peripherin staining occurs similarly during embryogenesis in adult tissues (Troy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">1990</xref>). Parallel studies carried out on rat embryonic models also demonstrated positive staining for peripherin at the eleventh day of embryonic development (Gorham et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Class III β-tubulin is a microtubule element connected to neuronal differentiation in the Central Nervous System (CNS; Katsetos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2003</xref>) and presents mostly in neurons of the mature and regenerating hair cells of the inner ear in avian (Molea et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">1999</xref>) and mammalian species. Similar analysis performed on human tissue has also shown the expression of the class III β-tubulin across the spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) in the fetal (Pechriggl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2015</xref>) and adult cochlea (Barclay et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2011</xref>). It has also been revealed that the β III tubulin isotype is found not only in the soma, axon and the bouton type terminal dendrite compartments, but also in the big calyceal nerve endings (Perry et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2003</xref>). Staining intensity for this microtubule element was found to increase from week 8–12 of embryonic development in the human fetal cochlea (Pechriggl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2015</xref>) and may be necessary to establish axonal function.</p>

<title>Neurotransmission associated proteins-synaptophysin and glutamine synthetase</title>
<p>Synaptophysin is a synaptic vesicle glycoprotein distributed across the peripheral vestibular afferent neurons in the developing mouse embryo (Scarfone et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">1991</xref>) as well in the vestibular nerve calyx that ensheathes the type I inner sensory hair cells of the vestibular epithelium (Scarfone et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">1988</xref>). It is the most abundant integral membrane protein of small presynaptic vesicles in the human cochlea (Khalifa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2003</xref>). Other studies performed during late postnatal development in mice have also shown that synaptophysin staining occurs in the nerve terminals of efferent neurons in the vestibular end organs (Dechesne et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1997</xref>). Synaptophysin expression indicates the initiation of the excitation process in the nerve fibers of the developing chick inner ear (Sokolowski and Cunningham, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">1996</xref>). Expression of the same has also been linked to the release of neurotransmitters (Sokolowski and Cunningham, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">1999</xref>). Studies performed on rat embryo models have shown that synaptophysin is restricted to efferent neurons and is down-regulated in these neurons indicating that synaptogenesis of efferent fibers is complete (Knipper et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Glutamate is the neurotransmitter in the hair cells of the inner ear (Nordang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2000</xref>), hair cells that are not surrounded by glial cells like they are in the CNS (Puel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">1995</xref>). Acoustic overstimulation in glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST)-deficient mice was found to cause an accumulation of glutamate in the perilymph leading to a deterioration of hearing loss, lending credence to the premise that glutamate is indeed the neurotransmitter for hair cells (Hakuba et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2000</xref>). Degradation of synaptically released glutamate is thus important for normal function. GLAST and glutamine synthetase that metabolizes glutamate to glutamine, respectively, may operate in concert to terminate the neurotransmitter action of glutamate (Miller et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2002</xref>). In adults, glutamine synthetase is located in the satellite glia cells surrounding many ganglion neurons (Hanani et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2005</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis of human fetal cochlear specimens has shown that the expression of glutamine synthetase-positive peripheral glial cells starts as early as the eighth week of gestation (Pechriggl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Non-sensory cells—S100 proteins are normally present in cells derived from the neural crest in the inner ear Schwann cells, chondrocytes, melanocytes, and intermediate cells of the stria vascularis. During development, a variety of other cells including ganglia and hair cells (Buckiova and Syka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2009</xref>) express S100 isotypes that do not overlap in expression with other calcium binding proteins. Studies performed on embryonic mice models have shown the expression of the calcium binding protein S100, which can locally regulate neuronal plasticity (Kiryushko et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2006</xref>) in the inner ear beginning on embryonic day 14 onwards, in both the vestibular and cochlear epithelial cells. This pattern of staining then progresses into the end organs of the vestibulum by embryonic day 17.</p>

<title>Cellular patterning-MAF B and the PAX gene family</title>
<p>The downregulation of the transcription factor Maf B (V-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog B), which is encoded by the MAF B gene in humans, has been found to affect the kr/Maf B-hindbrain pathway progression in fetal murine models, which in turn leads to a downregulation of the otic genes involved in normal inner ear cell patterning like the Gbx2, Dlx5, Wnt2b, and Otx2. This deviation in the expression pattern in the dorsal region of the developing otocyst leads to the loss of dorsal otic structures such as the endolymphatic duct and the sac (Choo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>). Studies performed on a MAF B KO model have also confirmed the abnormal inner ear development (Terrell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">2006</xref>). Immunohistochemical analyses of human fetal cochlear specimens have shown that the expression of this transcription factor is seen as early as the eighth week of gestation and helps to distinguish cochlear neurons from other cells in the spiral ganglion (Pechriggl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Pax2 is a protein which encodes a transcription factor necessary for the development of the cochlea in mice as well in humans. Moreover, inactivation of Pax2 has been found to cause varying degrees of vestibular defects as well as an associated loss of sensory neurons. Studies performed using Pax2;8 double null mice has shown that there is incomplete neuronal as well as neurosensory development in the inner ear and that Pax2 expression compensates for Pax8 in a Pax8 null mouse model (Bouchard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2010</xref>). Pax2 expression has been found at varying intensities in some vestibular regions in a developing chicken inner ear model (Sánchez-Calderon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2002</xref>), while loss of function experiments using the same model have shown the necessity of Pax2 for the development of the cochlear duct as well as its presence in the sensory and non-sensory structures in the inner ear (Sánchez-Calderón et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2005</xref>). Knockout as well as frameshift mutant Pax2 murine models revealed agenesis or severe deformity of the cochlea. Pax2 mutations have been found to cause mild sensorineural deafness in humans (Schimmenti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">1997</xref>). Other studies performed using embryonic chick models have also suggested a coordinating but independent role for Pax2 in epithelial morphogenesis and cell fate determination during inner ear development (Christophorou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2010</xref>). However, in studies performed using a Pax2 null mice model, the vestibular sensory cells of the inner ear were found to develop normally and establish their innervation with their associated vestibular ganglion (Torres et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">1996</xref>). We found Pax2 expression previously in the fetal human cochlea in the SGNs as well as in the inner hair cells (IHCs) indicating its role in the early maturation of the IHCs in comparison to the outer hair cells (OHC; Pechriggl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The Pax6 gene encodes the transcriptional factor, Paired Box Protein Pax-6 which is involved in sense organ patterning and forebrain development (Georgala et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2011</xref>) with its expression <italic>not being previously described in the fetal human inner ear</italic>.</p>
<p>Research performed using embryonic Xenopus models have identified Pax8 as the most primitive indicator of the development of the otic placode and of the intermediate mesoderm. Moreover, it has also been suggested that Pax8 plays a central role in the auditory development in the same model (Heller and Brändli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">1999</xref>). Additionally, findings from Zebrafish models have indicated that Pax8 is also the earliest developmental marker for the otic placode and that inactivation of Pax2 causes the development of the otic region to halt, thereby indicating that Pax8 expression is very much dependent on the expression of Pax2 (Pfeffer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">1998</xref>). Though, Pax8 expression has been connected to the induction of the otic placode and its further development, null Pax8 mice models have been found to have a normally developed inner ear (Mansouri et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">1998</xref>). Normal development of the inner ear, even in the absence of Pax8, has been suggested to be due to the redundant function either of an unrelated gene or of another member of the Pax gene family (Chatterjee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2010</xref>). From studies carried out on null mice models of both Pax2 and Pax8, this redundant functionality was later identified to be due to the ability of Pax2 to overcome the non-functionality of the Pax8 (Bouchard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2010</xref>). Moreover, 3D stem cell models of ear sensory epithelia have shown the upregulation of both Pax2 and Pax8 during development of the otic placode (Koehler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Proliferation—Ki-67 is a nuclear protein involved in ribosomal RNA transcription and is involved in cellular proliferation. Ki-67 is evenly distributed throughout the otocyst development and decreases as the embryonic development progresses, becoming spatially restricted within the membranous labyrinth epithelium (Tafra et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">2014</xref>). Embryonic human tissue of equal gestational stages has revealed staining for Ki-67 in the spiral ganglion region as well as in the epithelium of the cochlear duct in the developing cochlea (Pechriggl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Programmed cell death or apoptosis occurs widely during development. Caspases actively regulate animal development through both apoptosis and non-apoptotic functions that involve cell–cell communication in developing cell communities (Miura, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2011</xref>). The absence of the downstream apoptotic enzyme Caspase-3 has been found to induce hearing loss as well as vestibular dysfunction in a Caspase-3 deficient mouse model (Makishima et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2011</xref>). In our previous study on the human fetal cochlea, we did not find any clue for an involvement of this enzyme during development (Pechriggl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2015</xref>).</p>
<p>We hypothesize that humans and rodents display different patterns of inner ear development characterized by differing patterns of gene expression. The goal of this study is to present novel insights into the developmental changes occurring in the human fetal vestibular sensory organs orchestrated by various neuronal markers (beta III tubulin, peripherin, synaptophysin, and MAF B), non-sensory (S100), neurotransmitter related enzymes (glutamine synthetase), transcriptional factors (Pax2, Pax6, and Pax8), and markers for proliferation and apoptosis (Ki-67 and cleaved Caspase 3) which are of particular interest for cell fate and proliferation. Previous studies have engaged murine models where the onset of hearing is delayed to several days after birth (Kraus and Aulbach-Kraus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">1981</xref>) unlike in humans, making it difficult to draw inferences from animal developmental models and thus pertinent to mapping the expression patterns of these markers in the fetal inner ear. Moreover, we have used a combinatorial approach involving both immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy to identify and track the developmental changes occurring in the fetal human inner ear.</p>

<title>Embryonic, fetal specimens</title>
<p>Twenty four human embryos (4/W8; 4/W9; 4/W10; 6/W11; 6/W12) aged between 8 and 12 weeks after conception corresponding to the anatomical age were obtained from lawful abortions which were performed in concordance with Austrian legislation (§ 97 StGB) and with prior parental approval. These are the only developmental stages during which it is legal to acquire an embryo. These specimens exhibited no macroscopic malformations and their embryological ages were differentiated by quantification of the crown-rump length, external and internal morphology, and the estimated gynecological age. This research was approved by the ethics commission of the University Clinic for Gynaecology and Obstetrics at the Medical University of Innsbruck, ethical approval no. AN2014-0095 335/4.11.</p>

<title>Tissue preparation for histology and immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections</title>
<p>Temporal bone specimens were excised and then promptly fixed by steeping in ice cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M) at a pH of 7.4 and left overnight. Subsequently, the specimens were rinsed in PBS and were then prepared by dehydrating and later embedded in paraffin using a histological infiltration processor (Miles Scientific Inc., Naperville, IL, USA). Sequential sections of 4 μm thickness were made on a HM 355S microtome (Microm, Walldorf, Germany) and affixed on SuperFrost® Plus slides (Menzel, Braunschweig, Germany). The affixed specimens were dried overnight at room temperature. Afterwards, the section-containing slides were incubated at 60°C for 2 h to adhere the sectioned specimens firmly onto them. Every tenth specimen of each complete series was stained with haematoxylin/eosin (HE) (Shandon Varistain 24-4, Histocom Vienna, Austria).</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Immunohistochemistry was rendered with a Ventana Roche® Discovery XT Immunostainer (Mannheim, Germany), using a DAB-MAP discovery research standard procedure. When necessary, antigen retrieval was commenced by unmasking the epitope using a heat induction method while the sections were immersed in EDTA buffer (Cell Conditioning Solution CC1, Ventana 950–124).</p>
<p>The mounted sections were incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies at 37°C for 1 h. Following this the specimens were incubated with Discovery Universal Secondary Antibody, Ventana 760–4250 at room temperature for 30 min. Antibody detection was attained with the DAB-MAP Detection Kit (Ventana 760–124) using a combinatorial approach involving the diaminobenzidine development method with copper enhancement followed by light counter staining with haematoxylin (Ventana 760–2021) for 4 min. The stained sections were then manually dehydrated using an upgraded alcohol series, clarified with xylene and then mounted permanently with Entellan® (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).</p>
<p>The entire immunohistochemical staining reaction was benchmarked against appositive controls (e.g., small intestine, brain, and pancreas) that were supplemented to each experiment. Auxiliary negative controls were acquired by alternating the primary antibodies with reaction buffer or substituting them with isotype matching immunoglobulins. These ancillary controls never yielded any immunostaining.</p>

<title>Tissue preparation for light (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis</title>
<p>Two fetal inner ear specimens (2/W11) were detached and divided mid-modularly and were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde buffered in sodium cacodylate (0.1 M, pH = 7.4) over night at 4°C. Since the development of the principal fluid spaces in the fetal inner ear was not yet complete, this partitioning of the cochleae allowed for excellent fixation quality for ultrastructure analysis. Subsequently they were rinsed in sodium cacodylate buffer and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in distilled water for 3–4 h at 4°C. Again, samples were rinsed, dehydrated in graded ethanol series and embedded in EPON resin.</p>
<p>Ultrathin sections (90 nm) were cut on a Reichert Ultracut S microtome (Leica Microsystem, Wetzlar, Germany) with an ultra-diamond knife, mounted on dioxan-formvar coated slot-grids (#G2500C, Christine Gröpl, Elektronenmikroskopie, Tulln, Austria) and stained 35 min with 0.5% (w/v) uranyl acetate, pH 4.4 and 10 min with 3% (w/v) lead citrate, pH 12 (Leica Ultrostainer, Leica Microsystem, Wetzlar, Germany). The ultrathin sections were examined with a Philips CM 120 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV (FEI, Eindhoven, Netherlands) equipped with a MORADA digital camera (Olympus SIS, Münster, Germany).</p>

<title>Sensory innervation and cell proliferation at W8 and W9</title>
<p>At W8 all sensory organs were clearly identified and contained hair cells as well as neighboring supporting cells. Semi-circular canals had already formed with the vestibular neurons sending out axons toward the peripheral as well as central processes.</p>
<p>The vestibular end organs exhibited intense staining for the type-III neuronal intermediate filament <bold>peripherin</bold> in the nerve fibers innervating them. These fibers appeared between supporting cells and basal portion of hair cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Peripheral as well as central processes of Scarpa ganglia display high intensity of peripherin signal. Only few neurons showed staining in their somata. Different staining intensities may be related to unequal development within the neuronal population (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Peripherin previously identified as a marker for type II spiral ganglion cells in adults constituted only 5–10% of the total ganglion cell population (Spoendlin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">1985</xref>). A similar characterization was not reported for vestibular ganglion cells.</p>

</fig>
<p>Staining for β-<bold>III tubulin</bold> was confined to the nerve fibers projecting into the sensory epithelia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Expression for this marker was present in the nerve fibers which traversed the mesenchyme and projected into the sensory epithelium of both ampullary as well as the otolithic organs—the utricle and the saccule at W8. Peripheral as well as central processes revealed staining but were less pronounced than peripherin (compare Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,C</xref>). Scarpa perikarya were only faintly stained or void of any immunoreactivity.</p>
<p>Expression was also seen for the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein—<bold>synaptophysin</bold>—which was found in the axons and vestibular hair cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) as well as within the cytoplasm of all the neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Expression for this protein was observed among the axons of the nerve fibers lying underneath and projected toward the vestibular sensory hair cells lining the utricule (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Axoplasmic distribution was clearly observed; however, this staining was not evenly distributed and was enriched in the nerve terminals underneath the hair cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, arrows). The entire cytoplasm of hair cells was intensely stained and augmented at the cuticular plates, while stereocilia and cilia were void of any immunoreactivity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Staining patterns parallel to that of the utricule were apparent in the ampullary crests and the saccule. Synaptophysin expression was also widespread in the Scarpa ganglion neurons and seemed to be concentrated closer to the bigger central axons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Though stained nerve fibers where visible in the spiral ganglion of the cochlea, no penetration into the sensory epithelium was observed till week 12 of gestation in the cochlea (Pechriggl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2015</xref>), reflecting the advanced development of the vestibular system.</p>
<p>The low molecular weight protein <bold>S100</bold> was widely distributed at W8 and stained the cytoplasm of most chondrocytes of the otic capsule as well as the mesenchymal tissue to a much lesser extent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). The most prominent immunoreactivity appeared along the nerve fibers lying within the stroma and projected toward the sensory epithelia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). The Scarpa ganglion perikarya were not stained by this antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>), but many cells surrounding the ganglion were. Satellite glia cells that formed a thin sheet around some neurons showed reactivity. Putative, non-myelinating Schwann cells appeared stained (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>), and expression for S100 was very similar in the cochlea (Pechriggl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The embryonic vestibular organs (VO) at W8 also exhibited staining for the nuclear protein <bold>Ki-67</bold>. Staining for this antibody was found among the cells of the planum semilunatum layer (PSL), dark cells as well as the transitional cells adjacent to the cristae (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). This indicated that growth of the endolymphatic compartment was mostly contributed to by proliferation of these cells and by patches of the simple cuboidal epithelial lining of the membranous labyrinth. Staining was also seen in the mesenchymal cells lying underneath the cristae as well as in the chondrocytes that reflected the proliferation needed for the growth of the otic capsule.</p>

<title>Glutamine synthetase and transcriptional regulator MAF-B</title>
<p>Expression for the enzyme glutamine synthetase necessary for “detoxification” and recycling of the neurotransmitter glutamate was strongly expressed among the transitional zones of the utricle and supporting cells in the sensory epithelium (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>). Within the ganglion, satellite glia cells appeared stained (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), parallel to the adult situation in the spiral ganglion (Pechriggl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2015</xref>). Interestingly, at week 10, the putative, non-myelinating Schwann cells showed distinct immunoreactivity underneath the ampullary organs. Here again, transitional zones as well as supporting cells were positive while the hair cells were negative (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). In the vestibular ganglion, satellite glia cells were strongly stained at week 12 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>).</p>

Positive fibers reached the basal portion of the sensory hair cells in ampullary sensory patches (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) as well as in the otolith sensory epithelium. In contrast, in the cochlea, only few stained fibers were to be found within the prosensory domain (Pechriggl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2015</xref>), reflecting the advanced developmental time line of the vestibular system as compared to the auditory.</p>

<p>Intense immunolabelling was also observed for <bold>Beta III tubulin</bold> in the nerve fibers protruding and innervating the developing crista ampullaris (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) as well as other vestibular sensory hair cells at W10. The utricle at this stage exhibited intense staining for this neuronal filament with the nerve fiber bundles stained and traversing through the mesenchyme and projecting into the sensory epithelia. Single, faintly stained apical portions of vestibular sensory hair cells were also visible at this stage with some putative nerve fibers overshooting the basal portion of hair cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, arrows). We had previously observed a similar overshoot in the developing auditory system (Pechriggl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Staining for the <bold>S100</bold> proteins weakened in the cytoplasm of chondrocytes but increased dramatically in the cells at the border between the cartilage and mesenchymal tissue, a site where the periosteum developed into the lining of the otic capsule (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Strong immunoreactivity was present along the nerve fibers lying within the stroma and projected toward the sensory epithelia, as in week 8 of gestation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). All epithelial cells of the membranous labyrinth were void of immunoreactivity. A similar pattern was apparent in the adjacent cochlea (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Specific staining for S100 was also observed in the glia cells of Scarpa's ganglion as in prior stages (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Synaptophysin</bold> expression also intensified at W11 in the utricle with intensely stained nerve fibers which projected into the developing macular organ. Expression intensified dramatically in the hair cells of the cristae and otolith sensory cells. This paralleled the slight extension of peripherin stained fibers which entered the base of the hair cells in the sensory epithelia of the cristae. The expression pattern of synaptophysin in the cochlea was marked by increased intensity of staining, with the positive fibers only reaching the epithelia of the middle turn (Pechriggl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2015</xref>). In contrast, the synaptophysin staining in the vestibular end organs during W10 was marked by the complete staining of the nerve fibers as well as staining for the vestibular hair cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Expression for the proliferation marker <bold>Ki-67</bold> was apparent at W11 with patchy staining in the otic epithelium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). Hair cells with distinct cilia bundles lined the sensory epithelia and exhibited immunoreactivity for this marker. These cells were likely terminally differentiated and must have completed their proliferation process. Many cells of the basal sensory epithelia were positive and possibly contained prosensory cells capable of proliferation and differentiation toward both cell types (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). In the mesenchyme as well as the otic capsule, there was a more even distribution of positive cells without hot spots of cellular division.</p>

<title>Sensory innervation and cell proliferation at W12</title>
<p>Expression for the neuronal marker <bold>Beta III tubulin</bold> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) displayed the progression of innervation in the vestibular end organs compared to the cochlea. Nerve fibers reached both the ampullar as well as the macular organs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, inset) with intensely immunoreactive nerve fibers which sprouted onto the sensory epithelia of five end organs. Beta III tubulin better depicted the nerve fiber network underneath the hair cells, and some hair cells interestingly exhibited immunoreactivity in their cytoplasm, while some nerve fibers overshot into the endolymphatic compartment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, inset arrow). The vestibular ganglia were also intensely stained by this marker. The immunoreactivity was also visible in the spiral ganglion of the cochlea at this stage with the stained fibers extending all the way from the base to the apex within the future OC.</p>

<p>Specific staining for the Pax2 antibody was observed in the nuclei and the cytoplasm of the developing hair cells and the dark cells of the ampullary organs at W9, while transitional zones were not reactive (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Less intense staining was apparent among the nerve fibers which innervated the cristae. A similar cytoplasmic staining pattern was visible in the saccule with strong staining among the hair cells as well as in the cells which line the otic epithelia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Additional intense and specific staining for this antibody was observed in the Scarpa neurons during the same stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>), and negative nuclei within the ganglion were likely comprised of immature satellite glia or Schwann cells.

<p>Immunoreactivity for Pax2 was also prominent among the cell nuclei of the hair cells of the ampullae (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>) at W12. Only cells of the transitional and dark cell zone which faced the utricular aspect were positive, while the transitional cells (TC) and DC that merged into the canal side were negative. Keeping in mind that this transcription factor was expressed in the hair cells, the Lesser Epithelial Ridge (LER), and stria marginal cells together with cells of Reissner's membrane of the cochlea, we observed the corresponding expression in the utricular TC and DC zone and hair cells. The cell nuclei of the cuboidal epithelial cells of the membranous labyrinth were negative for Pax2. Pax2 staining was not restricted to nuclear expression; we found some less intense staining in the afferent nerve fibers innervating the end organs, and decent staining in the cytoplasm of the cuboidal epithelial cells separating the endolymph from perilymph.</p>
<p>Staining for the Pax8 was first apparent in the nuclei of the future hair cells of the otic epithelia of the ampulla at W8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>) as well as in the developing cochlea where the future cells of the stria vascularis were stained (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, inset). We added the information of the cochlea here because there were no previous reports about this protein in humans. The LER exhibited staining, while the Greater Epithelial Ridge (GER) and part of the future Organ of Corti (where the hair cells are not differentiated at this stage) were void of staining at W8. Around W12, expression was restricted to the nuclei of the hair cells in the utricle and adjacent cuboidal epithelium, while these cells were void of immunoreactivity toward the anterior ampulla. In the ampullar organs, we found expression of this protein only in the cell nuclei hair cells and dark cells. No staining was found in the PSL cells or epithelia of the developing ampulla. In W12, Pax8 expression was confined to the hair cells of the ampullar and macular organs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>) with the supporting cells remaining unstained in these end organs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). The simple cuboidal epithelia in between these end organs were also positive for this marker, while the TCs in between were negative. In the cochlea, three rows of OHC and one row of IHCs were positive at this stage, while the cells of the marginal cells of the stria vascularis were also positive for this marker (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>, inset). Immunopositive hair cells, dark cells, and marginal stria cells reflected corresponding structures in all sensory organs of the inner ear.</p>
<p>Staining for the nuclear marker Pax6 first showed up in the membranous labyrinth at W9. In the macular organs, otic epithelial cells as well as mesenchymal cells exhibited immunoreactivity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>). Differentiated hair cells at this stage showed apical cilia and were already differentiated as indicated by their dearth in reactivity. Likewise, vestibular neurons were devoid of staining in contrast to the glia cells and surrounding mensenchyme (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I</xref>). This staining pattern disappeared by W12 of gestation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5J</xref>), when satellite glia cells changed to their final shape with a smaller and denser nucleus. None of the cells in the ganglion exhibited staining.</p>
<p>Absence of immunoreactivity for the apoptosis marker Caspase 3 was observed in all the vestibular end organs and in adjacent nerves between the gestational weeks 8 and 12 (data not shown). Summary of expression timeline of selected markers in the development of the human inner ear between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation is shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>.</p>

<title>Electron microscope images W12</title>
<p>Transmission electron microscopy of specimens from the W12 showed clearly visible stereocilia (ST), with the kinocila not yet discernible at this stage. The terminal web composed of actin filaments called cuticular plates in hair cells was only weakly formed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). It underlies and anchors the stereocilia and appeared darkly stained. Hair cells possessed a less electron-dense cytoplasm with big nuclei rich in heterochromatin. Type I and II hair cells were not yet distinguishable from each other at this stage. The calyx synapses were not yet formed (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A,B</xref>), but numerous bouton contacts on the hair cells had attached to the hair cell somata (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, colored green). We could not observe any synaptic ribbons indicating the immature state of synaptic contacts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Nonetheless, some indications for proto-calyx formation were visible (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, colored blue; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Differently sized otoconia filled the space apical to the hair bundles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The higher magnified view of the protocalyx (pcal) in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> revealed synaptic contacts (s) with vesicles at the presynaptic membrane and punctum adherens contacts (p) already formed between the protocalyx and the cell body of the hair cell. Various small and bigger vesicles in the hair cell cytosol were visible in the vicinity of this protocalyx.</p>

<p>The maturing otoconia were hexagonally shaped with a central dense core of otoconin protein being calcified by the addition of carbonate crystals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The calcification process was still not complete as revealed by the white spots among these crystals, which were the sites of initiation of the calcium deposition in its carbonate form. (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>) gives an overview of the sensory epithelium close to the transitional zone, dark cell area, and the simple cuboidal epithelium in a semi-circular canal.

The cells in the CE were uniformly shaped with a centrally placed nucleus, while those in the DC area had an irregular, laminated appearance with a large, lobulated nucleus. The nuclei of these cells were electron dense and the cytoplasm in these cells contained numerous irregular vacuoles. Deep infoldings of the lateral and basal plasmalemma divided the lower third of these cells into numerous cytoplasmic compartments containing mitochondria. This basal labyrinth was an indication for the extensive transport that these cells must accomplish, which necessitates an extended surface area. The basal lamina (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>, colored red) clearly delineated this epithelium from the underlying mesothelial tissue.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The assemblage of the neuronal circuitry as well its associated functional units requires the synchronous action of a large number of neuronal structural components, neurotransmitters, catalyzing enzymes and transcription factors. The progression of this developmental mechanism also necessitates its upregulation to be mediated by proliferation markers and its downregulation by apoptosis markers. It is this spatially and temporally controlled action during embryogenesis that shapes vestibular machinery as well as its nervous circuitry.</p>
<p>Awareness of the progression of expression of the factors involved in the development of the inner ear/VO is vital to better understanding inner ear disease etiologies as well as their progression. Previous developmental studies focused on murine inner ear models which were used to draw inferences, though the murine inner ear was not considered analogous to the human inner ear. These models need to be supplemented with human studies as the onset of vestibular function differs. Studies performed on neonatal rat pups have shown that the initiation of vestibular function, as demonstrated via the vestibular short latency evoked potentials (VsEPs), starts at postnatal day (PND) 8, while hearing as measured by auditory brain stem response (ABR) potentials were observed only at PND14 (Freeman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1999</xref>). This indicates that although balance function emerges quite early in rats in comparison to hearing, it is still not a precise model to compare with the human VO developmental model. Studies were performed on newborn humans using vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) as an indicator of the development and maturation of the vestibular end organ. Studies showed that the sacculo-collic reflex which is responsible for head movements is already evoked by PND5 (Young et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">2009</xref>). Patch clamp studies performed on human fetal vestibular hair cells and afferent calyxes have shown that major functional characteristics of both have emerged by GW18 (Lim et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Expression for the neuronal intermediate filament protein peripherin was found in the nerve fibers penetrating the sensorineural epithelium of the developing VO. The staining intensity for this neuronal filament increases with the progression in the gestational age and penetrates further into the sensory epithelia as the developmental age progresses. Previous immunostaining studies performed on the vestibular sensory organs from chinchilla, mice, and rats have shown that the staining for peripherin is confined to the extra-striolar regions of the utricle as well as to the peripheral portions of the crista ampullaris, with the immunoreactivity in the vestibular ganglia in these species being confined to the small vestibular ganglionic cells having fine axons (Lysakowski et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">1999</xref>). In contrast, the peripherin-positive nerve fibers innervate the entire developing vestibular sensory organs of the human fetal utricle and cristae. Studies performed on adult gerbil specimens have shown immunoreactivity for peripherin in the vestibular ganglion as well as in the neuroepithelium of the cristae, with the staining being exclusive to the afferent neurons (Leonard and Kevetter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2002</xref>). The expression of peripherin has been associated with the process of axonal extension and regeneration (Liu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2009</xref>). In organotypic cultures performed on axotomized cochlear neurons, two-thirds of all the fibers were positive for peripherin (Lallemend et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2007</xref>), possibly implying that this neuronal marker could play a role in future regeneration models.</p>
<p>Immunostaining for synaptophysin is present in the nerve fibers innervating the sensory epithelia as well as in the afferent calyxes of the hair cells in the fetal VO, which in turn is of functional significance as it is an exceptional indicator of ongoing growth, synaptogenesis and neuronal activity in these afferent fibers surrounding the hair cells. This expression pattern parallels that observed in the mice embryo models (Scarfone et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">1991</xref>). Previous research from our group could show the same progressive increase in staining in the fetal cochlea during the same time period in the GER region of the cochlea which gets remodeled into the future organ of Corti (Pechriggl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The transcription factor Pax2 is necessary for the formation of the otic placode as observed in a Pax2 and Pax8<sup>−/−</sup> mice (Bouchard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2010</xref>), while mutations in Pax2 have been implicated in genetic malformations which could result in optic nerve malformation and hearing loss (McCarroll et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2012</xref>). Interestingly, we were able to detect this marker in the nuclei and cytoplasm of the vestibular hair cells toward W9, while in the fetal cochlea the same was observed at W11. Also, the expression of Pax8 was seen at W12 and was confined to the hair cells of the sensory organs of the fetal VO. Since Pax8 marker activity is correlated with Pax2, immunoreactivity for this marker is an indicator that the developmental process in the VO might still be ongoing during this stage of gestation.</p>
<p>Expression of the transcription factor Pax6, whose deletion has been found to result in aniridia, autism, and mental retardation in humans (Davis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2008</xref>), was localized to the sensory epithelia at W9 among the supporting cells as well in the surrounding mesenchymal tissue. The role of Pax6 in the fetal VO is as yet uncertain due to the absence of supporting literature, though mutations in Pax6 have been found to cause cerebral deformities due to an undeveloped or absence of the anterior commissure and a decrease in the area of the corpus callosum (Bamiou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2004b</xref>). Both of these affected regions have been found to contain auditory interhemispheric fibers resulting in substantial interhemispheric transfer deficits as well as hearing difficulties in patients with Pax6 mutations (Bamiou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2004a</xref>), which might have an influence on auditory processing. Pax6, a regulator of cellular differentiation, could be regulating cellular proliferation at W9 with its expression falling toward W12, which leads to the hypothesis that the satellite glial cells and the Schwann cells are matured by W12.</p>
<p>Staining for S100 was confined to smaller cells traveling with the axons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). Also, the fact that immunoreactivity did not proceed through the basal lamina separating the sensory epithelium from underlying mesothelial connective tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>) allowed us to suppose that these cells were unmyelinated Schwann cells. Likewise we identified mostly unmyelinated Schwann cells at electron microscopic level (compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Schwann cells did not enter the sensory epithelium since supporting cells acted as glia like cells for the innervating peripheral axons; the situation was likewise in the organ of Corti.</p>
<p>The specific expression of glutamine synthetase also supports the hypothesis that these sites of intense staining—the transitional zone as well as the developing satellite glial cells—are involved in glutamate detoxification in the fetal inner ear.</p>
<p>Previous research had shown the expression of this marker as early as the fifth week of gestation, with the expression decreasing toward the ninth week of gestation (Tafra et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">2014</xref>). The expression of Ki-67 is apparent in the region of the macula and is restricted to the undifferentiated cells, whereas the differentiated hair cells with stereocilia are negative for this marker. Inactivity of the Caspase-3 in our study parallels the same previously observed in the human fetal cochlea (Pechriggl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Expression for MAF B was found in a subpopulation of VG cells at W8. This subpopulation of cells was found to go down in number at W12. This neuronal marker which had earlier been identified to play an important role in the auditory circuit assembly (Lu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2011</xref>) as well as in directing the differentiation process in the auditory neurons (Yu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">2013</xref>) is playing an as yet unidentified role, probably one as a driver of the synaptogenesis process among the neurons of the vestibular ganglion.</p>
<p>In our specimens, the formation of the protocalyx is apparent at the electron microscopic level at W12 and reveals synaptic contacts at the presynaptic membrane and the developing punctum adherens contacts between the protocalyx and the hair cell body. Patch-clamp studies on fetal vestibular calyxes have revealed that the developmental processes which ultimately lead to the formation of the type I and type II hair cells as well as the functional calyx terminals are completed by Week 18 (Lim et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2014</xref>). Previous work had shown that immature otoconia are still present at W14 (Dechesne and Sans, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1985</xref>), suggesting that the maturation process for these crystalline structures has paused down between these stages. Moreover, parallel to that which is seen in fetal rat inner ear specimens (Salamat et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">1980</xref>), the calcium carbonate distribution in the rhombohedral (RH) otoconia was quite uneven, especially in the peripheral zones, as apparent from the varying distribution of electron density. This uneven distribution is indicative of the fact that the central core of organic matter in the otoconia is still seeding the calcite crystals in concert with the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) during this stage of vestibular development. This observation correlates to the previous research (Yamashita et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">1992</xref>) where strong expression for CA I and CA II in the endolymphatic sac of the developing human embryo during the gestational weeks 11 and 12 was observed.</p>
