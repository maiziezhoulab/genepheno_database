<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">CELF6, a member of the CELF family of RNA-binding proteins, regulates muscle-specific alternative splicing and contributes to the pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy (DM), however the role of CELF6 in cancer cell proliferation is less appreciated. Here, we show that the expression of CELF6 is cell cycle regulated. The cell cycle-dependent expression of CELF6 is mediated through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, SCF-β-TrCP recognizes a nonphospho motif in CELF6 and regulates its proteasomal degradation. Overexpression or depletion of CELF6 modulates p21 gene expression. CELF6 binds to the 3′UTR of p21 transcript and increases its mRNA stability. Depletion of CELF6 promotes cell cycle progression, cell proliferation and colony formation whereas overexpression of CELF6 induces G1 phase arrest. The effect of CELF6 on cell proliferation is p53 and/or p21 dependent. Collectively, these data demonstrate that CELF6 might be a potential tumor suppressor, CELF6 regulates cell proliferation and cell cycle progression via modulating p21 stability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play crucial role in posttranscriptional regulation in eukaryotes and control multiple aspects of cell behavior. RBPs often bind to mRNAs or noncoding RNAs to regulate all steps of RNA biogenesis, including pre-mRNA splicing, polyadenylation, transport and localization, mRNA stability, and translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. RBPs bind to specific sequences or secondary structures of target RNAs through RNA-binding domains (RBDs). The most widely studied RBDs are RNA-recognition motif, K-hology domain, double stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD), and zinc finger. An RNA-binding protein contains one or more different RBDs, which allow high flexibility for interaction with different RNA targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Considering that RBPs coordinate the networks of protein-RNA and protein–protein interactions that control RNA metabolism, aberrant expression of RBPs have been implicated in many human diseases such as cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. RBPs control the expression of numerous oncogenes or tumor suppressors through posttranscriptional gene regulation. Many RBPs are deregulated in cancer and play critical roles in tumorigenesis and cancer development.</p>
<p id="Par3">CUGBP Elav-like family (CELF) proteins are highly conserved based on their sequence-specific binding to RNA containing CUG repeats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The human CELF family has six members, which can be divided into two subfamilies CELF1-2 and CELF3-6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The mammalian CELF family proteins are broadly expressed in many tissues except that CELF3 and CELF5 are only found in the nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. CELF protein are found in the nucleus and cytoplasm, the major role of nuclear CELF is regulating alternative splicing of target pre-mRNAs, the cytoplasmic CELF is implicated in the control of mRNA translation and/or stability. CELF proteins have been implicated in pathogenesis in various human diseases. CELF1 is upregulated in heart and skeletal muscle in myotonic dystrophy (DM) patients, disruption of CELF1-mediated alternative splicing is linked to DM symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Both CELF1 and CELF2 are upregulated in DM brains, transcripts that are dysregulated in the DM brain have been shown to be targets of CELF-mediated alternative splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Emerging evidences suggest that CELF family proteins are central regulators in malignancies. A transposon-based genetic screen in mice identified CELF1 as a potent cancer driver in colorectal cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Depletion of CELF1 results in growth inhibition, decreased cell viability, and apoptosis in mice and several cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Conversely, overexpression of CELF1 prevents apoptosis in both HeLa and oral cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Recent studies report that CELF1 regulates the translation of ten drivers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), CELF1 is significantly overexpressed in human breast cancer tissues and is necessary and sufficient for both EMT and metastatic colonization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. On the contrary, CELF2 is a putative tumor suppressor in colon cancer, overexpression of CELF2 results in reduced colony formation and apoptosis by mitotic catastrophe in pancreatic and colon cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. CELF2 also plays a critical role in apoptosis in breast cancer cells in response to radiation injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Many studies have focused on CELF1-2 subfamily, the function of CELF3-6 subfamily received much less attention. Mammalian CELF6 is expressed in many tissues, preferentially in kidney, brain, and testis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. CELF6 activates exon inclusion and exon skipping in a tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific manner. <italic>Celf6−/−</italic> mice exhibit a partial autism spectrum disorder-like phenotype, polymorphisms in the CELF6 gene may contribute to autism risk in human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. <italic>Celf6</italic>-YFP transgenic mice study shows that the gene products are present early in neurodevelopment and in adulthood, disruption of <italic>Celf6</italic> expression in hypothalamic nuclei may impact a variety of behaviors downstream of neuropeptide activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In this report, we aimed to study the function of CELF6 in cancer cell proliferation. We show that the expression of CELF6 is cell cycle regulated. The cell cycle-dependent expression of CELF6 is mediated through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box)-β-TrCP is responsible for CELF6 degradation. Gene expression profiling and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis reveal that the p53 signaling is enriched in <italic>CELF6</italic> knockout cells. Depletion or overexpression of CELF6 results in dramatic change of p21 expression. CELF6 binds to p21 mRNA and regulates its stability. CELF6 modulates cell cycle progression and cell proliferation in p53 and/or p21-dependent manner. Thus, we propose that CELF6 is a potential tumor suppressor, CELF6 regulates cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression via modulating p21 stability.</p>

<title>The expression of CELF6 is cell cycle regulated</title>
<p id="Par5">To examine whether the expression of CELF6 is cell cycle regulated, the HCT116 colorectal cancer cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by a double-thymidine (DT) block, cells were released and harvested at different time points to perform flow cytometry and immunoblotting analysis. Immunoblotting revealed that CELF6 protein was relatively higher at G1/S and early S phases, then decreased sharply 4 h post DT release and maintained a relatively low level until most of the cells entered G2/M phase, following an increase in the amount of CELF6 at 10–12 h post DT release (G1 phase) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a, b</xref>). However, quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) demonstrated that the expression patterns of CELF6 protein and mRNA are different, <italic>CELF6</italic> mRNA levels increased dramatically 4 h post DT release, indicating that posttranscriptional modifications may regulate the fluctuation of CELF6 protein during the cell cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). Then, we used a selective CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 to arrest cells at the G2/M phase border (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). The G2/M phase marker cyclin B1 was used as an indicator for immunoblotting of synchronized cell extracts. CELF6 mRNA and protein maintained at relatively constant levels during G2/M and early G1 phases, followed by accumulation of CELF6 protein in late G1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e, f</xref>). We also analyzed CELF6 expression in HCT116 <italic>p21−/−</italic> cells, the protein level of CELF6 is still cell cycle regulated in <italic>p21−/−</italic> cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>The expression of CELF6 is cell cycle regulated.</title><p><bold>a</bold> HCT116 cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by using double-thymidine (DT) block, cells were released from thymidine treatment at the indicated time points, fixed and stained with Propidium iodide (PI) for flow cytometry. <bold>b</bold> Cell extracts were collected at different time pointes after DT release and analyzed by immunoblotting, cyclin E1 was used as a G1/S phase protein marker. <bold>c</bold> Relative <italic>CELF6</italic> mRNA levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. <bold>d</bold> HCT116 cells were synchronized at the G2/M transition by CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 treatment, cells were released from RO-3306 treatment at the indicated time points and cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry. <bold>e</bold> Cell extracts were collected at different time pointes after RO-3306 release and analyzed by immunoblotting or <bold>f</bold> quantitative RT-PCR, cyclin B1 was used as a G2/M phase protein marker</p></caption><graphic id="d29e539" xlink:href="41419_2019_1927_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>

<title>CELF6 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway</title>
<p id="Par6">Both autophagy-lysosomal pathway and the ubiquitin-proteasome system control degradation of the majority of eukaryotic proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. To investigate which pathway contributes to CELF6 degradation, HCT116 cells were treated with the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BAF) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 before harvesting cells for immunoblotting. Both BAF and HCQ did not affect CELF6 expression, whereas the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 stabilized CELF6, indicating that CELF6 is degraded by proteasome pathway (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). The majority of proteins that are destroyed by proteasome are marked by the covalent attachment of polyubiquitin chains. To examine whether CELF6 is covalently modified through ubiquitination, HA-Ubiquitin and GFP-CELF6 were coexpressed in HEK293 cells, cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with GFP antibody. Several slow migrating bands were detected in cells cotransfected with GFP-CELF6 and HA-Ubiquitin, the bands can be detected by both GFP and HA antibodies suggesting that CELF6 is degraded by ubiquitin-conjugated proteasome pathway (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>CELF6 is degraded by ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway.</title><p><bold>a</bold> HCT116 cells were treated with DMSO, 10 nM bafilomycin A1 (BAF) for 24 h, 20 μM hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for 6 h, or MG132 (20 μM) for 6 h.

<title>Ubiquitination of CELF6 is mediated by SCF-β-TrCP</title>
<p id="Par7">Two important E3 ubiquitin ligases, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and the SCF containing complex, are responsible for destroying the cell cycle regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. To explore the mechanism of CELF6 degradation during the cell cycle, we knocked down the expression of several F-box proteins (Skp2, Fbxw7, β-TrCP) or the APC activators (Cdc20, Cdh1). Immunoblotting revealed that CELF6 protein expression was not affected by <italic>Skp2</italic>, <italic>Fbxw7</italic>, <italic>Cdc20</italic>, or <italic>Cdh1</italic> siRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>). Interestingly, knockdown of <italic>β-TrCP</italic> significantly increased the protein level of CELF6 without affecting its mRNA expression. Wee1, a well-known β-TrCP substrate, was also accumulated in <italic>β-TrCP</italic> depleted cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). We also examined whether overexpression or silencing β-TrCP can regulate exogenous CELF6 degradation. HCT116 cells were transfected with His-CELF6, Flag-β-TrCP or β-TrCP siRNA, and/or HA-tagged ubiquitin. Immunoblotting for exogenous CELF6 indicated reduced levels of His-CELF6 in cells expressing Flag-β-TrCP and HA-Ub, whereas β-TrCP siRNA dramatically increased the level of His-CELF6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). Next, we investigated whether CELF6 can physically associate with β-TrCP. Co-immunoprecipitation results showed that Flag-β-TrCP or GFP-CELF6 was purified from cell extracts immunoprecipitated with GFP or Flag antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>). In addition, His-tagged CELF6 was also detected in Flag-β-TrCP immune complexes and Flag-β-TrCP was observed in His-CELF6 immunoprecipitates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g</xref>). These data indicate that CELF6 is a potential substrate of SCF-β-TrCP.</p>

We analyzed the amino acid sequence of CELF6 and identified a conserved motif for β-TrCP recognition (the DSGVGMS motif). To test the importance of this motif, we generated two CELF6 point mutations, in one the two serines were changed to alanine (S25A/S30A), in another both the DSG sites and serine were changed to alanine (D24A/S25A/G26A/S30A). However, none of the mutant proteins affected the interaction between CELF6 and β-TrCP. We also identified another potential β-TrCP-binding motif (resides between amino acids 98 and 105), the two serine residues were mutated to alanine (S99A/S105A). Co-immunoprecipitation result showed that mutant proteins did not affect CELF6/β-TrCP association (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the DSG(X<sub>2-</sub>n)S motif is not required for β-TrCP recognition and binding.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>SCF-β-TrCP targets CELF6 for degradation.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Alignment of DSG(X<sub>2-</sub>n)S motif in CELF6 in different species.

<p id="Par9">To precisely identify the potential β-TrCP-binding sequence, we constructed several truncated mutations of CELF6 (NΔ35, NΔ112, NΔ224, NΔ287, CΔ107, and CΔ230) and examined their interaction with β-TrCP. The truncations were coexpressed with Flag-β-TrCP in HEK293 cells, co-immunoprecipitation results revealed that NΔ35, NΔ112, NΔ224, and CΔ107 interacted with β-TrCP whereas NΔ287 and CΔ230 did not bind to β-TrCP, indicating the β-TrCP binding site likely resides in the region between amino acids 224 and 288 in CELF6 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>). We also examined the subcellular localization of CELF6 mutants to rule out that the loss of interaction could be a consequence of β-TrCP and CELF6 localization in different cellular compartments. Immunofluorescent staining showed that all the CELF6 mutant proteins colocalized with β-TrCP (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">2</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par10">Most substrates require phosphorylation to interact with SCF-β-TrCP, to test whether the interaction between CELF6 and β-TrCP is phosphorylation-dependent, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assay after λ phosphatase treatment. Surprisingly, the association between CELF6 and β-TrCP was not abolished by λ phosphatase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that β-TrCP binds to noncanonical degron in CELF6 and regulates its degradation in a phosphorylation-independent manner.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par17">The involvement of CELF family proteins in regulating cell cycle progression is less appreciated. In this study, we show that CELF6 protein level fluctuates throughout the cell cycle, SCF-β-TrCP is responsible for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of CELF6. β-TrCP, a member of the F-box protein family, is the substrate recognition subunit of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. β-TrCP plays important role in regulating cell cycle progression, cell growth, and survival. In general, β-TrCP recognizes a conserved binding motif with the sequence of DpSGΦXpS where Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Although there is a conserved DSGVGMS motif in the N-terminus of CELF6, mutation analysis suggests that this conserved motif is not recognized by β-TrCP. β-TrCP has the ability to bind to noncanonical phosphodegrons, even a nonphospho-motif can be recognized by β-TrCP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. We show here the interaction between CELF6 and β-TrCP is not affected by λ phosphatase treatment, indicating β-TrCP binds to CELF6 in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Truncation analysis identified the sequence between amino acids 224–287 is sufficient and necessary for β-TrCP association. The β-TrCP recognition site locates in the divergent domain of CELF6. The divergent domain likely plays a role in mediating the interaction with RNA, but it is not clear whether the divergent domain affects protein–proteins interactions. Our results thus provide new evidence that β-TrCP can bind to nonconsensus motif in a phosphorylation-independent manner.</p>
<p id="Par18">The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is a well-known cell cycle inhibitor and a major target of p53. p21 plays multiple function in cell cycle progression, cellular senescence, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation in response to a variety of stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The expression of p21 is tightly controlled at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. There are several lines of evidence suggesting that many RBPs, including HuR, HuD, Rbm24, RNPC1, and poly(C)-binding proteins (PCBPs) regulate p21 mRNA stability through binding the 3′UTR of p21 transcript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. On the other hand, CELF family protein CELF1 induces p21 expression via binding to a GC-rich sequence in the 5′UTR of p21 mRNA, overexpression of CELF1 increases p21 protein expression without increasing the cellular amount of the mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. In this study, we found that depletion of <italic>CELF6</italic> affected p53 signaling pathway in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. Both quantitative PCR and immunoblotting analysis revealed that the expression of p21 was dramatically modified by CELF6.

<p id="Par19">CELF family proteins play different roles in tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer. CELF1 is a potent cancer driver whereas CELF2 is potential tumor suppressor.
