<sec id="section1-0269881119858306">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>The potential benefits of cannabis and its major non-intoxicating component
cannabidiol (CBD) are attracting attention, including as a potential
treatment in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder
(ASD). However, the neural action of CBD, and its relevance to ASD, remains
unclear. We and others have previously shown that response to drug challenge
can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but that
pharmacological responsivity is atypical in ASD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269881119858306">
<title>Aims:</title>
<p>We hypothesized that there would be a (different) fMRI response to CBD in
ASD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269881119858306">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>To test this, task-free fMRI was acquired in 34 healthy men (half with ASD)
following oral administration of 600 mg CBD or matched placebo (random
order; double-blind administration). The ‘fractional amplitude of
low-frequency fluctuations’ (fALFF) was measured across the whole brain,
and, where CBD significantly altered fALFF, we tested if functional
connectivity (FC) of those regions was also affected by CBD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269881119858306">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>CBD significantly increased fALFF in the cerebellar vermis and the right
fusiform gyrus. However, post-hoc within-group analyses revealed that this
effect was primarily driven by the ASD group, with no significant change in
controls. Within the ASD group only, CBD also significantly altered vermal
FC with several of its subcortical (striatal) and cortical targets, but did
not affect fusiform FC with other regions in either group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269881119858306">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Our results suggest that, especially in ASD, CBD alters regional fALFF and FC
in/between regions consistently implicated in ASD. Future studies should
examine if this affects the complex behaviours these regions modulate.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881119858306">Baio et al., 2018</xref>) and complex
neurodevelopmental psychiatric condition, which shortens life expectancy by up to 20
years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881119858306">Hirvikoski et al.,
2016</xref>). Moreover, 70% of autistic individuals are estimated to have
co-occurring conditions, e.g. epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881119858306">Tuchman and Rapin, 2002</xref>) and mood and
anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881119858306">Joshi et al.,
2013</xref>). However, there are no effective pharmacological treatments for the
core symptoms of ASD, and individuals often respond poorly to conventional
treatments of complicating mental or physical illnesses. Alternative treatment
approaches, such as cannabis and its major non-intoxicating component cannabidiol
(CBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881119858306">Fetterman and Turner,
1972</xref>), are therefore increasingly explored.</p>
<p>There is accumulating evidence for the efficacy of CBD in several conditions, such as
spasticity in multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269881119858306">Zajicek et al., 2003</xref>) and schizophrenia
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881119858306">Bhattacharyya et al.,
2018</xref>); and in conditions associated with ASD, including social phobia
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881119858306">Bergamaschi et al.,
2011</xref>) and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881119858306">Devinsky et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, there are preliminary reports of
beneficial effects of medical marihuana in idiopathic ASD itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881119858306">Aran et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881119858306">Campbell et al., 2017</xref>). For
instance, a recent study has demonstrated that CBD-rich cannabis reduced behavioural
outbreaks in children with ASD and severe behavioural problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881119858306">Aran et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, a
role for CBD in ASD management warrants further attention. Consequently, there are
now at least two clinical trials of CBD in ASD (clinicaltrials.gov; identifiers
NCT03900923 and NCT02956226). However, we still have only limited understanding of
how the typical human brain, let alone the autistic brain, responds to CBD. Hence, a
fuller understanding of the mechanism of action of CBD on the brain, and its
relevance to ASD, is desirable before investing in large-scale clinical trials.</p>
<p>Brain responsivity to pharmacological challenges can, for example, be measured using
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881119858306">Bhattacharyya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881119858306">Fusar-Poli et al., 2010</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881119858306">Grimm et al., 2018</xref>).
Evidence that such approaches are sensitive to CBD effects comes from studies in
both neurotypicals and individuals with schizophrenia. For instance, in
neurotypicals, CBD reduced fronto-striatal – and decreased mediotemporal-prefrontal
– FC during a visual oddball salience task, and enhanced salience processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881119858306">Bhattacharyya et al., 2015</xref>).
In neurotypicals, CBD also disrupted prefrontal-subcortical connectivity during the
processing of fearful faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881119858306">Fusar-Poli et al., 2010</xref>), and increased fronto-striatal activity at rest
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881119858306">Grimm et al., 2018</xref>).
In schizophrenia, an acute dose of CBD was reported to ‘normalize’ brain activity in
regions during a verbal learning paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881119858306">Bhattacharyya et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly,
fMRI has been used as a marker for other drug challenges in ASD, such as riluzole,
propranolol or oxytocin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881119858306">Ajram et
al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881119858306">Gordon et
al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881119858306">Narayanan
et al., 2010</xref>). However, the vast majority of these previous studies
acquired fMRI during cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>Although this approach provides valuable task-specific information, it constrains the
analysis of drug response to task-relevant brain regions (and so misses the
potential impact of a drug on whole-brain function). Moreover, in a condition like
ASD, where the performance of such higher cognitive tasks can be compromised (e.g.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881119858306">Ashwin et al., 2007</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881119858306">Daly et al., 2012</xref>),
disentangling the effects of a drug from the demands of the task can be challenging.
Thus, to examine whole-brain impact of CBD in individuals with and without ASD, we
elected to use a resting state design.</p>
<p>In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study we adopted a
whole-brain, task-free (resting state) design to compare brain response to CBD in
individuals with and without ASD. We used resting state fMRI to examine the
fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) (0.01−0.1 Hz) as a
measure of spontaneous regional brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881119858306">Cordes et al., 2001</xref>). These low-frequency
oscillations are thought to subsequently support the synchronisation of activity
between spatially distinct regions (i.e. functional connectivity, FC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881119858306">Friston et al., 1993</xref>).
Therefore, in regions where a significant shift in fALFF was observed, we also
conducted a secondary seed-based analysis of FC of that region with the rest of the
brain. Data were acquired following a single oral dose of 600 mg CBD or a matched
placebo (at least 13 days apart). We predicted that CBD would alter regional fALFF
and also shift FC of those regions which responded. Moreover, based on our previous
findings that the autistic brain responds atypically to pharmacological challenge
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881119858306">Ajram et al., 2017</xref>),
we expected that responsivity to CBD would be different in autistic compared to
neurotypical individuals.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>This research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, at
the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at De Crespigny Park,
SE5 8AF, London, UK (August 2016 to February 2017). Ethical approval for this
study was provided by the King’s College London Research Ethics Committee, study
reference HR15/162744. All participants provided written informed consent. Every
participant took part in all aspects of this case–control observational study.
The Medicines and Health Research Authority in the UK confirmed that our study
design is not a clinical trial; however, in the interests of transparency this
observational study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (identifier:
NCT03537950, entry name: HR15-162744).</p>
<p>This was a placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind, repeated-measures,
cross-over study conducted as part of a larger investigation into the role of
phytocannabinoids in ASD. Drugs were allocated in a pseudo-randomised order, so
that each participant received each drug (PLC, CBD) once; approximately half of
our participants attended a placebo visit before CBD; and half received CBD
before placebo. This randomisation was implemented by G.M.M. using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.random.org/">https://www.random.org/</ext-link>. Participants and those assessing
outcomes were blinded to the assignment. Participants attended for two visits.
To allow for drug wash-out, visits were separated each by a minimum of 13 days,
with all attempts made to keep between-visit time consistent across all visits
and participants. Moreover, time of data acquisition from both groups was
largely overlapping. On each visit, urine samples were taken to screen for
illicit substances (a full list is included below). Subsequently, participants
underwent a brief health check and received a liquid oral dose of the
pharmacological probe (600 mg of CBD or a matched placebo, both provided by GW
Research Ltd, Cambridge, UK). The dose of 600 mg of CBD has previously been
demonstrated to be sufficient to elicit an effect on brain in adults (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881119858306">Bhattacharyya et al.,
2015</xref>), while being very well tolerated (GW Pharmaceuticals
Investigator Brochure 2015). After a second brief health check to test for
potential acute adverse reactions/side effects, participants underwent scanning
timed to coincide with peak plasma (2 h) concentration. Following the scan,
participants received a third health check to ensure they had experienced no
ill-effects and were fit to leave the department.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269881119858306">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Potential participants were excluded if they had a comorbid major psychiatric or
medical disorder affecting brain development (e.g. schizophrenia or epilepsy), a
history of head/brain injury, a genetic disorder associated with ASD (e.g.
tuberous sclerosis or Fragile X syndrome), an IQ below 70, or were reliant on
receiving regular medication known to modulate directly the neurotransmitters
glutamate and GABA. However, we included participants on other medications which
are frequently prescribed in this condition. Thus, one autistic participant
received a single dose of Ritalin on the morning of each test day, and another
autistic participant took a single dose of sertraline on the morning of each
visit. All participants were asked to abstain from using cannabis and/or other
illicit substances in the month prior to scanning, and from drinking alcohol on
the day prior to testing. Moreover, data from individuals who screened positive
for illicit substances in the urine drug screening were excluded. Thus, we
retained data from 34 subjects (17 neurotypicals, 17 ASD) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881119858306">Table 1</xref> for
demographics). All participants in the ASD group had a clinical diagnosis of ASD
made according to ICD10 research criteria, supported by the use of standardised
research diagnostic instruments (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, ADOS;
and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, ADI-R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881119858306">Lord, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881119858306">Lord et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881119858306">World Health Organisation,

<title>Imaging data acquisition</title>
<p>We acquired all imaging data on a 3T GE Excite II magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Our scanning protocol
included a structural MRI scan acquired using a 3D inversion recovery prepared
fast spoiled gradient recalled (IR-FSPGR) sequence (slice thickness = 1.1 mm,
spatial positions = 124, flip angle = 20°, field of view (FoV) = 280 mm, echo
time (TE) = 2.844 ms, repetition time (TR) = 7.068 ms, inversion time (TI) = 450
ms, matrix = 256×256). This structural MRI scan was used for co-registration of
the functional volumes. The scanning protocol further included a resting state
MRI scan. This scan was acquired using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence
(slice thickness = 3 mm, slice gap = 3.3 mm, flip angle = 75°, FoV = 240 mm, TE
= 30 ms, TR = 2000 ms, TI = 0 ms). We collected data for 256 time points, i.e.
the resting state scan lasted 512 s.</p>

<p>We processed our resting state data using in-house software CONN v.17c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269881119858306">Whitfield-Gabrieli and
Nieto-Castanon, 2012</xref>), DPABI v.2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269881119858306">Yan et al., 2016</xref>) and MATLAB R2017a
(The MathWorks, Inc., MA, USREF). To ensure adequate data quality, all data
were inspected manually for artefacts such as blurring, distortions,
ghosting or warping. The first five functional volumes were discarded to
allow for magnetization equilibrium.</p>
<p>Using CONN, all remaining functional volumes were slice-time corrected
(sinc-interpolation), realigned (within runs to first volume, then all
volumes to first volume of first run) and normalized to MNI space, using the
segmented (into GM, WM and CSF) structural scans.</p>
<p>Head motion is thought to affect measures of FC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881119858306">Power et al., 2012</xref>) and could
potentially affect fALFF. To account for head motion, for each subject and
run, we computed the frame-to-frame displacement (&gt;1.5 mm/°
translation/rotation classified as motion outlier). Following previous
studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881119858306">Gordon et
al., 2016</xref>), we used a joint threshold, where subjects with
movement in any dimension ⩾2 mm and/or ⩾15% of volumes identified as motion
outliers were excluded from the analysis. This resulted in the exclusion of
four runs from four subjects (all ASD). Thus, we retained a sample of 17
neurotypicals and 13 individuals with ASD.</p>

<title>fALFF data processing</title>
<p>Using DPABI, the functional data were detrended (linear trend removal),
and denoised (WM, CSF and movement confounds removed through linear
regression). Subsequently, the time series of each voxel was transformed
into the frequency domain using a Fast Fourier transform (as described
in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881119858306">Song et al.
(2011))</xref>. Next, we obtained the power spectrum and calculated
the square root (amplitude) at each frequency of the power spectrum. The
sum of amplitudes across the low-frequency spectrum (0.01 &lt;
<italic>f</italic> &lt; 0.1 Hz) was divided by that across the
entire frequency range (0 &lt; <italic>fT</italic> &lt; 0.25 Hz).
Individual fALFF maps were then standardised (Z-value; subtraction of
global mean, and division by standard deviation) within a brain mask
(average GM mask across all subjects) and smoothed (using a Gaussian
filter with a 6-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) kernel). Thus, our
analysis of low-frequency fluctuations proceeded on a voxel by voxel
basis.</p>

<p>In contrast to our fALFF analysis, our analysis of interregional FC used
the average activity within predefined regions of interest (ROIs) based

<italic>Introduction</italic>, we also wanted to examine the consistency of
this response across groups and to establish if a CBD effect was indeed present

drug, we performed planned post-hoc tests of these drug effects within each

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we report, for the first time, that CBD ‘shifts’ fALFF and FC in the adult human
brain. Specifically, we found that CBD significantly increased fALFF in the
cerebellar vermis VI and the right fusiform gyrus. However, post-hoc within-group
testing indicated that this shift was most prominent in ASD, and not significant in
controls (please note that we did not identify a significant group by drug
interaction). Moreover, in ASD, but not controls, the shift in fALFF in the
cerebellum (but not fusiform gyrus) was accompanied by widespread changes in vermal
FC with several of its subcortical and cortical targets.</p>
<sec id="section23-0269881119858306">
<title>Cerebellar vermis</title>
<p>In the typical brain, the cerebellar vermis and its
cerebellar–subcortical–cortical circuitry are increasingly understood to
subserve a critical role in movement, language and social processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881119858306">D’Mello and Stoodley,
2015</xref>). In ASD, however, there have been reports of functional
anomalies in the cerebellum, which are thought to contribute to the disruption
of these processes observed in ASD; but the results have been inconsistent.</p>
<p>For example, vermal hypoactivation during simple motor tasks (finger tapping)
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881119858306">Muller et al.,
2001</xref>) and during auditory perception (listening to tones) has been
observed in adults with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881119858306">Muller et al., 1999</xref>). In children and adolescents with ASD, FC of
the vermis with sensorimotor regions has been reported to be higher; whereas
vermal FC with prefrontal and motor regions has been recorded as lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881119858306">Khan et al., 2015</xref>)
compared to neurotypicals. Hence, the results of functional imaging studies in
ASD may depend on the task under investigation. Here we used a non-task design
and observed no baseline differences in cerebellar fALFF and FC measures (with
other regions) in participants with and without ASD. Instead, we found that
cerebellar activity and connectivity was modifiable, and especially so in ASD.
Specifically, we found that the CBD-induced increase in vermal fALFF in ASD was
accompanied by an increase in cerebellar–subcortical (striatal) FC. However, CBD
also decreased cerebellar-cortical FC. This suggests that, in autistic adults,
rather than inducing a general and unidirectional shift in FC, CBD appears to
‘tune’ FC in a region- or connection-specific manner. It was beyond the scope of
the present study to examine the cognitive or behavioural implications of this
response.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0269881119858306">
<title>Right fusiform gyrus</title>
<p>In the neurotypical brain, the right fusiform is commonly associated with the
visual processing of words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881119858306">McCandliss et al., 2003</xref>) and parts of the body (vs objects), e.g.
faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881119858306">Morris et al.,
2007</xref>). In ASD, face processing is overwhelmingly reported to be
impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881119858306">Ashwin et al.,
2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881119858306">Kleinhans
et al., 2008</xref>), and this is consistent with a wealth of evidence for
functional fusiform anomalies in this condition. For instance, neuroimaging
studies have reported hypoactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881119858306">Perlman et al., 2011</xref>) and impaired FC
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881119858306">Kleinhans et al.,
2008</xref>) during face processing. Again, using a task-free design we
found no baseline differences in the activity of this region; but our results
indicate that CBD modulates fusiform activity, and that the ASD group was
particularly responsive. Our study design does not speak to whether face
processing in ASD would also be altered by CBD, but it does indicate that the
functional dynamics of this region in ASD differ from controls, in that activity
can be modulated by CBD.</p>
<p>Although CBD shifted fALFF in both the vermis 6 and right fusiform gyrus, it only
altered FC of the vermis (and other regions) and not of the fusiform (and other
regions) of individuals with ASD. The reason for this is not known. One
explanation is that the connections of the fusiform with other regions are
relatively limited, certainly compared to the cerebellum. Fusiform FC (with
other regions) in ASD specifically may be further restricted by the anatomy of
the fusiform region in this condition. For example, the grey-white matter
boundary of the fusiform gyrus has been observed to be disrupted in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881119858306">Andrews et al., 2017</xref>),
as has the integrity of WM tracts in this location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881119858306">Barnea-Goraly et al., 2004</xref>).
Abnormalities in WM connections could restrict the impact of CBD on wider FC of
this seed. In contrast, previous studies of the vermis indicate that the
microstructural integrity of WM connections in this region is intact or even
higher in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881119858306">Noriuchi et
al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881119858306">Ben
Bashat et al., 2007</xref>); and thus there may be more ‘capacity’ for FC of
the cerebellum with other regions to change in response to pharmacological

<title>Neurobiological basis of CBD effects on fALFF and FC</title>
<p>The neurobiological underpinnings of these effects are unclear. However, previous
studies indicate that CBD can influence excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA
pathways, which play a crucial role in the regulation of LFF and FC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881119858306">Farrant and Nusser,
2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Preclinical studies suggest that CBD has a range of actions which may, for
example, converge in a modulation of brain excitation and inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881119858306">Kaplan et al., 2017</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881119858306">Musella et al.,
2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881119858306">Santana et
al., 2004</xref>). This is important because the balance of excitation and
inhibition is postulated to help establish and maintain LFF and FC. Inhibitory
phasic GABAergic interneurons, for instance, are key modulators of
temporo-spatial signal integration and propagation. Through feed-forward
inhibition, these neurons can synchronise large numbers of pyramidal cells and
thus provide the basis for coordinated firing across distinct brain regions
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881119858306">Farrant and Nusser,
2005</xref>). Similarly, tonic GABAergic neurons can shape LFF by tuning
cell conductance and thus controlling the amount and duration of voltage
response to excitatory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881119858306">Farrant and Nusser, 2005</xref>). Several
targets of CBD in the brain, e.g. TRPV1, GPR55 and 5-HT receptors, have been
linked to brain glutamate and/or GABA signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881119858306">Kaplan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881119858306">Musella et al., 2009</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881119858306">Santana et al.,
2004</xref>) and so may impact upon this neural activity. For instance,
TRPV1-activation through CBD has been reported to increase glutamatergic
excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881119858306">Musella et al.,
2009</xref>). In contrast, CBD antagonism on GPR55 has been observed to
increase the firing of GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881119858306">Kaplan et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, CBD is
an agonist on 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, which can be
found both on excitatory and inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881119858306">Santana et al., 2004</xref>); thus, CBD action
through these receptors may both enhance and reduce excitatory and inhibitory
transmission. In ASD, however, these targets of CBD have been reported to be
altered (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881119858306">Kerr et al.,
2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881119858306">Veenstra-VanderWeele et al., 2012</xref>). This may partly explain the
differential findings in ASD compared to neurotypicals observed here.</p>
<p>An alternative explanation for the sensitivity of ASD and not controls to a drug
challenge targeting glutamate-GABA systems may be the abnormalities in these
systems – and their responsivity – in ASD. For instance, there is reduced
expression of GABA receptors in the fusiform in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881119858306">Oblak et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly,
decreased levels both of glutamic acid decarboxylase (the enzyme responsible for
converting glutamate to GABA) and of inhibitory Purkinje cells in the vermis in
ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881119858306">Murakami et al.,
1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881119858306">Yip et al.,
2007</xref>) suggest inhibition deficits in this condition. Thus, our
results open the possibility that in ASD, CBD boosts LFF (and FC) especially in
regions where GABA systems are impaired. This proposed link between the
glutamate-GABA system and functional circuitry is supported by previous findings
of a significant correlation between cerebellar excitation–inhibition levels and
cerebro-cerebellar FC in adolescents and adults with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881119858306">Hegarty et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section26-0269881119858306">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>We acknowledge that our study has important limitations.</p>
<p>First, our study sample size was modest because: (a) we applied strict
recruitment criteria (e.g. exclusion of candidates with comorbid psychiatric or
medical conditions, which can be challenging in ASD); (b) participants were
asked to adhere to time-intensive repeated testing over several weeks, involving
drug administration – this commitment was not always practical; and (c) we
performed rigorous data quality control and excluded some datasets. Nonetheless,
our repeated-measures design mitigated these constraints to some extent by
reducing inter-subject variability (each participant had two scans and thus
acted as their own ‘control’) and thus increasing statistical power. In
addition, our findings survived rigorous statistical thresholding.</p>
<p>Second, fALFF analysis is focused on a single frequency range (0.01–0.1 Hz).
However, in the human brain, a range of frequency bands are thought to interact
and to possess hierarchical structure. For instance, EEG approaches have shown
that delta (1–4 Hz) phase modulates theta (4–10 Hz) amplitude, and that theta
phase modulates gamma (30–50 Hz) amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881119858306">Lakatos et al., 2005</xref>). Future studies
are required to investigate the impact of CBD across different frequency bands
to obtain a more comprehensive view of CBD effects in the neurotypical and
autistic brain.</p>
<p>Third, in the present study we investigated the impact of acute CBD
administration. However, the effects of longer periods of treatment with CBD on
fALFF and FC (and eventually on clinically relevant indices) are difficult to
predict and may vary between individuals. Therefore, future studies are required
to examine the effects of chronic CBD administration on brain, and whether the
acute response to CBD may help predict the impact of sustained treatment.</p>
<p>Fourth, there are two qualifications that need to be considered when interpreting
our results. These qualifications apply to most studies of resting state FC. The
first pertains to the nature of resting state fMRI: by its nature, this
task-free paradigm relinquishes experimental control over neuronal processing or
attentional set. It is therefore possible that the differences we have observed
reflected group differences in the way that subjects responded to the scanning
experience. The second issue is specific to the way in which we quantified FC.
By using the correlation coefficient as a measure of FC, we acknowledge that a
significant effect on a correlation coefficient can be produced either by a
change in the linear coupling between two regions, or by a difference in noise.
In other words, an increase (or decrease) in the correlation coefficient can be
explained by a decrease (or increase) in noise or random effects due to mental
or other (e.g., motion) effects. In short, a difference in correlation can be
explained either in terms of a difference in variance explained in one region by
another region – or by a difference in the variance not explained (i.e., noise).
A more direct way to test for differences in linear coupling would have been to
use a form of psychophysiological interaction in which the Fisher transformed
correlation coefficients are replaced by the regression coefficients (obtained
by regressing the activity of a target region on a source region). We will
consider this in future work.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary, we report the first evidence that CBD ‘shifts’ fALFF and associated FC in
the adult autistic brain. Thus, in ASD, CBD can alter a crucial property of brain
function, and targets key regions commonly implicated in the condition. Future
studies are required to (a) investigate if CBD-induced alterations of fALFF and FC
in ASD impact on the cognitive processes and behaviours these regions modulate; and
(b) examine whether brain response to an acute dose of CBD may help predict response
to sustained treatment in ASD.</p>
