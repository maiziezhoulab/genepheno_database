<abstract>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairments in social interactions and stereotyped behaviors. Valproic acid (VPA) is frequently used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorders. When taken during pregnancy, VPA increases the risk of the unborn child to develop an ASD. In rodents, <italic>in utero</italic> VPA exposure can precipitate behavioral phenotypes related to ASD in the offspring. Therefore, such rodent models may allow for identification of synaptic pathophysiology underlying ASD risk. Here, we systematically probed alterations in synaptic proteins that might contribute to autism-related behavior in the offspring of <italic>in utero</italic> VPA-exposed mice. Moreover, we tested whether direct VPA exposure of cultured neocortical neurons may recapitulate the molecular alterations seen <italic>in vivo</italic>. VPA-exposed neurons in culture exhibit a significant increase in the number of glutamatergic synapses accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of GABAergic synapses. This shift in excitatory/inhibitory balance results in substantially increased spontaneous activity in neuronal networks arising from VPA-exposed neurons. Pharmacological experiments demonstrate that the alterations in GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic proteins and structures are largely caused by inhibition of histone deacetylases. Therefore, our study highlights an epigenetic mechanism underlying the synaptic pathophysiology in this ASD model.</p>

<body>
<p>Valproic acid (VPA) is a drug commonly prescribed for patients with epilepsy and bipolar mood disorder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. However, during pregnancy VPA treatment elevates the risk for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders in the unborn child<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The mechanisms underlying this prenatal action of VPA remain unclear. VPA does cross the placenta. Thus, VPA exposure may act directly on developing neuronal cells. Moreover, VPA may also modify maternal tissues and indirectly impact neurodevelopment in the fetus.</p>
<p>The impact of <italic>in utero</italic> VPA exposure has been explored in rodent models. Administration of VPA to pregnant rats or mice during the third trimester results in molecular, synaptic and behavioral alterations in the offspring. Thus, <italic>in utero</italic> VPA-exposed offspring exhibit altered social communication, auditory evoked events and restricted and repetitive behaviors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Electrophysiological studies suggest that prenatal VPA exposure in rats leads to enhanced long-term potentiation and local hyper-connectivity through increased synaptic <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor density in neocortical areas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, increased frequency of mEPSCs in the amygdala<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, and impaired cortical inhibitory synaptic transmission<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p>
<p>The mechanisms underlying these alterations are still far from being understood. Anti-convulsant actions of VPA in adult patients are thought to induce γ (gamma)-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, thereby elevating inhibitory synaptic transmission. In fact, VPA alters expression profiles of numerous genes by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Such an epigenetic modification by VPA affects neuronal differentiation of multipotent adult neural progenitor cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Moreover, short-term VPA exposure of cultured neocortical neurons alters mRNA expression of genes encoding subsets of synaptic proteins such as glutamamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology relevant for ASD remain unclear.</p>
<p>In this study, we systematically investigated the effect of VPA on synaptic properties with biochemical, cell biological and electrophysiological studies using <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> VPA models. We uncover distinct defects in synaptic differentiation of neocortical neurons. These effects are mimicked by direct inhibition of HDACs in neuronal cells. Ultimately, the epigenetic modification elicited by VPA results in a hyper-excitable network state which might be fundamental for neuronal dys-function in ASD.</p>

<title>Distinct alteration in synaptic proteins in VPA-exposed mice</title>
<p>To systematically evaluate the effect of <italic>in utero</italic> VPA exposure on synaptic development, we surveyed protein expression of several synaptic and neuronal proteins in large cohorts of offspring from VPA-treated dams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). Pregnant mice (outbred CD1 strain) were subjected to subcutaneous injection with VPA (600 mg/kg) or saline at embryonic day 13 (E13). Considering that drug injection and action in each pregnant female represent the biggest experimental variables in such a study we examined cohorts of mice obtained from significant numbers of treated and control dams (n = 13 VPA dams and 15 vehicle dams, &gt;30 offspring per condition analyzed). Dams from both groups had normal pregnancies, and the day of birth was unaffected by VPA exposure, always occurring on E18 or E19. The size of the litters was similar, although there was a tendency for the VPA mothers to have slightly more pups (11.8 ± 0.6 pups/litter in vehicle vs. 14.0 ± 0.4 pups/litter in VPA group, n ≥ 23 litters, mean and SEM, p &lt; 0.01, Mann-Whitney test). Offspring from VPA-treated dams had significantly reduced body weight and exhibited a delay in eye opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>) as well as impaired surface righting and mid-air righting reflexes during the first weeks of life (data not shown).</p>
<p>Protein expression in the somatosensory cortex of adult male and female offspring were examined using quantitative western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c–f</xref>). Consistent with previous findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, we observed a significant increase in NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunits GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B in adult offspring from VPA-treated dams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). By contrast, AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluA2/3 was not altered. We then probed the level of several proteins that localize to glutamatergic and/or GABAergic synapses. We observed a small reduction in GAD65 and a trend to decrease for GAD67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). By contrast, a number of additional synaptic proteins (vGluT1, vGAT, PSD95, Homer1, neuroligin-1) were not altered in adult VPA-offspring. The somatosensory cortex has been implicated in sensory and behavioral alterations associated with autism-spectrum disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, but many other brain regions are thought to contribute to different aspects of the autism phenotype, including the cerebellum, a center for multisensory integration, fine-tuning, and timing of neuronal responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Moreover, the volume of hippocampus and amygdala might be reduced in autistic brains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Notably, under our experimental conditions no equivalent alterations in protein levels were observed in the cerebellum, hippocampus and amygdala of VPA-treated offspring. This indicates that the VPA-induced effects on synaptic proteins are brain area-selective (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1a</xref>).</p>
<p>Some aspects of synaptic pathophysiology might be shared between this environmental insult model and genetic models of ASD. Thus, we next investigated expression of GAD65, GAD67, GluN1, GluN2A, GluN2B and gephyrin in the somatosensory cortex of two monogenic ASD models, Fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMR1) knockout and Neuroligin-3 R451C (NL3 R451C) knock-in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. However, we did not observe a comparable alteration in GAD65, GAD67, GluN2B or gephyrin protein levels in either of two genetic models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1b</xref>). We note that previous studies did report elevation as well as reduction in GAD65/GAD67 protein levels in FMR1 knock-out mice. The divergent findings may be due to difference in age and brain areas analyzed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Interestingly, GluN1 and GluN2A protein levels were increased in the somatosensory cortex of <italic>Nlgn3</italic> R451C mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1b</xref>), providing a parallel to the VPA model. In summary, our results support a differential modification of glutamatergic and GABAergic systems in the somatosensory cortex of adult offspring from VPA-treated mice.</p>
<p>ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests in early postnatal life. Thus, we next examined whether the molecular alterations identified in adult mice are already present at P15-P21, a developmental time period where cortical circuits undergo significant changes in plasticity and maturation. Notably, we found that the extent and nature of molecular alterations differed between developing and adult somatosensory cortex. The GABAergic synaptic proteins GAD65 and GAD67 were more severely reduced in adolescent mice compared to adult. Thus, reduction in GAD65 was subtle in adult offspring from VPA-treated mice but a more marked reduction in adolescent mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). Interestingly, the NMDAR subunits which we observed to be significantly elevated in the adult were unchanged or slightly downregulated in adolescent mice. These observations demonstrate that prenatal VPA-exposure results in a down-regulation of GABAergic presynaptic components in the somatosensory cortex of adolescent mice. In adult mice, these GABAergic changes are somewhat attenuated and a significant up-regulation of NMDA-receptors subunits is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). When separately analyzing protein alterations in male versus female mice we did not observe significant differences in protein levels. However, some changes appeared to be somewhat more robust in male mice. GAD65 was 5.7% reduced in male offspring but no change (−0.9%) in female offspring. GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B were 11.7%, 10.7% and 18.8% increased in male, while 9.7%, 6.9% and 10.4% in female, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1c</xref>). Overall, we noted that the means of protein alterations calculated separately for offspring from each VPA-treated dam showing significant variation (F(11, 46) =3.077 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0055), one-way ANOVA in GluN2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1d,e</xref>). This further supports the notion that for this animal model, individual offspring can not reliably considered as number of experimental replications but rather that average data obtained for each litter should be considered each a single data point.</p>
<p>We further examined expression of inhibitory neuronal cell-type specific markers in the adolescent VPA model. In the neocortex, approximately 70% of GABAergic neurons express either parvalbumin (PV) or calretinin (CR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Notably, immunoblot analyses of lysates from adolescent offspring from VPA-treated dams showed a significant reduction in PV (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; &gt;20% reduced) and Kv3.1, a voltage-gated potassium channel predominantly localized to PV-positive inhibitory neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). These findings represent an interesting parallel to previous reports that the PV-positive area was decreased in somatosensory cortex of FMR1 knockout, NL3 R451C knock-in mice, and VPA-exposed rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. By contrast expression levels of CR were unchanged. Notably, the number of PV-positive interneurons was not altered in somatosensory cortex of the adolescent VPA model mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,d</xref>), indicating that there is no significant difference in the specification and survival of PV-positive neurons but rather an alteration in their maturation. Thus, prenatal VPA exposure leads to disturbed maturation of GABAergic interneurons in adolescent mice. These defects persist into adulthood, though in somewhat attenuated form. By contrast, there is an elevation in NMDAR expression and some other glutamatergic synapse components in the somatosensory cortex of adult mice.</p>

<title>Alteration in presynaptic proteins can be recapitulated <italic>in vitro</italic> by direct treatment of neocortical neurons with VPA</title>
<p>Prenatal VPA exposure and other environmental insults may modify neuronal development either directly through action on the developing neurons or indirectly through systemic effects such as inflammatory processes or cytokine signaling. Thus, we tested whether direct exposure of cultured cortical neurons would result in similar synaptic phenotypes as those observed after <italic>in utero</italic> VPA-exposure. Cultured neocortical neurons isolated at embryonic day 15 (E15) from untreated wild-type mice were exposed to 1.0–2.0 mM VPA for 6 days after plating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Note, that the effective concentration of VPA in plasma level for the treatment of epilepsy is 50–100 μg/ml (0.3–0.6 mM). The fetal plasma level of VPA is estimated to be 1.3–4.6 times higher than the maternal plasma level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Thus, the foetus is thought to be exposed to a VPA concentration of approximately 0.39–2.76 mM. In the neuronal cultures, VPA-containing medium was completely replaced to normal growth medium at DIV6 (day <italic>in vitro</italic> 6), and cells were maintained until DIV15, a time point when neurons are largely differentiated and matured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Notably this <italic>in vitro</italic> VPA exposure had similar effects on the expression of GABAergic markers as observed for adolescent mice that had undergone prenatal VPA exposure. We observed severe reduction in presynaptic proteins GAD65 (38.2%+/−3.1) and slight reduction in GAD67 and vGAT (23.3%+/−3.3, 15.4%+/−4.7 reduced respectively) upon VPA treatment, while the postsynaptic proteins gephyrin and GABARβ3 were not significantly altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Moreover, we observed a dramatic increase in the glutamatergic synaptic vesicle marker vGluT1 in the VPA-treated neurons (&gt;1.8 fold increased) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Interestingly, the effect of VPA on expression of synaptic proteins was dependent on dose, duration and developmental time-point of the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>). Thus, a maximum loss of GAD65 protein was achieved at 2 mM concentration and exposure for 6 days. VPA treatment of cultured neurons during the early developing phase (DIV0-6) resulted in a more severe reduction of GAD65 expression (41.5%+/−3.8 reduction) as compared to treatment at a later stage (DIV9–15) (22.0%+/−1.7 reduction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). These findings indicate that the dysregulation of synaptic proteins observed after <italic>in utero</italic> VPA-exposure can be replicated by direct VPA treatment of cultured neurons. Moreover, the experiments testing VPA effects in younger <italic>versus</italic> more mature cultures reveal that vulnerability of neurons to the VPA-exposure is particularly high during an early developmental period.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Disrupted presynaptic differentiation and E/I balance in <italic>in vitro</italic> VPA model</title>
<p>The alterations in presynaptic protein levels resulting from VPA exposure may represent changes in the number, differentiation, and/or function of synaptic terminals or more general changes in the number of viable neurons in the cortical cultures. To distinguish between these possibilities, we morphologically examined neuronal viability, synaptic differentiation, and maturation in VPA-treated neurons using immunocytochemical markers. Immunostaining for MAP2, a neuron-specific marker, showed no obvious morphological abnormalities between untreated- and VPA-treated neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2a</xref>). There was also no significant difference in the number of both CaMKII-positive glutamatergic and GAD67-positive GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2b,c</xref>). This is consistent with our observation that the number of PV-positive interneurons <italic>in vivo</italic> is not altered in the offspring of VPA-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e,f</xref>).</p>
<p>Immunostaining for vGluT1, vGAT and VAMP2 showed that vGluT1 positive presynaptic area was significantly increased, whereas vGAT positive presynaptic area correspondingly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b,d</xref>; no change in intensity of vGluT1 or vGAT immunoreactivity at individual puncta; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,c,e</xref>). This indicates that the number of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic terminals is altered upon VPA exposure <italic>in vitro</italic>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, we found PV-positive interneurons to be significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). These interneurons include fast-spiking basket cells and chandelier cells, which innervate cell soma, proximal dendrites and axon initiation segments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Consistent with an impairment of this class of cells, the number of perisomatic GAD65-positive puncta was severely decreased in VPA-treated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f–i</xref>). These data suggest that <italic>in vitro</italic> VPA-exposure during early development decreases the number of GABAergic presynaptic boutons and inversely increases the number of glutamatergic presynaptic boutons, thereby potentially leading to a shift in E/I balance.</p>
<p>To directly relate these morphological phenotypes to functional alterations in the neuronal network we performed whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings on VPA-treated and control cultures. We observed a striking increase in spontaneous synaptic network activity after VPA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). To further analyze the functional basis underlying the enhanced network activity, we recorded mEPSCs and mIPSCs in the presence of 0.5 μM TTX. The frequency of mEPSCs was 2.7-fold increased (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), whereas the mIPSCs frequency was decreased to 64% of control (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c–e</xref>). The amplitude of neither mEPSCs nor mIPSCs was significantly affected by VPA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c–e</xref>). Similarly, the decay time constant of mEPSCs and mIPSCs was very similar in control and VPA treated cells (mEPSCs: 3.08 ± 0.28 ms, n = 21 versus 3.08+/−0.29 ms, n = 15, P = 0.992 and mIPSCs: 47.0+/−3.7 ms, n = 22 versus 58.6+/−3.3 ms, n = 19, <italic>P</italic> = 0.026), suggesting that neither density nor subunit composition of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> and AMPA receptors is substantially affected. In combination with the morphological data obtained for the <italic>in vitro</italic> preparations, these findings demonstrate that <italic>in vitro</italic> VPA treatment during early neural development leads to enhanced network activity generated by an imbalance in the number of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections.</p>

<title>VPA treatment and pharmacological HDAC inhibition produce similar alterations in synaptic protein levels</title>
<p>VPA is an inhibitor of HDAC1, 2, 3 and 8<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. To evaluate whether the effect of VPA on synaptic protein levels might rely on HDAC inhibition, we treated cultured neurons with MS275, a selective inhibitor for HDAC1, 2, 3 and 9<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). MS275 treatment resulted in similar synaptic protein expression profiles as those observed with addition of VPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b,c</xref>). Thus, MS275 reduced vGAT, GAD65 and GAD67 expression, whereas it enhanced vGluT1 expression. Notably, also the transcript levels for GAD65 and vGluT1 mRNAs were significantly altered after VPA and MS275 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>), supporting the notion that these drugs modify presynaptic protein expression through a transcription-based mechanism. Notably, vGAT and GAD67 transcripts were not altered upon VPA or MS275 treatment. Thus, the reduction in vGAT and GAD67 protein levels may represent a secondary effect of a VPA-induced epigenetic change.</p>
<p>HDACs are generally thought to repress transcription. Thus, we hypothesize that the elevation in vGlut1 mRNAs is due to a de-repression resulting from the inhibition of HDAC activities. Considering that GAD65 transcription in interneurons has been linked to activity-dependent neuronal signaling and the transcription factor CREB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, we tested whether GAD65 transcripts in VPA-exposed cortical neurons are modified by NMDAR-dependent neuronal activity manipulation. We probed synaptic protein levels in control and VPA exposed cultured neocortical neurons that were treated with the NMDAR antagonist AP5 for 6 days before harvesting. VPA and AP5 individually resulted in a reduction in basal GAD65 protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a–c</xref>). Interestingly, effects were not additive when treatments were combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). At the morphological level, density of GAD65-positive puncta (but not staining intensity) was reduced upon VPA or AP5 treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d–f</xref>). Again, combination of both manipulations (VPA and AP5) did not further reduce puncta density as compared to single drug addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>). These observations provide initial evidence that the reduction in basal GAD65 protein levels observed in VPA-treated cultures may indeed be related to NMDAR-dependent signaling. Finally, the regulated synthesis and release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) represents one potential mechanism of how such NMDAR-dependent signaling may modify GAD65 expression in interneurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Using pharmacological manipulations we find that elevation of BDNF transcripts in response to elevated neuronal network activity is somewhat attenuated in VPA-exposed cortical cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>). These observations are consistent with a role for BDNF in the de-regulation of GAD65 levels in VPA-exposed cells. However, further work will be required to directly test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>In summary, these experiments demonstrate that significant alterations in synaptic components arise at multiple levels. Direct exposure of neurons to VPA or the HDAC inhibitor MS275 elevates expression of some transcripts (including vGluT1). Dysregulation of other transcripts (such as GAD65) is likely a consequence of altered neuronal activity in the VPA-exposed neurons, and other synaptic components are modified only on the protein level.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we systematically investigated the effect of VPA on synaptic properties with biochemical, cell biological and electrophysiological approaches. We demonstrate a differential impact on glutamatergic and GABAergic components in neocortical neurons, which results in a marked functional E/I imbalance in neuronal networks <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>An important conclusion from our experiments is that VPA exposure (either <italic>in utero</italic> or by direct application to cultured neurons) perturbs differentiation in GABAergic interneurons. This perturbation is exhibited by the loss of morphologically recognizable presynaptic terminals in cultured cortical neurons and significant reduction in mIPSC frequency. Thus, there is indeed a loss of functional inhibitory transmission after VPA exposure. In vivo, we observe a similar loss in presynaptic GABAergic markers. Moreover, the reduction in parvalbumin and Kv3.1 protein levels suggest that not only presynaptic markers but also other components are altered in parvalbumin-positive interneurons, a population that encompasses fast-spiking basket and chandelier cells. Whether other interneuron populations are modified remains to be tested experimentally. Our study significantly expands previous work that examined direct exposure of cultured neurons to VPA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Importantly, we specifically focused on exposure of embryonic neurons and used VPA concentrations modeled on dose applicable in human patients to more closely mimic the disease-relevant conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Finally, the functional data from whole-cell recording provide a critical extension of the data for interpreting their impact on neuronal function. Based on our observations we conclude that VPA exposure of embryonic neurons results in a long-lasting hyperexcitable network state.</p>
<p>In addition to the impairment in inhibitory interneuron maturation we identified a gain in glutamatergic synapse development. Comparison of tissue from adolescent and adult mice indicated a developmental shift in glutamatergic components, in particular the NMDAR complex. While NMDAR subunit expression in the adolescent somatosensory cortex of VPA-exposed mice was reduced it was elevated in the adult tissue. Similarly, in cultured cortical neurons NMDAR subunit expression was reduced upon VPA exposure–consistent with the early developmental stage of the cells isolated from embryonic tissue. The reduction in NMDARs might attenuate activity-dependent expression of several neural genes (including BDNF) which may subsequently alter GABAergic differentiation, maturation or functions in VPA-exposed neurons. However, further studies will be needed to clarify such mechanisms.</p>
<p>We observed a significant up-regulation of the presynaptic vesicle component vGluT1 in cultured neurons, a finding consistent with previous studies using VPA exposure of rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. This elevation in vGluT1 was accompanied by an increase in mEPSC frequency, confirming that excitatory synapse function is indeed enhanced by <italic>in vitro</italic> VPA treatment. These observations are consistent with a previous study employing genetic inactivation of HDACs in mouse neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. However, we did not observe a similar elevation in vGluT1 levels in the somatosensory cortices of offspring from VPA-exposed mice. Given that somatosensory neurons receive inputs from several cortical and sub-cortical regions, it is possible that an elevation of glutamatergic synapse function in VPA-exposed animals might be ameliorated by homeostatic regulation during neural development. In fact, a recent study suggests that enhanced NMDAR functions in adolescent VPA mice might be compensated by homeostatic events at later developmental stages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Alternatively, VPA-exposure <italic>in utero</italic> may trigger additional signaling pathways that are not dependent on HDAC inhibition and thereby explain discordance between the observations in the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure conditions.</p>
<p>A striking aspect of the VPA model is that a brief prenatal VPA exposure results in persistent alterations in synaptic proteins and synaptic function. <italic>In utero</italic>, VPA may act directly on fetal neurons but may also have indirect effects such as described for prenatal immune challenges<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. We demonstrate that direct exposure of fetal neurons to VPA <italic>in vitro</italic> replicates several molecular alterations observed in the brains of VPA-exposed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Thus, it is likely that at least some effects of VPA prenatal exposure are due to direct effects on fetal neurons or neuronal precursors rather than additional maternal signaling responses. Considering that another HDAC inhibitor, MS275, recapitulated the altered expression profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), we propose that prenatal VPA impairs E/I balance in the offspring through long-term epigenetic effects by HDAC inhibition.</p>
<p>Using our experimental approach we detected a significant reduction in GABAergic proteins in the somatosensory cortex of VPA model mice but not the cerebellum, hippocampus and amygdala (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1a</xref>). Clearly, the pathophysiology of autism is not restricted to a single brain area and different aspects of the behavioral phenotype are likely to result from alterations in a large number of specific circuits, including circuits for positive/negative valence, learning-related structures, but also multisensory integration. The differential responsiveness to VPA between neuronal cell-types and brain areas observed in our experiments might be explained by temporal differences in their developmental program between brain areas rather than a selective pharmacological effect.</p>
<p>ASD-like behavioral features can be observed upon VPA exposure during early postnatal period<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Indeed, in this study, developmental aberrations in the mice were evidenced by a delay in eye opening and the maturation of righting reflexes. We speculate that timing and dose of prenatal VPA exposure <italic>in vivo</italic> may be critical factors for the increased risk and severity of offsprings developing ASD.</p>
<p>Finally, from analyzing a large number of litters from VPA-exposed pregnant mice we conclude that the VPA treatment model in mice is subject to significant litter-specific effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1d,e</xref>). Thus, great care needs to be taken to use pups from larger numbers of independent litters as experimental replicates, rather than multiple mice from only a small number of litters.</p>
<p>An important conclusion from this study is that neuronal defects arising from prenatal VPA exposure show a significant developmental trajectory. We hypothesize that the prenatal insult results in a long-lasting epigenetic change in some synaptic target genes which then precipitates a number of transcriptional and post-transcriptional alterations–some of them due to altered neuronal activity in the developing circuits. NMDA-receptor subunit expression switches from reduced expression in adolescent mice to elevated expression in the adult. Notably, NMDAR dysfunction may indeed be an important parameter for the pathophysiology as pharmacological manipulation of NMDARs does indeed modify behavioral phenotypes in the VPA rat model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>.</p>
<p>Our analysis highlights an early de-regulation of GABAergic proteins and GABAergic transmission in adolescent VPA offspring that is somewhat attenuated in the adult. Dysregulation of GABAergic inhibitory circuits has been implicated in the onset of neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. GABAergic axons in postmortem brains from ASD patients display a marked decrease in GAD proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> and defects in GABAergic inhibitory systems have been reported for several rodent ASD models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Disruption of GABAergic neurons during early postnatal phase may strongly influence critical period plasticity, an experience-dependent circuit refinement during the early postnatal phase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Therefore, we speculate that disruption of GABAergic neurons (including the PV-positive populations) by <italic>in utero</italic> VPA exposure may represent a primary insult responsible for the neuronal dysfunction in this autism model. These developmental aspects highlight the importance for tailoring treatment approaches and the timing of interventions to maximize their efficacy in this developmental disorder.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry, image acquisition and analysis</title>
<p>Cultured neurons were fixed with ice-cold fixative (4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) for 20 min.
