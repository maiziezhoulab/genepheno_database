<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Heterogeneity is a fundamental feature of complex phenotypes. So far, genomic screenings have profiled thousands of samples providing insights into the transcriptome of the cell. However, disentangling the heterogeneity of these transcriptomic Big Data to identify defective biological processes remains challenging. Here we present GSECA, a method exploiting the bimodal behavior of RNA-sequencing gene expression profiles to identify altered gene sets in heterogeneous patient cohorts. Using simulated and experimental RNA-sequencing data sets, we show that GSECA provides higher performances than other available algorithms in detecting truly altered biological processes in large cohorts. Applied to 5941 samples from 14 different cancer types, GSECA correctly identified the alteration of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway driven by the somatic loss of PTEN and verified the emerging role of PTEN in modulating immune-related processes. In particular, we showed that, in prostate cancer, PTEN loss appears to establish an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through the activation of STAT3, and low PTEN expression levels have a detrimental impact on patient disease-free survival.

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>In recent years, genomic screenings have studied RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) expression profiles of large cohorts to gain insights into complex phenotypes, including cancer. Despite the abundance of expression data, it remains challenging to identify the biological processes that control disease progression. A major hurdle is the presence of inter-sample heterogeneity (IH), or the variable expression of genes across samples due to genetic, environmental, demographic, and technical factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Furthermore, the admixture of different cell types in the sequenced sample is a well-known source of heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). As the number of samples or the complexity of the phenotype grows, the confounding role of IH in detecting relevant biological information increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). As a consequence of IH, genes can be expressed at different levels in distinct samples. Specific genes can be activated and repressed in different subpopulations rather than being concordantly expressed in the whole population. Overall, these coordinated heterogeneous changes can result in small expression differences in the whole population that are difficult to detect, especially in large cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Moreover, it is well-known that complex phenotypes arise from subtle alterations of distinct genes sharing common functions or involved in the same biological process (i.e. gene sets) in different patients affected by the same condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p>
<p>In diseases such cancer, heterogeneity strongly impacts on disease progression and drug response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Therefore, dissecting the contribution of IH on gene expression becomes crucial to detect defective biological processes and to the therapy management of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). This issue has recently begun to be exploited with single cell analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Nevertheless, ‘bulk’ methods of RNA-seq remain the conventional approach to measure gene expression for the advantages of time, cost, and standardized data processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Currently, novel insights on complex phenotypes can be obtained from analyses of the growing public repository of genomic Big Data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In this view, the concept of ‘pathway’ rather than ‘single gene’ alteration has become widely employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Gene set analysis (GSA) aims at identifying gene sets whose cumulative expression is altered in the phenotype of interest. During the last years, several GSA methods using different statistical tests and null hypothesis formulation have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11–15</xref>). In particular, GSA algorithms can be divided into ‘self-contained’ and ‘competitive’ algorithms depending on whether they identify altered gene sets (AGSs) while ignoring or not genes that are outside the gene set of interest, with the former being more powerful than the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p>
<p>Most existing GSA methods suffer a few marked limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Firstly, GSA algorithms have been designed to handle microarray expression data and subsequently adopted to handle RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). RNA-seq gene expression profiles are characterized by a bimodal behavior reflecting the presence of two major subpopulations of genes in cells (i.e. lowly and highly expressed genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). This behavior is not observable using low-sensitive microarray experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and to date it has not been taken into account by existing GSA methods. Thus, their application to RNA-seq expression profiles may not be efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Secondly, GSA methods have been developed to handle experimental conditions in the absence of IH (i.e. altered genes are concordantly activated or repressed in the cohort of interest) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). As a consequence, biological processes composed of genes that exhibit a significant excess of coordinated variability (i.e. activated or repressed in different subpopulations) cannot be detected by conventional GSA methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Finally, most existing GSA methods have been designed to assess gene expression of case–control studies with limited sample size and, thus, characterized by a negligible IH and high signal-to-noise ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). These limitations become crucial in the analysis of RNA-seq datasets of large-scale screening projects that are characterized by a high IH. Therefore, GSA algorithms that are able to handle IH are needed. To date, few studies carried out a comprehensive analysis of the performance of GSA methods on high-volume RNA-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p>
<p>Nowadays, Big Data analysis employs machine learning approaches to assess the contribution of data heterogeneity. It has been recently shown that the division of numerical features into a limited number of non-overlapped intervals (i.e. data discretization, DD) improves the accuracy of such algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21–23</xref>). In computational biology, the DD approach has been used to explore gene regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and, as a pre-processing step, to improve classification accuracy using microarray data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Here, we present a Gene Set Enrichment Class Analysis (GSECA) algorithm to identify AGSs in heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets. GSECA implements a sample-specific finite mixture modeling (FMM) approach to assess the bimodal distribution of each RNA-seq profile followed by a model-based DD process to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Discretized data are then evaluated in a statistical framework to detect AGSs between two groups of samples. We showed that GSECA has the highest sensitivity and specificity in detecting AGSs as compared to other ‘state-of-the-art’ GSA algorithms in the presence of IH on both simulated and real RNA-seq data. We developed a GSECA as a user-friendly R/Shiny application freely available from GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/matteocereda/GSECA">https://github.com/matteocereda/GSECA</ext-link>).</p>

To estimate the parameters <italic>μ</italic> and <italic>σ</italic> of the two components the method applies the Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The algorithm runs iteratively until the maximum likelihood of the parameters of the two components is reached. To ensure a consistent subdivision with the overall expression profile an additional heuristic step was implemented. In particular, GSECA requires the mean of the first component (i.e. highly expressed genes) to be greater than the mean of the second one (i.e. lowly expressed genes). The EM step is repeated until the condition is satisfied. Besides providing an estimate of the Gaussian components, the mixture model calculates the posterior probabilities τ of the component membership of the mixture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Thus, GSECA measures the probabilities τ<sub>1</sub> and τ<sub>2</sub> of each gene to belong to the two distributions defined by the two components.</p>

<sec id="SEC2-2">
<title>Definition of expression classes</title>
<p>For each sample, genes are considered as (i) not expressed (NE), or not detected, if their expression level (i.e. FPKM) is smaller than 0.01; (ii) lowly expressed (LE) if the probability τ<sub>2</sub> of belonging to the second component of the mixture is greater than 0.9; (iii) highly expressed (HE) if the probability τ<sub>1</sub> of belonging to the first component is greater than 0.9; or (iv) medium expressed (ME) if both the probabilities τ<sub>1</sub> and τ<sub>2</sub> are &lt;0.9. To ensure an adequate distribution of genes among expression classes (ECs), thus a similar degree of statistical power for the subsequent tests performed for all classes, and retain as much information from the original continuous attribute as possible, HE genes are further divided accordingly to the percentiles of the expression level distribution defined by the first Gaussian component (see Supplementary Notes). In particular, for each sample, HE genes were assigned to (i) the first class of high expression (HE1) if their expression level is less than or equal to the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile of the distribution of HE genes; (ii) the second class of high expression (HE2) if their expression level ranges between the 25<sup>th</sup> and the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile; (iii) the third class of high expression (HE3) if their expression level falls between the 50<sup>th</sup> and the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile; or (iv) the fourth class of high expression (HE4) if their expression level is greater than or equal to the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile.</p>

The algorithm proceeds through three sequential steps: (i) the sample-specific finite mixture modeling of gene expression distribution; (ii<italic>)</italic> the sample-specific discretization of expression values into seven categorical expression classes and (iii) the statistical identification of altered gene sets (AGSs) obtained by comparing the cumulative proportion of genes of a gene set in each EC between the two cohorts using a Fisher's exact test. The expression perturbation is summarized into an association score (AS), corrected with two bootstrapping procedures for false discoveries (empirical <italic>P</italic>-value) and different sample sizes of the cohorts (success rate, SR). The AGSs are visualized as EC maps. The EC maps display the difference of the cumulative proportion of the genes of a gene set in the seven ECs between the two cohorts as triangles, whose sizes are proportional to such difference. The upper and the lower vertex of the triangles represent enrichment and depletion in cohort A as compared to B, respectively. EC maps depict the proportion <italic>N</italic> of genes in the gene set in each EC as grey bars. GSECA orders AGSs accordingly to their AS, thus obtaining the list of the most altered processes associated with the phenotype of interest.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="SEC3-1">
<title>Method overview</title>
<p>We designed GSECA as ‘model-based’ data discretization (MDD) approach fulfilling both a biological and a ‘statistical’ requirement. First, we required that the division of expression values into expression classes (ECs) must resemble the presence of two major subpopulations of lowly and highly expressed genes in the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) (i.e. biological requirement). Second, we considered that the discretization process must provide an adequate distribution of genes among classes and, thus, ensure a similar degree of statistical power for the subsequent tests performed for all ECs (i.e. statistical requirement).</p>
<p>To identify AGSs in a list of gene sets <italic>G =</italic> {<italic>G</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>…,G</italic><sub>n</sub>} between two cohorts <italic>A =</italic> {<italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>…, a</italic><sub>n</sub>} and <italic>B =</italic> {<italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>…, b</italic><sub>n</sub>} of heterogeneous RNA-seq expression profiles, GSECA runs through three sequential steps: (i) the sample-specific analysis of gene expression distribution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Step 1), (ii) the discretization of expression values into ECs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Step 2) and (iii) the statistical identification of AGSs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Step 3). The method is based on a null hypothesis of no overrepresentation of genes in the gene set in any EC between two cohorts (see Materials and Methods). To increase the signal-to-noise ratio GSECA converts the continuous measurements of expression level into discrete values. For each sample of the cohorts, the algorithm identifies the two subpopulations of lowly and highly expressed genes by fitting a two-component FMM on the normalized expression levels of all protein-coding genes as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, step 1, see Materials and Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Notes and</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Using the information derived from the FMM, GSECA defines seven categorical ECs and assigns each gene to the corresponding EC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, step 2, see Materials and Methods). Seven is the minimum number of classes that (i) ensures the minimal information loss between the discrete and continuous expression profiles and (ii) provides an adequate distribution of genes among classes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Notes and</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S2 and S3</xref>). Finally, GSECA implements a statistical framework to measure the perturbation of each EC between the two cohorts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Step 3). The purpose of GSECA is to evaluate whether the expression pattern of the genes in a gene set shows a significant displacement across the ECs in the samples of interest as compared to controls, thus suggesting a causal relationship between the condition and the phenotype. To quantify the extent of expression perturbation across the ECs for all gene sets, the algorithm combines the significance level of each comparison into an association score (AS) using the Fisher's method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). To reduce false positives discoveries and correct for a different sample size of the cohorts, GSECA implements two bootstrapping procedures measuring the empirical <italic>P</italic>-value (<italic>p</italic><sub>emp</sub>) and the success rate (SR) of each AS.</p>
<p>We designed GSECA to provide the user with a graphical overview of the variation of expression of each gene set across the seven classes between the two cohorts. GSECA visualizes the AGSs as a heatmap, namely expression class maps (i.e. EC maps), depicting the variation of expression across the seven ECs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p>

<title>Performance evaluation</title>
<p>To evaluate the performance of GSECA in detecting AGSs we employed simulated and real data sets. For each analysis, we compared GSECA results with those of seven different ‘state-of-art’ methods (i.e. GSEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), GSVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), ssGSEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), <italic>Z</italic>-Score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), PLAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), ROAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) and Globaltest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>)) that, even if designed to treat microarray data, are widely used in the scientific community to analyze RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="SEC3-3">
<title>Type I error rate and statistical power evaluation</title>
<p>In real-life systems, genes are differentially expressed with a certain degree of fold change (FC) and dispersion (i.e. a measure of IH) between two groups of samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). GSECA has been developed to dissect the contribution of IH, and thus of dispersion, in large cohorts of samples and detect the truly AGSs. To understand how well the algorithm achieves this aim, we first evaluated its type I error rate and statistical power as compared to the other GSA approaches using simulated RNA-seq data under different parameter settings.</p>
<p>To measure the type I error rate, we generated read counts for <italic>N</italic> samples and 1000 gene sets of equal size <italic>P</italic> in the condition of no differential expression as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Then, for each gene set, we tested the null hypothesis of no difference between the two cohorts (see Supplementary Notes). To examine the effects of sample and gene set sizes, we ran the analysis under different parameter settings of <italic>N</italic> (60, 150, 300, 500) and <italic>P</italic> (25, 50, 100, 300), repeating the analysis ten times to obtain more stable results. GSECA resulted in being the most conservative approach, with the lowest type I error rate (average median = 0.002) as compared to the other approaches (average median = 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The conservativeness of GSECA is due to the conservativeness of the Fisher's Exact test (FET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>) that are combined into the AS (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Notes and</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Each FET depends on to the cumulative number of genes in the gene set in the EC across samples of the cohorts (see Materials and Methods). As the sample size grows, the ability of the test to detect a small variation with high specificity and sensitivity increases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4A and B</xref>). As a consequence, combining conservative FET <italic>P</italic>-values using a logarithmic scale (i.e. Fisher's Method) results in small ASs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4C</xref>). For this reason, GSECA accounts for false positives better than the other GSA algorithms. Furthermore, GSECA specificity was not influenced by the sample and gene set sizes, remaining constant even in case of large cohorts and large gene sets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To assess the statistical power of each algorithm (i.e. the likelihood to detect an AGS when the gene set is altered) we implemented two independent simulations, namely ‘FC’ and ‘dispersion’ studies, modelling the contribution of fold and dispersion changes, respectively, in gene expression between two cohorts. In doing so, we first defined three parameters: (i) the proportion of gene sets that contains differentially expressed (DE) genes β, (ii) the percentage of DE genes in each gene set γ and (iii) the FC in gene counts between the two cohorts (iv). Then, we introduced a scaling factor <italic>D</italic> to control the estimated dispersion in gene counts (see Supplementary Notes). For both studies, we modeled eight conditions where, out of 1000 gene sets, the fractions of truly AGSs β (i.e. true positives) was equal to 5% and 25% and the percentage of DE genes in each gene set was set at 25% and 50% for relatively small and large gene set sizes (<italic>P</italic> = {25,100}). For the FC study, we selected FC values ranging between 1.5 and 3 without changes in the estimated dispersion (<italic>D</italic> = 1), thus simulating a differential expression driven by homogeneous changes across samples. Conversely, for the dispersion study, we let <italic>D</italic> vary between 1.5 and 10 allowing small, or no, FC changes between cohorts (FC = {1,1.1,1.25}), modelling expression changes driven by IH. Under these conditions, we generated read counts for <italic>N</italic> samples divided into two groups. For each group, we constructed 1000 gene sets composed from <italic>P</italic> random realizations of negative binomial distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) (see Supplementary Notes). For each gene set, we assessed power by testing the null hypothesis of no differential expression between cohorts for all methods. To account for the different specificity of GSA methods, we measured the F1 score, a performance evaluation metric that provides a harmonic mean of the precision and sensitivity in case of an uneven distribution of true and false positives (i.e. truly AGSs and invariant gene sets, respectively) for all simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>).</p>
<p>In presence of FC differences between cohorts (i.e. homogeneous changes across samples), the statistical power of GSECA increased with sample sizes and FC values without being affected by the gene set size and changes in the percentage of DE genes in the gene set (i.e. β and γ, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). In particular, GSECA showed a power, or sensitivity, higher than 70% for medium and large sample sizes (<italic>N</italic> ≥ 150) under different parameter settings, similar to those of the other self-contained approaches (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Conversely, for small sample size (<italic>N</italic> = 60), other GSA methods show a higher power than GSECA. Overall, we noticed that GSECA predictions showed a better tradeoff between precision and sensitivity (<italic>F</italic>1 score &gt; 0.7) than all other methods even for subtle changes in gene expression for small gene set sizes (i.e. β = 0.05 and <italic>P</italic> = 25, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>), reflecting the high specificity of GSECA in detecting truly AGSs.</p>
<p>GSECA outperformed other GSA methods in case of IH, and negligible FC, in gene expression between groups (i.e. heterogeneous changes across samples, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>). In particular, its statistical power grew exponentially with the dispersion parameter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). For small sample sizes (i.e. <italic>N</italic> = 60), none of the algorithms achieved considerable power. GSECA sensitivity increased with sample size whereas the power of all other approaches was almost unaffected with values &lt;70%. Even to a lesser extent, ssGSEA performed similarly to GSECA in handling heterogeneity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Comparably to GSECA DD approach, ssGSEA brings expression profiles to a common scale collapsing the range of possible gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In doing so, ssGSEA reduces the noise of IH (i.e. genes with similar expression levels will have the same rank) increasing its power to detect truly AGSs. GSECA achieved the highest F1 scores, underlining its high sensitivity and specificity in case of heterogeneous gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>). These results did not considerably change for small variation of FC values or with gene set sizes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, GSECA has a high sensitivity, proper of self-contained tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>), of identifying truly AGSs in presence of FC variations between cohorts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>, left panel). Most importantly, GSECA is the most powerful GSA approach, among the tested ones, to treat dispersion, and thus IH, in gene expression between phenotypes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>, right panel). The results of the simulation studies show that the performances of GSECA are enhanced in case of large cohorts (i.e. <italic>N</italic> ≥ 150, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). The statistical power of GSECA increased with sample size as a consequence of the DD, where it is expected that small sample sizes might be not sufficient to estimate the correct distribution of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Notes and</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4D</xref>). When the IH noise between cohorts is negligible and the cohort size is small, GSECA requires strong FC differences to reach adequate power. GSECA showed the best performance to identify AGSs between heterogeneous cohorts even in presence of overlapping gene sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Notes and</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification of AGSs in PTEN loss prostate adenocarcinomas</title>
<p>To evaluate the performance of GSECA on real data we simulated a condition where known deregulation of a biological process was expected. In particular, a frequently occurring event in prostate cancer is the loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>) that results in the alteration of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>) and promotes oncogenic programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). Among the first ten top-ranked primary interactors of PTEN in the STRING protein-protein interaction (PPI) network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>), nine genes are involved in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway accordingly to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9A</xref>). Indeed, gene ontology based on the STRING PPI network revealed the enrichment for genes in PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p>
<p>In view of the above, we hypothesized that stratifying human prostate adenocarcinomas (PRADs) accordingly to the somatic loss of PTEN could reveal the altered modulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, we collected genomic data of 498 PRAD samples available from TCGA and divided them into PTEN loss (PTEN-loss) and wild-type (PTEN-wt) tumors accordingly to somatic mutations and/or copy number alterations in PTEN as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) (see Supplementary Notes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9B</xref>). Using RNA-seq and protein data we measured a significant (i) lower expression of PTEN, (ii) altered modulation of PI3K/AKT genes and (iii) higher phosphorylation level of AKT1 in PTEN-loss tumors compared to PTEN-wt ones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9C-E</xref>, <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, two-tailed ranked Wilcoxon test). These results show that the sample stratification led to a dataset characterized by a significantly altered regulation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.</p>
<p>We next evaluated the level of IH of the cohorts reflected in the RNA-seq data. Using correlation analyses we found that on average 64% of samples had a low similarity of expression patterns with the others (Pearson's Correlation Coefficient &lt; 0.75, Supplementary Notes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9F and G</xref>), confirming the presence of IH in the dataset. To further characterize IH, we measured the FC and dispersion of FPKM values for 19663 protein-coding genes between PTEN-loss and PTEN-wt samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). We found that 56% of genes showed a reduced expression upon PTEN loss, which was reflected in the higher number of down-regulated genes (<italic>n</italic> = 631) than up-regulated ones (<italic>n</italic> = 325, see Materials and Methods). Furthermore, out of 4830 genes with a high level of dispersion (i.e. ≥75<sup>th</sup> percentile of the dispersion distribution), 29% were activated (i.e. FC ≥ 75<sup>th</sup> percentile of the FC distribution) and 48% repressed (i.e. FC ≤ 25<sup>th</sup> percentile of the FC distribution). These findings highlight a general reduction of expression characterized by IH in the PTEN-loss cohort. This might be a possible consequence of the role of PTEN in regulating basal transcription through histones and chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To assess the effect of PTEN loss on cellular processes, we applied GSECA on a list of 158 KEGG gene sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). We found that the fraction of genes in the gene sets reflected the landscape of FC and dispersion values of the cohorts, with the highest proportion of genes being repressed and dispersed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). In particular, 15% of genes in PI3K/AKT signaling pathway were repressed and highly dispersed, suggesting variable repression of PI3K/AKT genes across patients upon the somatic loss of PTEN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p>
<p>For each sample, GSECA implemented the FMM approach to model the normal distribution of lowly and highly expressed genes, referred to as ‘first’ and ‘second’ components, respectively. As expected, the kernel density distributions (KDDs) of the FPKM values displayed the bimodal profile underlining the presence of the two subpopulations of expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and visually presented different profiles reflecting the presence of outlier samples in the cohorts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess whether the FMM depicted PRAD IH, we compared the component parameters (i.e. μ, σ, and λ) between the cohorts. Even if showing the same μ, the average σ of the first component (i.e. lowly expressed genes) was significantly higher in PTEN-loss samples as compared to PTEN-wt ones (<italic>P</italic>-value = 0.031, two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, left panels), suggesting that PTEN-loss are more heterogeneous at low levels of expression (i.e. distinct lowly expressed genes in different patients) as compared to PTEN-wt samples. Inspecting the second component (i.e. highly expressed genes), we found that, on average, μ was significantly higher in PTEN-loss as compared to PTEN-wt samples (<italic>P</italic>-value = 0.003, two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) whereas σ did not differ between the cohorts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, right panels). These results confirmed that IH is less pronounced for high expressed genes than lowly expressed ones in PTEN-loss tumors. Finally, comparing the mixing proportions λ we found, on average, a significantly higher number of genes assigned to the first component (i.e. lowly expressed) in PTEN-loss as compared to PTEN-wt samples (<italic>P</italic>-value = 0.001, two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, left bottom panel). These results indicate that the FMM fully captures the features of the expression landscape of the cohorts resulting in a higher degree of IH at low expression levels upon PTEN loss.</p>
<p>Next, GSECA applied the DD process and clustered genes into the seven ECs for each sample of the two cohorts. We compared the distribution of the proportion of genes in each EC and found a significant increase and reduction of genes in the LE class (Bonferroni adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.016, two-sided Wilcoxon test) and in the four HE classes, respectively, in PTEN-loss samples as compared to wild-type ones (Bonferroni adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.021, two-sided Wilcoxon test, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>), reflecting the differences detected by the FMM. This result confirmed that the DD process preserves the structure of the expression dataset.</p>
<p>Then, GSECA compared the fraction of genes in each of the seven classes between PTEN-loss and PTEN-wt samples in the 158 KEGG gene sets. For each gene set, we determined the enrichment or depletion of samples with genes in each EC and corrected this for multiple tests. Furthermore, for all gene sets GSECA provided the AS, the associated empirical <italic>P</italic>-value to avoid false discoveries, and the SR controlling for the different sizes of the two cohorts (see Materials and Methods). We found that 21 out of 158 KEGG gene set were significantly altered in PTEN-loss as compared to wild-type samples (AS ≤ 0.01, <italic>p</italic><sub>emp</sub> ≤ 0.001 and SR ≥ 0.9, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Among these gene sets, GSECA identified the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway as the second top-ranked AGSs, showing a significant increase in the number of samples expressing genes in the LE, ME, and HE1 classes and a significant decrease in the HE2 and HE3 classes (FDR &lt; 0.1, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>), supporting the presence of high IH for PIK/AKT genes at low level of expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Among the remaining AGSs, GSECA identified five gene sets of signal transduction (i.e. calcium signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), MAPK and WNT signaling pathway) that are tightly connected with PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In particular, PTEN silencing, and the subsequent alteration of PI3K/AKT pathway, impairs calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>), alters epithelial CAMs and focal adhesion gene expression in prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>), alters MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>) and WNT signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>). Furthermore, GSECA detected the alteration of five immune-related processes (i.e. hematopoietic cell lineage, chemokine signaling pathway, B and T cell receptor signaling, FC gamma R mediated phagocytosis), supporting the role of PTEN in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>), controlling signaling and homeostasis in both B and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>), and inhibiting FC gamma receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>), as well as the role of PI3K/AKT pathway in the regulation of chemokine signaling during prostate tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>). Finally, GSECA highlighted the alteration of nine metabolic pathways (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>), underlining the contribution of PTEN in metabolism control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>). GSECA also identified the alteration of cardiac muscle contraction and aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption gene sets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). It is worth noting that the down-regulation of PTEN decreases heart muscle contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>) and the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway might be responsible for the alteration of aldosterone-mediated sodium transport in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>).</p>
<p>These results indicate that the FM modelling of RNA-seq expression profiles, the sample-specific DD process and the statistical framework implemented in GSECA can successfully identify known altered biological processes (i.e. PI3K/AKT signaling pathway) in a phenotype of interest (i.e. PTEN somatic loss) considering datasets characterized by IH.</p>

<sec id="SEC3-5">
<title>Comparison with available GSA algorithms</title>
<p>We next compared the performances of GSECA in detecting AGSs in PRAD samples upon the somatic loss of PTEN with those of the other GSA methods. Since these methods were not designed to work with an unbalanced sample size between two cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), we measured the success rate of each comparison using bootstrap simulations as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) (see Materials and Methods). We found that <italic>Z</italic>-Score, PLAGE, ssGSEA identified an average of 20 AGSs, comparably to GSECA, whereas GSVA identified 41 AGSs, and ROAST and GSEA detected only one AGS (adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.1, SR &gt; 0.9, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). To assess the concordance of results among methods, we measured the proportion of shared AGSs over the total number of unique AGSs between any couple of algorithms (i.e. Jaccard Coefficient, JC). Overall, the similarity of results among methods was low (mean JC = 12%). GSECA identified four AGSs that were not detected by any other methods (i.e. T and B cell receptor signaling pathway and steroid hormone biosynthesis) and showed the higher concordance of results with ssGSEA (JC = 19%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>). The weak concordance of results among different GSA algorithms has been previously reported as a consequence of the distinct statistical assumptions of each method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Thus, the number and the type of algorithm-specific AGSs might reflect the ability of a method to handle the IH of a complex dataset.</p>

</fig>
<p>To evaluate the biological reliability of the information provided by each method, we compared GSA results with those of orthogonal approaches. In doing so, we first selected the ten top-ranked AGSs identified by each algorithm and hierarchically clustered their rankings. Next, we performed gene ontology (GO) analyses using the STRING PPI network and the differentially expressed genes in PTEN-loss as compared to PTEN-wt tumors. Finally, we integrated GSA and GO results with a text mining analysis of published articles exploring the connection of PTEN with the selected AGSs (see Materials and Methods). The hierarchical clustering of AGSs highlighted the presence of five groups composed by gene sets that were (i) mainly identified by GSECA and Globaltest (G1); (ii) generally detected by different methods (G2) and (iii) exclusively marked by methods other than GSECA (G3, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Remarkably, GSECA was the only algorithm able to detect, the alteration of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway as a top-ranking result. We found that G1 contains 75% of gene sets enriched from the STRING PPI gene ontology, suggesting the highest ability of GSECA in detecting gene sets that are functionally related to the somatic loss of PTEN as compared to the other methods (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Considering differentially expressed genes, we found that five out of the eight gene sets enriched for significantly up- and down-regulated genes were detected by GSECA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, column ‘DEG’). The GO analysis revealed enrichment of PI3K/AKT genes only when we considered significantly activated and repressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). The fact that GSECA was the only algorithm able to identify this gene set as top-ranked AGSs suggests its ability in identifying processes where genes are significantly altered in both directions rather than being either activated or repressed. Finally, four out of the ten top-ranked GSECA AGSs showed published evidence (≥9) for the interaction of PTEN with the gene set, with the highest number of articles (n = 499) supporting PTEN regulation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, right column and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Conversely, we found few published records (mean = 4) supporting the interaction of PTEN with AGSs that were detected by other methods (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). In particular, AGSs that were exclusively marked by methods other than GSECA did not show any supports from GO and text mining results, with the only exception of the pentose phosphate pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Overall, GSECA was the only algorithm able to identify the altered modulation of PI3K/AKT pathway and of other known and functionally related processes in a real dataset characterized by IH. We further evaluated the degree of these algorithms to handle the heterogeneity of PRAD dataset assessing (i) the minimum number of samples required to detect alterations of the ten top-ranked GSECA results and (ii) how the stratification of samples according to PTEN expression levels affected the results (see Supplementary Notes). Using simulation studies, we found that GSECA achieves the best results in identifying the alteration of PI3K/AKT genes at the increase of IH (i.e. smaller cohort sizes or less stringent PTEN stratification, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S11 and S12 and Table S6</xref>).</p>
<p>To gain further insights into the reasons why GSECA outperformed the other algorithms in detecting the alteration of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway upon PTEN loss, we analyzed the gene expression levels of the 20 top-ranked gene sets of each method independently from their statistical significance. As mentioned above, a consistent fraction of PI3K/AKT genes is down-regulated in a highly variable manner across samples upon PTEN somatic loss (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S13A</xref>). Hence, to detect the alteration of this gene set, GSA methods must handle ‘coordinated’ expression changes (i.e. activation or repression) of distinct genes in different samples even if they can also result in small FC differences in the whole population. Therefore, we first inspected the distribution of expression levels of genes in each gene set across PRAD samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S13B</xref>). GSECA, ssGSEA and Globaltest detected gene sets predominantly composed by genes expressed at both low and high levels (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Notes and</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S13B</xref>). Conversely, the other algorithms detected gene sets predominately composed of highly expressed genes, suggesting that they might be not effective in detecting changes of lowly expressed genes. This held particularly true for GSEA whose KDDs showed the strongest shift towards high expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S13B</xref>).</p>
<p>To corroborate these findings, we assessed four parameters (i.e. FPKM values, FC, absolute FC and dispersion, see Supplementary Notes) measuring the range, direction, intensity, and IH of gene expression captured as altered by each method. In particular, we evaluated the mean μ and standard deviation σ of each parameter across PRAD samples and, then, averaged results across genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S13C</xref>). Overall, GSECA showed the best results in handling gene sets characterized by expression changes of groups of genes that are more intensively activated or repressed (i.e. direction and intensity, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S14</xref>) at all levels (i.e. range) in a heterogeneous manner across samples (i.e. IH, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). For this reason, GSECA was able to detect the altered modulation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway that is composed of genes that are expressed at different levels (<italic>i.e</italic>. low and high) and are distinctly activated or repressed in different samples upon PTEN loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S13B and C</xref>). It is worth noting that Globaltest performed similarly to GSECA. However, the highest type I error (i.e. 119 AGSs out of 158 gene sets, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) confers less confidence to the results (i.e. PI3K/AKT signaling pathway rank = 69, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Remarkably, our analyses show that other methods, particularly GSEA, cannot handle datasets characterized by high IH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S13C</xref>).</p>
<p>These results show that GSECA can detect functionally relevant altered biological processes under a phenotype of interest when considering more heterogeneous cohorts in contrast to other available methods.</p>

<title>The somatic loss of PTEN impacts on immune-related processes</title>
<p>Somatic inactivation of PTEN occurs in a wide range of human cancers with various effects on each tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>). For this reason, we employed GSECA to perform a comprehensive analysis of biological processes that are altered upon the loss of PTEN across cancer types. In particular, we collected genomic data of 9944 samples of 31 cancer type available from TCGA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>) and stratified them with respect to somatic alterations in PTEN as described for the PRAD cohort. Together with PRAD, we retained for further analyses 13 cancer types for which we could identify at least 30 samples with somatic alteration of PTEN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). As expected, we measured a significant decrease in PTEN expression levels in PTEN-loss samples as compared to wild-type ones (<italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, one-tailed Wilcoxon Rank sum test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S15A</xref>), leading to a significant alteration of expression pattern of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), low grade glioma (LGG), skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) and sarcoma (SARC) (<italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, two-tailed Wilcoxon Rank sum test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S15B</xref>). Using GSECA, we discretized the gene expression levels into the ECs and found a significant alteration of the number of genes in the ECs between PTEN-loss and PTEN-wt samples in UCEC, LGG, SKCM, lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) and kidney chromophobe (KICH, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S16 and S17</xref>), suggesting a possible regulation of transcriptional programs driven by PTEN in these tissues. We next compared the fraction of genes in the ECs between PTEN-loss and PTEN-wt samples in the list of 158 KEGG gene sets looking for significant differences. We found that 10 out of 13 cancer types showed at least one AGS (AS ≤ 0.05, <italic>p</italic><sub>emp</sub> ≤ 0.05 and SR ≥ 0.7, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). Importantly, six cancer types (i.e. UCEC, LGG, HNSC, SARC, PRAD and BRCA) showed the significant alteration of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway expression pattern (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Indeed, GSECA AS showed a significant positive correlation with the extent of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway alteration, which was measured as the statistical difference in the cumulative expression of PI3K/AKT related genes in PTEN-loss tumors as compared to wild-type samples (two-tailed Wilcoxon Rank sum test, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). To further assess whether the AS exploits the alteration of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, we employed a linear regression approach. In particular, we modeled the AS distribution across cancer types as a function of the alteration of both PTEN and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway expression levels, the number of PTEN-loss samples, and the correlation of expression profiles in PTEN-loss and PTEN-wt tumors (see Materials and Methods). We then performed an exhaustive search for the best subsets of variables for predicting the variability of the AS distributions using a branch-and-bound algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) (see Materials and Methods). We found that the alteration of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway gave the best fitting of the AS distributions in terms of coefficient of determination when using one predictor (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.81, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Increasing the model complexity led to a closer fitting between the AS distributions and the predictors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). We next measured the relative importance of each regressor in the linear model using the averaging over ordering method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) (see Materials and Methods). We found that even considering all variables in the model the alteration of expression of the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade was the most critical regressor accounting for 80% of the explained variance by the model (<italic>P</italic>-value = 0.009, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). These results indicate that GSECA AS recapitulate the extent of PI3K/AKT cascade alteration. Furthermore, GSECA identified PI3K/AKT signaling pathway as altered in two cancer types (i.e. UCEC and LGG) for which the alteration of PI3K/AKT signature is known to impact on patient survival in positive and negative way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>). The survival analysis based on PTEN loss stratification in UCEC and LGG confirmed these results, reinforcing the robustness of GSECA prediction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Notes and</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S18A</xref>).</p>

<p>To gain functional insights on the cancer-specific regulation of PTEN, we next inspected the 10 top-ranked AGSs in each cancer type and hierarchically clustered them at an intermediate KEGG gene set category level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>). We found that (i) metabolic processes were explicitly altered in distinct cancer types, (ii) information-related processes were altered among different tumor types, and, importantly, (iii) immune system gene sets were altered in the majority of tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). In particular, SARC, KICH and SKCM showed the highest number of immune-related AGSs, being hematopoietic cell lineage, chemokine and T cell receptor signaling pathways the most altered gene sets across cancer types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S9</xref>). These results highlight the association between the loss of PTEN and the alteration of immune cell infiltrates, which has been recently noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). To verify the accuracy of the results of GSECA, we performed two different analyses. First, we compared the results of the other GSA methods on the immune-related gene sets. Second, we evaluated the changes in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) upon the loss of PTEN. For the latter analysis, we collected information about the cellular composition of immune infiltrates for TGCA tumors of 14 cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>) and statistically measured the differences in the composition of 22 distinct immune cell types between PTEN-loss and PTEN-wt samples. Finally, to provide the degree of alteration of the immune cell population we combined the significance level of each comparison into an immune score (IS) using the Fisher's Method (see Materials and Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S18B and Table S10</xref>). Compared to the other GSA methods, GSECA detected the highest number of cancer types with a significant alteration of immune cell fractions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, left panel). Moreover, GSECA showed the highest positive correlation between the number of immune-related AGSs and the IS across GSA methods (Pearson's correlation coefficient <italic>R</italic> = 0.77, <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.003, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, right panel). In particular, the AS resulted significantly positively correlated with the IS, highlighting the accuracy of GSECA results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S18C</xref>). Together these results indicate that GSECA was the most robust approach to highlight the link between PTEN loss and alteration of immune regulation by detecting the highest number of immune-related AGSs in the vast majority of cancer types with statistically significant changes in TIME composition.</p>
<p>Emerging evidence has suggested that PTEN loss is an immunosuppressive event in prostate tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>). However, the connection between PTEN and the immune system is complex and involves both pro- and anti-tumorigenic immune responses depending on the cellular phenotype and the TIME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>). To assess the general applicability of GSECA we finally sought to investigate the impact of PTEN loss on TIME of PRAD samples. In doing so, we ran GSECA on a collection of 102 expression signatures representative of different immune cell activities, states, and modes in tumor tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). We found that 15 immune signatures were significantly altered upon PTEN loss (AS ≤ 0.05, <italic>p</italic><sub>emp</sub> ≤ 0.01 and SR ≥ 0.7, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S11</xref>). Six of the top ten AGSs characterized the state and activity of T and B cells, showing a general reduction of gene expression in the highly expressed classes, and a reciprocal increase of genes in lowly expressed classed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). These observations are consistent with previous data suggesting that PTEN loss prostate cancers are non-T cell inflamed, or ‘cold’, tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>). In particular, GSECA identified the decreased expression of genes representative of CD8 T cells, which was supported by the results of the TIME analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the two top-ranked AGSs contained markers of lymphocyte activation (i.e. Module4 T/B cells) and cell proliferation (i.e. Module11 Proliferation), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>). The combination of the down-regulation of the T/B cell module and the upregulation of the proliferation module has been strongly associated with decreased disease-free survival (DFS) in breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>). Since GSECA identified this same pattern, showing a reduction of genes in HE classes for the T/B cell module and an increase for the proliferation module (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>), we assessed the impact of PTEN loss on DFS in prostate cancer patients. Using DFS data for 355 PRAD patients available from TCGA, we observed a statistically significant difference in time to disease progression in the first 24 months from the treatment between patients with PTEN loss and wild-type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S18D</xref>). These data confirm the detrimental impact of PTEN loss on prostate cancer disease phenotype. Furthermore, since PTEN status determination impact on therapy management of prostate cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>), we wondered whether absolute PTEN expression levels could be prognostic of a shorter DFS. Using the maximally selected rank statistics approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>), we found that patients with PTEN expression levels lower than 3.58 TPM had a statistically significant shorter DFS time in the first two years (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>), as well as three years (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S18E</xref>), from the initial treatment. These results highlight that not only the genomic status but also the absolute expression levels of PTEN are associated with poor outcomes in patients with prostate cancer.</p>
<p>It has been shown that in <italic>Pten-</italic>null mice the activation of the Stat3 establishes an immunosuppressive TIME that contributes to tumor growth and chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>). Therefore, to finally validate GSECA results, we compared the expression levels of STAT3 in PRAD PTEN loss tumors as compared to controls. We also evaluated the expression of the inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule PD-L1 and PD-L2 and the immune inhibitor VEGFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). We found that PRAD PTEN loss tumors significantly expressed STAT3 at higher levels and PD-L1 and PD-L2 at lower levels than PRAD PTEN wild-type samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I</xref>). Moreover, the level of phosphorylation of STAT3 was significantly higher in PRAD PTEN loss tumors as compared to controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5J</xref>). These data support the establishment of an immunosuppressive TIME in human prostate cancers, which could be driven by the activation of STAT3, and validate the statistically significant associations found by GSECA.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results show the general applicability of GSECA in detecting biological processes that are altered in high-volume heterogeneous data sets, including pathological and physiological conditions other than cancer (Supplementary Notes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S19 and Table S12</xref>). In particular, GSECA has proved highly accurate in associating the loss of PTEN to the alteration of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and to the different regulation of immune-related processes across cancer types. In prostate cancer, GSECA detected the detrimental impact of PTEN loss on DFS of patients and the establishment of a ‘cold’ TIME through the down-regulation of lymphocytes signatures. Hence, our results support the emerging role of PTEN in immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>) and therapy resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87–89</xref>).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In this study, we have developed and evaluated GSECA, a tool to identify altered biological processes from the analysis of high-volume and heterogenous RNA-seq experiment data. Heterogeneity is a fundamental characteristic of information associated with complex traits, which can arise from subtle deregulation of distinct genes in different patients rather than of a single gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). IH affects the ability to detect such modifications in large datasets. Here we explored the importance of IH for the correct identification of biological mechanisms that are relevant for the phenotype of interest and confirm its confounding role in signal detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>).</p>
<p>By exploiting the concept of two major subpopulations of genes expressed by the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), GSECA estimates the IH due to biological and technical conditions. The method employs sample-specific estimates of gene expression distribution in a discretization process that reduces the large set of numerical values into a small list of categorical values. Finally, using these discrete units of measure, GSECA identifies the processes that are significantly altered in the phenotype of interest.</p>
<p>We employed simulated RNA-seq data modelling several conditions of differential gene expression between two cohorts to evaluate the performance of GSECA as compared to other seven ‘state-of-art’ GSA methods. Overall, GSECA showed a deflated type I error rate and a higher power than the other GSA methods when handling heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets. The algorithm also achieved a substantial sensitivity to detect AGSs in absence of IH, even if not designed to treat this scenario. Most importantly, GSECA displayed the highest F1 score among all methods to detect truly AGSs in the presence of IH in gene expression between samples. To summarize, GSECA can identify a smaller number of AGSs as compared to other GSA methods but with a higher sensitivity. The conservativeness of GSECA allows to avoid the ‘overproduction’ of significant results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>), and to provide the user a narrowed list of truly altered processes to inspect in details in further analyses. The predictions of GSECA were the most accurate ones when treating heterogeneous samples suggesting that its framework enhances the signal-to-noise ratio, and thus data interpretation. Interestingly, ssGSEA showed similar performance to GSECA in handling heterogeneity. Comparably to GSECA, this method treats each sample individually and collapses gene expression levels to a common scale using ranks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). This finding confirms that the reduction of the large set of expression levels into a smaller range of values increases the power to detect truly AGSs in the presence of IH.</p>
<p>We used our approach to identify the biologically relevant gene sets that are altered upon the somatic loss of PTEN, and the subsequent alteration of the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade in prostate cancer. The EC maps generated by GSECA correctly detected the alteration of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and related signal transduction gene sets, such as calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>), epithelial CAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>), MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>) and WNT signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>). Interestingly, the FMM and the DD approaches captured the heterogeneity among the cohorts revealing a general decreased and widespread gene expression in prostate cancer due to the loss of PTEN that might underline the role of PTEN in regulating basal transcription through histones and chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>).</p>
<p>The comparative performance analysis of GSA methods in detecting the effect of PTEN silencing shows that GSECA was the only algorithm able to tackle the heterogeneity of the prostate cancer dataset and to reveal the altered modulation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Moreover, GSECA detected the altered regulation of processes where genes directly interact with PTEN and, thus, are influenced by the somatic loss of their interactor. This result indicates the ability of the method to spot functionally related AGSs. Importantly, GSECA highlights the alteration of gene sets composed by genes that are coordinately and heterogeneously modulated rather than being uniformly activated or repressed at different levels (i.e. low and high) in distinct samples, whereas other methods might suffer from this limitation. Together, these results indicate that GSECA boosts the signal-to-noise ratio in heterogeneous datasets enabling the identification of the general mechanisms that are more likely to be altered across samples. In particular, compared to the other GSA algorithms, GSECA requires a smaller number of heterogeneous samples to detect the AGSs, and it can handle different degrees of IH without affecting the final results.</p>
<p>The pancancer analysis of the effect of PTEN somatic loss generated a comprehensive assessment of its regulation across tissues. PTEN critically interconnects the canonical PI3K/AKT and the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway, which are the two dominant tumorigenic gene sets controlling cell survival and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>). Our data shows that the impact of PTEN silencing on cellular program regulation is proportional to the impaired modulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade, with the stronger effect of gliomas, endometrial, head and neck, breast carcinomas, melanomas, and sarcomas. GSECA revealed a tissue-specific control of PTEN on metabolic processes, whereas information-related processes, such as signal transduction, are more uniformly affected across tissues. Most importantly, GSECA correctly highlighted the role of PTEN in controlling immune-related processes in the majority of cancer types, particularly in those showing a significant alteration of the TIME composition. These data support the importance of PTEN in modulating the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>) and therapy resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that the loss of PTEN impacts on T cell lineage stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>), inhibits T cell-mediated tumor killing and trafficking in melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>) and promotes resistance to T cell-mediated immunotherapy in uterine cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>). Using additional immune expression signatures, GSECA correctly highlights the immunosuppressive TIME of PTEN-loss prostate tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>), which could be driven by the significant activation of STAT3. Furthermore, GSECA results were pivotal to show the shorter of disease-free survival of these patients and to underline the biomarker potential of PTEN expression levels. These results validate previous findings in prostate mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>), melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>), breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>) and provide indications that might be important for the clinical management of prostate cancer patients.</p>
<p>To conclude, we tested GSECA under several conditions using distinct simulated and real RNA-seq datasets and different collections of gene sets. Our findings concordantly indicate that GSECA can improve the comprehensive identification of relevant biological processes that are altered in complex phenotypes. In particular, GSECA can detect functionally related and relevant altered cell mechanisms in a condition of interest considering more heterogeneous cohorts as compared to other available methods. By boosting signal-to-noise ratio, GSECA can successfully manage the heterogeneity of thousands of samples and provides useful insights on clinical and biological patterns proper of a phenotype. In this work we introduced the paradigm shift of ‘<italic>less is more</italic>’ in treating large heterogenous RNA-seq datasets and showed that it improves the detection of the altered biological processes in the phenotype of interest.</p>
