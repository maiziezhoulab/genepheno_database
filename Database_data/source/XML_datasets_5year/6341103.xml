<p id="Par1">Deletions in the 15q11.2 region of the human genome are associated with neurobehavioral deficits, and motor development delay, as well as in some cases, symptoms of autism or schizophrenia. The cytoplasmic FMRP-interacting protein 1 (<italic>CYFIP1</italic>) is one of the four genes contained within this locus and has been associated with other genetic forms of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In mice, <italic>Cyfip1</italic> haploinsufficiency leads to alteration of dendritic spine morphology and defects in synaptic plasticity, two pathophysiological hallmarks of mouse models of ASD. At the behavioral level, however, <italic>Cyfip1</italic> haploinsufficiency leads to minor phenotypes, not directly relevant for 15q11.2 deletion syndrome or ASD. A fundamental question is whether neuronal phenotypes caused by the mutation of <italic>Cyfip1</italic> are relevant for the human condition. Here, we describe a synaptic cluster of ASD-associated proteins centered on CYFIP1 and the adhesion protein Neuroligin-3. <italic>Cyfip1</italic> haploinsufficiency in mice led to decreased dendritic spine density and stability associated with social behavior and motor learning phenotypes. Behavioral training early in development resulted in alleviating the motor learning deficits caused by <italic>Cyfip1</italic> haploinsufficiency. Altogether, these data provide new insight into the neuronal and behavioral phenotypes caused by <italic>Cyfip1</italic> mutation and proof-of-concept for the development of a behavioral therapy to treat phenotypes associated with 15q11.2 syndromes and ASD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are defined by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction accompanied by restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. In addition to these core symptoms, more than 70% of individuals with ASD have co-occurring medical, developmental, or psychiatric conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. An extensive variety of impairments affecting gross and fine motor functions affect more than 79% of individuals with ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Despite the frequency of motor anomalies, studies on the underlying pathophysiology of motor deficits and their treatment remain limited.</p>
<p id="Par3">Deletions in the 15q11.2 region of the human genome are associated with neurobehavioral deficits, and motor development delay and, in about 30% of individuals, symptoms of autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The 15q11.2 locus contains four genes, tubulin gamma complex-associated protein 3 (<italic>TUBGCP3</italic>), cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1), and non-imprinted in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome 1 and 2 (<italic>NIPA1/2</italic>)), and is also associated with larger 15q11–q13 type I deletions causing Prader-Willi or Angelman Syndromes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Microdeletions of 15q11.2 correlated with decreased <italic>TUBGCP3</italic>, <italic>CYFIP1</italic>, and <italic>NIPA1/2</italic> mRNA levels in lymphoblastoid cells derived from patients with Prader-Willi syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The four genes in the 15q11.2 locus were shown to impact on the behavioral symptoms of patients with 15q11.2 deletion or Prader-Will syndrome. In addition, decreased <italic>CYFIP1</italic> mRNA levels were also found in leukocytes obtained from ASD diagnosed patients with Fragile X and in patients diagnosed with autism and carrying a deletion of SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 2 (SHANK2) gene.</p>
<p id="Par4">Amongst the genes within region 15q11.2, <italic>CYFIP1</italic> is of particular interest due to its role in the control of actin dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and protein translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This regulation occurs through its interaction with the Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, respectively. Hippocampal neurons with Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency (<italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup>) show defects in dendritic spine morphogenesis and increased metabotropic glutamate receptor-induced long-term depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, two phenotypes consistently found in mouse models of ASD and in particular Fragile X syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Importantly, analyses of post-mortem tissue of individuals with idiopathic and syndromic forms of ASD also showed alteration of dendritic spine morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. These results show that the effects of deletion of <italic>Cyfip1</italic> resemble the cellular phenotypes found in other models of ASD. However, mice heterozygous for <italic>Cyfip1</italic> (<italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup>) show mild behavioral phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. It is, therefore, possible that CYFIP1 function at synapses is not relevant for ASD or that the behavioral phenotyping of <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice was not conducted extensively enough.</p>
<p id="Par5">Within the WRC, CYFIP1, and Abi interactor proteins 1–3 (ABI1–3) form an interaction surface that enables the interaction with proteins containing a WRC interacting receptor sequence (WIRS). The coding sequence of synaptic adhesion proteins Neuroligin-3 contains a WIRS and is therefore predicted to interact with CYFIP1 and ABI 1–3. The genes coding for these proteins have been associated with ASD in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. A putative interaction between Neuroligin-3, CYFIP1, and FMRP would point towards a possible common pathway linking ASD-associated proteins at synapses. Mice lacking Neuroligin-3 or FMRP show defects of social behavior and motor learning deficits correlated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> with alterations of dendritic spine stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Based on this predicted interaction, we hypothesized that <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup><italic>Het</italic></sup> mice also show defects in social and motor behaviors. This study examines these possibilities by immunoprecipitation paired with mass-spectrometry, analysis of dendritic spine plasticity in vivo and behavioral analysis. Based on the results obtained, we investigated the possibility rescuing <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice motor learning phenotype using a behavioral approach.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p id="Par6">The interaction between Neuroligin-3 and CYFIP1 was investigated using immunoprecipitation of Neuroligin-3 in striatum, cerebellum, and cortex, followed by western blot analysis. Neuroligin-3 co-immunoprecipitates Neuroligin-1 and 2, two previously characterized interactors of Neuroligin-3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and CYFIP1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). CYFIP1 was detected in the three different brain regions indicating that the interaction between Neuroligin-3 and CYFIP1 is not restricted to a particular brain region. Note that FMRP was not detected in these samples. Further investigations revealed that CYFIP1 was also present in Neuroligin-3 immunoprecipitates from synaptosomes but again FMRP was not (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). Neuroligin-3 is expressed in neurons but also in astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. To determine if the interaction between Neuroligin-3 and CYFIP1 occurs in neurons, immunoprecipitations were performed on brain samples originating from mice expressing Neuroligin-3 only in <italic>Pvalb</italic>-expressing neurons (<italic>Nlgn3</italic><sup>KO</sup><italic>Pvalb</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup>), as we previously showed that re-expressing Neuroligin-3 in these cells was sufficient to restore the ASD-related deficits in <italic>Nlgn3</italic> knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Neuroligin-3 neuronal co-immunoprecipitated proteins from the three brain regions contained Neuroligin-2 and CYFIP1, indicating that indeed interaction between these proteins occurs in neurons and is not grossly influenced by the regional localization of <italic>Pvalb</italic>-expressing neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref> and supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>). Interestingly, proteins from <italic>Nlgn3</italic><sup>KO</sup><italic>Pvalb</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup>, co-immunoprecipitated with Neuroligin-3, did not contain Neuroligin-1 but did contain FMRP, suggesting that the identity of the proteins interacting with the Neuroligin-3/CYFIP1 complex vary depending on the cell type.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Binding between Neuroligin-3 and Cyfip1 in <italic>Pvalb</italic>-expressing neurons.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Western blot analysis showing that Neuroligin-1, 2, and 3 (NL1, 2, and 3) and Cyfip1 are detected in proteins co-immunoprecipitated with Neuroligin-3 in wild-type striatum (St), cerebellum (Cb), and cortex (Cx).

<p id="Par7">Studies suggest that CYFIP1's interaction with FMRP and WRC is mutually exclusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. To determine if the Neuroligin-3/CYFIP1 complex interacts exclusively with FMRP or also contains components of the WRC we performed an unbiased screen of Neuroligin-3 co-immunoprecipitated proteins using mass-spectrometry. The synapse-specific interactome of Neuroligin-3 was investigated, in vivo, in <italic>Nlgn3</italic><sup>KO</sup><italic>Pvalb</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice tissue (<italic>N</italic> = 3, supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>), and in tissue expressing Neuroligin-3 but lacking synapses (<italic>N</italic> = 3, supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">2</xref>), as a control. The so-called olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC) populating the vomeronasal organ (VNO) fulfill these criteria as they are known to express Neuroligin-3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, but are entirely devoid of synapses. Note that, biochemical analysis and in situ hybridization demonstrated that Neuroligin-3 is expressed in non-neuronal cells in the VNO, confirming its expression in OEC (supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>a–d). To determine proteins specifically associated with Neuroligin-3 in <italic>Pvalb</italic>-expressing interneurons, we performed co-immunoprecipitation of Neuroligin-3 coupled with mass-spectrometry analysis and included co-immunoprecipitation of the VNOs of wild-type (<italic>N</italic> = 3, supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">2</xref>) and <italic>Nlgn3</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> mice (<italic>N</italic> = 2) to our analysis to control for non-neuronal co-immunoprecipitated proteins and unspecific binding of the Neuroligin-3 antibody, respectively (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">2</xref>). We used hierarchical cluster analysis of co-immunoprecipitated proteins in wild-type mice VNO or <italic>Nlgn3</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup><italic>Pvalb</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice striatum or cerebellum but not in <italic>Nlgn3</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> mice VNO to determine the optimal number of clusters in our dataset, which was found to be three. On this basis, follow-up two-step cluster analysis showed that clusters 1, 2, and 3 contained 42.6%, 42.1%, and 15.3% of co-immunoprecipitated proteins, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). Analysis of the number of co-immunoprecipitated proteins contained in each cluster revealed that cluster 1 proteins almost uniquely originated from the striata and cluster 2 proteins originated from the three anatomical regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). Interestingly, cluster 3 was mostly composed of proteins co-immunoprecipitated from striata and/or cerebella but not VNOs, suggesting the existence of proteins interacting with Neuroligin-3 specifically in neurons. Consistent with Neuroligin-3 synaptic localization in neurons, excitatory (PSD93 and 95 and synapse-associated protein 97 and 102), and inhibitory synaptic proteins (Neuroligin-2 and Neuroligin-4 and Gephyrin) were co-immunoprecipitated only in <italic>Pvalb</italic>-expressing neurons independently of the brain region (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">3</xref>). As FMRP, WAS protein family member 1 (WASF1) and ABI1 were detected in proteins immunoprecipitated by Neuroligin-3. FMRP was detected in <italic>Nlgn3</italic><sup>KO</sup><italic>Pvalb</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice cerebella and striata, whereas WASF1 and ABI1 were only detected in striata (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">3</xref>). These results suggest that binding between Neuroligin-3 and CYFIP1 and WRC is influenced by the localization of the <italic>Pvalb</italic>-expressing cells (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">3</xref>). Interestingly, the protein products of genes reliably associated with syndromic and non-syndromic ASD (with an SFARI gene score of 1, 2, or 3) were also co-immunoprecipitated only in <italic>Pvalb</italic>-expressing interneurons, independently of the brain region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>). Altogether, these results show that Neuroligin-3 and CYFIP1 interact in neurons in vivo and that the identity of the proteins they interact with is influenced by the regional localization of the neurons. Moreover, they suggest that CYFIP1 may interact with other ASD-associated proteins at excitatory and inhibitory synapses, either directly or indirectly via its binding to Neuroligin-3 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par8">Mice lacking <italic>Fmr1</italic> or <italic>Nlgn3</italic> show behavioral phenotypes associated with the core symptoms of ASD, including defects in social behavior, but also with some of its comorbidities (e.g. hyperactivity, alteration of motor learning)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that since CYFIP1 interacts with both Neuroligin-3 and FMRP, the behavioral phenotype should be similar across the three models. A complete absence of <italic>Cyfip1</italic> is embryonic lethal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, therefore we used a <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mouse model. <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice showed an absence of interest for social cues compared to their <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>WT</sup> littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>) without deficits in social dominance (courtship vocalization test, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>) or repetitive behaviors (marble burying test, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>). In addition, <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice showed motor learning deficits, as indicated by the absence of an improved performance in the rotarod test, compared to their <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>WT</sup> littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>), but no change in basal motor activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e, f</xref>). The biochemical characterization of <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice showed a significant decrease of CYFIP1 protein expression levels in motor and frontal cortex and in the hippocampus but no change in other brain regions or in the periphery (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>). <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice phenotype is consistent with the region-specific decrease of CYFIP1 protein expression since frontal and motor areas of the cortex are involved in the control of social and motor functions. In addition, the behavioral phenotype of <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice is also consistent with the association between <italic>CYFIP1</italic> and 15q11.2 deletion syndrome and ASD in humans, therefore validating the use of the mouse model for ASD studies.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title><italic>Cyfip1</italic> haploinsufficiency leads to motor learning defects.</title><p><bold>a</bold>

<p id="Par9"><italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> hippocampal neurons show deficits in dendritic spine maturation in vitro and ex vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, a converging cellular phenotype between syndromic and non-syndromic genetic mouse models of ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Decreased dendritic spine maturation can be explained by defects in dendritic spine formation and/or dendritic spine instability. To investigate these two possibilities, we crossed <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice with mice expressing green fluorescent proteins in a subset of neurons (refer to Material and methods) and imaged dendritic spines of cortical neurons ex vivo and in vivo in adult male mice. Immunohistology experiments demonstrated that <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice showed decreased dendritic spine density in neurons from motor cortex but not from the V1 area of the visual cortex, compared to their <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>WT</sup> littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). Two-photon imaging to track dendritic spines in the motor cortex in vivo revealed an increased formation and elimination of dendritic spines over time, in <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice, compared to <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>WT</sup> littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b, c</xref>). Since increased rotarod performance correlates with increased formation of dendritic spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that, in addition to increased dendritic spine instability, <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice show defects in dendritic spine formation. As previously demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, motor training increased the formation of dendritic spines by about three-fold in <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>WT</sup> mice without affecting the number of eliminated spines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). Despite their lack of increased performance on the rotarod, <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice showed an increased number of newly formed dendritic spines upon motor training similar to that of their <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>WT</sup> littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). Note that rotarod training had no effect on dendritic spine elimination in both genotypes. These results show that while <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup><italic>HET</italic></sup> does not impact on the ability to form new spines it leads to an increased dendritic spines instability.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title><italic>Cyfip1</italic> haploinsufficiency leads to decreased stability of dendritic spines without affecting their formation.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Dendrites of GFP-expressing neurons from the motor cortex (M1), visual cortex (V1), and hippocampus (CA1 and CA3) of <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>WT</sup> and <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice.

<p id="Par10">Given that <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice show a similar ability to form new spines upon training as <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>WT</sup> mice, we hypothesized that training <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice during development, before the appearance of the behavioral phenotype, would be sufficient to rescue their motor learning deficits. The earliest time point in the development animals complied with the motor learning protocol was postnatal day 40 (P40), when <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>WT</sup> mice show reliable decreased latency to fall from an accelerating rod over successive trials (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). At P40, <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice showed a decreased latency to fall from the accelerating rod over successive trials (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par11">Three important conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, we found that CYFIP1 binds to Neuroligin-3 at synapses and, directly or indirectly, to other proteins associated with ASD. Second, we showed that <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup><italic>HET</italic></sup> is associated with alterations of dendritic spine stability, but not formation, and defects in social behavior and motor learning. Finally, based on these findings we designed a behavioral approach that alleviated the motor learning phenotype of <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice.</p>
<sec id="Sec4">
<title>Dendritic spine defects as a converging phenotype in ASD</title>
<p id="Par12">Previous work with genetic mouse models suggested that the different genetic mutations associated with ASD target a small set of molecular pathways, leading to a deficit in dendritic spine morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Our study is the first to provide direct evidence to support this hypothesis. Importantly, defects in dendritic spine morphology are also reported in human post-mortem studies, showing that this pathophysiological feature is one of the few conserved between mouse models and humans.</p>
<p id="Par13">When studied in isolation, the impact of specific monogenic genetic risk factors for ASD is limited by the frequency of the mutations in the human population, which is, in general, very low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Our results demonstrate that some of these risk factors are in fact directly connected, such that they are likely to form a single molecular pathway in which dysfunction can cause specific forms of ASD. The frequency of such molecular alterations is likely to be equivalent to the sum of the frequency of the genetic risks, thus accounting for a large number of individuals with ASD. It remains possible that independent pathways regulating dendritic spine formation and function may alter the composition of this cluster of ASD proteins, suggesting that, not all cases of ASD associated where such changes are present, can be attributed to a single cause. Nevertheless, this finding is likely to provide a framework to address the genetic heterogeneity associated with ASD.</p>
<p id="Par14">As such, analysis of dendritic spine morphology or density cannot be conveniently used as a biomarker in the human population, as it requires access to brain tissue. In this context, our findings are more likely to represent a step towards a better definition of some of the biological basis of ASD, which in turn may lead to the identification of biological markers. Indeed, dendritic spines are the postsynaptic docking compartment for a large number of excitatory synapses and decrease in their number and stability is likely to have a direct consequence on the number of synaptic inputs a neuron receives and, by extension, a brain region receives. Such connectivity between brain regions can be quantified in mice and humans using diffusion tensor imaging. Using <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>Het</sup> mouse model, and by extension, any genetic model associated with the ASD protein cluster could, therefore, help to better understand the complex relationship between brain region-specific defects in dendritic spine stability and brain-wide connectivity providing an experimental framework to identify biological markers for specific behavioral phenotypes.</p>

<title>Predicted functional consequences associated with the ASD cluster of proteins</title>
<p id="Par15">Aberrant signaling through type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors 1 and 5 (mGluR1 and 5), resulting in defects in long-term synaptic depression (LTD), is a pathophysiological hallmark of genetic mouse models of ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Interestingly, mutations in genes associated with the proteins co-immunoprecipitated with Neuroligin-3, including Neuroligin-3 itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> (but see ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>), CYFIP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, FMRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, MeCP2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, Synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein 1 (encoded by the <italic>Syngap1</italic> gene)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, and the beta 3 subunit of Type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors (encoded by the <italic>Gabrb3</italic> gene)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, lead to such phenotypes. These results indicate that in addition to regulating dendritic spine morphogenesis, this cluster of proteins might be involved in regulation of mGluR1/5 function and control of LTD.</p>
<p id="Par16">At synapses, mGluR1/5 binds directly to Homer proteins, which links the receptors to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), via interactions with PI 3-kinase enhancer (PIKE) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), or to ionotropic glutamate receptors, via SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains (Shank) proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Our data show that type 1 mGluR, and mGluR1 specifically, are reliably co-immunoprecipitated with Neuroligin-3 in cerebellar but not striatal <italic>Pvalb</italic>-expressing cells (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">3</xref>). Moreover, along with mGluR1 we also reliably detected PIKE (encoded by the <italic>Agap3</italic> gene) and IP3R1 (encoded by the <italic>Itpr1</italic> gene) but not Shank proteins or ionotropic receptors (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">3</xref>). Interestingly, FMPR has been shown to inhibit PIKE and therefore type 1 mGluR downstream signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. These results raise the question of a potential involvement of CYFIP1 in regulating type 1 mGluR downstream signaling. It is possible that Neuroligin-3, FMRP, and CYFIP1 are expressed in different subcellular compartments of the neurons and, therefore, do not aggregate in a single cluster. Nevertheless, these results suggest that Neuroligin-3, FMRP, and CYFIP1 are involved in localizing mGluR1 and the ER at the synapse. The release of calcium from the ER to the cytoplasm is regulated by mGluR1 and essential for the induction of LTD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Based on our results, we can further speculate that defects in mGluR-LTD observed in genetic mouse models for ASD result from an inappropriate localization of the mGlur/ER complex at the synapse, a hypothesis that remains to be experimentally tested. Importantly, this mechanism might be cell or type 1 mGluR specific as we did not reliably detect type 1 mGluR in proteins co-immunoprecipitated with Neuroligin-3 in the striatum.</p>

<title>Behavioral treatment to alleviate ASD core and comorbid symptoms</title>
<p id="Par17">About 42% of individuals carrying 15q11.2 deletions show motor delay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Motor abnormalities and delay in motor development are common comorbid symptoms in more than 70% of individuals with ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In this study, we found that adult <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice show defects in motor learning. Note that we have not fully characterized the motor learning deficits and it is possible that a less challenging paradigm, with longer interatrial intervals for example, would find milder or no phenotype in <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice. Nevertheless, along with <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice, other mouse models for ASD show motor phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, suggesting that, to a certain extent, mouse models of ASD replicate motor abnormalities found in humans. Importantly, we found that training <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup><italic>HET</italic></sup> mice early in the development is sufficient to alleviate the motor learning phenotype in adult mice. These results demonstrate that the motor learning phenotype of <italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>HET</sup> mice develops over time, appearing between young adult and adult stages, and is reversible using behavioral training approaches. As future studies, it would be interesting to know if dendritic spine phenotypes follow the similar developmental trajectories and sensitivity to behavioral training. These results provide important insights for the treatment of motor impairment in ASD in humans. In humans, motor impairments can be detected early in the development alongside the diagnosis of ASD. Our results suggest that early behavioral intervention, targeted at stimulating motor function, might help in preventing motor impairment arising later in life.</p>

Imaged stretches of dendrite close to parallel to the imaging plane were selected based on an eGFP expression which was traced back to the soma located in layer 5 (<italic>Z</italic>: 400–500 µm from brain surface). Cortical surface vascular landmarks were used to locate the same stretches of dendrite between sessions. During two-photon imaging animals were free to run on a custom designed fixed axis cylindrical treadmill, and data collection was limited to stationary periods to avoid locomotion related brain movement. Imaging data were acquired using Scanimage 4.1 (HHMI Janelia). Imaging data were first corrected for brain motion using an automated rigid registration algorithm implemented in Matlab (MathWorks). The 20 frames from each depth were then averaged and a maximum intensity projection calculated over the <italic>z</italic> planes which encompassed the stretch of the dendrite of interest. Formed and eliminated spines were manually counted and normalized to 100 µm of dendrite (Thy1-EGFP-<italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>Het</sup>
<italic>N</italic> = 36, from four mice; Thy1-EGFP-<italic>Cyfip1</italic><sup>WT</sup>
<italic>N</italic> = 40, from four mice).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p id="Par31">Prior the cluster analysis, every protein detected in immunoprecipitates from VNO of <italic>Nlgn3</italic><sup>KO</sup> mice (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">2</xref>) was filtered out of the ones immunoprecipitated from wild-type mice VNO (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">2</xref>) and <italic>Nlgn3</italic><sup>KO</sup><italic>Pvalb</italic><sup>Cre</sup> striatum and cerebellum (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>), because proteins present in <italic>Nlgn3</italic><sup>KO</sup> are likely to be false positives. The list of remaining proteins can be found in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">3</xref>. A protein was considered detected when its score was &gt;0, therefore obtaining a binarized dataset containing proteins detected (score of 1) and non-detected (score of 0) for each technical triplicate and each anatomical region. We used SPSS Statistics<sup>®</sup> software to perform hierarchical cluster analysis based on the binarized score and determined that three clusters described the dataset best. We then performed a two-step analysis with three clusters and obtained the results presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>.</p>
<p id="Par32">Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">4</xref> contains the data structure, type of test used, observed power and N for Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>. Each test included enough animals to reach a power close to or above 0.8. We designed our tests groups to have mice from the different groups tested at the same time. We used SPSS Statistics<sup>®</sup> software to systematically test for normality using Levene’s test. No animals were removed from the analyses. Pairwise comparisons were analyzed by two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test for normally distributed datasets or two-tailed Mann–Whitney’s test for non-normally distributed datasets. All datasets used for two-way non-repeated and repeated measure ANOVAs were normally distributed and, when appropriate, followed by post-hoc Bonferroni’s test.</p>
