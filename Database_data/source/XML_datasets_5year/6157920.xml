<p id="P1">Understanding neurological diseases requires tractable genetic systems.
Engineered 3D neural tissues are an attractive choice, but how the cellular
transcriptomic profiles in these tissues are affected by the encapsulating
materials and are related to the human-brain transcriptome is not well
understood. Here, we report the characterization of the effects of culturing
conditions on the transcriptomic profiles of induced neuronal cells, as well as
a method for the rapid generation of 3D co-cultures of neuronal and astrocytic
cells from the same pool of human embryonic stem cells. By comparing the
gene-expression profiles of neuronal cells in culture conditions relevant to the
developing human brain, we found that modifying the degree of crosslinking of
composite hydrogels can tune expression patterns so they correlate with those of
specific brain regions and developmental stages. Moreover, by using single-cell
sequencing, we show that our engineered tissues recapitulate transcriptional
patterns of cell types in the human brain. The analysis of culturing conditions
will inform the development of 3D neural tissues for use as tractable models of
brain diseases.</p>

<body>
<p id="P2">There is increasing evidence that some neurological diseases have a genetic
component<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> as evidenced by the growing catalogs of gene
variants involved in these diseases generated by next-generation sequencing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Understanding the mechanistic outcomes
of these mutations, however, has been difficult because we lack tractable genetic models
in which to systematically interrogate them. One promising approach has been to engineer
3D neural tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> that can provide a system for rapid genetic
manipulation in a brain-like environment. To be effective, such tissues should closely
reflect the extracellular matrix (ECM), gene expression profiles, and cell composition
of the human brain. In addition, they should be rapid and simple to generate and allow
for controllable numbers of brain-related cell types with an isogenic background within
a tunable environment.</p>
<p id="P3">A number of approaches have been taken to develop such neural tissues <italic>in
vitro</italic>, focusing on differentiating human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into brain-related cell types, such as neurons
and glia, on two-dimensional (2D) surfaces as well as 3D matrices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.
Typically, the brain-like properties of these tissues are assessed by performing
electrophysiological assays and immunostainings for neural markers. However, these broad
approaches may not accurately reflect the cellular state, and more comprehensive
analysis, like RNA-seq, could improve assessment of these tissues. A previous study
compared the transcriptomic profile of cerebral organoids to the human fetal
brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, however it has not
been reported how the global transcriptome of neural cells in engineered tissues relates
to the human brain and how the gene expression profiles of these cells respond to
various culturing conditions.</p>
<p id="P4">To generate a system that can serve as a proxy for studying the genetics of the
human brain, we compared a number of different conditions used for generating 3D neural
tissues from induced neuronal (iN) cells from hESCs and develop a method for rapid
generation of 3D co-cultures of iN and astrocytic cells derived from the same population
of hESCs. iN cells can be efficiently produced directly from hESCs using ectopic
expression of transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and have been used to model
neurological diseases by culturing them on 2D surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. This
approach has also been used to produce 3D neural tissues on an electrospun scaffold for
transplantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. We extended
these approaches to create a 3D culture of iN cells within Matrigel, a basement membrane
matrix that includes components that closely reflect brain ECM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We
optimized these tissues by exploring the effects of the addition of hyaluronic acid (HA)
as well as the formation of a composite hydrogel of Matrigel and alginate with varying
crosslinking density and volume. We compared the transcriptome of these iNs to a panel
of human brain transcriptomic data and showed that the gene expression of iN cells can
be tuned to correlate with specific developmental time points and brain regions by
modulating the composition of the 3D matrix. Single-cell sequencing of cells co-cultured
in 3D tissues confirmed their transcriptomic correlations to cell types found in the
human brain. Finally, we used gene editing tools to create gene knock-outs in our 3D
tissues of genes implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, demonstrating the feasibility
of combining these technologies.</p>

<title>Development and optimization of 3D neural tissues from hESCs</title>
<p id="P5">To create a robust, genetically tractable 3D neural tissue system, we
used a transcriptional activation approach to differentiate iN cells from hESCs
and encapsulate them in a Matrigel matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.
1a</xref>). We initially tested whether encapsulated hESCs transduced with
<italic>NGN1</italic> and <italic>NGN2</italic> overexpression constructs
could be directly differentiated in a Matrigel 3D matrix, but this approach
resulted in aggregation of encapsulated cells within 5 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>), preventing
efficient differentiation. To circumvent aggregation, hESCs were first seeded on
2D plates and then induced to form neuronal cells, which were subsequently
detached and then encapsulated in Matrigel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Although
this led to less aggregation, over time, aggregates continued to form, with
spheroids present at day-30 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c, d</xref>). Further improvements were made by
increasing selection for <italic>NGN1/2</italic> constructs and introducing a
proliferation inhibitor, 1-β-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C), to
suppress proliferation of undifferentiated stem cells. This resulted in 3D pure
human neural tissues without cell aggregates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e, Supplementary video
1-3</xref>). For comparison, we also generated 2D cultures of iN cells
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) (see methods).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Characterization of 3D cultures</title>
<p id="P6">To characterize the differences between 2D and 3D cultures of iN cells,
we performed global transcriptome analysis and observed clear differences
between these cultures at both the 1-week and 5-week time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1,2</xref>).
Maintaining healthy neural tissues for an extended amount of time promotes
neuronal maturity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, and we therefore focused our analysis
on tissues at the 5-week time point. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed
more enriched neurological processes present in 3D cultured iN cells than in 2D
ones at five weeks, whereas 2D cultures were enriched for apoptosis and
oxidative stress, indicative of their poor health (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). We
validated a subset of these genes by qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). This is
supported by gene ontology (GO) analysis for up- and down-regulated genes with
p&lt;0.001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). This trend was
not significantly affected by batch-to-batch variation in Matrigel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a-c</xref>).
Given this trend, we next tested whether increasing the concentration of
Matrigel would further enhance for neurological processes, and we found an
incremental improvement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d, e</xref>). The ability to study the
electrophysiological properties in a 3D culture system is desirably for
downstream genetic studies, and we therefore analyzed the expression of genes
involved in channel activity and the electrophysiological properties of these
tissues. The 3D cultures of iN cells showed increased expression of a number of
genes involved in channel activity, and we found that these cells, unlike their
2D counterparts, were capable of firing repetitive action potentials and
displayed spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). To further
develop the cellular composition of our 3D cultures, we co-cultured iN cells
with mouse astrocytes, which support neuronal processes and functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and performed bulk RNA-seq (reads
from mouse astrocytes were filtered out, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref> and methods).
We observed global transcriptome differences between 2D and 3D co-cultures of iN
cells at both the 1-week and 5-week time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), and a substantial number of the
significantly upregulated genes in 3D co-culture conditions were also
upregulated in iN cells cultured in 3D without mouse astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Although cells in both 3D and 2D co-cultures
at longer time points are electrophysiologically active (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>), GO analysis
of significantly up-and down regulated genes (p&lt;0.001) at five weeks
revealed more enriched neurological processes present in iN cells co-cultured in
3D versus 2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). The co-cultured 3D
tissues showed clear transcriptional differences from pure iN 3D cultures and
upregulation of genes involved in neurological processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b, c</xref>). We
therefore used co-cultured 3D tissues for further analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Influence of HA on transcriptome of 3D co-cultured iN cells</title>
<p id="P7">Previous neural tissue engineering approaches have incorporated HA, a
non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan, into the matrix to mimic biological
conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, but the influence of HA has not been characterized by
genome-wide profiling before. We incorporated a high molecular weight
(∼1.5–1.8×10<sup>6</sup> Da) HA at two different
concentrations in our tissue system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.
2a</xref>) and then performed bulk RNA-seq at 5 weeks. The presence of HA
resulted in significant differences in the transcriptome of iN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). GSEA and GO analysis showed that
cells cultured in the absence of HA were more enriched for neurological
processes, whereas the presence of HA lead to enrichment in non-neuronal
biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a,
Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Given previous reports of increased
transcription of some neuronal genes in the presence of HA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, we specifically looked at the
expression of genes involved in neuron development, forebrain development,
central nervous system development, and channel activity. We find expression of
some genes, including <italic>DLG4</italic>, <italic>NEUROD4</italic>, and
<italic>CLU</italic>, do show elevated expression in the presence of HA
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.
7b</xref>). To gain a global view of the effect of HA on gene expression, we
compared the transcriptome of our engineered tissues with and without HA to the
human brain transcriptome of four different subregions (V1C: primary visual
cortex (striate cortex, area V1/17); DFC: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; A1C:
primary auditory cortex (core); M1C: primary motor cortex (area M1, area 4)) at
four fetal developmental stages (12 post-conceptual weeks (pcw), 16 pcw, 19 pcw
and 37 pcw). We found that the presence of HA broadly decreased the correlation
between the transcriptome of 3D co-cultured iN cells to the human brain
developmental transcriptome, although correlations to 37 pcw did not fit this
trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Transcriptome profiles can be tuned by using composite hydrogels</title>
<p id="P8">Differentiation of cells in 3D tissues and their gene expression profiles
can be affected by the mechanical stiffness of the matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, providing an
avenue for creation of tunable engineered tissues. As increasing the
concentration of Matrigel had minimal effect, we explored how a composite
hydrogel (CH) consisting of alginate and Matrigel affected gene expression
profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Alginate networks can
be created in the Matrigel through addition of a crosslinker (calcium), the
concentration of which can be increased to produce a stiffer matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). We
performed bulk RNA-seq on co-cultured iN cells at week 5 in Matrigel and in CH
with increasing amounts of crosslinker. PCA showed clear transcriptomic
differences in the CH relative to Matrigel alone, although the global gene
expression profiles with intermediate levels of crosslinker were not strongly
separated from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Global
differential expression analysis between the transcriptome of iN cells in CHs
versus in Matrigel hydrogel showed four distinct clusters of genes with
different patterns of expression, containing a number of genes relevant to human
neurological disease such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (e.g.,
<italic>SOD1</italic>) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (e.g.,
<italic>ADSL</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9,
Supplementary Table 5</xref>). We also looked at the differential expression
of genes involved in forebrain development, axon guidance, and neuron
development biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>,
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.
8b-d</xref>). To analyze the effect of increasing crosslinker concentration
in CHs on the gene expression profile of iN cells, we performed differential
expression analysis of our RNA-seq data relative to CH with the lowest level of
crosslinker, focusing on differentially expressed genes involved in forebrain
development, axon guidance, and neuron development biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). Neuronal
transcripts such as <italic>DLG4, NFIB</italic>, and <italic>UNC5C</italic> are
less expressed in iN cells co-cultured in CH with high levels of crosslinker
than in iN cells co-cultured in other CHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.
4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary
Fig. 10</xref>). Although raising crosslinker concentration in CHs increased
expression of <italic>ARHGEF12</italic>, <italic>GSK3B</italic>,
<italic>SLC4A7</italic>, and <italic>GPM6A</italic>, neuronal genes such as
<italic>ID4</italic> and <italic>BAD</italic> are more highly expressed in
iN cells co-cultured in CHs with intermediate levels of crosslinker than in iN
cells co-cultured in CH with low or high levels crosslinker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">We further examined the influence of co-culturing iN cells in Matrigel
hydrogel and CHs for five weeks by comparing their transcriptome to a panel of
human brain transcriptome samples. For all four subregions tested, we observed a
positive trend in the correlation between the transcriptome of co-cultured iN
cells to the human brain transcriptome at later developmental time points (19
pcw and 37 pcw) when moving from Matrigel to CH with increasing levels of
crosslinker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Although there are
some exceptions to this trend, in most cases, CH was an improvement over
Matrigel alone. At the earliest developmental time point (12 pcw), gene
expression of iN cells co-cultured in Matrigel alone correlates more closely
with the human data. To determine genes driving increased correlation to human
brain transcriptome at later developmental time points (19 pcw and 37 pcw)
moving from Matrigel to CH 4× crosslinker, we scored each gene (see
Methods) and generated rank lists for each time point (19 pcw and 37 pcw) and
brain region (V1C, DFC, A1C and M1C), where high scoring genes have similar
expression levels in human brain developmental transcriptome and CH 4×
crosslinker condition, and different expression levels in human brain
developmental transcriptome and Matrigel condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6-13</xref>). GO
analysis for high scoring genes (rank score &gt; 3) for each brain region
at 19 pcw showed enrichment for neuronal-related processes, while high scoring
genes (rank score &gt; 3) for each brain region at 37 pcw demonstrated
enrichment for extracellular matrix-related processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6-13</xref>).
Additionally, we investigated how the presence of HA and increased cell density
in CH impacts gene expression profiles. In agreement with our previous findings,
adding HA to the CH decreased the correlation between the transcriptome of
co-cultured iN cells to the human brain transcriptome, whereas increasing cell
density lead to similar trends (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). We also
investigated the effect of varying the volume of CH with or without HA on the
gene expression profile of co-cultured iN cells and found that decreasing the
volume improved the enrichment of neurological processes while marginally
decreasing the correlation to the human brain transcriptome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">To compare broadly across all conditions tested, we performed
differential expression analysis of all conditions relative to stem cells. In
agreement with our previous results, we find that stem cells are enriched for
cell cycle and cell divisions processes and depleted for neurogenesis and
neuronal developmental processes. 2D cultures show marginal differences, whereas
3D cultures, with the exception of the HA condition, show the opposite pattern,
with enrichment for neuronal-related processes and reduced expression of cell
cycle and cell division genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13, Supplementary Table 14</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">We next compared the transcriptomes of the 3D tissues under all
conditions using PCA, which showed transcriptomic differences among various
conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). We also compared the
mechanical properties of encapsulating hydrogels, which displayed storage
modulus differences among various hydrogels used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). We profiled the mean correlation between the
transcriptome of the 3D tissues to the human brain transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 15a</xref>). Moving
from Matrigel conditions to CH conditions increased the correlation to four
subregions at later developmental time points (19 pcw and 37 pcw) while
decreasing the difference between the correlations at the early developmental
time point (12 pcw) and late developmental time point (37 pcw). Addition of HA
to CHs broadly decreased the correlation to four subregions at three
developmental time points (12 pcw, 19 pcw and 37 pcw) relative to their
corresponding CHs without HA. We observed the highest correlations to four
subregions at 19 pcw and 37 pcw developmental time points with CH with
4× crosslinker. In addition, expression levels of a number of genes
associated with neurological diseases varied across 3D conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 15b</xref>). These
results suggest that 3D tissues could serve as substrates for studying various
neurological diseases while providing transcriptomic correlation to the human
brain subregions at different developmental time points.</p>

<title>Generation of 3D neural tissues with human cell components</title>
<p id="P12">To better represent the cell composition of the human brain in our 3D
tissues, we developed a method to derive human astrocytic cells directly from
hESCs and used this to engineer 3D tissues of co-cultured human iN and
astrocytic cells. It was previously reported that overexpression of
<italic>NGN1/2</italic> in stem cells leads to a transient neural progenitor
state before the cells turn into iN cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, which we hypothesized could be exploited to derive
human astrocytic cells. We developed a method to induce formation of astrocytic
cells by terminating <italic>NGN1/2</italic> overexpression and adding a
morphogen, ciliary neurotrophic factor (cntf), at day 2, followed by passaging
cells at day 20 to eliminate neuron-like cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 16a, 17</xref>). The
majority of the cells thus derived were GFAP<sup>+</sup>,
S100β<sup>+</sup>, and Vimentin<sup>+</sup> at day
35, comparable to mouse astrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 18a</xref>). We also
analyzed the expression of <italic>GFAP</italic>, <italic>S100B</italic>,
<italic>VIM</italic>, and <italic>ALDH1L1</italic> by qPCR for cells exposed
to derivation protocols without any passaging at days 5, 15, and 30 using
undifferentiated hESCs, hESCs only exposed to morphogen, and human primary
astrocytes as controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 16b, Supplementary Fig. 18b</xref>).
<italic>GFAP</italic> expression was not detectable in undifferentiated
hESCs and in hESCs only exposed to morphogen but when morphogen was added
following transcriptional activation, <italic>GFAP</italic> levels increased.
Similarly, expression of <italic>S100B</italic>, <italic>VIM</italic>, and
<italic>ALDH1L1</italic> also gradually increased from day 5 to day 30
during the differentiation protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 16b, Supplementary Fig.
18b</xref>). The addition of fetal bovine serum (fbs), which is frequently
used to derive astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, decreased, but did not
abolish, the expression of all genes tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 18b</xref>). However,
fbs aided in the passaging steps of these cells for further expansion and was
therefore included in the differentiation protocol. We also performed bulk
RNA-seq throughout the course of astrocytic cell differentiation and observed
that expression levels of a number of astrocyte marker genes gradually increased
starting from day 15 and by day 30 reached levels similar to that of human
primary astrocytes. Moreover, these expression levels were still high at day 67
and day 114 in conditions combining transcription activation, morphogen, and
fbs, whereas undifferentiated hESCs and hESCs only exposed to morphogen lacked
high expression levels for the majority of astrocyte marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 18c</xref>). Consistent
with our qPCR results, addition of fbs decreased expression levels of astrocyte
marker genes at day 30, whereas expression levels of these marker genes was high
at day 67 and day 114 for the same condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.
6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary
Fig. 18c</xref>). Comparison to single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets of
fetal human cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and single-nuclei RNA-seq dataset of
adult human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> showed
similar trends: gradually increasing correlations to astrocytes in adult human
brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.
19a</xref>) and fetal human cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 19c</xref>) from day 15
to day 30, particularly for conditions with transcription activation and
morphogen. Addition of fbs decreased this trend (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 19a</xref>). We also
analyzed expression levels of marker genes of other cell types, such as radial
glia (RG), intermediate progenitor cells (IPC), excitatory neurons, and
inhibitory neurons, among the samples throughout the course of astrocytic cell
differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 18c</xref>), and
derived transcriptomic correlations between these samples and corresponding cell
types in fetal human cortex and adult human brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 19a-c</xref>). Although
these comparisons suggest there is some heterogeneity in the populations of
cells arising from the astrocytic cell differentiation protocols at the
transcriptomic level, immunostaining, qPCR and RNA-seq profiles of marker genes
support the identity of these cells as astrocytic, and we therefore co-cultured
them in 3D tissues with iN cells for further experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">To examine the impact of astrocytic cells on iN cells, we compared the
gene expression profiles of iN cells co-cultured with differentiated astrocytic
cells, human primary astrocytes, or cultured without any astrocytic cells. We
performed fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) of iN cells from all
cultures at week 5 with minimal cell contamination from astrocytic cells or
human primary astrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 19d,e</xref>). Gene expression profiling showed that
astrocytic cells cause gene expression differences in iN cells close to that
caused by human primary astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.
6c-e</xref>), further supporting the astrocytic-like cell fate arising from
our differentiation protocol.</p>
<p id="P14">To further explore the cell fates and transcriptional profiles of the
cells in our tissues, we performed single-cell sequencing on 3D co-cultures of
human iN cells with mouse astrocytes and with human astrocytic cells in CH
4× crosslinker at week 5. We performed clustering on scRNA-seq profiles
of human cells in both 3D co-cultures and identified 12 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 20a</xref>), and using
various cell type marker genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 20b-d</xref>) we
classified 5 main clusters of cell types: neurons, astrocytes, inhibitory
neurons, RG, and neuroepithelial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>).
iN cells co-cultured with mouse astrocytes contained only neuron cells (only
reads aligning to the human genome were analyzed), whereas iN cells co-cultured
with human astrocytic cells contained cells from clusters of neurons,
astrocytes, inhibitory neurons, RG, and neuroepithelial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>), suggesting that the astrocytic cell
differentiation protocol generates other transcriptionally distinct cell types
in addition to astrocytes, which was also observed in bulk RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 18c, Supplementary Fig.
19a-c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">We next examined whether cell type clusters we identified in our 3D
tissues transcriptionally resemble their counterparts in human brain by
comparing our data to scRNA-seq datasets of fetal human cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and single-nuclei RNA-seq datasets of adult human
brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Although we
see some expression of marker genes for IPCs, the transcriptomic correlation of
our neurons cluster to neurons in the fetal human cortex is higher than its
correlation to IPCs in fetal human cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.
7d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary
Fig. 20e, Supplementary Fig. 21a,b</xref>). Moreover, our neurons cluster
showed a high transcriptomic correlation to different types of excitatory
neurons in the fetal human cortex data, such as early and late born excitatory
neurons in the primary visual cortex (EN-V1-2) and prefrontal cortex (EN-PFC2),
and in the adult human brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d,f</xref>,
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 20f,
Supplementary Fig. 21a,b</xref>). In addition, the gene expression profile
of our RG cluster correlates more with RG cells in the fetal human cortex, such
as early RG (RG-early), dividing RG (RG-div2), and medial ganglionic eminence RG
(MGE-RG2), which can give rise to inhibitory neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.
7d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary
Fig. 20e, Supplementary Fig. 21a,b</xref>). Although our inhibitory neurons
cluster transcriptionally correlates with both inhibitory neuron types (such as
IN-CTX-MGE1; MGE-derived cortex inhibitory neurons) and excitatory neuron types
identified in the fetal human cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.
7d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary
Fig. 21a,b</xref>), in the adult human brain, it correlates most highly with
inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 20f</xref>).
Similarly, although our astrocyte cluster correlates more highly with RG cells
than with astrocytes in the fetal human cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 21a,b</xref>), its transcriptome correlation with
astrocytes in the adult human brain is higher than its correlation to other cell
types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 20f</xref>). This trend
is also observed in comparisons between scRNA-seq data from six-month-old human
brain organoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and
scRNA-seq data from the fetal human cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 21c</xref>). To explore this further, we performed
differential expression analysis between astrocytes and RG cells in the
scRNA-seq dataset of the human fetal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and identified the top 9 astrocyte-specific genes and
top 9 RG-specific genes based on log fold change (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 21d</xref>). The
average expression levels of these genes in the astrocyte and RG clusters in our
3D tissue and in data from the six-month-old human brain organoids varies
between these cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 21e,f</xref>), indicating that in both our 3D tissues
and the human brain organoids, astrocytic-like cells are present, but they are
not transcriptionally homogenous. Taken together, these results demonstrated
that cell types in our 3D tissue transcriptionally resemble their analogues in
fetal human cortex and adult human brain. Finally, comparison between scRNA-seq
profiles of our 3D tissues and scRNA-seq dataset of six-month-old human brain
organoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> revealed
that our cell type clusters show transcriptome correlation with their
counterparts in six-month-old human brain organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 20g</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">As a proof-of-concept, we tested the feasibility of performing
CRISPR-mediated genome editing in our engineered 3D neural tissues in a disease

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P17">3D neural tissues have the potential to be tractable models for studying the
human brain and neurological disorders, but to achieve this potential, they must
closely reflect the cell composition, ECM, and gene expression profiles of the human
brain. Here we analyzed how the transcriptome of iN cells in 3D tissues relates to
the human brain transcriptome and is affected by a number of tissue engineering
variables. Furthermore, we developed an approach to generate co-cultured iN and
astrocytic cells derived from hESCs in a 3D matrix that could be tuned to reflect
different transcriptomic states of the human developing brain transcriptome, which
will be helpful for the rapid generation of complex neurological disease models.</p>
<p id="P18">To gain a global view of the brain-like properties of these engineered
tissues, we compared the transcriptomes of cells cultured in 3D versus 2D and found
more enriched neuronal biological processes in iN cells cultured in 3D Matrigel than
2D cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>), which was not
affected by batch-to-batch variation in Matrigel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a-c</xref>). In addition,
transcriptome profiling showed enriched apoptotic and oxidative stress biological
processes in 2D cultures compared to 3D cultures and 3D cultures enabled
electrophysiological measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2,4</xref>), both suggesting that iN cells in 3D cultures
were healthier than cells in 2D cultures, although we did not directly test cell
viability. In addition, we co-cultured iN cells with mouse astrocytes both in 3D and
on 2D. Although iN cells in both co-cultures were electrophysiologically active at
later timepoints, the transcriptome of 3D co-cultured iN cells was more enriched in
neuronal biologically processes than that of iN cells on 2D, indicating 3D tissues
offer a closer approximation to the biology than 2D tissues. Varying cell seeding
densities or independent components of the encapsulating matrix (e.g., laminin,
collagens, or synthetic hydrogels) may lead to different characteristics of the iN
cells, avenues which could be explored in future functional studies.</p>
<p id="P19">Engineered neural tissues can be made more brain-like by adding other ECM
components, such as HA, which has been shown to promote better replication of the
brain microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Under the conditions we tested, however,
incorporation of HA in our 3D Matrigel co-cultures of iN cells did not strongly
improve the correlation with the transcriptome of the human developing brain,
although some individual neuronal transcripts as well as genes associated with
neurological diseases were upregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). We chose to use a high-molecular weight
HA and incorporated it in a high concentration of Matrigel (which showed a storage
modulus closed to Matrigel without HA due to the uncrosslinked state of HA in
Matrigel) to minimize its diffusion from the hydrogel structures while maintaining
its natural state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. However, other variables (such as chemical
modifications, concentration, and the source of HA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>)
or shorter culture times (such as 1 week) that were not tested may have a greater
impact on gene expression. Given that high-molecular weight HA is thought to inhibit
remyelination following central nervous system (CNS) injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>,
introducing HA into hydrogels could impede expression of genes involved in neuronal
development.</p>
<p id="P20">Matrix stiffness in engineered tissues can also impact cellular properties
and can be increased in a pure Matrigel hydrogel simply by increasing the
concentration of Matrigel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Alternatively, in a CH, stiffness
can be increased by increasing the amount of crosslinker while holding the
concentration of alginate and Matrigel constant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. We therefore investigated whether developing 3D
co-cultures of iN cells within CHs of Matrigel and alginate improved the
transcriptomic correlation to human brain samples. Alginate is a naturally occurred
polysaccharide, composed of mannuronic acid and guluronic acid with no cell adhesion
ligands, that can be crosslinked to form a network within Matrigel through addition
of divalent cations such as calcium (Ca<sup>+2</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. We demonstrated that increasing the
crosslinking of the alginate network in CHs (which lead to an increase in storage
modulus) can tune the correlation of the transcriptome of 3D co-cultured iN cells to
the transcriptome of particular sub-regions of the human brain at specific
developmental stages. Furthermore, modulating the amount of crosslinker and/or the
volume of the CH led to gene expression changes in specific neuronal transcripts,
including <italic>DLG4</italic>, <italic>GRIN3A</italic>, and <italic>SOD1</italic>
as well as changes in expression levels of genes associated with neurological
diseases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). As HA was previously integrated in crosslinked
alginate hydrogels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, we
incorporated HA in CHs of Matrigel and alginate and, in agreement with our other
results, found it had little effect. It will be informative to analyze the effects
of changing the hydrogel volume or removing the Matrigel on cellular state to better
understand how these parameters impact gene expression.</p>
<p id="P21">To better model cell composition in human brain within our 3D tissues, we
first developed a method to derive human astrocytic cells directly from hESCs. We
exploited a previously reported transient neural progenitor state of stem cells
induced by overexpression of neurogenins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> to differentiate cells towards an astrocytic phenotype.
Immunostaining, qPCR, and bulk RNA-seq showed that the derived astrocytic cells
express astrocyte markers and that this expression increases over time. By day 15,
we could detect the expression of marker genes for astrocytic cells, inhibitory
neurons, and RG, offering the potential to rapidly create 3D tissues with controlled
composition of these cell types by generating reporter cell lines using these
markers. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we evaluated the gene expression profiles
of the cells arising from our differentiation protocols and compared these to
published transcriptional datasets of fetal and adult human brain as well as human
brain organoids. We found that the cells present in our 3D co-cultured tissues
broadly reflect their counterparts in the human brain, and we observed interesting
similarities between the gene expression profiles in our system and in human brain
organoids as they relate to the human brain data. Overall, these results suggest
that we were able to generate relevant cell types, but further functional studies
are required to fully characterize these astrocytic cells and inhibitory neurons in
our system and it will be informative to test additional differentiation protocols
(such as use of other transcription factors or small molecules) to further expand
the cells types that can be studied in this system.</p>
<p id="P22">Our method of deriving both iN and astrocytic cells from the same pool of
hESCs allows for the rapid creation of engineered tissues with an isogenic
background. These 3D tissues composed of iN cells (at day 35) and astrocytic cells
(at day 118) exhibit transcriptional profiles that correlate with relevant cell
types in the human brain as well as with six-month-old human brain organoids,
suggesting this system may be a faster alternative to organoids. To show the
potential for studying the genetics of neurodegenerative diseases in our 3D neural
tissues, we perturbed three genes implicated in ALS and FTD using Cpf1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> directly in iN cells, and observed
at least 5% indel formation rates for each gene. Directly injecting AAV
mixtures within 3D tissues instead of mixing with culture medium could be tested in
future studies to improve indel rates. This approach could be extended by
independently targeting astrocytic cells within 3D tissues by using the GFAP
promoter in gene editing constructs.</p>
<p id="P23">Despite the potential for this approach as a scalable method for
interrogating the genetics of brain disorders, there are a number of limitations and
challenges. All 3D tissue models are limited in their ability to recapitulate
complex environmental features, such as the interplay between the immune system and
the central nervous system, vasculature and the signals that are distributed through
this network, and aging. Nevertheless, as the technology and our understanding of
the brain advances, it should be possible to develop increasingly complex tissues
that contain multiple cell types that develop over time.</p>
<sec id="S8">
<title>Outlook</title>
<p id="P24">By varying the parameters of the 3D neural matrix (e.g., adjusting the
composition), we have shown that our engineered tissues can be tuned to have
different expression levels of neuronal transcripts as well as genes associated
with neurological diseases and to reflect specific stages of the human brain
developmental transcriptome. Single-cell sequencing revealed that our 3D tissues
contain cell types that transcriptionally resemble their analogues in the human
brain, further supporting the utility of this system. In combination with genome
editing tools, which can be used to precisely disrupt specific genes in a
cell-type specific manner, these tissues offer an adaptable and genetically
tractable system for studying neurological disorders. In particular, the ability
to rapidly model polygenic diseases such as ALS, Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's, in a controllable environment will be particularly
beneficial to unraveling these complex diseases. This may be achieved by either
independently targeting gene function in neuronal and astrocytic cells or
developing 3D tissues directly from hESCs carrying the desired mutations and
utilizing single cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> or single nuclei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> RNA-seq methodologies in
combination with functional studies. The analysis described in this study as
well as continued interrogation of 3D culture systems will further aid the
development of more effective models for brain diseases.</p>

<title>Generation of iN cells from hESCs</title>
<p id="P26">To produce iN cells, hESCs were infected with lentiviral vectors. These
vectors provided constitutive expression of <italic>rtTA3</italic> driven by
human EF1α promoter, and doxycycline inducible expression of human
<italic>NGN1</italic> and <italic>NGN2</italic> driven by TRE promoter. The
Puromycin resistant gene was linked with <italic>NGN1</italic> and
<italic>NGN2</italic> by a P2A linker to enable selection. Lentiviral
infected hESCs were plated at ∼15×10<sup>3</sup>
cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in 15 cm tissue culture dishes pre-coated with 10 ml of
Growth Factor Reduced (GFR) Matrigel (Corning) (at 8.5 mg/ml - 10 mg/ml
concentration) diluted in DMEM at 1:100 for 30 min at 37 °C. Day 0
medium of plated stem cells contained stem cell culture medium and 2
μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) to initiate expression of
<italic>NGN1/2</italic>. Whole medium at Day 1 was replaced by a medium
containing 3 volumes of stem cell culture medium and 1 volume of neural culture

Neural culture medium was prepared by mixing 500 ml of neurobasal medium
(Thermo-Fisher Scientific), 10 ml of B27 supplement (Thermo-Fisher Scientific),
5 ml of penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo-Fisher Scientific), and 5 ml of Glutamax

<title>Primary mouse glia culture</title>
<p id="P27">Mouse glial cells were isolated from cortex of newborn C57 mice in
procedures carried out in accordance with Animal Care and Use regulations at the
Broad Institute with protocol (0008-06-14) approved by the Broad
Institute's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Cortices of newborn mice were dissected and digested by using papain for 30 min
and applying agitation. Dissociated cells were plated in tissue culture dishes
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Glial cells were passaged by
trypsinizing and replating at lower density more than eight times to remove
potential low amounts of mouse neurons in culture before their use in 2D and 3D
co-cultures with iN cells.</p>

<title>2D cultures and co-cultures of iN cells</title>
<p id="P28">For 2D cultures of iN cells, 5 glass coverslips (Corning-Biocoat) were
inserted per well of a 6-well plate. Then, each well with coverslips was coated
with 1.5 ml of GFR Matrigel diluted in DMEM at 1:100 for 30 min at 37
°C. The coating solution was aspirated from each well before cell
seeding. iN cells generated within 3 days as described were detached from
culture plates with accutase diluted in DPBS at 1:3. iN cells were seeded on
each pre-coated well with coverslips at 50×10<sup>3</sup>
cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in 3 ml medium made of 1:3 mixture of stem cell culture
medium and neural culture medium (hereafter 1:3 culture medium) with 2
μg/ml doxycycline. One day later, whole medium of each well was replaced
with 3 ml neural culture medium with 2 μg/ml doxycycline. On the second
day of seeding, 1 ml neural culture medium with doxycycline and
1-β-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) was added in each well, keeping
the final concentration of doxycycline in each well at 2 μg/ml and final
concentration of Ara-C in each well at 0.5-1 μM. One third of the whole
culture medium in each well was replaced every 3-4 days. For 2D co-cultures of
iN cells with mouse glia, 6-well plates with coverslips were prepared as
described above. Mouse astrocytes were detached from culture plates by using
trypsin. iN cells and mouse glia were mixed 1:1 and seeded on each pre-coated
well with coverslips at 100×10<sup>3</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in 3 ml
1:3 culture medium with 2 μg/ml doxycycline. For the rest of the

<title>3D cultures and co-cultures of iN cells</title>
<p id="P29">Three-dimensional cultures and co-cultures of iN cells were performed by
encapsulating them within hydrogels. These hydrogels were made of pure GFR
Matrigel or GFR Matrigel and hyaluronic acid (HA) or GFR Matrigel and alginate
or GFR Matrigel, alginate and HA. Before encapsulation experiments, the
following preparations were done: GFR Matrigel was kept on ice, sodium alginate
(PRONOVA UP VLVG, NovaMatrix) was first reconstituted at 4% (40 mg/ml)
in a medium made of 1:3 mixture of mTeSR and neurobasal medium (without
supplements) with 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) (Sigma) and this solution was
then incubated for 6 hours at 37 °C for further dissolution of alginate.
This alginate stock solution was passed through a 0.22 μm filter (EMD
Millipore) and kept on ice. Calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) solution (1M in
water, Sigma) was diluted in a medium made of 1:3 mixture of mTeSR and
neurobasal medium (without supplements) at concentrations of 25 mM, 12.5 mM,
6.25 mM and 3.125 mM. These CaCl<sub>2</sub> solutions were individually passed
through 0.22 μm filters and kept on ice. HA sodium salt (Sigma,
#53747) was dissolved at 1% (10 mg/ml) concentration under
sterile conditions in a medium made of 1:3 mixture of mTeSR and neurobasal
medium (without supplements) and then incubated for 6 hours at 37 °C for
further dissolution of HA and frequently vortexed. This HA stock solution was
kept on ice. A sheet of Parafilm and a microcentrifuge tube rack were sprayed
with 70 % Ethanol and kept in a biohood under UV light for 30 min.
Parafilm dimples were formed by placing a sheet of Parafilm on the
microcentrifuge tube rack and pressing gently on Parafilm. Serum-free DMEM was
kept on ice.</p>
<p id="P30">Three-dimensional cultures of iN cells were performed by encapsulating
them within 200 μl hydrogels of Matrigel at 10×10<sup>6</sup>
cells/ml. iN cells generated within 3 days were detached as previously described
and filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer (Corning), and pelleted at
desired amount. The final concentration of encapsulating Matrigel was either 4.6
mg/ml or 7.36 mg/ml. As the Matrigel stock concentration varied from batch to
batch (8.5 mg/ml -10 mg/ml), different amounts of 1:3 culture medium were used
to adjust the final concentration of Matrigel in hydrogels and kept on ice until
used. A desired amount of Matrigel stock was placed in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube
and kept on ice. A pipette tip was chilled by pipetting cold serum-free DMEM.
This pipette tip was then used to resuspend iN cell pellet in pre-chilled 1:3
culture medium. These resuspended iN cells were then mixed with the Matrigel in
the 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. The final concentration of iN cells in this cell-gel
solution was 10×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml and the final concentration of
Matrigel in this solution was either 4.6 mg/ml or 7.36 mg/ml. The cell-gel
solution was vortexed for 10 s and then kept on ice while chilling a pipette tip
by pipetting cold serum-free DMEM. This pipette tip was then used to place 200
μl droplets of cell-gel solution one by one on Parafilm dimples. These
droplets were then placed at 37 °C for 1 hour to allow gelling of
Matrigel. Each droplet was subsequently placed in one well of a 6-well plate by
gently pipetting from Parafilm with 1 ml of 1:3 culture medium with 6
μg/ml doxycycline. After placing all droplets, 2 ml of same culture
medium was added to each well. At day-1, whole medium of each well was
substituted with 3 ml neural culture medium containing 6 μg/ml
doxycycline. On the second day of encapsulation, 1 ml neural culture medium with
doxycycline and Ara-C was added in each well by keeping final concentration of
doxycycline in each well at 6 μg/ml and final concentration of Ara-C in
each well at 0.5-1μM. One third of the whole culture medium in each well
was renewed every 3-4 days.</p>
<p id="P31">3D co-cultures of iN cells with mouse astrocytes were carried out by
encapsulating them within 200 μl hydrogels made of either Matrigel
(either 4.6 mg/ml or 7.36 mg/ml) or Matrigel and HA (7.36 mg/ml Matrigel and 1
mg/ml or 1.5 mg/ml final HA concentration) or composite hydrogels (CH) (4.6
mg/ml Matrigel and 0.5% final concentration of Alginate, with and
without HA). iN cells were prepared as described above. Mouse astrocytes were
detached by trypsinizing and filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer, and
pelleted at desired amount. All hydrogels contained 1:1 mixture of iN cells and
mouse astrocytes. For pure Matrigel hydrogels, the cell concentration was either
20×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml or 30×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml.
For hydrogels of Matrigel and HA, the cell concentration was
30×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml Different amounts of 1:3 culture medium
were used to adjust the final concentration of Matrigel and HA in hydrogels and
kept on ice until use. Tissues were prepared as above with the following
additions: For hydrogels of Matrigel and HA, a desired volume from 1% HA
stock was pipetted in Matrigel in the tube to a final concentration of HA at
either 1 mg/ml or 1.5 mg/ml. Cell suspensions were then mixed either with pure
Matrigel or with mixture of Matrigel and HA in the centrifuge tube. For CH, the
cell concentration within hydrogels was either 20×10<sup>6</sup>
cells/ml or 30×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. For CH containing HA, the cell
concentration was 30×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. Calcium chloride was used
to crosslink Alginate in CH. Each 200 μl CH was made by mixing 150
μl cell-gel solution with 50 μl calcium chloride solution on a
Parafilm dimple. Cell-gel solution was prepared accordingly so that in each 200
μl CH the final concentration of Matrigel was 4.6 mg/ml and that of
Alginate was 0.5%. For each 200 μl CH containing HA, the final
HA concentration was either 1 mg/ml or 1.5 mg/ml. To prepare gel solutions, a
desired volume of Matrigel was placed within a centrifuge tube with a
pre-chilled pipette tip and then the desired volume of 4% Alginate was
mixed with Matrigel in the centrifuge tube with a pre-chilled pipette tip,
vortexed for 10 s, and kept on ice. For CHs containing HA, a desired volume of
10 mg/ml HA was mixed with Matrigel and Alginate solution, vortexed for 10 s,
and kept on ice. A volume of 1:3 culture medium required to adjust the
concentration of components in gel solution was used to resuspend 1:1 mixture of
iN cells and mouse astrocytes. These resuspended cells were then mixed with gel
solutions and vortexed for 10 s. Each 200 μl droplet of CH was made by
first placing 50 μl calcium chloride solution (at concentrations of 25
mM, 12.5 mM, 6.25 mM, and 3.125 mM) on a Parafilm dimple and then rapidly mixing
150 μl cell-gel solution with this calcium chloride solution on a
Parafilm dimple with a pre-chilled pipette tip without generating bubbles. 50
μl droplets of CHs were generated in the same manner by adjusting
volumes. To allow Matrigel gelling, all droplets were then placed at 37
°C for 1 hour. After forming hydrogels, the same protocol as previously
described was followed for the remaining of the experiment, except the final
concentration of Ara-C in each well was at 2-5 μM, which was added with
the neural culture medium in each well on the second day of encapsulation.</p>

further match the BrainSpan dataset, the data were processed using Gencode v10.
RSEQtools, which was utilized by the BrainSpan group, to obtain gene-level

driving the increased correlation in expression with BrainSpan data in iN cells
co-cultured in CH 4× crosslinker compared to iN cells co-cultured in
Matrigel, for each gene we calculated both the squared log fold change between
iN cells co-cultured in Matrigeland BrainSpan data and the squared log fold
change between iN cells co-cultured in CH 4× crosslinker and BrainSpan
data (using RPKM normalized data), and took the difference between the two
values to get our final score.</p>

<p id="P44">3D co-cultures of iN cells with mouse astrocytes and with human
astrocytic cells were generated in 200 μl CHs made by using 12.5 mM
calcium chloride solution. A 1:1 mixture of iN cells and mouse astrocytes was
encapsulated (at a final cell concentration of 30×10<sup>6</sup>
cells/ml) in corresponding CHs and cultured as described above. Astrocytic cells
derived following the protocol termed “moprhogen + fbs”
cultured until day 83 in passage 5 and in passage 6 were detached from culture
plates with accutase and pooled. A 1:1 mixture of iN cells and astrocytic cells
was encapsulated (at a final cell concentration of 30×10<sup>6</sup>
cells/ml) in corresponding CHs and cultured as described above, with the
following change: the culture mediums did not contain doxycycline. At week 5 of
culture, cell disassociation from 3D tissues was performed utilizing a
previously described protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> with the following modifications. Briefly, each 3D tissue
was cut into small pieces with a blade and immersed in 1 ml of 20:1 mix of
papain solution (PAP2, Worthington) and DNase solution (D2, Worthington) in a
15ml tube, which was then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and shaken by
hand every 5 min. After 20 min, pieces of 3D tissues in this solution were
pipetted for further dissociation, and then incubated at 37 °C for 10
min. 1 ml Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS, Worthington) was mixed
with the solution of dissociated tissue. The cloudy cell suspension from this
mix was transferred to a new 15 ml tube and mixed with 1.9 ml inhibitor solution
(OI.BSA, Worthington). This final solution was then centrifuged at
300<italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Cell pellets from three biological
replicates of each 3D co-culture condition (iN cells with mouse astrocytes and
iN cells with human astrocytic cells) were pooled by resuspending cell pellets
in ice-cold DPBS with 0.2%BSA (Sigma), which was then passed through a
30 μm filter (Sysmex). Cell suspensions for each condition, 3D
co-cultures of iN cells with mouse astrocytes and 3D co-cultures of iN cells
with human astrocytic cells, were loaded onto the 10× Chromium
Instrument (10× Genomics) through two independent channels to generate
single-cell GEMs (Gel bead in EMulsion). Single-cell RNA-Seq libraries were
constructed using 10× Chromium 3′ Solution (10×
Genomics) following the manufacturer's protocol and sequenced on a
NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina) with 26 bases for read1 and 57 bases for
read2.</p>

<title>Single-cell data analysis</title>
<p id="P45">Cellranger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> was used
to map fastq files to the joint hg19 and mm10 transcriptome, with the option
--force-cells=10,000. The cell by gene (hg19 genes only, mm10 genes were
explored separately for QC purposes) count matrix was loaded into R using Seurat
v1.3<sup>64</sup>. The data was normalized to be log counts per million, and
we removed all cells expressing less than 1000 human genes or more than 300
mouse genes. MeanVarPlot was used to find variable genes (with
x.low.cutoff=1). The number of genes and percent mitochondrial RNA were
regressed out with the RegressOut function, and PCA was performed using PCAFast.
Rtsne was applied to the PCA matrix using the top 13 PCs. Clustering was
performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, using the top 13 PCs and a 100 shared nearest neighbor
graph. Cell types of clusters were identified using known marker genes. Note
that the clusters identified as neurons express many IPC markers at high levels,
but comparison with outside datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (see below)
suggests these clusters are more similar to neurons than IPCs (see Results).</p>
<p id="P46">We loaded numerous outside single cell datasets of human fetal
cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and a single-nuclei dataset of adult
post-mortem human brain tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, and a single cell dataset of six-month-old human brain
organoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> into R
with Seurat. All data were normalized to be log counts per million, and we
removed all cells with less than 500 genes. MeanVarPlot was used to find
variable genes (with x.low.cutoff=1). For each dataset, we used the
clustering available from their respective papers, and identified cell types
based on marker genes. In addition, we extracted the forebrain cluster from the
six-month-old human brain organoid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> dataset, and subclustered it using the same pipeline as was
used for our single-cell dataset, except we did not regress out percent
mitochondria, and used 12 PCs and 50 shared nearest neighbors for
clustering.</p>
<p id="P47">Correlation heatmaps comparing clusters in our single-cell dataset to
clusters in published single-cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and single-nuclei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> datasets were generated as follows: for
each dataset, the Seurat function AverageCluster was used to generate the
average expression profiles of clusters in that dataset. Variable genes from the
published single-cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> or single-nuclei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> dataset were identified by MeanVarPlot and then used to
calculate the correlation between these average transcript profiles. For
comparison between bulk RNA-Seq of conditions involved in our astrocyte
differentiation protocol and single cell and single-nuclei datasets of the human
brain, a similar procedure as above was used to calculate the average expression
of each cell type in the single cell or single-nuclei data. These average
profiles were then compared to the expression profiles from the bulk data
(measured in log TPM) using Pearson correlation.</p>

condition. Bars show mean ± SEM. (<bold>c</bold>) Pearson's
correlations between RNA-sequencing data of human iN cells cultured/co-cultured
in different 3D conditions at 5 weeks and human brain transcriptome data of 2
different subregions at 3 fetal developmental stages. V1C: primary visual cortex
(striate cortex, area V1/17); DFC: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; pcw:
post-conceptual weeks (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 15a</xref>). Dots
represent correlation values between a 3D condition and a brainspan sample. Each
brainspan timepoint-region pair has 1 sample except for 12 pcw, which had 3
samples available for each subregion. Bars show mean correlation ± SEM.

<p>Generation of 3D neural tissues composed of human iN and astrocytic cells.
(<bold>a</bold>) Astrocytic cells were derived from hESCs using a
combination of transcription factors used for neural induction
(<italic>NGN1</italic> and <italic>NGN2</italic>), a morphogen (cntf,
ciliary neurotrophic factor), and fetal bovine serum (fbs). Expression levels of
marker genes for a variety of cell types across different conditions of
differentiation protocols at different time points. Undifferentiated hESCs were
used as a negative control and human primary astrocytes (huPAst) were used as
positive control. Astro: Astrocyte marker genes; RG: Radial Glia marker genes;
NE: Neuroepithelial cells marker genes; IPC: Intermediate Progenitor Cells
marker genes; ExcN: Excitatory Neurons marker genes; InhbN: Inhibitory Neurons
marker genes. Color schemes are based on z-score distribution. (n=3 for
all conditions). (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 16, 17, 18, 19a,b,c</xref>). (<bold>b</bold>) Schematic
