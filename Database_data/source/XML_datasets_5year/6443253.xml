<title>SUMMARY</title>
<p id="P3">Cortical hyperexcitability is a hallmark of fragile X syndrome (FXS). In the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse model of FXS,
cortical hyperexcitability is linked to sensory hypersensitivity and seizure susceptibility. It remains unclear why homeostatic
mechanisms fail to prevent such activity. Homeostatic intrinsic plasticity (HIP) adjusts membrane excitability through regulation
of ion channels to maintain activity levels following activity perturbation. Despite the critical role of HIP in the maturation of
excitability, it has not been examined in FXS. Here, we demonstrate that HIP does not operate normally in a disease model, FXS.
HIP was either lost or exaggerated in two distinct neuronal populations from Fmr1 KO cortical cultures. In addition, we have
identified a mechanism for homeostatic intrinsic plasticity. Compromising HIP function during development could leave cortical
neurons in the FXS nervous system vulnerable to hyperexcitability.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="P6">Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is the leading monogenetic cause of autism and inherited form of
intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bassell and Warren, 2008</xref>). Patients with FXS do not express the fragile
X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and suffer from a diversity of debilitating symptoms, including sensory hypersensitivity,
seizures, and sleep disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Contractor et al., 2015</xref>). The mouse model of FXS, the Fmr1
knockout (KO), is hypersensitive to sensory stimuli and displays increased seizure susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Contractor et al., 2015</xref>). Many studies <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> have now demonstrated that
the Fmr1 KO cortex exhibits hyperexcitable features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gibson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gonçalves et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gross et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). A wide variety of mechanisms underlying cortical hyperexcitability have been reported,
including alterations in synaptic transmission and ion channel expression and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kalmbach et
al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Ronesi et al., 2012</xref>). Despite significant progress in this field, the
hyperexcitable features and the underlying mechanisms reported are often heterogeneous if not contradictory. Although it is clear that
the mechanisms underlying cortical hyperexcitability in FXS are complicated and multifactorial, recognition of a guiding principle
driving the expression of these altered mechanisms would be transformative.</p>
<p id="P7">One set of mechanisms that is known to be important for ensuring appropriate levels of excitability is referred to as
homeostatic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Davis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Desai, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Turrigiano, 2011</xref>). Homeostatic mechanisms are expressed in the nervous system to maintain an
appropriate level of neuronal activity despite ongoing challenges to the network. Homeostatic plasticity is thought to be particularly
important during early development, a period characterized by vast challenges to neuronal activity due to increases in cell size, the
transition of GABA from excitatory to inhibitory, and changes in ion channel expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Marder and
Goaillard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Wenner, 2014</xref>). Despite these major alterations, neuronal and
network function is remarkably stable, and homeostatic mechanisms are thought to be especially important in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Marder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</xref>). The
hyperexcitability associated with FXS suggests that homeostatic mechanisms are either incapable of preventing increased excitability
or that the loss of FMRP directly impairs homeostatic mechanisms. Recent work suggests that one type of homeostatic plasticity,
synaptic scaling, fails in the Fmr1 KO hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sarti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Soden and Chen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">Although less studied, homeostatic regulation of intrinsic membrane excitability may be even more influential in setting
network excitability than synaptic scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Karmarkar and Buonomano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Marder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wilhelm et al., 2009</xref>). This homeostatic intrinsic
plasticity (HIP) regulates the expression of voltage-gated ion channels to alter membrane excitability and thereby maintain certain
features of neural function such as firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Desai, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Desai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Turrigiano et al., 1995</xref>). Interestingly, FMRP has previously
been shown to regulate a subset of ion channels, some of which are known to be regulated by HIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Contractor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Desai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Turrigiano et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wilhelm et al., 2009</xref>). In FXS, the loss of FMRP could
significantly impair the function of HIP leading to dysregulated excitability levels. We therefore examined the function of HIP in the
Fmr1 KO. We hypothesized that HIP was either absent or functioned inappropriately in Fmr1 KO cortical neurons, which contributed to
hyperexcitability. In order to test this idea, we used primary cultures of mouse cortical Fmr1 KO neurons and assessed the function of
HIP following prolonged activity deprivation. In summary, we find that HIP does not operate appropriately in the KO but that the
alterations observed in these neurons depend on the specific cell population. These results show that a fundamental neuronal mechanism
implicated in maintaining neural activity levels through development is not working normally in Fmr1 KO cortical neurons.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Baseline Intrinsic Membrane Excitability Is Not Enhanced in Fmr1 KO Primary Cortical Excitatory Neurons</title>
<p id="P9">We examined if cultured Fmr1 KO cortical neurons displayed hyperexcitability at baseline by measuring action potential (AP)
threshold (the current and voltage necessary to trigger an AP) and firing frequency. We recorded from large, pyramidal-shaped
neurons (presumed excitatory) at days <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) 10–15. We found that AP threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>), and the number of spikes per current step (shown as “spike number
frequency” in Hz) were no different between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, we
measured no differences in passive membrane properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The
observation that these electrophysiologically assessed properties were similar in wild-type (WT) and KO cells raised the
possibility that hyperexcitability may not emerge in cortical Fmr1 KO neurons until later stages of development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Some Features of Homeostatic Intrinsic Plasticity Are Intact in Cortical Fmr1 KO Neurons</title>
<p id="P10">Previous studies have shown an absence of synaptic scaling in hippocampal Fmr1 KO neurons following activity deprivation
with TTX (Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker) and APV (NMDA receptor blocker) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sarti et al.,
2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Soden and Chen, 2010</xref>). We therefore used this pharmacological approach to
test the hypothesis that HIP was altered as well. For purposes of clarity we use the following terminology: WT or KO Con
(untreated cortical cultures/control) and WT T/A or KO T/A (cortical cultures treated for 48 h with TTX and APV). As expected, we
found that AP threshold was reduced in WT T/A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>), and the number of spikes
generated in response to increasing current injections was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).
Surprisingly, the compensatory adjustments following TTX/APV treatment were no different between WT and Fmr1 KO cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These initial findings appear to suggest that HIP is acting in a normal fashion in
cortical Fmr1 KO neurons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>A Subset of Cortical Fmr1 KO Neurons Displays Loss of HIP</title>
<p id="P11">Although many aspects of excitability appeared to be similar between WT Con and KO Con neurons, we noted that following
chronic activity deprivation there were striking differences in the proportions of single-spiking neurons (i.e., cells that spike
only once at all steps; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) and multi-spiking neurons (i.e., cells that spike more
than once during the step protocol; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Approximately 50% of the WT Con neurons
exhibited a single-spiking (SS) profile, while almost all WT T/A neurons were multi-spiking (MS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This conversion from SS neurons to a MS phenotype represents a previously unrecognized mechanism of HIP.
Strikingly, this conversion from SS to MS neurons failed to occur in the Fmr1 KO cultures, where the proportion of SS neurons was
statistically indistinguishable between KO Con and KO T/A sister cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).
Although our total n for the WT T/A was lower than other conditions, power analysis demonstrated that our n was sufficient to
identify the true proportions of SS and MS neurons (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">STAR Methods</xref> for power analysis;
power = 0.98). Interestingly, although SS Fmr1 KO neurons were unable to convert to the MS phenotype, we did observe a
non-significant reduction in the threshold current of KO T/A SS compared with KO Con SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure
2B2</xref>), which was due to a significant increase in input resistance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>A Subset of Cortical Fmr1 KO Neurons Displays Exaggerated HIP</title>
<p id="P12">The inappropriate maintenance of a large SS population following TTX/APV in the Fmr1 KO compared with WT cultures
significantly affected our analysis of the spike number frequency in response to increasing current injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). To better compare multi-spiking populations between genotypes, we analyzed the number of
spikes generated per step from only MS neurons. Applying this approach, we observed a significantly larger increase of spike
number in KO T/A compared with WT T/A through steps 6, 7, and 8 (150–210 pA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures
2C1–2C3</xref>). The populations of WT T/A MS cells and KO T/A MS cells appeared to be distinct. KO T/A MS neurons were
likely to be derived from cells that were multi-spiking before treatment, as SS cells failed to convert to the MS phenotype.
However, the WT T/A MS cells were likely to be derived from cells that were either MS or SS. We considered the possibility that KO
T/A MS cells expressed more spiking than in WT T/A MS cells because the SS cells that converted to MS cells in the WT had smaller
spike numbers. Several observations argue against such a possibility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure
S1</xref>): (1) we did not see any evidence of a bimodal distribution of firing frequency in WT T/A MS cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>), (2) the proportion of cells firing at ≥ 10Hz on steps 6–8
(150–210 pA) was far larger for KO T/A MS cells compared with WT T/A MS cells (WT T/A MS versus KO T/A MS: step 6, 9%
versus 48%; step 7, 14% versus 40%; step 8, 18% versus 40%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1A and
S1B</xref>), and finally, (3) we noted that for steps 4–8, the two or three cells with the highest firing rates were
always KO T/A MS cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">Two results became clear when we measured the spike time interval between the first two spikes at each of the depolarizing
steps (shown as “spike interval frequency” in Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). First, we noticed
that spike interval frequency was lower in KO Con MS cells compared with the WT Con MS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure
2D</xref>). Although this was true for the interval between the first two spikes, overall spike interval frequency was not
different between WT and KO controls as the number of spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C1</xref>) and period of
spiking (duration between first and last spike; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E1</xref>) were nearly identical. The
results contribute to the observation that KO cells were not more excitable than the WT at baseline. Second, although spike number
frequency was higher in the KO T/A MS cells compared with the WT T/A MS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures
2C1–2C3</xref>), we did not observe any differences in spike interval frequency in these populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). By assessing the duration between the first and last spike generated per step, KO T/A MS
cells fired more APs than WT T/A MS cells by firing for a longer period rather than at a faster rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E1 and 2E2</xref>). However, because of the slower spike interval frequency in KO Con MS cells, the
spike interval frequency was increased to a greater extent following TTX/APV treatment in the KO compared with WT multi-spikers,
consistent with exaggerated HIP in these cells. Finally, we found a significant reduction in threshold current for both WT T/A MS
cells and KO T/A MS cells compared with their untreated counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>Homeostatic Synaptic Scaling in Cortical Fmr1 KO Neurons</title>
<p id="P14">One of our initial motivations for studying homeostatic plasticity in the Fmr1 KO cortex were the findings that AMPAergic
and GABAergic synaptic scaling were absent in the Fmr1 KO hippocampus following TTX/APV treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sarti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Soden and Chen, 2010</xref>). However, it remained unknown whether
scaling was perturbed in different regions of the Fmr1 KO brain. We therefore tested whether scaling was also impaired in cortical
Fmr1 KO neurons. Unexpectedly, we found that AMPAergic synaptic up-scaling was intact in KO T/A cells. We observed a similar
increase in the miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A1</xref>) and
a clear rightward shift in the distribution of mEPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A2</xref>). This shift in
the distribution of both WT T/A and KO T/A mEPSC amplitudes exhibited a multiplicative relationship to untreated control
amplitudes, consistent with synaptic scaling (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">STAR Methods</xref>; Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">TTX/APV treatment did not trigger GABAergic down-scaling in cortical WT or KO neurons. There were no differences in
miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSC) amplitudes among any of the four conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B1 and 3B2</xref>). We also found no differences in mEPSC or mIPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">Thus, homeostatic synaptic scaling was no different in WT and Fmr1 KO cortical neurons and therefore would be unlikely to
contribute to cortical hyperexcitability. These findings further focus our attention on the loss and gain of HIP function as a
mechanism underlying cortical hyperexcitability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S8">
<title>Reduction of AMPA Receptor-Mediated Transmission Also Triggers Altered HIP in Cortical Fmr1 KO Neurons</title>
<p id="P17">In order to test HIP function in WT and KO cultures in response to a distinct and less severe activity perturbation, we
treated cultures with the AMPA receptor blocker NBQX. We found that NBQX treatment produced a non-significant trend toward a
reduction in the proportion of SS neurons in WT cultures, but this reduction was less apparent in Fmr1 KO cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, chronic AMPAR blockade led to a significant increase in spike interval
frequency of MS KO neurons that was absent in the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B1 and 4B2</xref>). Specifically,
Fmr1 KO neurons fired a second AP more quickly. We did not observe an obvious difference in spike number frequency between
genotypes after NBQX, although the KO cells did appear to have a stronger increase than WT cells in the early steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). In short, we found that Fmr1 KO neurons displayed functionally similar alterations
in HIP function after either NBQX or TTX/APV treatment, but the phenotypic changes of NBQX were less pronounced than TTX/APV, and
in some cases qualitatively distinct. Surprisingly, NBQX did not trigger reductions in threshold current or threshold voltage
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4A and S4B</xref>), did not increase mEPSC amplitude or frequency
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4C and S4D</xref>), and also did not change mIPSC amplitude or
frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4E and S4F</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that
altered HIP function is expressed in response to multiple pharmacological types of activity deprivation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S9">
<title>Activity Perturbation Alters AP Parameters</title>
<p id="P18">Previous work has demonstrated that specific ion channel conductances mediate distinct components of the AP waveform
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bean, 2007</xref>). Thus, to estimate how
activity perturbation (TTX/APV or NBQX) may have triggered different changes in ion channel populations, a comprehensive analysis
of AP parameters was conducted. We start with the first AP generated during the first step that exhibited an AP (called
“threshold AP”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) and then assess the first APs generated during the
current steps expressing the overcompensation in KO T/A MS cells (steps 6–8, i.e., 150–210 pA).</p>
<p id="P19">Interestingly, we found that KO Con APs had significant increases in rise time and afterhyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude
compared with WT Con APs, consistent with the idea that loss of FMRP alters the function of several ion channel populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). In contrast, we observed no differences between single-spiking
or multi-spiking cells in threshold AP parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>) or passive
properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S2 and S3</xref>). Thus, despite significant differences in
their functional output (firing single versus multiple spikes), these cell populations appear otherwise similar in AP
waveform.</p>
<p id="P20">As described below, differences in AP parameters were observed in MS neurons in treated and control conditions. We
considered the possibility that the failure of HIP to convert KO SS neurons into MS neurons would be associated with weak or no
changes in AP parameters. Consistent with this idea, following treatment (TTX/APV or NBQX), KO SS neurons did not show significant
changes in any of the parameters of the threshold AP compared with KO Con SS cells, although trends were observed (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6B</xref>). Furthermore, these
changes were less prominent in SS compared with MS KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). The results are
consistent with impaired regulation of ion channel function in non-converting Fmr1 KO cells.</p>
<p id="P21">In the case of exaggerated HIP in which KO T/A MS cells had greater increases in spike number frequency compared with WT
T/A MS cells, we hypothesized that we would observe larger changes in AP parameters (i.e., ion channel conductances) in KO T/A MS
neurons. Indeed, we found that KO T/A MS cells displayed significantly larger treatment-dependent reductions in threshold AP width
and rise time than WT T/A MS cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6A</xref>). Although AHP amplitude of the threshold AP was significantly reduced in treated
KO MS cells, it was also reduced in treated WT MS cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6A</xref>). These results suggest that Na<sup>+</sup> channels rather than K<sup>+</sup>
channels might be involved in the expression of exaggerated HIP. Consistent with the idea that Na<sup>+</sup> channels were
important in the overcompensation of spike number frequency in steps 6–8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C1</xref>),
we observed an overcompensation of the maximum slope in these same steps for KO T/A MS cells compared with WT T/A MS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5E and 5F</xref>). On the other hand, when we measured the AHP amplitude of the first five APs
(averaged across step 6–8), we saw no differences across genotypes or conditions in the MS cells at any point in the spike
train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). This result suggests that reduction in AHP amplitude, and thus
K<sup>+</sup>-channel conductance associated with the AP, is not critical in driving the overcompensation.</p>
<p id="P22">Next, we correlated slope of the rising phase of the AP or AHP amplitude with spike number frequency in each cell.
Interestingly, when we correlated maximum slope with spike number frequency for steps 6–8, we observed significant
correlations for both WT T/A MS cells and KO T/A MS cells, consistent with the idea that rise time, and presumably Na<sup>+</sup>
channels, are associated with determining the number of spikes a cell generates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>).
In contrast, when we correlated AHP amplitude (steps 6–8), we did not observe correlations with spike number frequency
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>).</p>
<p id="P23">In summary, our results suggest that (1) Fmr1 KO MS cells display larger changes in Na<sup>+</sup> channel function and
that this difference likely contributes to an exaggerated HIP, and, conversely, (2) SS Fmr1 KO neurons display reduced changes in
AP parameters and thus underlying ion channel conductances. Together, the observed changes in AP waveform provide indications of
some of the channels that could be involved in the loss and gain of homeostatic regulation observed in the KO.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<sec id="S11">
<title>Compensatory Shift in WT Neurons from Single- to Multi-spiking Phenotype Fails in the Fmr1 KO</title>
<p id="P24">Several previous studies have shown that activity perturbations can trigger changes in ion channel conductances that lead
to homeostatic compensations in some aspect of membrane excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Desai et al., 1999</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Turrigiano et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wilhelm et al., 2009</xref>).
Here we describe a distinct form of HIP in which chronic activity perturbation converts single-spiking neurons into multi-spiking
neurons, which should elevate the excitability of the network. Strikingly, this conversion fails to occur in Fmr1 KO neurons.</p>
<p id="P25">What are the mechanisms underlying this conversion in the WT, and why might it fail in the KO? WT SS cells convert to a
multi-spiking phenotype through what must be a change in channel conductances that favor multiple spike generation, while these
changes would not be replicated in the KO. Although SS Fmr1 KO neurons fail to convert to MS neurons, they do show some
compensatory trends such as reductions in threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B2</xref>), rise time, and AHP
amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), but these changes may not be sufficient for conversion. Alternatively,
the channels mediating the conversion could be separate from those shaping the AP waveform. Although we do not currently know
which channels are involved in the conversion from single- to multi-spiking neurons, potential candidates include the delayed
rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels, slow K<sup>+</sup> conductance (M-current), and Na<sup>+</sup> persistent inward currents
(NaPICs). Each of these conductances have been shown to shape firing pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bean, 2007</xref>).
In these scenarios, KO SS neurons would fail to alter these channels sufficiently, thus preventing the conversion to a MS
phenotype. Importantly, FMRP has been shown to regulate or associate with the delayed rectifier potassium channel Kv1.1 and
slow-activating potassium channel Kv7.2, and the NaPIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Contractor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Deng and Klyachko, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kalmbach et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, Kv1.1 and the slow-activating K<sup>+</sup> channel
kv7.2 have also recently been shown to be targets of HIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kuba et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Overall our results suggest that FMRP is necessary for the WT conversion
from SS to MS neurons.</p>

<sec id="S12">
<title>Compensatory Increase in the Firing Frequency of WT Multi-spiking Cells Is Exaggerated in the Fmr1 KO</title>
<p id="P26">Following activity deprivation, MS WT cells increase their overall excitability, and this is associated with a significant
reduction in the AHP amplitude as well as trends toward reduced AP rise time and AP width (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6A</xref>), suggesting that alterations in Na<sup>+</sup>
and K<sup>+</sup> conductances could facilitate increased excitability. Interestingly, treated MS Fmr1 KO neurons increase their
spike number frequency to an even greater extent, and this was associated with a significant increase in the maximum slope of the
rising phase of the AP during the steps when we observed the overcompensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5E and
5F</xref>). Moreover, rise time, but not AHP amplitude, correlated with spike number frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5H and 5I</xref>), suggesting that treatment-induced changes in Na<sup>+</sup> channels could contribute to the
increase in spike number frequency and that the changes in Na<sup>+</sup> channel function were greater in the KO. Previous
literature has shown that FMRP interacts with Nav1.2 and Nav 1.6 at the level of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Darnell
et al., 2011</xref>), and both transient and persistent Na<sup>+</sup> conductances are increased in mature cortical Fmr1 KO
neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Deng and Klyachko, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Routh et al.,
2017</xref>). One possibility is that HIP could trigger increased Na<sup>+</sup> channel function in KO MS neurons because of a
loss of FMRP translation suppression. This exaggerated plasticity is reminiscent of the overactive mGluR pathway mediating LTD in
the Fmr1 KO hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Huber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Osterweil et
al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively, impairments in HIP may be attributed to loss of FMRP’s translation-independent
interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Contractor et al., 2015</xref>). Our result introduces a potentially novel mechanism
whereby an impaired homeostatic intrinsic plasticity drives alterations in ion channel function that lead to the development of
cortical hyperexcitability in the Fmr1 KO.</p>

<title>Development of Hyperexcitability in Cortical Fmr1 KO Neurons</title>
<p id="P27">Several studies have demonstrated various measures of hyperexcitability in mature cortical Fmr1 KO neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gibson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gonçalves et al., 2013</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gross et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), which
have been linked to the loss of FMRP regulation of ion channels at the level of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gross et
al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Strumbos et al.,
2010</xref>) or via direct protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Deng et al., 2013</xref>). Recent reports have demonstrated a gradual development of
hyperexcitability in the Fmr1 KO rat visual cortex <italic>in vivo</italic> and in FXS patient-derived human induced pluripotent
stem cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Berzhanskaya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). These results are consistent with the observation that symptoms associated with
cortical hyperexcitability (seizures, sensory hypersensitivity) do not emerge until a few years into FXS development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hagerman et al., 2017</xref>). These findings support the idea that hyperexcitability is not caused
by the changes in ion channel function that are directly produced by the loss of FMRP but rather indirect compensations to these
initial changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Brager et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies have shown in WT neurons that
altering the function of a particular ion channel leads to compensatory changes in the function of other channel types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">MacLean et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Pratt and Aizenman, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p id="P28">Our findings, in what are likely immature cortical cultures (derived from ~P1 cortices) support the idea that KO
neurons compensate for the direct effects of FMRP loss early in development. First, there was no sign of baseline
hyperexcitability in Fmr1 KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), despite the observation that certain AP
parameters were significantly altered, suggesting changes in ion channel function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). Second, we found that certain features of HIP were intact as chronic
activity blockade produced similar compensatory changes in AP threshold in WT and KO cultures (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B1, and 2B2</xref>). Finally, differences in WT Con and KO Con
spike interval frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) and AP rise time and AHP amplitude (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S5B and S5C</xref>) suggested that if anything the KO cells were hypoexcitable. This
could represent a compensation to higher activity levels that occur at an even earlier stage in the KO cultures.</p>
<p id="P29">If various compensations in early development of the Fmr1 KO network are intact, then how does hyperexcitability emerge
later in development? Homeostatic mechanisms will be particularly important in defining the mature constellation of ion channels
and synaptic receptors because this plasticity regulates their expression through development in order to maintain some aspect of
neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">O’Leary et al., 2014</xref>). Recent work has demonstrated that virtually identical activity patterns can be achieved
through highly distinct combinations of ion channel and receptor combinations (parameter solutions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Prinz et al., 2004</xref>). In the Fmr1 KO,
the constellation of ion channels and receptors that are homeostatically regulated will have been altered by the loss of FMRP. The
loss of FMRP could lead to parameter solutions that maintain most aspects of excitability at early developmental stages. However,
as the network is repeatedly challenged through the natural process of development, or experimentally by activity blockade
(TTX/APV or NBQX), HIP may drive the cells into parameter solutions that are less successful in maintaining appropriate
excitability. If continued developmental challenges lead to a subset of neurons that express very high firing frequencies, as
occured following activity blockade, we might expect that this would contribute to the emergence of hyperexcitability of the Fmr1
KO cortical network. As development progresses, HIP may not be able to prevent hyperexcitability, because of developmental
challenges that are out of the range of HIP adjustments or because homeostatic capacity is reduced in later development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S14">
<title>Region-Specific Differences in Homeostatic Impairments</title>
<p id="P30">Previous work has suggested that the loss of FMRP is complicated in that loss of this protein produces distinct deficits
in a very specific fashion depending on the tissue and cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Contractor et al., 2015</xref>).
Earlier work has shown that the Fmr1 KO can exhibit cell type-specific changes that can even be found among different cells within
the same layer of cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kalmbach et al., 2015</xref>). Our results are consistent with this
complexity in that two different cell populations display opposing alterations in HIP function.</p>
<p id="P31">We have also made the surprising finding that cortical Fmr1 KO neurons show intact AMPAergic up-scaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This result is consistent with region-specific differences because previous reports suggest
that scaling is impaired in hippocampal Fmr1 KO neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sarti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Soden and Chen, 2010</xref>). In fact, region-specific deficits in plasticity mechanisms have been
reported previously in the Fmr1 KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Brager et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, it is possible that scaling deficits are strain specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dobkin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Ranson et al., 2012</xref>). Although we used Fmr1
KO mice bred on the C57BL/6 background, Lu Chen’s group used the FVB strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Soden and
Chen, 2010</xref>). Moving forward, it will be important to recognize that plasticity mechanisms in FXS may be expressed
differently in different cell types or regions of the nervous system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S15">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="P32">We have shown that homeostatic intrinsic plasticity, a fundamental neuronal mechanism driving nervous system development,
does not operate normally in Fmr1 KO cortical neurons. We discovered a form of HIP in single-spiking WT neurons and find that this
plasticity was lost in the Fmr1 KO. Conversely, Fmr1 KO multi-spiking neurons displayed an exaggerated form of HIP. Our findings
that HIP is altered in the KO distinctly in different cells could provide an explanation for subtle or contradictory results that
have been reported. This work motivates further studies to investigate how loss of FMRP leads to impaired HIP, and how altered HIP
function may contribute to the emergence of cortical hyperexcitability in FXS. Future studies on underlying mechanisms of
alterations in HIP could provide a platform for understanding the development of hyperexcitability and could suggest therapeutic
strategies for manipulating HIP’s contribution to the development of hyperactive networks.</p>

<p id="P34"><italic>FMR1</italic><sup>HET</sup> females (backcrossed on C57BL6 background) were crossed with WT C57BL6 males
(Jackson Laboratory) to generate litters of pups with mixed genotypes (Fmr1 KO, Fmr1<sup>HET</sup> or wild-type (WT)). Thus,
for all experiments, Fmr1 KO male pups were compared to their WT littermate control. We performed PCR to identify genotypes as

<title>Primary cortical neuronal cultures</title>
<p id="P35">Cerebral cortices were dissected and cultured from genotyped WT and Fmr1 KO pups on P0-P3. The cortices were
enzymatically dissociated using trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 10 min), mechanically dissociated in Minimum Essential
Media (MEM; Fisher) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Hyclone) and stained to assess viability using Trypan Blue
(Sigma). The neurons were plated on coverslips (Matsunami Inc., 22mm) coated with FBS, poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and laminin
(Sigma). A total of 50,000 neurons were plated as a ‘spot’ on the center of the coverslip to create a small,
high density network. The neurons were cultured in standard growth medium (glial conditioned neurobasal (Fisher) supplemented
with glutamax (GIBCO) and B27 (Invitrogen)), and half of the media was exchanged 2-3 times a week until experimental
treatments began. No antibiotics or antimycotics were used. The cultures were maintained in an incubator regulated at 37 C, 5%
CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% relative humidity (culturing protocol is similar to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fong et al.,

<title>Pharmacology and whole cell recordings</title>
<p id="P36">Drugs were used in the following concentrations (in μM): TTX, 1 (Tocris); APV, 100 (Tocris); NBQX, 10 (Tocris).
Drugs were added to fresh standard growth medium and added to the cultures by a complete media change. Control cultures had a
simultaneous complete media change but without drugs. Cultures were randomly assigned to each treatment group (control,
TTX/APV, NBQX). Whole cell recordings were performed on all groups (control, TTX/APV, NBQX) on the same day for each
genotype.</p>
<p id="P37">Large, pyramidal shaped neurons were selected for whole cell recordings during a continuous perfusion of artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 126 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1
NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 HEPES, and 25 D-glucose (pH 7.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fong et al.,
2015</xref>). For intrinsic excitability and AMPAergic mEPSC recordings, the internal solution contained the following (in
mM): 94 K-gluconate, 10 NaCl, 36 KCl, 1.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl, 0.1 CaCl, 1 ATP-salt, 0.5 GTP (pH 7.3). To isolate AMPAergic
mEPSCs the external solution was supplemented with 1 μM TTX, 20 μM gabazine and 100 μM APV, and the
recordings were done in voltage-clamp at −70 mV. For GABAergic mIPSCs, recordings the internal solution contained the
following (in mM): 136 CsCl, 1.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 0.1 CaCl, 0.3 MgCl, 3 Mg-ATP, 0.5 Na-GTP (pH 7.3). To isolate GABAergic
mIPSCs the external solution was supplemented with 1 μM TTX, 20 μM NBQX and 100 μM APV, and the
recordings were done in voltage-clamp at −70 mV. mPSCs were recorded using an AxoClamp 2B amplifier. Pipette
resistances ranged from 7-12 MΩ. All data was collected at 5, 10 or 20 kHz sampling rate and analyzed blind to genotype
and treatment using Axograph Software. The mPSCs with amplitudes less than 5 pA and cells with less than 20 mPSCs were
excluded from analysis. Intrinsic excitability measurements were done in a drug-free external solution in current clamp. A15
current step (500 ms long injection; 0-420 pA) protocol with 30 pA step-increments was used to assess AP threshold and firing
frequency. The current injection protocol was repeated 3 times for each cell, and the average value was used for analysis.
Cells with a resting membrane potential less than −55 mV were excluded from analysis. For intrinsic excitability
experiments, we calculated the number of APs generated during the current pulse, and measured spike interval frequency as 1 s
divided by the interval between the onset of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> AP at each current step. For spike time
interval, we did not analyze steps if any of the conditions had an n below 7 (led to exclusion of current step 1-5 in all
conditions (control, TTX/APV and NBQX)). All analysis was done blind to genotype and treatment, and the cultures were assigned
randomly to treatment conditions.</p>
<sec id="S23">
<title>AP parameter analysis</title>
<p id="P38">Analysis of “threshold AP” (AP) waveform parameters was carried out offline using Axograph software.
Analysis was done blind to genotype and treatment. We performed the analysis of the first spike generated during the
current step protocol and measured the following parameters: AP peak (measured from AP threshold to peak), AP rise time
(10 to 90% of AP peak), AP width (measured at 50% of AP peak), after hyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude (the deepest
negative peak immediately following the AP peak compared to the threshold voltage). Measurement of maximum slope of the AP
rising phase across all steps was carried out in MATLAB using custom scripts to identify the maximum change in voltage
over time (dV/dt). Measurement of AHP amplitudes of spike trains during step 6-8 was carried out in MATLAB using in-house
constructed programs to identify the maximum negative peak following the peak of the AP (measured in voltage). Duration of
spiking was measured in MATLAB using custom scripts which identified the time between the first and last AP generated
during each step.</p>
