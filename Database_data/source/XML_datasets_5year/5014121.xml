<p id="P1"><italic>SHANK3</italic> (also called PROSAP2) genetic haploinsufficiency
is thought to be the major cause of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Phelan-McDermid

features. Furthermore, a significant number of <italic>SHANK3</italic> mutations
have been identified in patients with Autism Spectrum disorders ASD, and
<italic>SHANK3</italic> truncating mutations are associated with moderate to
profound ID. The Shank3 protein is a scaffold protein that is located in the

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2"><italic>SHANK3/PROSAP2</italic> is considered to be the main gene that is
associated with the neuropsychiatric symptoms experienced by patients with Phelan
McDermid syndrome (PMS). PMS is characterized by a significant delay in expressive
language, intellectual disability (ID), hypotonia, minor craniofacial dysmorphisms,
increased tolerance to pain, epilepsy and autism-like features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>. Furthermore <italic>SHANK3</italic> truncating mutations have
been identified in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>. ASD is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder
that is defined by repetitive, restricted behavioral patterns and impaired
sociability and communication. These neuropsychiatric conditions are probably due to
the altered formation and plasticity of synaptic connections, which can lead to
dysfunctional neuronal communication. Therefore, understanding the functions of
Shank3 in the brain is crucial to developing new pharmacological targets with which
to treat patients with Shank3 mutations or deletions. Indeed, several
<italic>Shank3</italic> KO mice were generated in which different regions of the
gene were deleted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>. For a review, please see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>.</p>
<p id="P3">Shank proteins (encoded by three genes, Shank 1−3) are scaffold
proteins that are located in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of glutamatergic
synapses. They are essential for dendritic spine development and plasticity.
Overexpression of Shank1 in hippocampal neurons accelerated the maturation of
filopodial−like protrusions in mature spines and promoted the enlargement of
mature spines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>. However, smaller dendritic spines, weaker synaptic
transmission, and altered spatial learning have been observed in mice lacking Shank1
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. Shank3 overexpression in cerebellar
granule cells induced dendritic spine and synapse formation by recruiting different
subtypes of glutamate receptors, whereas inhibiting Shank3 expression in hippocampal
neurons reduced the number of dendritic spines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>.</p>
<p id="P4">Shanks proteins, which are composed of five protein-protein interaction
domains, including N-terminal ankyrin repeats (ANK), a Src Homology 3 domain (SH3),
a PDZ domain, a proline-rich region (Pro-rich), and a sterile alpha motif domain
(SAM) at the C-terminus, interact with more than 30 synaptic proteins, including
cytoskeletal proteins, cell adhesion proteins, and ionotropic and metabotropic
glutamate receptors. A major complex is formed by interactions between the Pro-rich
region of Shank with the EVH1 (Ena-VASP homology 1) domain of Homer proteins.
Through this interaction and through the multimerization of Homer1b/c via its
C-terminal coiled-coil domains, Shank stabilizes mGlu1 and mGlu5 at excitatory
synapses and regulates its inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R)-mediated
downstream pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>.</p>
<p id="P5">Interestingly, the direct alteration of Homer1 and mGlu5 gene expression and
function has been identified as a risk factor for ASD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> , and different studies have linked Homer proteins to mGlu5
receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity and ASD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>. mGlu5 proteins are highly
expressed postsynaptically in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>.</p>
<p id="P6">Our previous studies demonstrated that in rat hippocampal cell cultures,
mGlu5 receptor expression and function were strongly affected when Shank3 expression
was downregulated using a specific shRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>.
However, it is not clear whether in vivo Shank3 deletion caused these impairments in
mGlu5 functions.</p>
<p id="P7">In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that are associated
with the ASD-like behaviors observed in
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, which were generated by
deleting exon 11 and which are characterized by the absence of the three major and
higher MW isoforms of Shank3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>.</p>
<p id="P8">Our data indicate that, specifically in striatum and cortex, Shank3 performs
an essential function in mediating mGlu5 receptor signaling by recruiting Homer1b/c
to the PSD. Moreover, our results suggest that augmenting mGlu5 receptor activity
using CDPPB ameliorated the functional and behavioral defects observed in
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</p>

as previously described by Schemeisser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> and re-derived in a C57BL/6 background (Charles River
Laboratories, Calco, Italy). They were housed under constant temperature (22
± 1°C) and humidity (50%) conditions with a 12 h light/dark cycle
and provided with food and water ad libitum. Using heterozygous mice for
breeding, we derived wild type and knockout littermates.</p>

<title>Cell culture preparation and transfection of primary rat and mouse cortical
neurons</title>
<p id="P10">Rat cortical neuronal cultures were obtained from 18- to 19-day-old rat
embryos as previously described, with minor modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>. Neurons were
grown in B27 medium that was prepared in the laboratory in 12- or 6-well petri
dishes (Primo).</p>
<p id="P11">Mouse cortical neurons were prepared from E18 embryos, grown in 12- or
6-well petri dishes (Primo) and maintained in Neurobasal B27-supplemented medium
(Life Technologies). Rat cortical neurons were transfected using Lipofectamine
2000 on day 11 (DIV11), and the experiments were performed on DIV13-15.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Immunocytochemistry and image analysis</title>
<p id="P12">Mouse cortical neurons were fixed at DIV13 in 100% methanol at
-20°C for 10 minutes. Rat cortical neurons were transfected at DIV 11 and
fixed at DIV15 in 4% paraformaldehyde. Primary antibodies (anti-Homer1, provided
by Enjoom Kim Laboratory, KAIST Institute, Sout Korea and anti-Bassoon, Enzo
Life Sciences, cat. ADI-VAM-PS003-F) and secondary antibodies were applied in
GDB Buffer in PBS (30 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.2% gelatin, 0.5% Triton
X-100, and 0.8 M NaCl; all from Sigma-Aldrich).</p>
<p id="P13">Confocal images were obtained using a confocal microscope (Zeiss 510
Confocal Microscope, a gift from Fondazione Monzino) with a 63× objective
and sequential-acquisition setting at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels.
A total of 16 neurons (cortical neurons fixed at DIV 15) for each genotype (WT
and KO) were randomly chosen for quantification from 4 to 10 coverslips from
three independent experiments. Morphometric measurements were performed using
MetaMorph image analysis software. Colocalization was measured by using
color-separating Homer and Bassoon channels, manually setting a threshold level
for each channel (identical for each neuron), and then determining the
overlapping area using MetaMorph analysis.</p>
<p id="P14">Morphometric and colocalization analyses were performed by investigators
who were blind to the experimental conditions. Measurements are expressed as the
means ± SEM.</p>
<p id="P15">For the immunodetection of postsynaptic density markers on brain
sections, the mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally using Avertin
(Sigma-Aldrich) and then decapitated. The brains were rapidly excised and
manually cut into coronal slabs that were fixed via immersion in ice-cold
paraformaldehyde (4% in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, PB, pH 7.4) for 30 min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>. After fixation, the tissue slabs were
rinsed in PB, cryoprotected via immersion in ascending sucrose solutions (10%,
20% and 30%), cut into 20-µm sections with a cryostat, mounted on
gelatin-coated slides and stored for a maximum of one month at
−20°C until immunolabeling was performed. Following blocking in
normal donkey serum (NDS, 3% in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100), the sections were
incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 3% NGS and 0.5%
Triton X-100 overnight at 4°C (anti-PSD-95 NeuroMab, Ca, USA cat. 75-028
and anti-Homer1 provided by Enjoom Kim Laboratory, KAIST Institute, Sout Korea).
The sections were then washed and incubated with secondary antibodies
(cyanine-derived Cy3 anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit, both 1:1000;
Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) that were diluted in 3% NGS and 0.5%
Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. The sections were rinsed
again and coverslipped with Dako fluorescence mounting medium (Dako Italia,
Italy). For quantitative analysis of Homer1-immunoreactive puncta and
colocalization studies, 5 serial optical sections (using a 0.5-µm Z-step
size) were acquired from sections including layers 2-3 of the primary
somatosensory cortex (S1), the CA1 region of the hippocampus (stratum radiatum)
and the dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen nuclei) using a laser scanning
confocal microscope (LSM5 Pascal; Zeiss) with a 100× objective (1.4
numerical aperture) and the pinhole set at 1 Airy unit. The density of the
immunolabeled puncta was determined by manually counting postsynaptic clusters
in neuropilar areas using dedicated software (Imaris, Bitplane, Zurich, CH) and
expressed as puncta/100 µm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<title>Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blot analysis</title>
<p id="P16">Subcellular fractionation of brain tissues was performed according to
<italic>Distler et al., Proteomics, 2014</italic>, with some modifications.
All steps were performed at 4°C. In brief, tissues were homogenized in
buffer A containing 0.32 M sucrose and 5 mM HEPES (pH7.4) and centrifuged at
1.000 x g. The supernatant (S1) was further centrifuged at 12.000 x g, and a
pellet containing the crude membrane fraction (P2) was obtained. This fraction
was solubilized in buffer B containing 0.32 M sucrose and 5 mM Tris (pH 8.1) and
loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose step gradient (0.85 M/1.0 M/1.2 M). After
centrifugation at 85.000 x g, the synaptosomes (Syn) were collected from the 1.0
M/1.2 M interface and incubated with buffer C containing 0.32 M sucrose, 12 mM
Tris (pH 8.1) and 1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 32.800 x g, the PSD
pellet was collected and solubilized in H2O.</p>
<p id="P17">Equal amounts (10 µg) of each sample were separated using
SDS-PAGE and subsequently blotted on nitrocellulose membranes according to
standard protocols. Incubation with a primary antibody (β-actin Sigma,
cat. A5316; Homer1b/c, SynapticSystems, cat. 160022,; mGluR5, Millipore, cat.
AB5675; Shank3, Santa Cruz Biothecnology, cat. H-160; β3-tubulin,
Covance, cat. PRB-435P ) was followed by treatment of the membrane with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (swine anti-rabbit, 1:1000 or rabbit
anti-mouse, 1:3000; both Dako, Hamburg, Germany), and the signal was visualized
using Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate and further detected using a
MicroChemi 4.2 machine. All signals were quantified using Gel analyzer software
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gelanalyzer.com/">www.gelanalyzer.com/</ext-link>) and normalized against the values of the

<title>Immunoprecipitation Assay</title>
<p id="P18">PSD-enriched preparations (as previously described) of different brain
regions (cortex, hippocampus and striatum) from P60 WT and KO mice were
incubated at 4°C overnight with protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare)
conjugated to 10 μg/ml of Homer1b/c (Santa Cruz cat. H-342) or of PSD-95
(NeuroMab, Ca, USA cat. 75-028 ) or control IgG (10 μg/ml) antibodies.
The beads were then washed three times with RIPA buffer, re-suspended in sample
buffer, warmed at 65°C for 10 minutes and analyzed using SDS-PAGE.
Western blot analysis was performed using mGlu5 (Millipore, cat. AB5675), SynGAP
(Cell Signaling cat. D78B11) andGluN2A (Sigma cat. G9038) primary
antibodies.</p>

<title>FURA-2 Single Cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> Imaging</title>
<p id="P19">For Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements, 0.3 mln neurons were plated onto 24-mm
round coverslips in 6-well plates. At DIV12-DIV14, the plates were loaded with 5
μM Fura-2 AM (Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) containing 0.002% Pluronic
F-127 (Life Technologies) and 10 μM sulfinpyrazone (Sigma) in
Krebs-Ringer modified buffer (KRB solution: 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM
Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>
5.5 mM glucose, and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature (RT).
The neurons were then washed twice in KRB, and the Fura-2 was allowed to
de-esterify for another 30 min at RT. The coverslips were then mounted in the
acquisition chamber of a Leica DMI6000 epifluorescent microscope equipped with
an S Fluor 40x/1.3 objective. First, neurons expressing a GFP-tagged shShank3 or
control (shCtrl) plasmid were imaged and photographed using Leica AM Meta Morph
software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, US) at an excitation wavelength of
488 with a bandpass 510-nm emission filter. The cells were then alternately
excited at 340 and 380 nm using a monochromator Policrome V (Till Photonics,
Munich, Germany), and images of the fluorescent signals were captured each
second through bandpass 510 nm filter using a CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Japan). All
hardware was controlled, and Fura-2 images were analyzed using MetaFluor
(Molecular Devices) software. To quantify differences in the amplitudes of
Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, the ratio values were normalized using the
formula (DF)/F<sub>0</sub> (referred to as norm. ratio). To compare multiple
samples (e.g., shShank3 and rescue results), ANOVA was used with Tukey’s
post-hoc tests. To analyze differences between two samples (e.g., Shank3-KO
results) Student’s two-tailed unpaired t-tests were used. Differences
were considered statistically significant when p &lt; 0.05.</p>

<title>Behavioral Assays</title>
<p id="P24">For behavioral analyses, 3-month-old age-matched littermate mice were
used. All experimental procedures followed the guidelines established by the
Italian Council on Animal Care and were approved by the Italian Government. All
efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.
<italic>Shank-3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and their littermates were
housed in cages in groups of five with free access to food and water at
22°C and with a 12-h alternating light/dark cycle. When obtaining
behavioral profiles, the animals were tested once for each test. All tests were
performed between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m.</p>
<sec id="S11">
<title>Spontaneous motor activity</title>
<p id="P25">Motor function was evaluated in an activity cage (43 × 43
× 32 cm) (Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy) that was placed in a
sound-attenuating room as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>. The cage was fitted with two horizontal and
vertical infrared beams that were located 2 cm and 4 cm from the floor of
the cage, respectively. Before the start of the test each mouse was
habituated to the testing room for 1 h. Cumulative horizontal and vertical
movement counts were recorded for 10 min.</p>

<title>Repetitive self-grooming</title>
<p id="P26">Spontaneous repetitive self-grooming behavior was scored as
previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>. Each mouse
was individually placed into a standard cylinder, (46 cm length ×
23.5 cm wide × 20 cm high). Cylinders were empty to eliminate digging
in the bedding, which is a potentially competing behavior. The room was
illuminated at ~ 40 lux. A front-mounted CC TV camera (Security
Cameras Direct) was placed at ~ 1 m from the cages to record the
sessions. Sessions were video-taped for 20 min. The first 10-min of
habituation was not scored. Cumulative time spent grooming all the body
regions during the second 10 min of the test session and the total number of
grooming episodes was measured.</p>

<title>Spatial object recognition</title>
<p id="P27">Object location tests were performed in an arena according to the
methods described in Kenney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, with slight modifications. Two visual cues were placed on two
adjacent walls of an opaque white Plexiglas cage (58×50×43 cm)
that was dimly lit from above (27 lux). The visual cues consisted of a black
and white striped pattern (21×19.5 cm) that was affixed to the center
of the northern wall and a black and gray checkered pattern (26.5×20
cm) that was placed in the center of the western wall. The objects were
counterbalanced across locations. The cage and the objects were thoroughly
wiped down with acetic acid (0.1%) before and after all behavioral
procedures, which were observed and recorded using a camera mounted above
the cage. Climbing or sitting on objects was not scored as object
exploration. Mice that did not spend more than a total of 30 s exploring the
objects during training or testing were excluded from the analysis. Mice
were pre-exposed to the cage for 10 min. Twenty-four hours later, the mice
were returned to the cage and allowed to explore two different objects
placed in the NE and NW corners, and the time spent exploring the objects
was recorded. Two hours later, the object the mouse had spent more time
exploring in the previous session was moved to the SW corner of the cage
(only this object was placed in the cage), and the mouse was allowed to
re-explore the cage. Exploration was defined as a mouse having its nose
directed toward the object and within approximately 1 cm of the object <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>. Performance was evaluated by
calculating a discrimination index (N-F/N+F), where N = the time

mouse was first placed in the middle compartment, and it was allowed to
explore all three chambers for 10 min (habituation). Then, an unfamiliar
adult DBA/2J male mouse was placed in one side compartment. The opposite
side compartment contained an empty wire cage. The social novelty tests were
performed in the same apparatus immediately after sociability test. The
cages were not cleaned between these two tests. For these tests, one side
compartment contained the familiar mouse (from the previous sociability
phase), while the other side contained an unfamiliar mouse. The new,
unfamiliar mouse was placed in the wire cage that had been empty during the
prior 10-min session. The familiar and unfamiliar animals were from
different home cages and had never been in physical contact with the subject
mouse or with each other. For both tests, the time spent in each chamber and
the number of entries into each chamber were recorded for 10 min. The data
were expressed as the difference in the scores between the time spent
exploring the compartment containing the familiar mouse and the time spent
in the empty compartment (for sociability tests) or the difference in the
scores between the time spent containing the stranger animal and the time
spent with the familiar mouse (for social novelty tests). An operator blind
to the genotypes of the mice manually recorded the time spent in each
chamber. We also evaluated a sociability index (SI) and a social novelty
preference index (SNI) as follows: SI = (time exploring novel mouse 1

exploring novel object) and SNI = (time exploring novel mouse 2

learning and memory abilities of the mice according to the methods described
in Morris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> (adapted for mice). A
circular water maze (120 cm in diameter x 50 cm in height) was used. A
circular hidden platform with a diameter of 10 cm was placed inside the
maze, and its surface was maintained at 0.5 cm below the surface of the
water. Floating plastic particles were placed on the surface of the water to
hide the platform from sight according to the methods of Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>. The temperature of the water was
25.0°C ± 0.5°C. For the habituation trials, the mice
were placed in a random area inside the maze and allowed to swim for 60 sec.
For the acquisition trials, the mice were submitted to 4 trials per day
(with 60 sec inter-trial intervals) for 4 consecutive days during which each
mouse was released into the pool at different starting points and trained to
locate a constant platform position. At 24 hours after the last trial, a
probe test was performed during which the platform was removed. Two days
later, a reversal task was performed to assess cognitive flexibility. The
platform was placed in the opposite quadrant of the tank, and 4 daily trials
were performed for 4 days. On the fifth day, a probe trial was performed
that was similar to that in the acquisition phase. The time spent in the
target area and the latency to reaching the target zone were evaluated by an
experimenter who was blind to the genotypes of the mice. After each trial,
the mice were placed on a paper towel to dry, and they were then placed back

<title>Deletion of Shank3 in mice results in ASD-like behavior</title>
<p id="P36">To determine whether a Shank3 mutation in mice results in ASD-like
behavior and ID, we characterized the behavior of
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (previously called
<italic>ProSAP2/Shank3αβ<sup>-/-</sup></italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).</p>
<p id="P37">To analyze repetitive, stereotyped behavior, which is one of the two
cores symptoms of ASD, we measured grooming behaviors. In KO mice, we detected
an increase in self-grooming activity in terms of the time spent grooming and
the number of grooming episodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure
1A</xref>).</p>
<p id="P38">Given that impaired social interaction is the second core symptom of
ASD, we tested sociability in <italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic>
mice using a three-chamber test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure
1B</xref>). We observed that KO mice were impaired in that they spent more time
exploring the compartment containing the empty cage than the compartment
containing the stranger mouse (left panel). In addition, KO mice remained closer
to the familiar stranger for longer period of time, which suggests impaired
social recognition (right panel). Accordingly, the corresponding sociability
index (SI) and the social novelty preference index (SNI) scores were lower in
the KO mice than in their littermates. Because <italic>SHANK3</italic> mutations
are often associated with ID, we tested spatial learning and memory in
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. To evaluate
spatial memory, we used a spatial object recognition test in which we analyzed a
discrimination index with an inter-trial interval of 120 min. We did not detect
significant differences between the two genotypes in this test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P39">We also tested the mice in a water-maze place navigation task. KO mice
showed normal acquisition compared to their littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> left panel). Spatial memory was then tested using
a probe trial, which was administered after a 4-day training period during which
we measured the latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, center
panel) and the time required to reach the target quadrant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, right panel). We did not detect any significant
difference between the genotypes. The latency and the percentage of time spent
swimming to the target quadrant were also not significantly different. On the
contrary, the escape latency of KO mice was longer than the latency in WT mice
on day 8 and day 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1E</xref>, left panel).
In the probe trial, the KO mice took longer to find the target zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, center panel) and spent less time
than WT mice to swim to the quadrant that previously housed the platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1E</xref>, right panel).
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice also showed
impairments in the T-maze task, but only during the reversal phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1F</xref>). KO mice required more days to
achieve the criterion than WT mice. This resistance to change in a learned
pattern of behavior indicates that
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice recapitulate cognitive
rigidity, which is a typical symptom of many neuropsychiatric disorders,
including ASD.</p>
<p id="P40">We next analyzed behaviors related to avoidance of inanimate objects and
restricted interests. In the marble burying test, KO mice buried fewer marbles
than WT mice and took a larger amount of time to bury the first marble (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>).
We detected a similar pattern in avoidance behavior when we measured nest
building in that KO mice had lower nest building scores than WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>).
The corresponding AUC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>) was significantly lower in KO mice than in
WT mice. These results strongly suggest that
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit restricted
interest and an avoidance phenotype when exposed to inanimate objects.</p>
<p id="P41">We next characterized motor coordination and motor learning, behaviors
that are also often altered in ASD patients, in
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Fine motor
coordination and balance were assessed using the beam walking assay. We did not
observe any difference in the mean time required to cross to the escape box
between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>). On the contrary, during the pole test, KO
mice took longer to complete the task than WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref>)
and they had more difficulty in remaining suspended from the lid during the
hanging wire test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1F</xref>). In rotarod tests, KO mice showed a defect
only in the fourth trial of the first day of evaluation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1G</xref>).
These data indicate that <italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice
exhibit only minor deficits in motor coordination.</p>
<p id="P42">Because there is a strong association between anxiety and autism, we
also tested <italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice using an
elevated plus maze, but we did not find any differences between WT and KO
animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure
1H</xref>).</p>
<p id="P43">Associated symptoms, which have also been documented in a subset of
individuals with ASD, include increased aggression and hyposensitivity to pain.
Indeed, we found that aggressive behavior was significantly increased in KO mice
compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1I</xref>) and that KO mice showed a higher mean
threshold latency than WT mice in hot plate tests (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure
1L</xref>).</p>
<p id="P44">Interestingly, we also tested
<italic>Shank3Δ1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, and we did not observe
any major behavioral impairment except for a longer time to complete the pole
test than was observed in WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Shank3 absence alters the synaptic localization of Homer and the mGlu5
receptor</title>
<p id="P45">Based on our previous results that showed that knock-down of Shank3 in
primary neuronal cultures caused a significant reduction in the mGlu5 receptor
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, we measured mGlu5 and Homer1b/c
protein levels in total homogenates and PSD fractions from the striatum, cortex
and hippocampus of <italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</p>
<p id="P46">In PSD fractions obtained from KO animals, we observed a reduction in
Homer1b/c protein levels in the striatum, a reduction in both mGlu5 and
Homer1b/c in the cortex, and no change in mGlu5 and Homer1b/c levels in the
hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly,
decreased mGlu5 receptor and Homer1b/c levels were detected only in the PSD
fractions, and there was no significant change in the level of either protein in
total homogenates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). These biochemical data indicate that
<italic>in vivo</italic>, Shank3 absence alters mGlu5 receptor and Homer
1b/c protein expression only in the PSD of specific brain regions.</p>
<p id="P47">To understand whether the localization of Homer was altered in the
absence of Shank3, we next analyzed postsynaptic Homer1 signals in the dorsal
striatum, in layers 2-3 of the primary somatosensory cortex and in the CA1
stratum radiatum of the hippocampus in
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice using
immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. First, we found that the density of
Homer1-positive puncta was unchanged between WT and
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice in all three brains
regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>).
Interestingly, KO mice showed an increase in the density of Homer1 puncta that
did not colocalize with PSD-95 and, in parallel, a robust reduction in
double-labeled puncta in both the dorsal striatum and the somatosensory cortex
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>).
In contrast, we did not observe any change in Homer1 localization in the CA1
area of the hippocampus in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure
2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P48">We then examined whether these alterations in the synaptic localization
of Homer1 compromised the interaction between Homer and the mGlu5 receptor by
performing co-immunoprecipitation assays using tissues from the striatum, cortex
and hippocampus.</p>
<p id="P49">Quantitative analysis using WB was performed to co-immunoprecipitate
mGlu5 using Homer1b/c antibodies. The results revealed a significant reduction
in protein-protein interactions between mGlu5 and Homer1b/c in both the striatum
and the cortex, but not in the hippocampus, in
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to WT mice
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). We also
co-immunoprecipitated SynGAP and GluN2A using PSD-95 antibodies in the striatum,
cortex and hippocampus of <italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT
mice. Quantitative analysis of corresponding blots showed that there was no
difference in the interaction between PSD-95 and SynGAP or PSD-95 and GluN2A
between <italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT mice in any the
brain areas analyzed. These results confirm that the absence of Shank3
specifically reduced mGlu5/Homer interactions in the striatum and cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure
2C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P50">Finally, in consideration for the results obtained in the different
brain areas, we next sought to determine whether Shank3 levels were different in
the striatum, cortex and hippocampus in total homogenates and PSD fractions, and
we found that its expression was lower in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure
2D</xref>)</p>
<p id="P51">Taken together, these data suggest that the absence of Shank3 causes
brain region-specific alterations in both protein levels and the localization of
the mGlu5 receptor and Homer1b/c at synapses and that these changes prevent the
normal formation of the mGlu5/Homer complex, which is essential to mediating
mGlu5 intracellular signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>.</p>
<p id="P52">To clarify whether Homer1b/c localization was altered also in neurons
derived from patients with PMS who exhibited <italic>SHANK3</italic>
haploinsufficiency, we established human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)
lines using cells derived from two different patients with PMS, one of whom had
a deletion of approximately 7.99 Mb (Patient 1) and one of whom had a deletion
that was 22q13.3 ARSA-negative (Patient 2). As a control, we used hiPSCs that
were generated from two healthy donors. The control and PMS clones were tested
to determine the expression of endogenous pluripotency markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure
3A-B</xref>). The hiPSC clones were differentiated into cortical neurons via the
generation of neural-rosette intermediate neural progenitors, and they were
subsequently differentiated for 80 days. We confirmed using WB that there was a
reduction in Shank3 protein levels in the neurons obtained from both of the PMS
patients compared to the Shank3 levels in the control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 3C</xref>).
To analyze Homer cluster localization, we infected neuronal progenitors with a
lentivirus expressing Homer-GFP. Interestingly, after 80 days of
differentiation, we observed a significant reduction in the number of Homer
puncta that co-localized with Synaptophysin in neurons derived from both of the
PMS patients compared to the co-localization observed in the neurons derived
from the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). These
results suggest that in human neurons, Shank3 is essential for Homer1b/c
synaptic localization.</p>

Quantification of the co-localization of Homer puncta and Bassoon revealed that
the postsynaptic localization of Homer was reduced in the
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cortical cultured
neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P55">In a second series of experiments, we knocked down Shank3 using specific
shRNA sequences. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary
Figure 4A–B</xref> shows that the administration of 200 µM
DHPG elicited a much lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in shRNA-Shank3-tranfected
neurons than in control neurons (either non-transfected or transfected with a
GFP-expressing plasmid) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure 4A-B</xref>). When the shShank3-resistant form of
Shank3 was co-expressed with the shRNA-Shank3 plasmid, the DHPG-induced
Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were restored to control levels, indicating that
the effect of shRNA-Shank3 transfection was specific. We also confirmed using
immunofluorescence that Homer-Bassoon co-localization was altered in Shank3
knock-down neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P56">Our previous results suggested that <italic>in vitro</italic>, the
reduction in mGlu5 receptor activity that was caused by Shank3 knock-down could
be rescued using CDPPB, a positive allosteric modulator of mGlu5 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>. For these experiments, DIV12-14 cortical neuronal cultures were
loaded with Fura-2 and challenged with 200 μM DHPG in either the presence
(5 min of preincubation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) or the
absence of 3 μM CDPPB. As expected, in the Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup>
cortical neurons, the DHPG-induced Ca2+ transients were approximately 40% lower
than in the WT neurons. After preincubation with CDPPB, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>
transients in the Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup> neurons were significantly
augmented, reaching the level of WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

<title>The effect of mGlu5 stimulation on NMDA responses in striatal medium spiny
neurons is dependent on Shank3</title>
<p id="P57">Because we observed a disruption in synaptic Homer localization in the
absence of Shank3 and high expression of Shank3 in the striatum, we tested the
electrophysiological properties of striatal neurons.</p>
<p id="P58">Patch-clamp recordings were obtained using medium spiny neurons (MSNs)
obtained from WT and KO mice to explore whether the deletion of Shank3 affected
the basal membrane properties of striatal neurons. Current-voltage curves were
obtained by delivering hyperpolarizing and depolarizing steps of currents to the
MSNs of KO (n=6) and WT (n=6) mice, and we observed no difference
between these two groups of neurons, suggesting that the basal membrane
properties of MSNs do not depend on Shank3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 A-B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P59">We subsequently studied whether Shank3 was responsible for the observed
changes in the membrane potential and the ionic currents induced by the
stimulation of group I mGlu receptors in MSNs. Activation of these types of
metabotropic glutamate receptors has been shown to enhance the membrane
depolarization/inward current that is produced by the activation of the NMDA
receptor in striatal MSNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>. As shown in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4C and 4G</xref>, the application of
30 µM NMDA produced a membrane depolarization of approximately 15 mV and
an inward current of approximately -70 pA in MSNs in WT mice, while the
co-application of NMDA in the presence of DHPG produced a significantly larger
depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-D</xref>) and inward
current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 G-H</xref>). Interestingly, in
the MSNs obtained from KO mice, the co-application of NMDA plus DHPG failed to
produce a membrane depolarization and inward current that was larger than those
observed in the presence of NMDA alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.
4E-H</xref>).</p>
<p id="P60">Because mGlu5 receptors are mainly involved in potentiation of NMDA
responses in striatal MSNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, we also
tested whether the selective mGlu5 receptor agonist CHPG would be able to
increase NMDA receptor-mediated responses in MSNs obtained from WT and KO
mice.</p>
<p id="P61">As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure 4A-B</xref>, when 500 µM CHPG was applied for 5
minutes, it significantly enhanced the NMDA receptor-mediated membrane
depolarization of MSNs (n=5) obtained from WT mice, but it failed to
produce a larger NMDA response in the MSNs obtained from KO animals
(n=5). Taken together, these data confirm that in striatal MSNs, normal
NMDA receptor function depends on mGlu5 receptor activity, and this interplay is
essentially disrupted by the deletion of Shank3.</p>
<p id="P62">We also explored whether Shank3 is involved in the functions of a
different class of metabotropic receptors, the muscarinic cholinergic receptors.
Because in MSNs, the NMDA receptor-mediated response is increased by the
activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, we tested whether Shank3 also plays a role in this process
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure
4C-D</xref>). Interestingly, we found that activating cholinergic receptors
using muscarine increased NMDA-mediated neuronal depolarization in MSNs obtained
from both WT and KO mice. These experiments confirm that Shank3 does not play a
major role in mediating metabotropic responses that are related to the
activation of cholinergic receptors in MSNs.</p>
<p id="P63">Finally, we tested whether Shank3 was involved in the function of
presynaptic group III mGlu receptors. In fact, stimulating mGluIII receptors is
known to inhibit glutamate release and excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs)
in MSNs via a presynaptic mechanism of action. Thus, we first tested the effect
of applying a 10 µM solution of the mGlu III receptor agonist L-SOP to
MSNs for 10 minutes. We found that the EPSC amplitude was reduced by 34.72
± 8.2% (n=4, p&lt;0.05) and 47.9 ±5.9% (n=6,
p&lt;0.05) in WT and KO mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure
4E-F</xref>). Moreover, we measured the effect of L-SOP on paired-pulse
facilitation (PPF) because changes in PPF are indicative of a presynaptic
mechanism of action. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure 4F</xref>, PPF
(EPSC<sub>2</sub>/EPSC<sub>1</sub>) was significantly increased in MSNs
obtained from both WT and KO animals in the presence of L-SOP. These results
substantiate the hypothesis that Shank3 deletion specifically affects mGlu5
signaling in striatal MSNs.</p>
<p id="P64">We then tested the effect of CDPPB on MSNs obtained from WT and KO mice,
and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4I-J</xref>, CDPPB
treatment was able to recover normal NMDA receptor functions, which depend on
mGlu5 receptor activity, in the MSNs obtained from Shank3 KO mice to levels
comparable to those in the MSNs obtained from WT mice.</p>
<p id="P65">Surprisingly, we found that, in Shank3 KO MSN, CDPPB alone was able to
rescue the activation of NMDA receptor mediated responses; on the contrary, in
culture cortical neurons from Shank3 KO mice, CDPPB alone was not able to rescue
the impaired calcium release (data not shown). Thus we cannot exclude neither
that in MSN CDPPB has also a partial intrinsic agonist activity nor that in
striatal slices preparation the glutamate tone is higher then in cultured
neuronal preparation and it is enough to partially activate mGlu5.</p>

<p id="P67">The behavioral profiles of KO mice were evaluated after treatment with
CDPPB (3 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle (veh), which was administered acutely or
repeatedly 70 min before each test. The results are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. The increased self-grooming
activity observed in KO mice was reduced by acute treatment with CDPPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). There was also a significant
reduction in the mean number of grooming episodes. Notably, the drug did not
affect motor activity when mice were evaluated immediately after self-grooming
activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Reduced sociability
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>, left) was slightly, but not
significantly, rescued in KO animals by acute treatment with CDPPB when analyzed
as time spent close to the stranger/object. However, the SI, which measures
sniffing activity, was significantly increased when the animals were given
CDPPB. Social recognition was completely rescued in
<italic>Shank3Δ11-/-</italic> mice, when analyzed as either the time
spent close to the stranger2/stranger1 or sniffing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>, right). In the water-maze place
navigation task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), the KO mice
showed normal acquisition compared to WT mice in terms of mean time required to
reach the platform. A significant latency reduction between the first and the
fourth trial was observed in all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure

the probe test, no difference among the groups was shown in latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>, center panel) or the time spent in
the target zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>, right panel).
During reversal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>), a significant
difference in the escape latency across the trials was observed. KO mice treated
with vehicle were completely impaired compared to their littermates, while CDPPB
reduced escape latency during the learning phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>, left panel).</p>
<p id="P68">When submitted to the probe trial on day 10, the KO mice that were
treated with CDPPB required less time to find the target zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>, center panel) and spent more time
than the KO mice treated with vehicle to swim to the quadrant that previously
housed the platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>, right

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P70">To evaluate the role of Shank3 in synapse function and to develop therapies
that might ameliorate or even reverse the neuropsychiatric symptoms experienced by
patients with PMS or other mutations in the <italic>SHANK3</italic> gene, we
characterized the behavioral, molecular and electrophysiological phenotypes of
<italic>Shank3</italic> mutant mice that were generated by deleting exon 11
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>. Among the <italic>Shank3</italic>
mutants that were available, <italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice
are less often studied, although they are highly homologous to the
<italic>Shank3B<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants described by Peça et
al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>.</p>
<p id="P71">Behaviorally, our analysis demonstrates that the
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant is an excellent model
for studying the role of Shank3 in the pathogenesis of PMS and ASD. Indeed, this
mutant line shows repetitive and stereotyped behavior, restricted interests and
impaired social interactions, which are the core diagnostic features of ASD and are
similar to the features observed in most other Shank3 KO mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, our mice, similar to the
Shank3D4-9-/- mice, displayed impairments in the reversal phase of the Morris Water
maze and T-maze tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>. Because PMS patients are heterozygous for Shank3
mutations/deletions, we also tested all of the behavioral tasks in
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/+</sup></italic> mice, but we did not find
any significant behavioral defects in the heterozygous mice. Our results are in line
with the results described in the majority of studies that have been performed using
other Shank3 KO mice, in which it has been demonstrated that behavioral alterations
are present only in Shank3 KO mice. It is possible that there are unknown
compensatory mechanisms that reduce the severity of the Shank3 deletion in the
heterozygous mice.</p>
<p id="P72">The results of our molecular studies further indicate that Shank3 plays a
major role in modulating mGlu5 signaling by regulating Homer
recruitment/localization to the PSD in brain regions that are highly associated with
ASD-like behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>.</p>
<p id="P73">Finally, our findings demonstrate that treatment with a PAM for mGlu5
rescued both the functional and the behavioral defects observed in the
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants.</p>
<sec id="S28">
<title>Deletion of Shank3 alters the recruitment of Homer to the PSD in the cortex
and striatum</title>
<p id="P74">Shank proteins are indirectly connected to group I mGlu receptors by
Homer proteins, which contain coiled-coil domains. For Shank1, it has already
been demonstrated that the Shank/Homer complex regulates their reciprocal
localization at the PSD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>. The biochemical and morphological data
in this study demonstrate that in
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, the localization of
Homer1b/c to the PSD is significantly reduced in both striatal and cortical
neurons. As consequence, the synaptic association of Homer1b/c and mGlu5 in
these two areas is reduced (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure
2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P75">Biochemical analysis of synaptosome preparations from the cortex,
hippocampus and striatum of <italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice
have already shown that there is a significant increase in GluN2B in the
hippocampus and a slight reduction in various AMPA receptor subunits in all of
the regions analyzed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>. Here we
specifically investigated mGlu5 and Homer protein levels based on our previous
work showing a reduction in the expression of mGlu5 in Shank3 knock-down neurons
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>. Importantly, both mGlu5 and
Homer1b/c were reduced in the PSD fractions obtained from the cortex and
striatum of <italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, while their
expression in hippocampus was unaffected.</p>
<p id="P76">Thus, our data indicate that depending on the brain region, Shank3
performs different functions at synapses. Even if the underlying molecular
mechanism is not yet clear, biochemical analyses in several other
<italic>Shank3</italic> mutant mice have suggested that the brain
region-specific function of Shank3 in regulating glutamate receptor levels at
synapses might further depend on the different splice variants that are
expressed. For example, <italic>Shank3B<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants exhibited
a major reduction in GluA2, GluN2A and GluN2B in striatal PSDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> and <italic>Shank3<sup>e4-9</sup></italic>
mutants exhibited a reduction in GluA1 in whole forebrain PSDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>.
These alterations were not evaluated in
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and
<italic>Shank3<sup>ΔC/ΔC</sup></italic> mice. In contrast,
<italic>Shank3<sup>ΔC/ΔC</sup></italic> mice showed a
strong increase in mGlu5 in hippocampal PSD preparations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>. A common alteration observed in several Shank3 mutants is
a reduction in Homer, as has been observed in forebrain PSDs of
<italic>Shank3<sup>e4-9</sup></italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> mutants and in the striatal PSDs of
<italic>Shank3B<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>.</p>
<p id="P77">However, a systematic molecular analysis of each brain region of
interest and how it is correlated to the regional expression level of all three
Shank proteins and their isoforms alike has yet to be performed to decipher the
defects in the highly complex synaptic transmission identified in
<italic>Shank</italic> mutants. Finally, Homer1b/c synaptic localization is
strongly impaired in hiPSC-derived neurons that were obtained from patients with
PMS who exhibited SHANK3 haploinsufficiency, suggesting that Shank3 is also
important for the normal clustering of Homer1b/c into synaptic puncta in human
neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S29">
<title>Deletion of Shank3 alters mGlu5 function in cortex and striatum, but not in
hippocampus</title>
<p id="P78">Because mGluR-Homer complex formation is required for the correct
function of mGluRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, we have provided
<italic>in vitro</italic> data showing that mGlu5-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>
release from intracellular stores is impaired in cortical neurons in
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We also provide <italic>in

is completely abolished in striatal neurons obtained from
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). To the contrary, we did not
observe any defects in DHPG-mediated LTD in the hippocampus in
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>).
The function of Shank3 in regulating mGlu5 signaling is specifically supported
by the following data sets: 1) The expression of shRNA-resistant Shank3 rescued
the changes in DHPG-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores
observed in Shank3 knock-down cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure
4A-B</xref>); 2) Shank3 does not play a major role in mediating metabotropic
responses related to the activation of cholinergic receptors in MSNs and is not
involved in the regulation of presynaptic group III mGluRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>);
3) CDPPB induced the positive modulation of mGlu5 activity and rescued the
functional defects observed in both cortical and striatal neurons in
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice to WT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I-J</xref>)</p>

<title>ASD-like behaviors were reversed in Shank3 mutant mice by an mGlu5
PAM</title>
<p id="P80">Our data are in line with recent evidence linking Homer proteins to
mGlu5 receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity and ASD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>. Indeed, inhibiting mGlu5-Homer complex formation
impaired mGluR-dependent LTD and protein synthesis in normal mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, while in a mouse model of Fragile-X
syndrome (FXS), mGlu5 receptors were less associated with Homer1b/c and more
associated with Homer1a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, resulting in alterations in the
cross-linking activity of Homer1b/c <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>.
Similarly, in a mouse model of Angelman Syndrome, mGlu5 receptor-dependent
synaptic plasticity was altered because it showed an increased association with
Homer 1b/c <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>. However, in these two
mouse models, an enhancement in hippocampal mGlu5 receptor function was the core
phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, which was contrary to the decrease in mGlu5 receptor
function we observed in <italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants.
This indicates that changes in the function of synapses might occur if mGlu5
signaling is pathologically modified in any direction. Interestingly, Homer1
itself has recently been identified as a novel risk gene for non-syndromic ASD
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, and another study showed that
mGlu5 gene expression was reduced in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
in ASD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>.</p>
<p id="P81">Our previous findings prompted us to test whether the ASD-like behaviors
of <italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants could be reversed by
the application of an allosteric mGlu5 agonist, such as CDPPB. Indeed, we found
that repetitive and stereotyped behavior, a lack of cognitive flexibility and
partially impaired social interactions were rescued by <italic>in vivo</italic>
treatment with CDPPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). A similar
approach was used to rescue behavioral phenotypes in a <italic>Shank2</italic>
mutant line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>. Importantly, the
potential of positive allosteric mGlu5 modulation has already been tested in
other models of ASD. In particular, Auerbach et al. demonstrated that treatment
with CDPPB restored synaptic and behavioral deficits in
<italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, and very recently, Lin et al. showed that the systemic
administration of CDPPB ameliorated the behavioral defects observed in Sarm1
knockdown mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>. Our data, including
our observation that there were no alterations in mGlu5 signaling in the
hippocampus, suggest that the ASD-like behavioral defects that are the result of
mGlu5 signaling impairments in the striatum and cortex of
<italic>Shank3Δ11<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice can be functional
rescued by CDPPB, even if we cannot totally exclude the possibility that CDPPB
might have an effect on other brain areas.</p>
<p id="P82">Our results confirm that positive allosteric modulation of mGlu5
antagonizes ASD-like behaviors and suggest that mGlu5 activity could be viewed
as a potential therapeutic target for neurodevelopmental disorders in general,
as has been suggested by many recent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>. Therefore, our findings open up new possibilities for the
pharmacological treatment of patients affected by PMS and
<italic>SHANK3</italic> mutations.</p>
