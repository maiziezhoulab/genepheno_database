<abstract>
<p>We propose that human self-domestication favored the emergence of a less aggressive phenotype in our species, more precisely phenotype prone to replace (reactive) physical aggression with verbal aggression. In turn, the (gradual) transition to verbal aggression and to more sophisticated forms of verbal behavior favored self-domestication, with the two processes engaged in a mutually reinforcing feedback loop, considering that verbal behavior entails not only less violence and better survival but also more opportunities to interact longer and socialize with more conspecifics, ultimately enabling the emergence of more complex forms of language. Whereas in the case of self-domestication, sexual selection has been proposed to work against physical aggression traits, in the case of verbal insult, the selection has been proposed to work in favor of verbal aggression. The tension between these two seemingly opposing forces gets resolved/alleviated by a tendency to replace physical aggression with verbal aggression and with verbal behavior more generally. This also helps solve the paradox of the Self-Domestication Hypothesis regarding aggression, more precisely why aggression in humans has been reduced only when it comes to reactive aggression, but not when it comes to proactive aggression, the latter exhibiting an increase in the advent of modern language. We postulate that this feedback loop was particularly important during the time period arguably between 200 and 50 kya, when humans were not fully modern, neither in terms of their skull/brain morphology and their behavior/culture nor in terms of their self-domestication. The novelty of our approach lies in (1) giving an active role to early forms of language in interacting with self-domestication processes; (2) providing specific linguistic details and functions of this early stage of grammar (including insult and humor); (3) supplying neurobiological, ontogenetic, and clinical evidence of a link between (reactive) aggression and (reactive) verbal behavior; (4) identifying proxies of the earlier stages in evolution among cognitive disorders; and (5) identifying specific points of contact and mutual reinforcement between these two processes (self-domestication and early language evolution), including reduction in physical aggression and stress/tension, as well as sexual selection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Here we propose that human self-domestication (the presence in humans of morphological, physiological, behavioral, and cognitive features commonly found in domestic animals) co-evolved with a gradual transition from in-group (reactive) physical aggression to inter-group (complex) verbal behavior <italic>via</italic> (reactive) verbal aggression, in a mutually reinforcing fashion. We explore here in detail the possibility that the emergence of the simplest forms of language/grammar accelerated processes of self-domestication and brain evolution already underway, which in turn fueled the transition to more complex languages. Early verbal creations would have afforded an adaptive (non-violent) way to compete for status and sex (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref147">Progovac and Locke, 2009</xref>), accelerating/reinforcing self-domestication, while enhanced self-domestication provided a richer niche for extended communication and language learning enabling the transition to more complex forms of language.</p>
<p>Language – communication relying on syntax and grammar – is usually construed as a human-specific cognitive faculty that resulted from biological changes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">Bolhuis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">Chomsky, 2017</xref>). As a consequence, its history is generally reconstructed by looking for proxies of language in extinct hominin species and for (deep) homologs of language in extant species. By contrast, emergence and divergence of modern languages across the globe are presumed influenced by the physical environment, and social and cultural practices, with such influences largely confined to non-grammatical, lexical components. As a consequence, the history of languages is traced with a minimal reference to changes in brain, behavior, and cognition.</p>
<p>There is ample evidence that socio-cultural factors do indeed influence the divergence of modern languages, and this goes well beyond the attested effect of social factors on linguistic diversity within a language (as studied by Sociolinguistics) or on the lexicons of world languages (as studied by Anthropological Linguistics). For instance, the number of speakers seemingly contributes to explain the morphological complexity of languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref114">Lupyan and Dale, 2010</xref>). Likewise, computational modeling, experimental work with human learners, and language emergence in certain cultural contexts (like the <italic>homesigns</italic> developed by isolated deaf communities) have shown that core properties of language, such as duality of pattern or compositionality, can emerge by iterated learning and cultural transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref501">Sandler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref173">Tamariz and Kirby, 2016</xref>) and that the same cognitive and biological biases can result in different language features in different cultural environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref178">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>). Increasingly, however, evidence suggests that language structure also impacts on basic cognitive abilities, such as effects of word order on working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">Amici et al., 2019</xref>). As a consequence, language features, language learning, and cognitive architecture comprise a reinforcing feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">Deacon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">Clarke and Heyes, 2017</xref>), wherein genetic changes occurred to accommodate language-specific cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref81">Jablonka et al., 2012</xref>). The greater cognitive cost of language processing and learning incurred by certain recently evolved languages might have necessitated cognitive adaptation because of the enhanced demands on working memory and executive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">Benítez-Burraco and Kempe, 2018</xref>). In brief, we should expect not only that our cognitive architecture accounts for many aspects of the languages we speak, but also that certain language features, resulting from cultural and environmental factors, affect, more or less permanently, our cognitive architecture. These two aspects cannot be detached one from the other.</p>
<p>We have a good understanding of the morphological changes that apparently afforded language readiness, including brain rewiring associated with the globularization of the human skull/brain, which is a distinctive feature of our species when compared to the elongated shape found in Neanderthals and Denisovans (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">Boeckx and Benítez-Burraco, 2014a</xref>). Likewise, we also appreciate the changes in human behavior and culture that affect language structure and divergence<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn001"><sup>1</sup></xref>. However, we lack good hypotheses about the feedback loop between these two processes. One possibility is that the biological changes that brought about our species also favored the creation of the niche that enabled the emergence of aspects of language complexity <italic>via</italic> cultural evolution, which in turn affected our biology. Another possibility, not mutually exclusive, is that certain cultural practices affected our biology and paved the way toward specific cognitive changes that enabled the emergence of language complexity. Human self-domestication might have contributed to both processes, the evolution of our language-ready brain, mostly <italic>via</italic> biological mechanisms, and the creation of modern languages mostly <italic>via</italic> cultural mechanisms. Prior proposals linking language evolution with self-domestication in humans (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref177">Thomas and Kirby, 2018</xref>) seem to assume a unidirectional causal relationship, whereby self-domestication contributed to the emergence of language readiness and of complex languages. Such proposals have not advanced explicit hypotheses regarding how some specific language expressions/structures would have contributed to self-domestication processes and thus to the biological aspects of human evolution. Here we explore such a possibility in detail.</p>

<title>The Language Evolution/Self-Domestication Feedback Loop: A Hypothesis</title>
<p>Compared to our primate relatives (perhaps with the exception of bonobos), and to species of extinct hominins, present-day humans exhibit reduced aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref78">Herrmann et al., 2011</xref>). Morphological changes indicative of reduced aggression appear in the fossil record alongside an increase in cultural artifacts, from around 80,000 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">Hare et al., 2012</xref>). The human self-domestication hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">Hare, 2017</xref>) proposes that these changes evolved when natural selection favored increased in-group prosociality over aggression in human evolution. Accordingly, as a by-product of this selection, present-day humans are thought to exhibit most of the physical, physiological, and behavioral traits commonly found in domesticated strains of animals compared to their wild conspecifics, including reduced cranial robusticity and brain size, neotenic features (mostly affecting the face), reduced sexual dimorphism, reduced aggression, increased playing behavior, enhanced socialization, and reduced responsiveness to stress as measured by cortisol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref161">Shea, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref104">Leach, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref165">Somel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref202">Zollikofer and Ponce de León, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref78">Herrmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref142">Plavcan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref116">Márquez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">Fukase et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref171">Stringer, 2016</xref>). This is seemingly due to the fact that selection against aggression inhibits the proliferation of the neural crest cells (NCCs), ultimately affecting the development of many body components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref187">Wilkins et al., 2014</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref160">Sánchez-Villagra and van Schaik, 2019</xref> for some cautionary notes). Less aggressive behavior resulting from our self-domestication might have specifically enhanced learning and teaching opportunities and our capacity for knowledge exchange and group collaboration, ultimately supporting an increase in language complexity <italic>via</italic> a cultural process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">Benítez-Burraco and Kempe, 2018</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref177">Thomas and Kirby, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>However, this broad picture has to be properly qualified. In spite of the trend toward increased in-group tolerance and prosociality, demographic pressures during the last part of our history seemingly increased inter-group aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">Choi and Bowles, 2007</xref>). As a consequence, although reactive physical aggression (that which arises from fear or anger) has declined over time, inter-group proactive aggression (which strategically aims to achieve specific outcomes) has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref191">Wrangham, 2018</xref>). Our proposal, which gives the emergence of language an active role, helps explain this otherwise surprising discrepancy between in-group and inter-group violence, which cannot be explained solely by self-domestication<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn002"><sup>2</sup></xref>. Interestingly, while proactive aggression seems to be tied to complex language/cognition, derogatory language, like swearing, is typically reactive, reinforcing our idea that it serves well to replace reactive physical aggression, specifically, and that it represents an early stage in the evolution of language complexity under the self-domestication hypothesis<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn003"><sup>3</sup></xref>.</p>
<p>While some reactive physical aggression persists, it has been largely replaced by reactive verbal aggression. Verbal rituals have persisted throughout recorded history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref113">Locke and Bogin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref112">Locke, 2009</xref>). Such duels with words, as opposed to fists, provide an adaptive way to discharge aggressive dispositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref117">Marsh, 1978</xref>) and to compete without risking physical harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref111">Locke, 2008</xref>). Although verbal duels may be a cathartic purging of aggressive impulses, their beauty, creativity, artistic value, and cultural specificity have also been observed by many (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">Darmesteter, 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref159">Samarin, 1969</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref138">Pagliai, 2009</xref>). While linguists tend to focus on the language function of conveying information (and have tended to “sanitize” the language they study, excluding swearing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Bergen, 2016</xref>, p. 3), there are other, expressive, esthetic, and profane aspects of language, which are just as relevant in the context of language evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">Haiman, 2013</xref>). Both verbal aggression and creativity are directly relevant to our proposal, showing the multiple adaptive advantages of using linguistic aggression over physical fighting (see section “Emergence of Proto-Syntax and Verbal Aggression (Insult)” for further discussion).</p>
<p>Direct verbal confrontation often makes use of simple forms of language, as illustrated with, e.g., crude compounds consisting of just one verb and one noun [e.g., English <italic>kill-joy</italic>, <italic>pick-pocket, scatter-brain</italic>, <italic>turn-coat, cry-baby</italic>; Serbian <italic>cepi-dlaka</italic> “split-hair,” <italic>vrti-guz</italic> “spin-butt” (fidget), <italic>ispi-čutura</italic> “drink-flask” (drunkard), <italic>jebi-vetar</italic> “screw-wind” (charlatan)]. As such, very simple grammars can suffice for verbal aggression and insult. Significantly, these compounds, which afford a particularly creative strategy for coining names with derogatory reference, have been analyzed as approximations of the earliest stages of grammar, showing both crude syntax and primitive vocabulary (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref147">Progovac and Locke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref144">Progovac, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref145">2016</xref>). Our hypothesis is that looking at the (gradual) emergence of verbal means of aggression (approximated by this kind of compound) might help illuminate the initial steps of the language evolution/self-domestication feedback loop. These verbal items would have afforded an adaptive (non-violent) way to compete for status and sex, first by derogating existing rivals and placing prospective rivals on notice; and second by demonstrating verbal skills and quick wittedness, both directly relevant for sexual selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref147">Progovac and Locke, 2009</xref>, p. 346)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn004"><sup>4</sup></xref>. As a consequence, they would have accelerated/reinforced the effects of self-domestication on human behavior and cognition, promoting the transition to more complex forms of language. These types of verbal forms promise to make just a bit narrower the otherwise enormous chasm separating, on the one hand, expressions of emotion/aggression in animals, and, on the other hand, refined human language, with embedded sentences, and thousands of words expressing various subtleties of meaning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">Code (2005</xref>, and references therein) offers evidence that swearwords are neurally distinct from the other words, relying both on brain areas where compositional language is processed, and on brain areas which support laughing and crying. In that sense, swearwords straddle the boundary between (animal) calls, which share many properties with laughing and crying, on the one hand, and compositional language, on the other. This reinforces the view that swearwords, which also often feature in insults, are primarily reactive, as are laughter and crying. Given that domestication processes can be long and protracted and not guaranteed to succeed either<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn005"><sup>5</sup></xref>, it is important that we can identify factors that can reinforce it. According to our view, one of these factors was the gradual emergence of language itself (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref160">Sánchez-Villagra and van Schaik, 2019</xref> for the importance of considering additional, synergistic factors, including language, in the considerations of self-domestication).</p>
<p>For concreteness, we postulate that this feedback loop was particularly important during the time period roughly between 200 and 50 kya<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn006"><sup>6</sup></xref>. This is a long time period when humans were not fully modern, neither in terms of their skull/brain morphology (and presumably, their cognitive abilities) and their behavior/culture nor in terms of their self-domestication (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">Hare, 2017</xref>). During this time period, we propose to correlate the advances in human self-domestication processes with the emergence of simple forms of language/syntax, which were particularly suitable for the expression of verbal aggression. The novelty of our approach lies in (1) giving an active role to early forms of language in interacting with self-domestication processes; (2) providing specific details and functions of this early stage of grammar (including insult and humor); (3) supplying neurobiological, ontogenetic, and clinical evidence of a link between (reactive) aggression and (reactive) verbal behavior; (4) identifying proxies of the earlier stages in evolution among cognitive disorders; and (5) identifying specific points of contact and mutual reinforcement between these two processes (self-domestication and early language evolution), including reduction in physical aggression and stress/tension, as well as sexual selection.</p>
<p>One benefit of our proposal is that it helps solve the paradox of the two aggression types, reactive and proactive, which is raised by the Self-Domestication Hypothesis (SDH), that is, why proactive aggression has increased with time in spite of our increased self-domestication. The problem finds a direct solution in correlating early self-domestication processes with the emergence of simple forms of early language/grammar, featuring reactive verbal aggression; on the other hand, proactive aggression seems to be enabled in the later stages of self-domestication, which correlates with more complex forms of language (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">Benítez-Burraco and Kempe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref91">Kissel and Kim, 2019</xref>). The following stages outline our proposal (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>):</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p><italic>The first stage</italic>, occurring roughly in the period prior to 200 kya, sees self-domestication processes only start to emerge, with reactive physical aggression still relatively high.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>The second stage</italic>, occurring roughly from 200 to 50 kya, sees increased self-domestication favoring the emergence of early language forms with proto-grammars especially suitable for swearing and insult (i.e., reactive language), which began to gradually replace reactive physical aggression, serving the same function. This early language was insufficiently sophisticated to support proactive aggression. During this stage, there is an accelerated feedback loop between self-domestication processes and the solidification of the early forms of language, both promoting a reduction in reactive physical aggression.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>The third stage</italic>, 50–10 kya (the Upper Paleolithic), saw self-domestication reach its peak. More cooperation and socialization and less reactive aggression created a niche for more complex forms of language and cognition.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>The fourth stage</italic>, from 10 kya (the onset of the Neolithic period) to the present day, was characterized by even more complex language and cognition, which now affords the linguistic, cognitive, and cultural means (e.g., sophisticated weapons) for coordinating premediated, large-scale, proactive aggression<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn007"><sup>7</sup></xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Our proposal regarding what characterized the second stage with respect to self-domestication and language evolution establishes a middle ground between two opposite but influential views, those of Chomsky and colleagues vs. Dediu and colleagues. On the one hand, based on their view of syntax/grammar as an undecomposable/unnegotiable block, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">Berwick and Chomsky (2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">2016</xref>, also previous work) proposed that language/syntax emerged suddenly and recently, in its full complexity, “just a bit over 50,000 years ago” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">Chomsky, 2005</xref>), with no possibility for any simpler stages or precursors, or “some 70,000–100,000 years ago, and does not seem to have undergone modification since then” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">Bolhuis et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, based on the comparative evidence among <italic>Homo heidelbergensis</italic>’ descendants, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">Dediu and Levinson (2013)</xref> proposed that language dates back to at least <italic>H. heidelbergensis</italic>, to some 500–400 kya, suggesting that Neanderthals and Denisovans might have even spoken complex languages comparable to those of modern humans, which would imply hierarchical and recursive syntax. We therefore acknowledge that our proposed timelines may be subject to revision pending further evidence. By contrast, in our proposal, this time period (roughly 200–50 kya) was characterized by a pre-hierarchical stage of languages, to contrast with the hierarchical and recursive stage, which is often associated with Chomsky’s notion of Merge. To avoid potential terminological confusion, we will adopt the terms pre-hierarchical stage and hierarchical stage. While the pre-hierarchical stage is associated with rudimentary symmetrical, flat, and non-recursive grammars, the hierarchical stage is associated with the exact opposite: asymmetrical, hierarchical, (potentially) recursive syntax. Nonetheless, as will be discussed in the following section, there is continuity and common ground between the two types of grammar, with the pre-hierarchical stage directly foreshadowing the nature of the hierarchical stage itself.</p>
<p>Relevant to this debate is also the nature and significant degree of cross-linguistic variation attested in the expression of the hierarchical stage (e.g., transitivity and tense) among extant human languages. Considering this variation in detail led to the proposal that these widely diverging hierarchical solutions were a later add-on, superimposed upon the common proto-syntactic foundation, and that the hierarchical layers of language may not have emerged only once and uniformly (in Africa) along with our species, but instead multiple times, and independently, either within Africa, or after the dispersion from Africa, plausibly in response to cultural pressures and innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref144">Progovac, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref145">2016</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn008"><sup>8</sup></xref>. At least under the uniregional view of human origins, this would argue against hierarchical syntax emerging earlier than around 100–50 kya with humans<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn009"><sup>9</sup></xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3">
<title>Emergence of Proto-Syntax and Verbal Aggression (Insult)</title>
<p>The use of profanity is characterized as “reactive language” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Bergen, 2016</xref>, p. 88) in the sense that it is typically impulsive and spontaneous, often referred to as automatic speech, or automatisms in aphasic studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref82">Jackson, 1884</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">Code, 2011</xref>). It contrasts with “intentional” language, which gets impaired in Broca’s and global aphasias and which is more complex, demanding greater working memory. We contend that reactive language (e.g., swearing) is continuous with reactive physical aggression, having gradually replaced the latter, during the second stage (roughly from 200 to 50 kya).</p>
<p>Consider the following verb-noun compounds (1–3) from English, Serbian, and Twi, collected from various sources, old and new (English and Serbian examples are from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref144">Progovac, 2015</xref>; Twi examples are from Kingsley Okai, p.c., 2011)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn010"><sup>10</sup></xref>.

The significance of these compounds is also that they specialize for insult when referring to humans, in a variety of languages, reinforcing our view that simplest grammars are especially suitable for insult. There is no other grammatical strategy that we are aware of that specializes for insult, and certainly not a strategy with so many tokens.</p>

<p>These creations specialize for derogatory reference and can be quite obscene and cruel. They are also humorous and creative, especially considering the simplicity of their structure. These compounds are coined by one single (non-recursive) operation merging just one verb and one noun (for illustration, see below; for further evidence and a discussion of alternative views, and possible variation across languages, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref144">Progovac, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref146">2019</xref>). Predominating among them are concrete, basic nouns, and verbs, depicting body parts and functions<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn012"><sup>12</sup></xref>. However, this rudimentary compounding strategy can produce stunning new concepts, often abstract. Their high imageability and coarseness contribute to the strong visceral effect. As metaphors, they demonstrate the cognitive innovations important for language, in particular, our ability to transcend the signature limits of core knowledge systems and ultimately, to combine and unify conceptual units that belong to distinct domains (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">Boeckx and Benítez-Burraco, 2014a</xref> for discussion). This enables us to metaphorize and metonymize, as well as to grammaticalize, and ultimately, to make languages change (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">Benítez-Burraco, 2017</xref> for discussion). They are thus also directly relevant for the consideration of cross-modality in the evolution of language, as discussed by, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">Cuskley and Kirby (2013)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref128">Miyagawa et al. (2018)</xref>.</p>
<p>These compounds exhibit features consistent with the primitive stages of language: grammatical simplicity; basic, concrete vocabulary; strong visceral effect; significant creativity; ability to transcend modalities to create new, abstract concepts (metaphoricity); ability to entertain and amuse (including humor); and continuity with complex syntax (see below). While these creations cannot be completely identical to what was created early in evolution<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn013"><sup>13</sup></xref>, they can serve as excellent proxies, or approximations, which can be used to test current hypotheses, as well as to formulate new ones. Moreover, even though they certainly fall short of modern syntactic riches, they provide the foundation, the template from which to build modern syntaxes, as discussed below. As argued by, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">Gil (2005)</xref>, such simple (associational) grammars are sufficient for many practical purposes.</p>
<p>While it is hard not to be distracted (or disturbed) by their extraordinary content, it is necessary to focus on the grammatical properties of these compounds. It is because of the most rudimentary nature of their grammar that these compounds qualify as approximations/proxies of proto-syntax. One concrete consequence of this type of two-slot grammar (which can only fit one verb and one noun, e.g., <italic>turn-skin</italic>) is that it cannot depict transitive events, which would require (at least) three slots (e.g., *<italic>snake-turn-skin</italic>; or <italic>*snake-shed-skin</italic>). In fact, this type of grammar is incapable of distinguishing subjects from objects (for further evidence, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref144">Progovac, 2015</xref>). The noun in these compounds can be either subject-like (<italic>cry-baby; rattle-snake; turn-table; tumble-weed</italic>) or object-like (<italic>turn-coat/skin; tumble-dung</italic> (beetle); <italic>fold-tail; split-hair</italic>), and sometimes, it is hard to tell (e.g., <italic>scatter-brain; busy-body; dare-devil</italic>). Moreover, unlike their hierarchical counterparts in (4), verb-noun compounds in English (or Serbian) are not recursive (5), in the sense that the output of one binary operation of V + N (creating another N, <italic>pick-pocket</italic>) cannot serve as input to another binary operation, combining, e.g., the verb (V) <italic>chase</italic> with the noun (N) <italic>pick-pocket</italic>.</p>

</list-item>
</list>
<p>This simple binary stage of language directly foreshadows the nature of modern grammars in two important respects. First, modern grammars (with their so-called Merge operation) are considered to be binary, too, creating structures in a pair-wise fashion. Second, modern grammars rely heavily on nouns and verbs to express predications, i.e., who (noun) does what (verb). One can certainly imagine different kinds of grammars (ternary, n-ary), and different vocabularies depicting totally different concepts and relations, but modern human grammars are designed in a painstakingly binary fashion, and mostly for the purposes of expressing who does what (to whom). Such noun-verb combinations are at the bottom and the beginning of almost every modern sentence<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn014"><sup>14</sup></xref>. In fact, syntactic theory (e.g., Minimalism and predecessors) considers that every sentence unfolds from this bottom layer, which typically features a merge of just one verb and one noun (phrase), resulting in a Verb Phrase (VP) or Small Clause (SC), as given in (6). This analysis of the modern sentence is one of the most insightful and stable postulates in this theoretical framework. It was originally outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">Burzio (1981)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref169">Stowell (1981)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref92">Kitagawa (1985)</xref> and further solidified in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref93">Koopman and Sportiche (1991)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">Chomsky (1995)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Adger (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">Citko (2011)</xref>, and many others. This merge operation at the bottom of the hierarchy is sometimes referred to as First Merge in syntactic literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Adger, 2003</xref>), whereas Second Merge adds a second argument (subject), in another, higher layer/segment of the verb phrase, which may be referred to as little vP (where TP is the Tense Phrase, responsible for the expression of tense and finiteness):</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>6. TP &gt; vP &gt; SC/VP<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn015"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>If one intends to express both a subject and an object, together with the verb (7), one cannot do so with just a single binary operation (note that human grammars do not seem to allow ternary merges, but only binary ones; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref90">Kayne, 1984</xref>). This now requires first assembling an intransitive verb phrase or VP (a verb and one noun) (8a), and then taking that VP as an assembled unit and merging it with another layer of structure, little vP (8b). And the same is true for expressing tense/time – yet another layer, TP, is added for that purpose (8c). But, importantly, at the bottom of both transitive (7,8) and intransitive (9,10) sentences lies the binary, and possibly flat, small clause combination of just one verb and one noun (phrase)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn016"><sup>16</sup></xref>.</p>

<p>The cross-out notation indicates the initial, underlying position of the subject in the small clause, before it moves to the TP layer. The Move operation in modern syntax can be seen as a strategy for connecting various layers of structure and, in this case, transforming the ancestral small clause into a full-fledged modern sentence. This certainly looks like a tortured, roundabout way to simply express who does what to whom. But this step-by-step building of modern syntactic layers, including transitivity, makes perfect sense if the original proto-grammar was preserved as the foundation upon which to build further layers, rather than discarded. It would have been a solid, sturdy step from which to reach for ever higher but shakier steps. The less plausible alternative would have been to step down first, to the platform with no grammar at all, and then start from scratch, trying to jump straight to the higher realms. But this would have resulted in very different modern grammars<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn017"><sup>17</sup></xref>. It is this binary requirement on building syntactic structure, already foreshadowed in the proto-grammar stage, that forces the hierarchy/asymmetry, which characterizes modern languages.</p>
<p>Even though our focus here is on verbal aggression and insult, the benefits of this kind of proto-grammar would have been much broader. This type of proto-grammar would have also provided a convenient strategy for naming animals [<italic>tumble-dung; swish-tail</italic> (<italic>bird</italic>)<italic>; stink-bug</italic>], plants (<italic>tumble-weed; catch-fly</italic>), objects, and places, as well as for expressing basic commands (e.g., <italic>Catch fly! Turn snake!</italic>) and statements (e.g., <italic>Bug stink; Monkey see</italic>), not to mention enhanced ways of thinking, because it enables one to create new concepts by merging two pre-existing concepts. They could have also been used for affective purposes between partners or for calming and comforting one’s children (e.g., <italic>Baby sleep</italic>), also contributing to alleviating stress and tensions. In addition, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref144">Progovac (2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref145">2016)</xref>, an important extension of this two-<italic>word</italic> proto-grammar would have been two-<italic>clause</italic> symmetric combinations involving binary formulae (typically AB AC), often expressing wisdoms and observations (e.g., <italic>You seek, you find; You sow, you reap; Easy come, easy go; Come one, come all; First come, first serve(d); Like father, like son; Monkey see, monkey do</italic>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn018"><sup>18</sup></xref>. Such symmetric/paratactic clause combinations, where clauses stand next to each other, would have foreshadowed modern-day subordination/hypotaxis, where clauses get embedded one within another (e.g., <italic>Those who seek will find</italic>.).</p>
<p>In summary, the postulated approximations of proto-grammar provide continuity with modern syntax in two essential ways: (1) in their binary nature and (2) in their reliance on noun-like and verb-like elements to express predication. Even though it has become customary to reduce syntax to Chomsky’s Merge, it is important to emphasize here that the combinatorics of syntax is just one aspect of it, determining how many elements can merge at a time (binarity), and how many times (recursion), and in which manner (flat or hierarchical). Human syntax/language is also undoubtedly designed to express predication, i.e., to express who does what (to whom), by using primarily verbs and nouns. Importantly, the way syntax became complex is not in just any old random way, but in a way that helps express, with more precision, who does what to whom (and when, and where, and how, and why)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn019"><sup>19</sup></xref>. In both of these respects (binary combinatorics, and the focus on who does what to whom), verb-noun compounds are an excellent stepping stone into modern syntax. Importantly for our purposes, the proto-grammar strategy behind these compounds not only provides continuity with complex syntax but also provides a more graceful transition from animal cognition, and particularly, from animal behavior, i.e., their emotional vocalizations, to human behavior, <italic>via</italic> verbal aggression.</p>

<title>Neurobiology of Physical Aggression and Reactive Language</title>
<p>The limbic system (a group of brain structures supporting emotion, motivation, and long-term memory; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref156">Rolls, 2015</xref> for review), the striatal regions, and parts of the cortex, particularly, the frontal and the temporal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">Dolan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref197">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">Boccardi et al., 2011</xref>) support aggressive behavior. Highly aggressive subjects exhibit enlargement and atypical activation of striatal regions (particularly, the caudate; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">Gatzke-Kopp et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">Ducharme et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref196">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). The striatum has been associated with the dopamine system that governs the regulation of motivated behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref129">Mogenson et al., 1980</xref>), and which is critically involved in the expression of aggression in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref155">Rodriguiz et al., 2004</xref>), but it is also crucially involved in language processing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref95">Krishnan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref183">Viñas-Guasch and Wu, 2017</xref>). Domesticated rats exhibit size reductions of the striatal area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref500">Kruska and Schott, 1977</xref>), and the limbic system exhibits the highest differences between domesticated animals and their wild conspecifics (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref97">Kruska, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar brain areas are involved in both reactive and proactive aggression; however, only the latter is associated with a thinner anterior cingulate cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref196">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), a region involved in the regulation of emotions and social behavior including conflict monitoring and empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">Devinsky et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">Botvinick, 2007</xref>). The cingulate gyrus, which is part of cingulate cortex, plays a key role in language processing, contributing to speech production <italic>via</italic> its connections with Broca’s area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">Bernal et al., 2015</xref>). Compared to chimpanzees, bonobos (who are less aggressive) exhibit stronger links between the anterior cingulate gyrus and the amygdala, a pathway involved in the inhibition of aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref153">Rilling et al., 2012</xref>). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref157">Roth and Strüber (2009)</xref> found that reactive aggression is associated with smaller, less active frontal brain structures and amygdala hyperactivity, whereas proactive aggression correlates with reduced response of the amygdala and of cortical regions related to empathic and social behavior. Compared to chimps, bonobos also show an enlarged dorsal amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref153">Rilling et al., 2012</xref>). The amygdala is also implicated in the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis through connections with the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">Davis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref107">Ledoux, 1998</xref>). The HPA axis is a major neuroendocrine system encompassing the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the adrenal glands and regulating a great number of bodily functions. A reduced response of the HPA axis to stress has been observed in most domesticated animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref97">Kruska, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100">Künzl and Sachser, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref180">Trut et al., 2009</xref>). With respect to aggression and cognitive functioning, reactive aggression in humans is associated with lower levels of goal-oriented inhibition and higher levels of flexibility, and proactive aggression is associated with higher levels of working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref76">Hecht and Latzman, 2018</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn020"><sup>20</sup></xref>.</p>
<p>In comparison to other forms of language, the processing of swear words/profanity entails more involvement of the basal ganglia, limbic structures, thalamus, and the right hemisphere (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">Code, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Bergen, 2016</xref>). The basal ganglia (i.e., the striatal regions) and the limbic system are also highly implicated in physical aggression. Disorders, which result in uncontrolled swearing/profanity, typically involve a basal-limbic connection dysfunction (discussed further in section “Disorders”). Basal-limbic structures are phylogenetically old, and the aspects of human communication associated with them are considered to be ancient, too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref182">Van Lancker and Cummings, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">Bradshaw, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Bergen, 2016</xref>), a potentially controversial claim (although see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref108">Lieberman, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref109">2009</xref> on the ancient nature of basal ganglia). In this respect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">Code (2005</xref>, p. 317) suggests that these forms of language might represent fossilized clues to the evolutionary origins of human communication. With brain damage affecting inhibitory processes, primitive behaviors (e.g., verbal automatisms) can emerge from primitive regions. In fact, damage to language centers in the brain can obliterate most language but leave swearing and expletives intact (see section “Disorders” for more details).</p>
<p>Differential impairment of reactive language versus intentional language implies that they employ distinct neural bases/pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Bergen, 2016</xref>, p. 87). The circuit that supports reactive language (including profanity) is evolutionarily far older, dominated by the limbic system, responsible for generating emotions and motor impulses, where the basal ganglia regulates and selectively suppresses such impulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Bergen, 2016</xref>, p. 95). In disorders, such as Tourette’s syndrome with coprolalia, there is a failure of this regulatory function of basal ganglia (see section “Disorders”). The relevance of basal ganglia for emotional speech processes, including such basic emotions as fear and disgust, is also established in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref140">Paulmann et al. (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref141">Péron et al. (2013)</xref>. Emotional vocalizations by other primates and mammals also seem to be supported by this kind of pathway, involving the limbic system and the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref154">Robinson, 1967</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">Gruber and Grandjean, 2017</xref>), suggesting that emotional, profane language has some continuity with emotional vocalizations in other animals.</p>
<p>In natural use, expletives, especially those that are highly taboo, elicit strong physiological responses (including increased heart rate and sweating; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Bergen, 2016</xref>). Such words are used for fundamental expression of deep emotion, including fear, pain, frustration, as well as for sex and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">Code, 2005</xref>). The use of profanity is more common in men than in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref85">Jay, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref86">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref182">Van Lancker and Cummings, 1999</xref>, but see section “Aggression, Verbal Behavior, and Sexual Selection” for a possible challenge to this view), and this is true even in language disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">Code, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref84">Jankovic and Rohaidy, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Bergen, 2016</xref>). Considering that reactive physical aggression is more frequent in men than in women and that self-domestication was primarily subject to sexual selection (see section “Child Development”), this parallelism between physical and verbal aggression reinforces our hypothesis that verbal aggression acts as a proxy/replacement for reactive physical aggression.</p>
<p>Finally, expletive compounds can be highly humorous. One of the main functions of humor is to provide relief from stress and tension, <italic>via</italic> laughter and mirth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">Berlyne, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref123">Meyer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">Buijzen and Valkenburg, 2004</xref>). Humor serves as a natural stress antagonist in situations of trauma and stress, by decreasing cortisol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref184">Vrticka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">Bains et al., 2014</xref>). Typically, wild animals exhibit a more pronounced cortisol response to stress, compared to their domestic counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100">Künzl and Sachser, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref99">Künzl et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref201">Zipser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref88">Kaiser et al., 2015</xref>). As noted above, domestication is associated with a reduction in the function of the HPA axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref132">Naumenko and Belyaev, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref97">Kruska, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref136">Oskina, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100">Künzl and Sachser, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref180">Trut et al., 2009</xref>). Humor engages a core network of cortical and subcortical structures, including the meso-cortico-limbic dopaminergic system and the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref184">Vrticka et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, humor can often serve as a form of strong assertiveness bordering on aggression, especially in cases of teasing and insult (see section “Child Development”). We therefore argue that humor’s dual functions (i.e., stress reduction function and verbal aggression), and its reliance on limbic structures supports our proposition that early forms of language provided relief from stress and tension, as well as a (verbal) alternative to reactive aggression, and thus reinforced the effects of self-domestication.</p>

<title>Disorders</title>
<p>Of particular relevance to our hypothesis are disorders that exhibit an imbalance between inhibition and disinhibition of verbal aggression. In this section, we consider certain disorders, which imply a dissociation between derogatory language and (more complex) referential language. Some of these conditions have a genetic basis, with candidate genes positively selected in our species.</p>
<sec id="sec6">
<title>Tourette’s Syndrome and Coprophenomena</title>
<p>Tourette’s syndrome (TS) is a hereditary tic disorder affecting the basal ganglia and the basolateral amygdala and hippocampal formation, circuitry involved in social decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Albin, 2018</xref>). It is sometimes accompanied by involuntary obscene speech and derogatory comments (coprolalia). Less commonly, TS patients may also exhibit copropraxia, which involves involuntarily making obscene gestures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref84">Jankovic and Rohaidy, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref162">Singer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">Freeman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Bergen, 2016</xref>). Although these coprophenomena and the TS syndrome more generally remain poorly understood, brain imaging, neurophysiological, and post-mortem findings implicate the cortical-striatal-thalamocortical pathways in the etiopathology of TS (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref126">Mink, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref163">Singer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref164">Singer and Minzer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">Ganos et al., 2013</xref>). These pathways overlap with striatal-cortical networks implicated in physical aggression (as discussed above) and with the Broca’s-basal ganglia network essential for speech and language processing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref108">Lieberman, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref109">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref110">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref181">Ullman, 2006</xref>). TS also tends to include repetitive involuntary eye, facial, and head movements, as well as explosive outbursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">Budman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref89">Kano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">Ganos et al., 2014</xref>). Given that the major functional role of eye, face, and head movements is social signaling, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Albin (2018)</xref> suggested that the coprophenomena associated with TS may be best understood as distortions of reactive, spontaneous social signals, thus possibly implicating the brain areas involved in TS in the evolution of early language. The use of foul reactive language at the early stages of human self-domestication may have strengthened these brain circuits, easing the way into more complex forms of language<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn021"><sup>21</sup></xref>.</p>
<p>Patients with TS experience an increase in their tics under stressful conditions, which are accompanied by a sense of discomfort that is relieved by tic performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">Cohen and Leckman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref106">Leckman and Peterson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">Evers and van de Wetering, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref83">Jankovic, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">Banaschewski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref101">Kwak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref190">Woods et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref502">Corbett et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Albin, 2018</xref>). Importantly, a subset of TS patients exhibits heightened reactivity to stress of the HPA axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref503">Chappell et al., 1994</xref>). Likewise, children with TS show higher cortisol levels in response to stressors, which are indicative of an enhanced HPA responsivity to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref502">Corbett et al., 2008</xref>). This is relevant to the self-domestication hypothesis of human evolution, because, as noted above, domestication entails reduced response of the HPA axis to stress. In this respect, TS can be seen as exhibiting attenuated features of self-domestication, positing an intriguing parallelism with autism, also proposed to exhibit some features of a less-domesticated phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">Benítez-Burraco et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Rare mutations in selected genes have been identified in some TS patients. One of these genes is <italic>SLITRK1</italic>, which encodes an integral membrane protein involved in neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref127">Miranda et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>SLITRK1</italic> has an evolutionarily conserved expression pattern in projection neurons of the corticostriatal-thalamocortical circuits and cortical pyramidal neurons, contributing to the development of connections between the cortex, the striatum, and the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref168">Stillman et al., 2009</xref>). Incidentally, there is also an ancestral mutation of <italic>SLITRK1</italic> (S330A) that has been related to TS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref137">Ozomaro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">Alexander et al., 2016</xref>). This SNP is highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref176">Theofanopoulou et al. (2017b)</xref> as a sort of window to the “underdomesticated” phenotypes found in other hominins. Overall, these genetic findings suggest that TS is more related to ancestral genomic variants than to derived changes in modern humans.</p>

<sec id="sec7">
<title>Aphasia and Speech Automatisms</title>
<p>Aphasias, resulting from brain damage, involve disinhibition of speech automatisms, such as counting, rhyming, prayer, but most commonly expletives and modal/auxiliary sentence stem structures (e.g., <italic>I cannot</italic>; <italic>I try</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">Code, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">Code et al., 2009</xref>). These two most frequent subtypes are also most relevant for evolutionary considerations. For the severest cases of non-fluent aphasia, these automatisms may be the only speech produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">Code, 2011</xref>, p. 139). Speaking specifically about derogatory language, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">Code (2011)</xref> points out that naturally occurring expletives emerge from ancient areas of the limbic system (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref504">Code, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref105">Leckman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref166">Speedie et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref182">Van Lancker and Cummings, 1999</xref>). On the other hand, in pathology, expletives seem to emerge from disinhibited basal-limbic structures, which are normally under control from prefrontal networks, where basal ganglia damage appears to be essential for the production of an aphasic automatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">Brunner et al., 1982</xref>). With aphasias, we witness a loss of the complex compositional language, while the reactive, derogatory language is preserved. According to the so-called last in, first out principle (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">Code, 2005</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">Gibson, 2009</xref>), what is acquired last is the most shallow/fragile layer that is the easiest to lose, and vice versa. In other words, the most recently evolved components of cognition, which certainly include compositional language, are the least robust, and most prone to damage and loss. If true, this provides further evidence of the role of reactive verbal aggression in language evolution.</p>
<p>This raises the question of whether the production of automatisms is associated with a higher degree of stress, and whether such production helps relieve stress. While there are many reports to the effect that aphasics in general experience a lot of stress and anxiety, even anger, specifically in trying to use language (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">Goldstein, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref115">Luria, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref103">Laures-Gore et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">Cahana-Amitay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref102">Laures-Gore, 2012</xref>), we have not come across any reports addressing specifically the production of automatisms in this respect. It would be of interest for future research to determine whether or not the incidence of specifically cursing and derogatory automatisms correlates with the experience of higher stress and anger (and thus higher cortisol levels), as well as whether the uttering of such automatisms helps relieve stress, in a way comparable to the production of tics in TS (section “Tourette’s Syndrome and Coprophenomena”).</p>
<p>In summary, our discussion of language/cognitive disorders in relation to self-domestication and language evolution supports the view that these disorders can inform on aspects of human domestication. They, moreover, involve patterns of inhibition and disinhibition that seem to be just poles on the continuum of cognitive modes, encompassing also the typically developing cognition. The discussion of disorders also highlights the existence of significant individual variability across all the dimensions relevant for language processing, which, moreover, seems to be genetically influenced. These considerations suggest that the evolution of language cannot be a simple, straightforward step, but rather a complex, multi-faceted, and multi-gene phenomenon, recruiting and coordinating a variety of cognitive systems and functions, with each new development potentially subject to genetic and/or cultural evolution.</p>

<title>Child Development</title>
<p>While ontogeny does not literally recapitulate phylogeny, there are usually points of comparison (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref152">Ridley, 1993</xref>). Here we report on some notable parallels between childhood development and our model of language evolution, with a focus on aggression, verbal (derogatory) behavior, and complex language. First, in the transition from infancy to childhood, when syntax emerges, there are developments in three other relevant areas: the ability to spontaneously coin compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">Becker, 1994</xref>); the tendency to tease and insult, and thus, the onset of humor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref120">McGhee, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">Apte, 1985</xref>); and the onset of agonistic verbal engagement or verbal dueling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">Gossen, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref193">Wyatt, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref194">1999</xref>). Second, as noted by these and other authors, teasing and insulting, as well as verbal dueling, tend to predominate in males, even at the time of their appearance in late infancy or early childhood, pointing to the relevance of sexual selection, and providing further supporting evidence for our proposal.</p>
<p>Regarding the emergence of syntax, children use simpler/simplified syntactic structures early on, and combinations of just one verb and one noun (intransitive structures) predominate in early child grammars cross-linguistically. It is beyond the scope of this paper to get into different types of theories and controversies behind these omissions/simplifications, as the literature on this topic is vast and varied. Suffice it to note here that, at least on the surface, early children grammars often express only one noun argument per verb (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref199">Zheng and Goldin-Meadow, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref151">Rakhlin and Progovac, 2017</xref>). Children’s early utterances also include novel compounds of various kinds, including noun-noun and verb-noun combinations, for example, light-man (electrician); nose-beard (whiskers); and push-ball (a ball for pushing and bouncing; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">Becker, 1994</xref>). Compounding of this type seems to be a rather simple, straightforward strategy for children expressing new concepts.</p>
<p>There are also experiments targeting specifically compounds using verbs and nouns, establishing a clear difference in the order and ease of acquisition between flat verb-noun compounds and their hierarchical counterparts. In their experiment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">Clark et al. (1986)</xref> prompted children to produce hierarchical -<italic>er</italic> compounds (e.g., <italic>This is a cheese-grater</italic>; <italic>paper-ripper; ball-bouncer</italic>). At around three, instead of these targeted compounds, children consistently produced related verb-noun combinations (i.e., <italic>This is a grate-cheese; rip-paper; bounce-ball</italic>). Before reaching the target adult-like stage, many children also experienced another stage, where they produced compounds with misplaced affixes (i.e., <italic>This is dry-hair-er/dry-er-hair</italic> in lieu of <italic>hair-dry-er</italic>) or (<italic>This is a fix-bik-er/fix-er-bike</italic> in lieu of <italic>bike-fix-er</italic>).</p>
<p>Some conclusions from child language studies are important for our hypothesis. First, the stages and struggles in the acquisition of these compounds reinforce the view that -<italic>er</italic> compounds are related to VN compounds, as both rely on the common foundation provided by the flat (paratactic) verb-noun composition. Second, children start with the simpler structures, with the foundation, before they can scaffold to the hierarchical supra-structure, as emphasized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">Clark et al. (1986)</xref>. Third, VN compositions seem to be more primary and simpler than their hierarchical relatives.</p>
<p>With regard to the second area of development, namely, the onset of humor (and the tendency to tease and insult), laughter is one of the first social vocalizations in human infants, with an early onset at approximately 4 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref158">Ruch and Ekman, 2001</xref>). Responsive smiling generally develops even earlier, within the first 5 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref94">Kraemer et al., 1999</xref>). The earliest form of humor in young children, incongruity-based humor, relies on principles of discrepancy applied to actions, such as clowning and acting silly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref120">McGhee, 1976</xref>). This kind of humor has also been reported for other primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref139">Patterson and Gordon, 1993</xref>). McGhee also reports a gender difference emerging at the age of 6–11 years old, but not before that. Specifically, he found that boys laughed more frequently than girls (the girls instead tended to smile), that they initiated humor more often, whether by non-verbal or verbal means, and that they also showed more hostility in their laughter and humor, including ridicule and insult. McGhee concluded that attempts to initiate humor or laughter in the presence of others can be seen as a form of strong assertiveness, especially in the case of hostile humor. This is directly relevant for our hypothesis of verbal aggression (partly) replacing physical aggression, which also predominates in males.</p>
<p>Finally, concerning the third area of development that we wish to highlight (the onset of agonistic verbal engagement or verbal dueling), it has been found that, cross-culturally, boys aged 3–11 engage in rough and tumble play, as well as verbal aggression, significantly more than do girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref186">Whiting and Edwards, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">Apte, 1985</xref>, p. 71; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref505">Björkqvist, 2018</xref>, for a possibly different view). Likewise, in many cultures, adolescent boys and men tend to engage in ritual insults (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">Apte, 1985</xref>, p. 70). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref117">Marsh (1978)</xref> provides convincing evidence from a variety of situations and cultures that ritual insult exchanges often serve instead of physical violence. This is consistent with our view that verbal aggression provides a different channel to the same goal, involving less risk of physical harm, thus contributing to better survival.</p>

<title>Aggression, Verbal Behavior, and Sexual Selection</title>
<p>Self-domestication in humans has been attributed to sexually selective forces, including selection against (physical) aggression, and in favor of pair-bonding beneficial for child rearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">Hare et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref167">Stanyon and Bigoni, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref135">Okanoya, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">Gleeson, 2018</xref>). Likewise, the emergence of early grammars, especially suited to verbal aggression (insult), has been attributed to sexual selection for creative cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref147">Progovac and Locke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref144">Progovac, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the use of both verbal and physical aggression seems more prevalent in males, revealing a dimorphism characteristic of sexual selection. Starting early on in childhood, and continuing into adulthood, across a variety of cultures, both physical aggression and verbal aggression show significant gender differences in favor of males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref186">Whiting and Edwards, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">Apte, 1985</xref>), including with language disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">Code, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref84">Jankovic and Rohaidy, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Bergen, 2016</xref>). This gender discrepancy in both types of aggression suggests that they cluster together and that they have a common underlying cause, consistent with our proposal that verbal aggression served to replace (reactive) physical aggression.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">Franks and Rigby (2005)</xref> observed that men increase their creativity with language in the presence of both attractive women and male competitors. Creativity is highly correlated with intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref125">Miller, 2000</xref>), implicating creative language use in both mate attraction and intra-sexual competition in men. Furthermore, eloquent speakers tend to be granted the highest social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref172">Tallerman, 2013</xref>, p. 95), which in turn is correlated with greater reproductive success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref112">Locke, 2009</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">Gleeson (2018</xref>, p. 8), we contend that any increase in language complexity may imply selection forces favoring such complexity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref146">Progovac, 2019</xref>), directly implicating sexual selection in the proliferation of more complex, creative language.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while sexual dimorphism has decreased in humans during the period of self-domestication, it has certainly not been eliminated. In his review article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">Gleeson (2018)</xref> makes a case for the relevance of sexual selection in the evolution of humans, and he observes that female preferences must have been for moderately masculine males, rather than for extremely non-masculine (domesticated) ones, likely reflecting conflicting forces in sexual selection<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn022"><sup>22</sup></xref>. On the one hand, there are female preferences for male investment in pair-bonding, but on the other hand, there are also female preferences for physically stronger, more masculine males, which seem to be context-dependent, and to vary relative to environmental and other circumstances, related to survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref179">Trivers, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref96">Kruger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">Archer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref150">Quist et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">Boothroyd et al. (2017)</xref> found that moderately masculine fathers had more surviving offspring than those with both relatively low and relatively high masculinity, suggesting a centralized optimum of masculinity. It is also worth observing that some indicators of masculinity have infiltrated language, including low vocal pitch, as well as the initiation of humor, often analyzed as building and then resolving tension/incongruity, and considered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref120">McGhee (1976)</xref> to reveal strong assertiveness, especially given that it involves a risk of failure. Both of these features seem to be subject to female preferences, possibly indirectly contributing to the preservation of (moderate) masculinity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, males exhibit displays of physical prowess to the formidability of male competitors, as well as characteristics such as facial hair and low vocal pitch, that increase perceptions of dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref79">Hill et al., 2017</xref>). These traits are of direct relevance for sexual selection because they show sexual dimorphism, they emerge around puberty, and they correlate with success in mating and reproduction. Importantly, the specific derogatory compounds, which we argue are reflective of early language, are illustrative of both inter- and intra-sexual selection. Regarding male to male competition, these compounds often describe men in derogatory terms, but even when they seemingly describe women, such compounds are still typically used to derogate men, for a doubly insulting effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref124">Mihajlović, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref147">Progovac and Locke, 2009</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn023"><sup>23</sup></xref>. As pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref117">Marsh (1978)</xref>, the most frequent type of insult among men even today has to do with emasculating one’s opponent. Their usefulness in derogating existing rivals and placing prospective rivals on notice (aggressive rivalry), and in demonstrating verbal skills, humor, and quick wittedness simultaneously engages both sides of the sexual selection equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref147">Progovac and Locke, 2009</xref>). Such verbal items would have afforded a particularly useful, low-risk (non-violent) way to compete for status and sex. Of direct relevance for our proposal is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref79">Hill et al.’s (2017)</xref> conclusion that intra-sexual selection led to enhanced same-sex intimidation, or formidability, instead of actual combat. In this respect, derogatory language can be viewed as the most innovative and creative means of achieving such “formidability,” which straddles the boundary between physical and cognitive strength.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">Card et al.’s (2008)</xref> meta-analytic review of 148 studies, there exist clear gender discrepancies favoring boys in direct (reactive) aggression, and only trivial differences favoring girls in indirect aggression (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref505">Björkqvist, 2018</xref>). While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref505">Björkqvist (2018)</xref> suggests that boys and girls are equally aggressive when it comes to verbal aggression, the evidence for this claim is not provided in this opinion piece, and it contradicts many reports which have found such a difference favoring males in verbal aggression, whether with typical populations [section “Neurobiology of Physical Aggression and Reactive Language”], or impaired populations (section “Disorders”). While reactive physical aggression in humans has seen a decline, as discussed at length in the previous sections, it still exists, and it (still) shows a prominent gender difference. According to, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">Archer (2009)</xref>, the extent and the nature of gender differences in aggression can be better explained by sexual selection, given that they increase with the degree of associated risk, occur early in life, and peak in young adulthood.</p>
<p>There are also gender differences in initiating and perceiving humor. Adolescent and adult females exhibit greater emotional reactivity during humor perception than do males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref184">Vrticka et al., 2013</xref>). This supports the fitness indicator hypothesis of humor, related to female preferences. Unlike with humor appreciation, where striatal activation follows or coincides with activation of temporal regions, with humor creation (which exhibits a male bias), the peak striatal activation precedes the peak of temporal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">Amir and Biederman, 2016</xref>). The striatum (basal ganglia) is also implicated in both physical and verbal aggression. Both types of gender differences, those associated with the initiation of humor, and those associated with the appreciation of humor, directly implicate sexual selection in the feedback loop that we propose was critical to the evolution of language and self-domestication.</p>
<p>Three hormones were likely targets for sexual selection with respect to a reduction in physically aggressive behavior: serotonin, testosterone, and oxytocin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref98">Kuepper et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref131">Montoya et al., 2012</xref>). Low testosterone has been related to male prosociality and parental care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">Burnham, 2007</xref>). Exogenous serotonin increases harm avoidance and cooperative behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref189">Wood et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">Crockett et al., 2010</xref>) and increases in brain levels of serotonin correlate with reduced emotional reactivity and aggression in experimental animal populations selected for friendliness toward humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref143">Plyusnina et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">Agnvall et al., 2015</xref>). In domesticated animals and bonobos, an increase in serotonin and a reduction in testosterone are associated with facial feminization and reduced cranial capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">Hare et al., 2012</xref>). Although archaic human species had similar sized brains compared to <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, their faces seem to be more masculinized than the oldest modern humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">Churchill, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">Hare, 2017</xref>). It is also relevant that changes in the brain seem to have predated changes in our face morphology, possibly because of our mild self-domestication at that initial stage. Finally, oxytocin has been claimed to modulate the multimodality that characterizes higher-order linguistic abilities, including the vocal-auditory system, the attentional-memory system, and the socio-interactive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref174">Theofanopoulou, 2016</xref>) because of its regulatory role on the development of specific neural pathways (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref175">Theofanopoulou et al., 2017a</xref> on vocal learning).</p>
<p>We thus conclude that sexual selection of self-domestication interacts with sexual selection for verbal aggression, possibly in conflicting ways, which may account for the complicated picture of the expressions of masculinity described above: while the former favored less physically aggressive males, the latter favored verbal behavior/aggression, which, at early stages of language emergence, brought about novelty, creativity, and verbal humor. The net result would converge on selecting those who are not just less aggressive, but who are also better able to use verbal aggression to replace physical aggression, as they would be selected by both processes. This contrasts with the conclusion reached by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref167">Stanyon and Bigoni (2014)</xref>, who argue that it was reduced male competition and increased female choice that favored cognitive evolution. While this is certainly one part of the story, our proposal implies that the continued male competition in the realm of verbal aggression/verbal behavior also contributed substantially to the evolution of cognitive abilities, at least at this early but crucial step in the emergence of language and evolution of self-domestication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10">
<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>Here we proposed that that self-domestication favored the emergence of a phenotype prone to replace reactive physical aggression with verbal aggression. The (partial) transition to verbal aggression and verbal behavior more generally then favored self-domestication, <italic>via</italic> a mutually reinforcing feedback loop, since verbal behavior affords less violence, better survival, and more opportunities for social interactions, ultimately paving the way for the evolution of more complex forms of language. We further proposed that looking at the (gradual) emergence of verbal means of aggression (approximated by proto-grammatical compounds) helps illuminate the initial steps of the language evolution/self-domestication feedback loop. The novelty of our approach lies in (1) giving an active role to early forms of language in interacting with self-domestication processes; (2) providing specific details and functions of this early stage of grammar (including creative uses of insult and humor); (3) supplying neurobiological, ontogenetic, and clinical evidence of a link between (reactive) aggression and (reactive) verbal behavior; (4) identifying proxies of the earlier stages in evolution among cognitive disorders; and (5) identifying specific points of contact and mutual reinforcement between these two processes (self-domestication and early language evolution), including reduction in physical aggression and stress/tension, as well as sexual selection.</p>
<p>One immediate advantage of our proposal is that, as noted, it helps solve the paradox of the two aggression types, reactive and proactive, which the Self-Domestication Hypothesis (SDH) on its own cannot solve. If SDH simply postulates that humans were selected for their friendliness and lack of aggression, then this discrepancy between the two aggression types is unexpected. But the problem finds a direct solution in correlating early self-domestication processes with the emergence of simple forms of early language/grammar, as per our proposal in this paper, but also in correlating later stages of self-domestication with more complex forms of language, as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">Benítez-Burraco and Kempe (2018)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref91">Kissel and Kim (2019)</xref>. Given that the postulated proto-grammar is particularly suitable for expressing crude and often obscene insults, representing essentially reactive language, this kind of language would have been most useful in countering/replacing reactive aggression, but as such, it would not have affected any existing or emerging proactive aggression.</p>
<p>Several classes of predictions arise from our proposal, yielding specific hypotheses. We single out three such classes: (1) the history of aggression and the fossil record; (2) linguistic proxies (fossils) of the second (proto-grammar) stage in (language) evolution, and their acquisition and processing implications; and (3) Disorders and (verbal) aggression. For each of these classes, we identify some specific hypotheses that are subject to testing and falsification (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The history of aggression and the fossil record.</p>
<list list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item>
<p>First, we predict a gradual decrease in reactive physical aggression, accelerated during especially the second and third stages, but also continuing into the present times. This scenario already seems well supported (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">Cieri et al., 2014</xref> for the claim that features of self-domestication reached a peak at the end of Upper Paleolithic). Still, this is a hypothesis in need of further testing.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Second, we predict an increase in proactive aggression starting in the third stage, and accelerating in the fourth stage, consistent with the considerations of gradual language evolution. There is already some initial evidence for this hypothesis, as collaborative inter-group conflicts became widespread during the Neolithic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref198">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). But further evidence can certainly be sought to better support or falsify this hypothesis. For example, evidence of accelerated proactive aggression in the first or second stages postulated above would falsify our hypothesis and would at least necessitate a reconsideration/revision of the timeline.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Linguistic proxies (fossils) of the second (proto-grammar) stage in human evolution.</p>
<list list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item>
<p>Our first prediction is that the flatter evolutionary proxies will be acquired earlier by children, and with less effort, than their more hierarchical counterparts. As mentioned in Section “Child Development,” some experiments with children already established that what we refer to here as “fossil” compounds are acquired earlier, and with more ease, than their hierarchical counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">Clark et al., 1986</xref>). Such experiments can be replicated with additional language proxies and conducted using additional languages, or even by using artificial grammars.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Similar expectations hold for the processing of human language by adults, where the prediction is that the processing of flatter, fossil structures, such as small clauses and compounds, in contrast to their syntactically more layered counterparts, will rely less on the more recently enhanced brain networks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref148">Progovac et al. (2018a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref149">b)</xref> report some preliminary results of fMRI experiments along these lines that establish clear processing differences between the two types of structures, but more studies are needed to confirm or disconfirm these results, especially cross-linguistic studies, including a variety of languages. This line of research can help determine what kind of brains are needed for the (effortless) processing of early language vs. modern languages and would potentially tie into the considerations of the evolution of the human brain and the human skull, as discussed in section “Introduction.”</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Disorders and (verbal) aggression.</p>
<list list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item>
<p>The anxiolytic (stress and anxiety-relieving) properties of reactive verbal aggression are hypothesized to have contributed to the language emergence/self-domestication feedback loop. While there are proposals in the literature to the effect that tics in TS are anxiolytic (section “Tourette’s Syndrome and Coprophenomena”), this should be subjected to further experimental testing. We further predict that tics accompanied by coprolalia (uncontrollable profanity) will provide better stress relief than those without it.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>We make a similar prediction when it comes to automatisms in aphasia. The production of these automatisms, specifically expletives, seems to be associated with a higher degree of stress, and experiments can be designed to gauge whether such production is anxiolytic.</p>

<p>The truth is that very little is known about swearing and derogatory language, including its processing and genetic basis, whether in typical populations, or in disorders, most probably because this kind of language is often taboo, and typically avoided even in scientific research<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn024"><sup>24</sup></xref>. However, once tapped into, these phenomena, including the neuroscience and genetics of the functions and dysfunctions of swearing/derogatory language, will provide an especially fertile ground for formulating and testing a variety of hypotheses about language evolution and self-domestication, and human evolution more generally.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>These two processes are expected to have incurred in some sort of gradualism (which is not incompatible with occasional punctual sudden changes). In truth, gradual changes have been reported for the globularity of the human skull. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref133">Neubauer et al.’s (2018)</xref> study of endocranial casts, hominin fossils from first anatomically modern humans did not exhibit this type of globularity, in clear contrast to human skulls from more recent periods, which they found to be within the range of modern humans. They also identified an intermediate stage in the evolution of globularity, with the fossils dating somewhere between 130 and 100 kya. Overall, in the first step of this process, approximately 200–130 kya, the frontal area became taller, and the parietal areas and the cerebellum bulged and became larger, while the occipital area became more rounded. The second step, roughly 130–100 kya, involved size changes primarily in the cerebellar and occipital areas. Both steps contributed to the globular shape of the human skull. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref133">Neubauer et al. (2018)</xref> further suggested that the initial changes in the shape of the skull were caused by brain reorganization, rather than changes in the shape of the face, which are typically found in domesticated animals. Moreover, these morphological changes in the evolution of humans were not likely to have been a result of genetic drift, but rather of selection, given that there is evidence for positive selection of several genes expressed in brain development, including the genes responsible for axon and dendrite growth. Something similar occurs with our behavior, including our cultural practices. Based mostly on archeological findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref121">Mellars (2002)</xref> and others initially proposed that there was a major cultural and cognitive transition/revolution around 43–35 kya. However, later discoveries led to a revision of this view, pointing to a more protracted, gradual accretion of culture (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref119">McBrearty and Brooks, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref118">McBrearty, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref122">Mellars, 2007</xref>, p. 3). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref133">Neubauer et al. (2018)</xref> further note that the globularization timeline parallels the emergence of behavioral modernity, culminating around 50–40 kya, suggesting that some of those genes expressed in brain development were selected and fixed. In summary, comparable to the morphology of the skull/brain, behavioral modernity also represents a culmination of gradual accretion over time, rather than a single rapid evolutionary event.</p>

<fn id="fn002">
<p><sup>2</sup>Some differences exist between primate and human inter-group aggression, considering that humans usually form peaceful relationships and alliances among groups (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref192">Wrangham and Glowacki, 2012</xref> for discussion). Socially coordinated violence (proactive aggression) potentially became possible only with the onset of symbolic thought and complex cognition because the same capacities for communication and sociality allow warfare and conflict resolution and avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref91">Kissel and Kim, 2019</xref>). In fact, features of self-domestication reached a peak at the end of Upper Paleolithic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">Cieri et al., 2014</xref>), right before collaborative inter-group conflicts became widespread during the Neolithic, as shown by genetic evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref198">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn003">
<p><sup>3</sup>While it may be true, as pointed out by a reviewer, that derogatory language can be used playfully in an endearing way, this is of course also true of physical aggression, such as hitting. This does not undermine the view that the primary function of both of these phenomena is aggression. As the reviewer also points out, complex language can certainly be used for derogatory purposes, even when seemingly polished and polite. This does not pose a problem for our approach, which associates such complex, pragmatically refined capabilities with the later developments in human evolution, which brought about more complex forms of language, with more sophisticated pragmatic skills, and, arguably, also more sophisticated tools for planning and coordinating proactive aggression.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn004">
<p><sup>4</sup>Sexual selection is also thought to be one important triggering factor of self-domestication features, with females selecting less aggressive males, as discussed in section “Aggression, Verbal Behavior, and Sexual Selection.”</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn005">
<p><sup>5</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref99">Künzl et al. (2003)</xref> found that long-term breeding and rearing of wild guinea pigs in captivity did not result in significant changes in behavior and hormonal stress responses in comparison to domestic guinea pigs. They concluded that it takes much longer periods of time, as well as artificial selection by humans, to bring about characteristics of domestication in wild animals. Human self-domestication did not involve artificial selection by others, and as such is not expected to have been instantaneous. Similar processes of slow self-domestication have also been observed in bonobos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">Hare et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn006">
<p><sup>6</sup>Pending further evidence, this timeline, especially the starting point, has to be considered approximate. As pointed out by a reviewer, researchers have proposed that some forms of language with grammar may have been in place as early as 500 kya, based on the skeletal and genetic evidence from Neanderthals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">Dediu and Levinson, 2013</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref87">Johansson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref200">Zilhão, 2011</xref>).</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn007">
<p><sup>7</sup>However, the picture is a bit more complicated. While there is a clear overall trend toward evolving self-domestication features in humans, including less masculinized traits in men, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">Cieri et al. (2014)</xref> found that Neolithic humans exhibit more masculinized features compared to Upper Paleolithic humans, as well as compared to present-day hunter-gatherers, attributing the effect to the more hierarchical and man-dominated nature of agricultural societies, where women have less opportunity to exert their sexual selection preferences, as compared to relatively egalitarian hunter-gatherer societies (see section “Aggression, Verbal Behavior, and Sexual Selection” for further discussion of these issues within a sexual selection scenario). It is also possible that proactive aggression contributed to this development, as it brings about wars, creating a new environment where stronger, more aggressive males would have been favored by both natural and sexual selection.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn008">
<p><sup>8</sup>According to, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref170">Stringer (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">Finlayson (2009)</xref>, there are still many uncertainties about human timeline and dispersals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref170">Stringer (2007</xref>, p. 17) mentions a possibility for an African version of multiregionalism, citing “growing molecular evidence of deep divisions within African populations” (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref188">Wong, 2017</xref> for some recent findings). Under this scenario, hierarchical syntax could have emerged much earlier, independently among different populations in Africa, more in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">Dediu and Levinson’s (2013)</xref> view.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn009">
<p><sup>9</sup>It is of note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">Chomsky (2005)</xref> has also advocated a rather late emergence of hierarchical syntax, around 50 kya, as pointed out in the text. The difference is that on his approach syntax emerged suddenly in all its complexity, and uniformly, without any precursors, while on our approach syntax evolved gradually, and often differently in different populations, with precursors that interacted with the domestication and other processes involving the evolution of the brain. Also, for Chomsky, the evolution of syntax was fully biological/genetic, while in our view, it involves a complex feedback loop between culture and genes.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn010">
<p><sup>10</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref185">Weekley (1916)</xref> collected a sizeable number of English verb-noun compounds. According to him, this expressive way of naming, often exhibiting unquotable coarseness, flourished in thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, yielding thousands of tokens. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref124">Mihajlović (1992)</xref> collected over 500 Serbian people and place names in this form, reporting that these condensed compositions pack in them “frozen fairy tales, proverbs, and ancient wisdoms and metaphors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref124">Mihajlović 1992</xref>, p. 8,9). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">Darmesteter (1934</xref>, p. 443) was impressed by the “artistic beauty and richness” of such derogatory compounds in French.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn011">
<p><sup>11</sup>Contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref134">Nóbrega and Miyagawa (2015)</xref>’s view, in order for such compounds to count as approximations (“fossils”) of early stages of syntax, they do not necessarily need to be found in every human language, with exactly the same characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref146">Progovac, 2019</xref> offers a detailed defense of syntactic “fossils” in this sense). The claim is that this is the starting point, the bedrock upon which one can build (or not) various types of syntactic complexity, as discussed below. Different languages in fact offer different types of fossil structures in this sense, some of them rare to find across modern languages (as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref144">Progovac, 2015</xref>).</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn012">
<p><sup>12</sup>See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref159">Samarin (1969)</xref> for Gbeya insults, which also fixate on body parts and physical appearance. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref130">Mohr (2013)</xref> provides evidence that such vulgar expressions were completely appropriate to use in, e.g., Roman times, only 2 kya, clearly at the stage of advanced modernity. As she argues, the appropriateness of such language coincided with a much less strict sense of privacy in performing bodily functions, as well as in covering body parts with clothing. Whatever we might think of such language today, it played a much bigger role in ancient times.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn013">
<p><sup>13</sup>For example, while in modern languages, the categories of verbs and nouns are typically distinguished grammatically, this would not have been the case at the time when grammar/language just started emerging.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn014">
<p><sup>14</sup>It is also of note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">Heine and Kuteva (2007)</xref> reconstructed a stage of human language evolution in which only nouns were used, followed by a stage in which both nouns and verbs were used, but no other categories, arguing that other categories gradually gammaticalize from nouns and verbs.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn015">
<p><sup>15</sup>The representation in (6) depicts the basic (partial) hierarchy of sentential structure, widely adopted in this syntactic framework. These are the least controversial layers, sufficient for our purposes, but there are certainly several others that have been postulated (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Adger, 2003</xref>).</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn016">
<p><sup>16</sup>It is of note that in some cases what counts as subject vs. object can get blurred, depending not so much on the noun’s inherent relationship with the verb, but more on whether or not there are additional noun arguments. This is the case with the noun <italic>snake</italic> in the two derivations in the text. This is relevant for the claim that this bottom layer by itself is not capable of distinguishing subjects from objects. The reader should also note that these derivations are simplified by omitting certain steps and null categories (such as null v head), which are not relevant for the discussion.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn017">
<p><sup>17</sup>One possibility would be n-ary (as opposed to binary) grammars, with certain designated slots with fixed ordering for tense, subject, verb, object, without grouping these categories into constituents and subconstituents, and without some of these categories exhibiting syntactic dominance over the others. One can also imagine languages that are not obsessed with who does what to whom. There seems to be nothing inevitable about evolving grammars with binary branching based on predication typically expressed by verbs and nouns.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn018">
<p><sup>18</sup>Such expressions are preserved much better in some languages than others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref144">Progovac, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref145">2016</xref> for discussion and references.) For a more theoretical discussion of the relevance of symmetry vs. asymmetry in human language and evolution, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">Citko (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref144">Progovac (2015)</xref>.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn019">
<p><sup>19</sup>This is in fact where languages differ profoundly. There are several different strategies for discriminating between subjects/agents from objects/patients, including, but not limited to, ergative-absolutive grammars, split-ergative grammars, nominative-accusative grammars, serial verb grammars, and active-stative grammars. These strategies are distinct enough to pose serious challenges for linguistic analysis and description. In this approach, the emergence of transitivity is seen as a later evolutionary development, discovering different solutions to the same problem posed by the limitations of the most rudimentary of grammars.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn020">
<p><sup>20</sup>In this respect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref195">Wynn and Coolidge (2004)</xref> proposed that working memory may have been enhanced in modern humans, compared to Neanderthals, contributing to the capacity for innovation and experimentation. It is also pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref506">Balari et al. (2013)</xref> that enhanced working memory may have enabled recursive syntax. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">Benítez-Burraco and Kempe (2018)</xref> linked the enhancement of working memory to the emergence of languages with expanded vocabularies and more complex syntax, which are purportedly optimized for conveying complex meanings and know-hows to people not sharing a common ground or a common cultural knowledge.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn021">
<p><sup>21</sup>A reviewer points out that the mainstream view of the evolution of language has shifted away from biological evolution to cultural evolution. While it is true that trends in scientific research often bend in this and then that direction, especially with the questions having to do with nature vs. nurture, our proposal is that both biology and culture are directly involved and that the relevant challenge is to identify phenomena that can be shown to be so intertwined. Our paper presents an attempt in this direction, invoking a complex feedback loop between cultural innovations and biological selection. Importantly, our proposal is detailed enough to allow empirical testing. In this respect, we point out that genetic mutations affecting <italic>FOXP2</italic> and other genes increased synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity of the human brain (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref80">Hillert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">Dediu, 2015</xref>), particularly in the frontal-striatal network, likely enabling human capacity for more complex language (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">Boeckx and Benítez-Burraco, 2014b</xref>). The finding that these networks have a biological foundation, supported by multiple genes, suggests that the emergence of complex syntax/language was not only a cultural invention but also a biological/genetic event.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn022">
<p><sup>22</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref507">Gleeson and Kushnick (2018)</xref> provided evidence in favor of sexual selection <italic>via</italic> female preference for less aggressive males, leading to reduced sexual dimorphism, but only in the societies where females have relatively high social status, high enough to be able to choose. Furthermore, this effect is more robust where food resources are more secure. In the case of food scarcity, even when females can exert a choice, the tendency is toward selecting stronger (more aggressive) males.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn023">
<p><sup>23</sup>As discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref147">Progovac and Locke (2009)</xref>, even compositions that seem to describe females (<italic>laj-kučka</italic> “bark-bitch,” loud, and obnoxious person; <italic>plači-pička</italic> “cry-cunt,” vulgar version of <italic>crybaby</italic>) are in fact typically used in reference to males.</p>
</fn>
<fn id="fn024">
<p><sup>24</sup>As pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">Freeman et al. (2009)</xref> and others, the research on coprophenomena (coprolalia and copropraxia) is very limited and leaves large gaps and many unanswered questions. The same is true of the studies of insult, swearing, and profanity more generally (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref130">Mohr, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Bergen, 2016</xref>).</p>
