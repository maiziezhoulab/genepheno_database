<p>This paper reviews progress in the application of computational models to
personality, developmental, and clinical neuroscience. We first describe the
concept of a computational phenotype, a collection of parameters derived from
computational models fit to behavioral and neural data. This approach represents
individuals as points in a continuous parameter space, complementing traditional
trait and symptom measures. One key advantage of this representation is that it
is mechanistic: The parameters have interpretations in terms of cognitive
processes, which can be translated into quantitative predictions about future
behavior and brain activity. We illustrate with several examples how this
approach has led to new scientific insights into individual differences,
developmental trajectories, and psychopathology. We then survey some of the
challenges that lay ahead.</p>

<p>The study of personality has a rich history examining individual differences in how we
behave, relate to ourselves and each other, and understand our experiences and
environment. This work has had the significant challenge of linking multiple levels of
analysis spanning complex neural and cognitive processes. Recently, computational models
have provided a powerful tool to mathematically formalize this complexity, and provide
rich descriptions of the processes underlying human behavior. In the present review, we
discuss the concept and promise of a computational phenotype—a collection of
mathematically derived parameters that precisely describe individual differences in
personality, development, and psychiatric illness.</p>
<p>Traditional approaches to personality are grounded in the study of individuals and how
they differ across a range of psychological characteristics that are indexed via
measures of traits or symptoms. The most widespread example of this is “general
intelligence” (Spearman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref78">1904</xref>).
Individuals higher on general intelligence experience better educational (Deary, Strand,
Smith, &amp; Fernandes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">2007</xref>) and
job-related outcomes (Ree, Earles, &amp; Teachout, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">1994</xref>; Schmidt &amp; Hunter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">2004</xref>). However, this research is largely descriptive; general intelligence is a
composite measure of several underlying cognitive processes including, but not limited
to, working memory (Alloway &amp; Alloway, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">2010</xref>), verbal and spatial ability, reasoning and processing speed (Deary,
Penke, &amp; Johnson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">2010</xref>; Hunt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">2011</xref>; Lubinski, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">2004</xref>). This composition of processes has been examined experimentally, but
rarely formalized mechanistically. A formal mechanistic definition describes how and why
the composition of processes leads to the observable outcome or behavior.</p>
<p>Computational applications to psychiatry have been widely advocated in recent literature
(Adams, Huys, &amp; Roiser, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2015</xref>; Friston,
Stephan, Montague, &amp; Dolan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">2014</xref>; Huys,
Maia, &amp; Frank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">2016</xref>; Huys, Moutoussis,

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">2011</xref>; Montague, Dolan, Friston, &amp;
Dayan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">2012</xref>; Paulus, Huys, &amp; Maia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">2016</xref>; Petzschner, Weber, Gard, &amp; Stephan,

Diaconescu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref79">2015</xref>; Stephan &amp; Mathys,

computational phenotyping has been described in considerable depth using real and
simulated data (Schwartenbeck &amp; Friston, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">2016</xref>; Wiecki, Poland, &amp; Frank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref96">2015</xref>). Yet, computational perspectives in the fields of personality and
development have been relatively limited. Thus, the current review has three goals.
First, we broadly outline how computational phenotypes work, and why individuals differ
in their phenotype. Second, we review recent work that illustrates the benefits of using
computational phenotypes to investigate individual differences. Third, we look forward
to challenges in the practical application of computational phenotypes.</p>
<sec id="sec1" sec-type="general">
<label>1.</label>
<title>Computational phenotypes: How and why</title>
<p>A computational phenotype is a set of parameters, derived from neural and behavioral
data, which characterizes an individual’s cognitive mechanisms. We broadly
schematize the process of deriving individual phenotypes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>. This more explicit mechanistic characterization
complements traditionally descriptive trait and symptom measures in several ways: It
formalizes cognitive processes quantitatively, and reduces dimensionality by
compressing the target process into a parameter or set of parameters. Moreover,
these parameters vary within and between individuals, providing an opportunity to
examine individual differences in computational mechanisms. The parameters are also
sometimes linked to underlying neurobiological mechanisms.<fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(a) Computational phenotyping pipeline. Underlying cognitive or
biological processes give rise to brain or behavioral data. The data are
entered into the computational model, which produces a set of parameters
representing the phenotype. (b) Process represented by computational
phenotype. In this example, the light represents a cue that indicates a
monetary reward. The value of the cue changes on each trial as a
function of the value of the cue on the last trial
(<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>t</italic>-1</sub>), the
learning rate (i.e., computational phenotype; 0.3 in the illustration),
and the prediction error (observed reward—cue
value<sub><italic>t</italic>-1</sub>) (Rescorla &amp; Wagner,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">1972</xref>). (c) Learning rate is
the computational phenotype. It varies between individuals, which is why
the cue value changes at different rates for each person. (d) Learning
rates are estimated using Bayesian analysis, increasing parameter
sensitivity by using posterior distributions that incorporate
uncertainty about the phenotype within and between individuals.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="S2513988618000147_fig1"></graphic></fig></p>
<p>To illustrate how computational models can provide a mechanistic understanding of
behavior, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> shows a case study of
Pavlovian conditioning (Rescorla &amp; Wagner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">1972</xref>; Sutton &amp; Barto, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref82">1998</xref>). In this experimental paradigm, a light signals the receipt of
reward. The Rescorla–Wagner model (Rescorla &amp; Wagner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">1972</xref>) explains how the light comes to acquire
an association with reward (the “cue value,” denoted by V) over the
course of conditioning. The learning equation uses the cue value on the current
trial <italic>t</italic> (<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>) to
calculate the cue value for the next trial
(<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>t</italic>+1</sub>):<disp-formula id="eqnU1"><graphic mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image" orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="S2513988618000147_eqnU1.jpg"></graphic></disp-formula>where <italic>α</italic> is a learning rate
parameter (governing how quickly an individual learns) and the reward prediction
error <italic>δ</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is defined as the cue
value from the last trial subtracted from the observed reward
<italic>r</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>.<disp-formula id="eqnU2"><graphic mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image" orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="S2513988618000147_eqnU2.jpg"></graphic></disp-formula></p>
<p>These equations are formal definitions and serve as mechanistic hypotheses about a
wide range of learning and decision-making processes with intricate ties to
neurobiology. For example, reward prediction error signals have been found in
midbrain dopamine neurons and functional activation in the ventral striatum
(Glimcher, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">2011</xref>; O’Doherty et al.,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">2004</xref>; Pessiglione, Seymour, Flandin,
Dolan, &amp; Frith, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">2006</xref>; Schultz,
Dayan, &amp; Montague, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">1997</xref>). In this
simple model, the computational phenotype typically corresponds to the learning rate
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), which has been linked to
genetic (Frank, Moustafa, Haughey, Curran, &amp; Hutchison, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">2007</xref>) and developmental differences (Christakou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">2013</xref>; van den Bos, Cohen, Kahnt, &amp;
Crone, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref90">2012</xref>) between individuals. The
prediction error signal itself has sometimes been used as a computational phenotype,
distinguishing learners from non-learners (Schönberg, Daw, Joel, &amp;
O’Doherty, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">2007</xref>) and tracking
individual differences in the relationship between fluid intelligence and dopamine
synthesis (Schlagenhauf et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">2013</xref>). We
return to the latter study in depth, within the section on computational phenotyping
in personality.</p>
<p>Another key advantage of computational phenotypes, such as learning rate, is
dimensionality reduction. Describing a behavioral phenotype without a computational
model requires a collection of parameters (e.g., accuracy, reaction time, choice
preference) that roughly approximate the process of interest. Computational model
parameters compress this information into a single parameter (e.g., learning rate)
or set of parameters that specify how cognitive mechanisms produce behavior and
neural activity.</p>
<p>In sum, computational phenotypes define how the cognitive process works
mechanistically and provides rich descriptions about why individual variation in
phenotypes (e.g., learning rate) produces different behavioral outcomes and neural
activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2" sec-type="general">
<label>2.</label>
<title>Model selection and parameter estimation</title>
<p>Any study of computational phenotypes faces two methodological questions: How to
select the appropriate model, and how to estimate the parameters of that model. Here
we will briefly review the main approaches to these questions.</p>
<p>Models are typically evaluated in one of two ways. Goodness-of-fit criteria, such as
the likelihood ratio test, the Bayesian information criterion, and the Akaike
information criterion, evaluate how well the model fits the data, while penalizing
for model complexity. Bayesian model selection criteria are similarly motivated, but
place a full distribution over models. Each of these criteria is grounded in
different theoretical foundations, so it is often useful to calculate multiple
criteria. Predictive criteria evaluate how well a model predicts held-out data. For
example, cross-validation uses a model fit to one subset of the data to predict
another subset of the data.</p>
<p>Parameter estimation methods fall into one of two categories. Point estimation
methods are based on fitting a single set of parameters for each individual.
Bayesian methods are based on estimating a posterior distribution over parameters,
which allows the researcher to quantify parameter uncertainty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Hierarchical Bayesian models (see Gelman et al.,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">2013</xref>; Wiecki, Poland, &amp; Frank,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref96">2015</xref>) take this one step further,
estimating distributions over both group-level and individual-level parameter
estimates. Researchers can also incorporate prior beliefs about parameter estimates
from other data sets, thereby increasing parameter reliability, identifiability,
predictive validity, and sensitivity to individual differences (Gershman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">2016</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec3" sec-type="general">
<label>3.</label>
<title>Computational phenotyping: Personality, development, and psychiatric
illness</title>
<p>Next, we will illustrate the value of computational phenotypes from several different
perspectives. Given the scientific breadth of this review, for each perspective we
will focus on specific case studies rather than providing exhaustive coverage of the
literature. We will show how this approach can reveal new insights into individual
differences in personality and examine how the computational phenotype changes over
the course of development and aging. Finally, we will show how differences between
healthy and disordered brain function can be mapped onto systematic changes in the
computational phenotype.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4" sec-type="general">
<label>4.</label>
<title>The computational structure of personality</title>
<p>Traditional approaches to the study of personality, such as factor analysis, have
been particularly effective in reducing the high-dimensional space of personality to
latent constructs such as the Big Five (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion,
agreeableness, neuroticism) (Tupes &amp; Christal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref85">1992</xref>). These personality dimensions are largely stable across
the lifetime and predict a number of individual differences (e.g., religiosity,
dating frequency, and alcohol use among many others; Paunonen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">2003</xref>). Despite this predictive validity, traditional
personality constructs are largely agnostic as to the cognitive mechanisms by which
differences in personality lead to differences in behavior.</p>
<p>For example, conscientiousness is associated with a wide range of adaptive behaviors
and outcomes such as greater health and longevity (Bogg &amp; Roberts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">2013</xref>), and increased reliability and
goal-directed behavior (Jackson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">2010</xref>). Indeed, how people differ in conscientiousness has been well
documented, but it is still relatively unclear as to why people differ in
conscientiousness (Abram &amp; DeYoung, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">2017</xref>). In part, this is due to the fact that conscientiousness is
comprised of a heterogenous composition of underlying processes. Disentangling these
processes is a task for which computational phenotyping can be uniquely useful. The
specific processes can be operationalized, such as why people higher in
conscientious seek more goal-directed behavior. Identifying the computational
phenotypes associated with these personality constructs offers the opportunity to
link the predictive validity of the construct to its underlying mechanisms. In this
section, we examine a set of examples that illustrate what computational models have
to offer as a complement to these traditional constructs.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1" sec-type="general">
<label>4.1.</label>
<title>Personality: Goals and habits</title>
<p>Computational modeling has had an enormous impact on our understanding of
decision-making. Here we focus on one particular aspect of this research area:
The distinction between two forms of action selection, one based on goals and
one based on habits. Initial studies theorized that goal-directed behavior (as
studied in rats) was subserved by a “cognitive map” of the
environment that supported flexible pursuit of goals (Tolman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref84">1948</xref>). Tolman hypothesized the use of
latent learning and planning processes that went far beyond the
stimulus–response habits posited by the behaviorists (Thorndike, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref83">1911</xref>). Despite the intuitive link to our
everyday experience, researchers had only glimpses into the underlying
processes. It took more than 50 years to integrate advances in engineering
(Bellman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">1957</xref>), computer science
(Sutton &amp; Barto, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref82">1998</xref>),
neuroscience (Schultz, Dayan, &amp; Montague, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">1997</xref>), and psychology (Daw, Gershman, Seymour, Dayan,
&amp; Dolan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">2011</xref>; Dickinson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">1985</xref>) into a synthetic theoretical
framework for understanding how the human brain carries out goal-directed and
habitual action. This modern computational synthesis conceptualizes
goal-directed action arises from using an internal model
(“model-based” control) of potential actions and their
consequences in the environment, whereas habits arise from a trial-and-error
learning system that does not exploit an internal model
(“model-free” control).</p>
<p>By constructing explicit computational models of these two systems and their
interplay, researchers have been able to capture individual differences in the
degree of reliance on model-based vs. model-free control using a single
parameter estimated from a canonical task (Daw et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">2011</xref>). This line of work has led to the study of how
stress (Otto, Raio, Chiang, Phelps, &amp; Daw, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">2013</xref>), age (Decker, Otto, Daw, &amp; Hartley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">2016</xref>; Eppinger, Walter, Heekeren,
&amp; Li, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">2013</xref>), and psychiatric
illness (Gillan, Kosinski, Whelan, Phelps, &amp; Daw, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">2016</xref>; Sebold et al., 2014, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">2017</xref>; Voon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref93">2015</xref>) affect, or fail to affect (Nebe et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">2018</xref>), the delicate balance between model-based and
model-free control.</p>
<p>Individual variation in model-based control was recently captured by Otto et al.
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">2013</xref>) when they examined how
model-based control is affected by individual differences in stress response.
Participants submerged their arms in ice-cold water (a commonly used acute
stress manipulation) and their cortisol levels were measured. Subsequently, they
completed a two-step sequential decision task (Daw et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">2011</xref>), that we will refer to as the “two-step
task.” Computational parameters fit to this task characterize several
aspects of learning and decision-making, including the relative contribution of
model-free and model-based control for each individual. Otto et al. found that
participants with higher cortisol levels (greater stress response) exhibited
less model-based control. In turn, this effect was modulated by working memory
capacity such that greater working memory attenuated stress-induced reductions
in model-based control. The key insight from this study is that the precise
characterization of how stress and working memory affect individual variation in
the computational phenotype (i.e., model-based control), thereby shifting the
balance between goal-directed and habitual action. Future work could seek to
understand how model-based control does, or does not, covary with
conscientiousness and stress.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-2" sec-type="general">
<label>4.2.</label>
<title>Personality: Social cognition</title>
<p>Personality measures such as extraversion and agreeableness are composed of
questions about social interaction, including how we relate to ourselves and
others. Computational phenotyping increases our understanding of social
interaction by specifying the mechanisms underlying social cognition. For
example, computational models of social cognition include parameters
representing how quickly we change our view of others, beliefs about the
motivations driving their behavior, and a host of other features of social
interaction. A recent study (Diaconescu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">2014</xref>) provides a nice example of computational
phenotyping of social cognition in an economic decision-making game.</p>
<p>Diaconescu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">2014</xref>) used a paradigm
where participants were asked to predict the outcome of a lottery. Each
participant was paired with an advisor who provided information to aid in the
participant’s lottery prediction. Importantly, the advisor was
incentivized to provide misleading or helpful information, and this varied over
time. The critical question for the participant was whether or not to trust the
advice of the advisor. Two key parameters from the computational model were (1)
a parameter representing the perceived volatility of the advisor’s
intentions (i.e., how quickly the advice shifted between misleading or helpful),
and (2) a parameter representing the perceived advice correctness. When the
perceived volatility of the advisor’s intentions was high, players
weighted their advice lower. Strikingly, players with higher self-reported
perspective-taking proficiency had more stable representations of their advisor.
This was indicated by slower changes in their belief about advice correctness.
Thus, a personality trait (perspective-taking proficiency) directly corresponded
to a parameter representing the participant’s estimate of another
person’s trustworthiness. In this example, we have a computational
phenotype with parameters for each individual describing <italic>how</italic>
and <italic>why</italic> they ultimately decide to take the advice of another
person. This computational approach was subsequently extended to the
relationship between social cognition and a personality questionnaire measuring
autism traits in a healthy population (Sevgi, Diaconescu, Tittgemeyer, &amp;
Schilbach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Autism is characterized by impairment in social communication and social
interaction leading to great difficulty maintaining interpersonal relationships.
Moreover, autism traits are continuously distributed in the general population
(Robinson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">2011</xref>).To investigate
the processes that underlie these traits, Sevgi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">2016</xref>) employed a computational approach in a social
decision-making task while measuring a score on the autism spectrum in a healthy
population. They used a game in which using social cue information (indicated by
the directional “gaze” of a human avatar) resulted in higher task
performance. A computational parameter that represented the weighting of this
information in subsequent decisions was correlated with autism score such that
higher autism traits were associated with less reliance on social information
during decision-making. Moreover, the study showed that individuals high on the
autism spectrum showed particular difficulty integrating social advice under
more volatile task conditions. Thus, a computational phenotype characterizing a
social decision-making process provides a specific mechanism whereby elevations
in autism traits are associated with a decreased ability to effectively learn
from social information. Next, we turn to the use of computational phenotyping
to identify mechanisms underlying individual differences in how people process
threatening situations. This is particularly relevant to the construct
neuroticism, whereby people higher in this trait experience greater levels of
anxiety and worry.</p>

<title>Personality: The spontaneous recovery of fear</title>
<p>A core feature of adaptive behavior is the ability to update our beliefs about
threatening situations once they no longer pose a threat. However, some
individuals continue to feel fear in apparently safe situations, whereas others
seem to learn that a situation no longer poses a threat. In accordance with this
idea, a recent paper by Gershman and Hartley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">2015</xref>) demonstrated how a computational phenotype helps explain
<italic>why</italic> some people seem to have persistent fears, while others
do not.</p>
<p>Gershman and Hartley measured skin conductance response during Pavlovian
conditioning. The experiment consisted of three phases: (1) acquisition of the
initial fear association by pairing cues with shock, (2) extinction of the fear
association by presenting the cues repeatedly without shock, and (3) testing of
fear response one day later. Spontaneous recovery of fear was measured as the
difference between skin conductance response on the first block of test relative
to the last block of extinction (i.e., how much did an individual’s fear
response to the cue re-emerge, despite having extinguished this fear response on
the previous day). Gershman and Hartley fit a computational model of learning to
the acquisition and extinction skin conductance data. This model posited that
participants make inferences about the “latent causes” underlying
the cue-shock pairs. When the contingencies change sufficiently, the
participants should infer that a new latent cause is active. A single parameter
controls the sensitivity of latent cause inferences to contingency change. For
small values of this parameter, the acquisition and extinction phases are
clustered together into a single cause, producing unlearning of the acquired
fear and hence no possibility of recovery at test. For large values of this
parameter, the acquisition and extinction phases are separated into separate
latent causes, thereby protecting the acquired fear from extinction, thus making
spontaneous recovery possible.</p>
<p>Using the computational model, Gershman and Hartley clustered participants into
two groups on the basis of the sensitivity parameter. As predicted, participants
with small sensitivity values apparently unlearned the fear association, showing
no evidence of spontaneous recovery. In contrast, participants with larger
sensitivity values inferred separate acquisition and extinction latent causes,
and accordingly showed spontaneous recovery. Thus, this study demonstrated how a
computational phenotyping approach can explain <italic>why</italic> some
individuals may continue to feel threatened in environments that no longer pose
a threat.</p>

<title>Personality: The mechanisms of fluid intelligence</title>
<p>As noted above, intelligence is comprised of a complex set of underlying
processes. A recent study by Schlagenhauf et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">2013</xref>) validated complex attention and reasoning as a
subprocess of general intelligence using computational modeling. Participants
completed a reversal learning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) and this was followed by a positron emission tomography (PET) scan used
to measure dopamine synthesis capacity. It was found that reward prediction
errors in the ventral striatum positively correlated with IQ, and this was
specific to the complex attention and reasoning portion of the general
intelligence assessment. Moreover, the ventral striatal reward prediction error
signal was inversely correlated with dopamine synthesis. Together these findings
suggest that a component of the computational phenotype (reward prediction
errors) are a promising target for understanding individual differences in fluid
intelligence.</p>

<title>The computational phenotype across development and aging</title>
<p>Development across the lifespan is associated with profound behavioral and
psychological changes. For example, adolescence is characterized by hypersensitivity
to social context, vulnerability to emotional arousal, increased impulsivity, and a
propensity toward drug and alcohol abuse. Adolescence is also accompanied by
neurodevelopmental changes in brain structure (Giedd et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">1999</xref>) and function (Casey, Getz, &amp; Galvan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">2008</xref>). The challenge is linking brain and
behavior to specific cognitive processes that are tuned differently across
developmental stages. Understanding the normative trajectory of these processes can
help us to identify atypical developmental trajectories. Moreover, individual
differences in these processes arise through a developmental process. Computational
phenotypes allow us to better understand and disentangle the factors that influence
individual trajectories.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1" sec-type="general">
<label>5.1.</label>
<title>Development: Model-based control across the lifespan</title>
<p>One particularly important phenotype is the expression of model-based
control—the critical ability to evaluate the consequences of our actions.
The capacity to prospectively plan actions according to their consequences is
starkly contrasted in childhood and adulthood. Requiring significant cognitive
resources, model-based control relies on prefrontal structures (Doll, Duncan,
Simon, Shohamy, &amp; Daw, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">2015</xref>;
Smittenaar, FitzGerald, Romei, Wright, &amp; Dolan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">2013</xref>) known to change dramatically across development
(Gogtay et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">2004</xref>). Indeed, there is
a shift across development from reliance on impulses to deliberative
goal-directed planning (Hartley &amp; Somerville, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">2015</xref>). This behavioral shift mirrors a neurodevelopmental
trajectory whereby prefrontal structures engaged during goal-directed evaluation
exhibit a gradual process of integration with subcortical brain structures that
can support more automatic behavior (Gogtay et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">2004</xref>). The computational phenotype of model-based control
is one way to link changes in brain function and structure to behavioral changes
in goal-directed action across development.</p>
<p>Building upon this idea, Decker et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">2016</xref>) administered the same two-step task discussed above, using a
computational model to estimate the relative balance of model-free and
model-based control in a developmental sample. They found a near total absence
of model-based control in children ages 8–12. Model-based control emerged
during adolescence (ages 13–17) and further strengthened during adulthood
(ages 18–25). Extending this work, a subsequent study found that
age-related increases in model-based control were mediated by increases in fluid
reasoning—the ability to integrate distant concepts to solve problems
(Potter, Bryce, &amp; Hartley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">2017</xref>). The developmental relevance of these findings is bolstered by
evidence that model-based control has been linked to variation in dopamine
function (Deserno et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">2015</xref>; Doll,
Bath, Daw, &amp; Frank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">2016</xref>; Sharp,
Foerde, Daw, &amp; Shohamy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref76">2015</xref>;
Wunderlich, Smittenaar, &amp; Dolan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref98">2012</xref>) and prefrontal cortex function (Daw et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">2011</xref>; Doll et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">2015</xref>; Smittenaar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">2013</xref>), both of which are known to change across
development (Hartley &amp; Somerville, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">2015</xref>). Interestingly, while Decker et al. found an increase in
model-based control from childhood into adulthood, a recent study found that
model-based control subsequently decreases in older adults.</p>
<p>Eppinger et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">2013</xref>) examined the
relationship between model-based control, age, and working memory in a sample of
younger adults (mean age 24) and older adults (mean age 69). Older adults showed
less model-based control than younger adults and this effect was further
pronounced by shifting the reward probabilities. They demonstrated that older
adults have specific difficulties changing their “cognitive map”
of the environment in response to unexpected rewards, whereas younger adults
changed their decision strategy and explored the new environment. Like Otto et
al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">2013</xref>), they found that greater
working memory was associated with greater model-based control, but only in
younger adults. Moreover, following unexpected rewards younger adults engaged in
more strategic exploration of the task structure and older adults tended to
perseverate on the previously exploited option. The authors suggest this may be
due to a deficit updating expected reward values in older adults. By using a
computational phenotype and relating it to other age-dependent processes, the
authors demonstrate how phenotypes can be used to examine age-related changes in
goal-directed and habitual behavior.</p>
<p>Together, these studies demonstrate how a computational phenotype can be used to
trace an arc of cognitive changes across development and through senescence.</p>

<title>Development: Counterfactual deficits in adolescence</title>
<p>A core feature of adolescence is difficulty simulating the hypothetical outcomes
of decisions. In cognitive science, the consideration of these alternative
outcomes is referred to as counterfactual thinking. A recent demonstration of
counterfactual deficits in adolescence was accomplished via Bayesian model
selection. Palminteri, Kilford, Coricelli, and Blakemore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">2016</xref>) administered an instrumental learning task and
applied three separate computational models. While adolescents were best
characterized by a simple reinforcement learning model based upon the
Rescorla–Wagner learning rule detailed above, adults were best fit by two
more sophisticated models. The first was a counterfactual learning model in
which adults incorporated task feedback about unchosen options, and the second
was a value contextualization model that allowed adults to learn equally from
positive and negative rewards. In contrast to symmetrical reward and punishment
learning in adults, adolescents were less likely to learn from punishment.
Therefore, this study identifies three separate computational phenotypes that
account for developmental changes in learning and specific process components
(e.g., counterfactual learning and punishment sensitivity) that underlie these
differences.</p>

<title>Debugging the brain</title>
<p>Computational modeling provides the advantages in overcoming problems of
heterogeneity, comorbidity, and non-specificity in psychiatric nosology (Petzschner
et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">2017</xref>; Stephan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref79">2015</xref>; Wiecki, Poland, &amp; Frank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref96">2015</xref>), providing mechanistic links (i.e.,
computational phenotypes) between translational neuroscience and applied practice
(Friston et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">2014</xref>; Huys, Maia, &amp;
Frank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">2016</xref>; Maia &amp; Frank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">2017</xref>; Paulus, Huys, &amp; Maia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">2016</xref>), and even producing single-patient
clinical predictions (Stephan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref81">2017</xref>). To expand, pathological behavior can be linked to brain disruptions
through computational models of distortions in the latent cognitive or biological
process. Moreover, specific parameters represent individual components of the
process, providing targets for intervention. Computational models also hold promise
for linking various types of measurement (e.g., behavior, self-report, brain
function) at several levels of analysis. In this section we turn back to model-based
control, and examine how this phenotype shows specific relationships with different
aspects of psychopathology. We then review work that combines phenotyping with
machine learning to aid in the study of schizophrenia, and follow that with an
illustration of using Bayesian model comparison to identify two separate
neurobiological mechanisms for the phenomenon of synesthesia.</p>

<label>6.1.</label>
<title>Psychopathology: Model-based control</title>
<p>A core feature of psychiatric illness is over-reliance on habits at the cost of
goal-directed action (Everitt &amp; Robbins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">2005</xref>). For example, individuals will often continue a
pattern of compulsive drug use despite a stated desire to abstain. The goal of
abstinence requires actions that are commensurate with accurate prospective
simulations of the severe consequences of relapse. Due to this phenomenological
similarity with the prospective simulation aspect of model-based control (Doll
et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">2015</xref>), several studies have
investigated the balance between model-free and model-based control in
psychiatric illness. Model-based impairment has been found in schizophrenia
(Culbreth, Westbrook, Daw, Botvinick, &amp; Barch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">2016</xref>), obsessive-compulsive disorder, methamphetamine
dependence, and binge eating disorder (Voon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref93">2015</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the association between model-based control and problematic alcohol use
has been somewhat equivocal and concurrently illuminating. Across the subsequent
studies the computational phenotype (balance between model-based and model-free
behavior) remains formally consistent, yet the phenotype relates to categorical
and trait characteristics of problematic alcohol use differentially. This
suggests traditional category-based descriptions of heterogeneous phenomena such
as addiction may be further specified with computational phenotypes.</p>
<p>In computational investigations of alcohol use problems some studies have found
reduced model-based control in detoxified patients (Sebold et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">2014</xref>) whereas others have not (Sebold et
al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">2017</xref>; Voon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref93">2015</xref>). Despite no reductions of
model-based control, Sebold et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">2017</xref>) found that reduced medial-prefrontal signatures during
model-based decision-making predicted relapse in detoxified alcohol-dependent
patients. In addition, positive views about the reinforcing effects of alcohol
were associated with reduced model-based control in patients who subsequently
relapsed (Sebold et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">2017</xref>). Yet,
other research has found that model-based control is <italic>not</italic>
associated with a range of problematic alcohol use, including binge drinking,
onset age for alcohol use, and alcohol consumption (Nebe et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">2018</xref>). Together these studies suggest
that model-based impairments may have a more nuanced relationship with alcohol
use that traditional methods are not well designed to capture.</p>
<p>Indeed, contemporary views of addiction (Everitt &amp; Robbins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">2005</xref>; Kurth-Nelson &amp; Redish, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">2012</xref>) suggest that individuals will
engage in complex reasoning and goal-directed activity to satisfy a craving.
This shifts the view of addiction as simply habitual behavior to a process-based
account of drug taking and seeking. Meanwhile, the traditional notion of
“addiction as habit” relies on a phenomenological observation that
compulsive drug seeking is habitual. This leaves out mechanistic accounts of
what drives addictive behavior. Fortunately, a large volume of preclinical and
human studies suggest that addiction is comprised of multifactorial disruptions
(e.g., cognitive, pharmacological, neural) in the learning process (see this
book chapter for theoretical integration of this research; Huys, Beck, Dayan,
&amp; Heinz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">2014</xref>). Challenges in
specifying the mechanisms underlying pathological phenomena can also be
partially remedied via dimensional approaches to psychiatric illness.</p>
<p>A large online study by Gillan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">2016</xref>) used a transdiagnostic approach to studying model-based
control in psychopathology. They applied factor analysis to symptom dimensions
comprising mood problems, habitual behaviors, and social functioning. They found
that model-based control was reduced in a factor termed “compulsive
behavior and intrusive thought” but was unaffected by anxious depression
and slightly improved by social withdrawal. Thus, model-based impairments may be
specific to symptoms and traits that cluster together.</p>
<p>While relatively few studies have examined model-based control in
psychopathology, computational phenotypes provide a common mathematical
foundation for understanding goal-directed deficits. The aforementioned
categorical studies ostensibly examined the same process, however, they may
suffer from nosological problems associated with diagnostic classification and
description (Cuthbert &amp; Insel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">2013</xref>; Insel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">2010</xref>).
Gillan et al. illustrate how we can more accurately conceptualize
psychopathological phenomena by shared deficits in a certain process represented
by a computational phenotype. Clinicians and researchers alike have observed the
transdiagnostic nature of psychopathology, but we have been restricted by lack
of formalization of the process and dysfunction within the process. In this
regard, computational phenotypes may help shift diagnosis toward a
process-oriented understanding of mental illness whereby deficits in the
cognitive process are linked to brain disruptions and behavioral
impairments.</p>

<title>Psychopathology: Generative embedding in schizophrenia</title>
<p>We have largely focused on mechanistic models that describe how the behavioral or
neural data were generated (so-called generative models). These generative
models can also be combined with machine learning techniques (e.g., Brodersen et
al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">2011</xref>). We illustrate this idea with
a study that uses machine learning to define psychiatric subgroups in
schizophrenia (Brodersen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">2014</xref>).
In contrast to generative models, machine learning approaches are agnostic to
mechanism and use the data only to classify subjects as patient or non-patient.
However, there is a fundamental problem with this approach. It requires the use
of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International
Classification of Diseases diagnostic labels. Specifically, the researcher
labels training data as patient or control and this is the input for the machine
learning algorithm. Using these labels, the machine learning algorithm trains
itself to classify the data into patient or control. This approach reifies
pre-existing theories about categorical diagnoses. Alternatively, Brodersen et
al. embed a generative model (rather than labels) of the process giving rise to
neural data as the input into a machine learning classifier.</p>
<p>Brodersen et al. administered an n-back working memory task to a group of
patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and healthy controls while they were
being scanned with fMRI. They created a generative causal model of the
underlying neuronal dynamics (dynamic causal model [DCM]) that
gave rise to the fMRI data. The DCM described the network dynamics between the
visual cortex, parietal cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
Subject-level parameters were derived describing the specific neuronal dynamics
for each person and these were subsequently entered into a machine learning
algorithm that classified subjects into the schizophrenia or control group.
Without any clinical information, the classifier was able to sort the subjects
with 78% accuracy. Moreover, within the patient group, the classifier
identified three different groups of neural network dynamics. Again, without
access to any diagnostic information, the three classifier groups corresponded
to three clinical subgroups as shown by significant differences in negative
symptoms. This study is a powerful demonstration of linking a neurocognitive
model of working memory to ecologically valid clinical diagnoses via completely
data-driven approaches.</p>

<title>Psychopathology: Grapheme-color synthesia</title>
<p>Grapheme-color synthesthesia is a perceptual disturbance whereby letters
and/or numerals are associated with an experience of color. For example,
a person may see a black “4” and perceive the color yellow.
Interestingly, there are two broad phenomena that characterize the experience of
grapheme-color synthesthetes. Projector synthesthetes perceive the color
externally such that the number (e.g., 4) appears in the color yellow.
Alternatively, associator synthesthetes experience a strong internal association
of the color. In a recent study, van Leeuwen, den Ouden, and Hagoort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref91">2011</xref>) demonstrate the advantage of using
computational phenotypes to identify separable neuronal mechanisms that account
for these two types of grapheme-color synthesthesia.</p>
<p>van Leeuwen et al. administered a synesthesia-inducing paradigm to a group of
known synesthetes during fMRI. They used a DCM to test two competing hypotheses
about visual processing abnormalities that could account for projectors vs.
associators. They found that neural activity in projectors more closely matched
(via Bayesian model comparison) a bottom-up processing stream within the
fusiform gyrus, whereas associators’ neural activity matched a top-down
processing stream in the parietal lobe. Therefore, Bayesian model comparison was
able to validate that projectors and associators have dissociable computational
phenotypes.</p>

<label>7.</label>
<title>Challenges ahead</title>
<p>Computational modeling is a field that holds promise for grounding individual
differences in underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms. However, there are
several challenges facing the practical use of computational phenotypes.</p>
<p>One challenge concerns specifying the mechanisms underlying the computational
phenotype. For example, model-based control is based upon a number of interrelated
cognitive mechanisms including working memory (see Voon, Reiter, Sebold, &amp;
Groman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref94">2017</xref>, for a recent review).
Therefore, impairments in working memory will correlate with impairments in
model-based control (Culbreth et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">2016</xref>)
and it will be difficult to tease competing mechanisms apart. One possible solution
is administering multiple tasks within the same subject and developing models that
capture the overlapping sets of mechanisms across these tasks. These models would
derive, for example, parameters that concurrently consider working memory demands
and sequential decision making to dissociate the relative contributions of various
underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>A second, related challenge is construct validity. While personality psychology has
exerted considerable effort in establishing the validity and robustness of its
constructs, computational phenotyping has not yet undertaken such a systematic
effort. This is particularly important for several reasons. First, it is well known
that parameters in computational models are not always identifiable (Gershman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">2016</xref>). This means that parameter values can
trade-off against one another to produce similar predictions, thereby making it much
more difficult to draw conclusions about the mechanism underlying patterns of
behavior. This can be partially remedied by parameterizing models in such a way that
they do not suffer from identifiability issues, or using data-driven constraints on
parameter estimates (Gershman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Reliable parameter estimates also require tasks with many trials. This is
particularly problematic for patients studies where heterogeneity in the underlying
mechanisms and deficits can produce high variance data. One possible solution is to
use hierarchical Bayesian modeling to increase sensitivity to individual differences
(Nilsson, Rieskamp, &amp; Wagenmakers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">2011</xref>; Wiecki, Poland, &amp; Frank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref96">2015</xref>; Wiecki, Sofer, &amp; Frank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref97">2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Adding to this complexity, it is also unclear how, why, or if, the processes
represented by the parameters change over time. This is also important for
developmental research, as cross-sectional age differences in a given parameter are
assumed to mean that the parameter values within-individual exhibit similar
age-related changes over developmental time. However, we do not typically know the
test–retest reliability of computational phenotypes because models are rarely
fit to multiple data sets from the same subject. This means we have no handle on the
contribution of state dynamics to trait measures. This issue can be easily remedied
simply by collecting more data; even better, we can measure (or experimentally
control) the dynamics of other variables, and thus begin to model state-dependent
aspects of computational phenotypes (see Kool, Gershman, &amp; Cushman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">2017</xref>, for an example). Test–retest
reliability will be especially important for establishing the utility of phenotypes
in predicting clinical outcomes and treatment development (Stephan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref81">2017</xref>) as we move from translational
neuroscience to clinical application (Gold et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">2012</xref>; Paulus, Huys, &amp; Maia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Another challenge concerns the integration of behavioral and neural data.
Computational models are typically fit to behavioral data and then the fitted
parameters and latent variables are used in the analysis of neural data. However,
recent work has shown how simultaneously modeling neural data (e.g.,
electroencephalography or fMRI; Cassey, Gaut, Steyvers, &amp; Brown, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">2016</xref>; Turner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref86">2013</xref>; Turner, Rodriguez, Norcia, McClure, &amp; Steyvers,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref87">2016</xref>; Turner, Van Maanen, &amp;
Forstmann, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref88">2015</xref>; Turner, Wang, &amp;
Merkle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref89">2017</xref>), or self-report measures
(Vandekerckhove, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref92">2014</xref>) with behavioral data
can lead to greater predictive accuracy and integration of latent cognitive
abilities with personality constructs. Other approaches, such as behavioral dynamic
causal modeling (bDCM) translate experimental stimuli into neural connections, which
in turn, gives rise to behavioral outcomes (Rigoux &amp; Daunizeau, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">2015</xref>). Effectively, the computational
phenotypes represented by bDCMs are neural networks that operate as
neurocomputational mechanisms between environmental inputs and behavioral outputs.
Neural models of specific brain regions (e.g., the basal ganglia; Frank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">2005</xref>) can also link cellular and systems
neuroscience to inform decisions about experimental acquisition of behavioral and
brain data. This approach provides biologically plausible mechanisms that account
for the neural computations that give rise to behavior (Forstmann &amp;
Wagenmakers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">2015</xref>). However, application of
these models by non-experts poses significant challenges because of the mathematical
and programmatic skills required.</p>
<p>Accessible software development is critical for adoption of models by
non-computational psychologists and neuroscientists. To date, there are relatively
limited software tools available (though, see Wiecki, Sofer, &amp; Frank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref97">2013</xref>), and those that exist can be difficult
for non-experts to use. This problem will be gradually remedied as funding bodies
and journals place more stringent requirements on software accessibility. In fact,
efforts such as the annual computational psychiatry course already provide open
source software for reinforcement learning models, hierarchical Gaussian filters,
and drift diffusion models.</p>
<p>Computational models also require mathematical skills that are not easily applied, or
understood. Indeed, the application of these models to questions in personality,
development, and psychiatry has typically required the integration of skills from
multiple researchers with different backgrounds (e.g., personality psychologists and
computational neuroscientists). Conferences (e.g., the annual Computational
Psychiatry course in London), graduate courses, and potentially graduate degree
tracks, could aid in filling these technical and conceptual gaps. In addition,
simple steps such as attempts to bridge the language of complementary fields will
also be important. For example, the article by Brodersen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">2014</xref>) explicitly describes generative
embedding methods in a tutorial aimed at researchers with a clinical background.</p>
<p>Finally, we need more systematic evaluations of the assumptions linking computational
phenotypes to behavioral and neural data. Often, researchers run a correlation or
regression, looking for simple associations without grappling with the possibility
that computational phenotypes could be related to observed data in more complex
ways. Clinical psychometricians have extensively studied a range of probabilistic
models for understanding how different symptoms and traits are related, ranging from
factor analysis to undirected networks (Borsboom, Mellenbergh, &amp; van Heerden,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">2004</xref>; Borsboom et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">2016</xref>). These same kinds of techniques could be
applied to analyzing computational phenotypes. However, the importance of these
phenotypes depends upon their predictive validity. This is where longitudinal
translational research efforts (Paulus, Huys, &amp; Maia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">2016</xref>), such as those currently underway in the study of
schizophrenia (Gold, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">2012</xref>; Gold et al.,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">2012</xref>), can validate the ecological and
clinical utility of computational models.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, we are optimistic that computational phenotypes have
already begun to bear fruit for personality neuroscience and related fields. We
envision a future in which they will be applied to precision medicine approaches
(Cuthbert &amp; Insel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">2013</xref>; Fernandes
et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">2017</xref>; Friston, Redish, &amp;
Gordon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">2017</xref>), where particular latent
processes can be targeted for intervention, and optimized for individual people.
Similar interventions could be conceived for the purposes of individualized
education and the design of incentive mechanisms for improving financial decision
making.</p>
