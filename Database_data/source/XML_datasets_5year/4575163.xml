<abstract>
<p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) catalyzes a committed and rate-limiting step in hepatic gluconeogenesis, and its activity is tightly regulated to maintain blood glucose levels within normal limits. PEPCK activity is primarily regulated through hormonal control of gene transcription. Transcription is additionally regulated via a cAMP response unit, which includes a cAMP response element and four binding sites for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP). Notably, the cAMP response unit also contains a putative response element for retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor α (RORα). In this paper, we characterize the effect of the RORα response element on cAMP-induced transcription. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay indicates that RORα binds this response element in a sequence-specific manner. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assays indicate that RORα interacts with C/EBP at the PEPCK promoter to synergistically enhance transcription. We also found that cAMP-induced transcription depends in part on RORα and its response element. In addition, we show that suppression of RORα by siRNA significantly decreased PEPCK transcription. Finally, we found that a RORα antagonist inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis in an <italic>in vitro</italic> glucose production assay. Taken together, the data strongly suggest that PEPCK is a direct RORα target. These results define possible new roles for RORα in hepatic gluconeogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) catalyzes a committed and rate-limiting step in hepatic gluconeogenesis, and its activity is tightly regulated to maintain normal blood glucose levels. PEPCK activity is primarily modulated through hormonal control of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref003">3</xref>]. The PEPCK promoter contains several <italic>cis</italic>-elements that functionally cooperate to respond to the thyroid hormone, glucocorticoids, and cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref004">4</xref>]. The glucocorticoid response unit consists of elements between -467 and -300, which include two tandem binding sites for the glucocorticoid receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref005">5</xref>]. On the other hand, the cAMP response unit consists of four binding sites for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), and a canonical cAMP response element that recruits both CREB and C/EBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>C/EBP mediates the sensitivity of the PEPCK promoter to cAMP. Indeed, knockout of C/EBPβ decreases gluconeogenesis and circulating lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref010">10</xref>]. Notably, a putative response element for retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor alpha (RORα) is found four bases downstream of a C/EBP site. This response element has a strongly conserved consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>RORα regulates target gene expression mainly by binding as monomers to promoter response elements, which typically consist of a consensus AGGTCA half-site preceded by an A/T-rich sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref011">11</xref>]. RORα-deficient mice that carry a natural deletion in the ligand-binding domain have cerebellar ataxia, a phenotype also observed in <italic>Staggerer</italic> (<italic>sg</italic>/<italic>sg</italic>) mutant mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref012">12</xref>], which express mutated RORα and additionally present vascular dysfunction, muscular defects, osteoporosis, immune abnormalities, and diet-induced atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref015">15</xref>]. Although RORα is expressed in the liver, its contribution to hepatic function has not been appreciated until recently. In mice, loss of RORα affected expression of multiple hepatic phase I and phase II enzymes that metabolize drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref016">16</xref>]. The receptor has also been shown to directly regulate the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP7B1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref017">17</xref>] and CYP2C8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref018">18</xref>]. Moreover, the transcriptional activator SRC-2 functions as a coactivator with RORα to modulate expression of G6Pase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref019">19</xref>], an essential, rate-limiting enzyme that controls glucose release into the plasma. Furthermore, RORα deficiency and treatment with RORα antagonists inhibit PEPCK expression and glucose production in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref021">21</xref>]. Similarly, overexpression of Rev-erbα, the physiological repressor of RORα, also suppresses expression of G6Pase and PEPCK in HepG2 cells. Conversely, silencing of Rev-erbα significantly stimulates G6Pase and PEPCK expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the role of RORα in modulating PEPCK promoter activity is not clear. In this paper, we demonstrate that RORα cooperates with C/EBPβ to directly stimulate PEPCK expression.</p>

<title>Electrophoresis mobility shift assay</title>
<p>RORα was obtained by <italic>in vitro</italic> translation using the <italic>In Vitro</italic> Transcription Coupled Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The empty expression vector was used as control. Subsequently, the RORα crude product from <italic>in vitro</italic> translation was incubated with radiolabeled DNA probes for 20 min at 30°C in a reaction mixture that also contained 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 20 μg/mL dI/dC, and 0.025% NP-40. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was then performed essentially as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref025">25</xref>]. The PEPCK probe was prepared by radiolabeling synthetic double-stranded DNA using [γ-32P] ATP (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). Unlabeled probe was used as competitive inhibitor, along with a mutated probe and I-kb, which contains a known RORα response element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref026">26</xref>] and was used as positive competitive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In this assay, 0.02 pmol <sup>32</sup>P-radiolabeled wild type probe was incubated with RORα crude product from <italic>in vitro</italic> translation, along with 0.1 pmol and 0.4 pmol unlabeled DNA. Probe sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0137955.s001">S1 Table</xref>.</p>

<title>Luciferase reporters</title>
<p>The human PEPCK promoter, from -1305 to +51 relative to the transcriptional start site, was amplified by PCR and inserted into the luciferase expression vector PGVB2 (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). This plasmid was then used in linker-scanning mutagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref027">27</xref>] to generate the deletion plasmids dC1 (deletion of C1 from -1305 to -323), dC2C3 (deletion of C2 and C3 from -323 to -251), dC4 (deletion of C4 from -251 to -203), and dC5 (deletion of C5 from -78 to -43). The mutated promoter ROREmt was generated by PCR using the wild type sequence as template. Briefly, the primers ROREmt-FW and ROREmt-RV were synthesized to incorporate the desired mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0137955.s001">S1 Table</xref>). These primers were then used in PCR reactions with PGVB2-FW and PGVB2-RV, respectively, to generate overlapping fragments that contain the mutation. The resulting fragments were then used in a final PCR reaction with PGVB2-FW and PGVB2-RV to generate a continuous mutated fragment, which was then cloned as a <italic>Mul</italic>I/<italic>Hind</italic>III-fragment into PGVB2. The mutated promoter C3mt was generated in a similar manner using the primers C3mt-FW and C3mt-RV to incorporate mutations in the C3 binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0137955.s001">S1 Table</xref>).

Total RNA was then prepared using ISOGENE reagent (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan), and reverse transcribed for 90 min at 37°C in a reaction containing 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 37.5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 pmol/μL oligo dT (Takara Bio), 0.5 mM dNTP (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 10 mM dithiothreitol, 20 units RNase inhibitor (Takara Bio), and 200 units Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MBI Fermentas, St Leon-Rot, Germany). Synthesized cDNA was then directly amplified using a Roche Light Cycler in a 15 μL reaction containing SYBR green Real-Time PCR master mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and 1 μM primers.

PEPCK expression was quantified in a similar manner using rtPEPCK-FW and rtPEPCK-RV. β-actin, amplified using rtACTB-FW and rtACTB-RV, was used as internal control, along with 18S rRNA, which was amplified using rt18SrRNA-FW and rt18SrRNA-RV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0137955.s001">S1 Table</xref>).

<title>Identification of a RORα response element in PEPCK</title>
<p>The ability of RORα to bind its putative response element in the PEPCK promoter was tested by EMSA. The location and sequence of this response element are shown in Figures (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g002">2A</xref>). Briefly, a 20-bp fragment spanning positions -250 to -230 of the PEPCK promoter was end-labeled, and incubated with RORα obtained by <italic>in vitro</italic> translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The receptor induced sequence-specific electrophoretic mobility shifts that were inhibited by addition of excess unlabeled probe such as I-kB, which contains a known RORα response element in NF-kappaB inhibitor α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Notably, the mutated probe was unable to inhibit RORα binding to the putative response element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec011">
<title>C/EBPβ and RORα synergistically activate PEPCK expression</title>
<p>As both C/EBPβ and RORα can bind the cAMP response element in PEPCK, we investigated the effect of overexpressing both. In HepG2 cells, C/EBPβ alone strongly stimulates, by 12-fold, expression of luciferase under the control of the PEPCK promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). However, RORα by itself stimulates expression only 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Notably, when both proteins were overexpressed, reporter activity increased about 20-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Mutation of the downstream C/EBPβ binding site C1, C4 and C5 did not affect this synergy, suggesting that C/EBPβ synergizes with RORα at the RORα response element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Other nuclear receptors, including CREB and glucocorticoid receptor, did not cooperate with RORα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine whether RORα and C/EBPβ synergistically stimulate transcription of PEPCK genes, both proteins were overexpressed in HepG2 cells along with luciferase under the control of wild type or mutated PEPCK promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Mutations in the promoter include deletions of the C1, C4, and C5 binding sites, as well as deletion of both C2 and C3 and mutation of C3 and of the RORα response element. Synergy between RORα and C/EBPβ was markedly disrupted by deletion of C2 and C3, or point mutation of RORE and C3. Thus, mutation of the RORα response element abolished both the ability of the receptor to activate transcription and to synergize with C/EBPβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). This mutation also diminished transactivation by C/EBPβ. Similar results were obtained when the C3 site was mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), or when C2 and C3 were both deleted. Deletion of C1, C4, and C5 did not significantly diminish PEPCK activation by RORα, but markedly reduced the cooperative effect of C/EBPβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). These results suggest that each binding site is required for a synergistic response to C/EBPβ and RORα although they are similar and could theoretically compensate for the loss of each other.</p>

<title>RORα response element and cAMP-dependent PEPCK expression</title>
<p>In HepG2 cultures, 10 μM forskolin mimics cAMP signaling and stimulates PEPCK transcription about 5-fold without affecting expression of RORα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In a luciferase reporter assay, cAMP-dependent activation of PEPCK decreased by about 50% by mutation of C3 and of the RORα response element four bases downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Thus, transcriptional activation by cAMP depends only modestly on these motifs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>PEPCK catalyzes a committed and rate-limiting reaction in hepatic gluconeogenesis, and its activity is tightly regulated by hormones and cAMP to maintain normal blood glucose levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref003">3</xref>]. The cAMP response unit consists of five <italic>cis</italic>-elements, including four binding sites for C/EBPs, and a canonical cAMP response element for CREB. In particular, the C3 binding site is absolutely conserved among humans, rhesus monkeys, dogs, mice, and rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g001">Fig 1</xref>), suggesting that transcriptional activation of PEPCK by C/EBPβ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref004">4</xref>] is a process common to mammals.</p>
<p>Notably, a search for RORα response elements in human genes identified PEPCK as a putative target. A typical RORα response element consists of a consensus AGGTCA half-site preceded by an A/T-rich region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref011">11</xref>]. In PEPCK, the response element is four bases downstream of the C3 site, and is absolutely conserved in humans and rhesus monkeys, but not in dogs, mice, and rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we demonstrated that RORα binds to this response element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Furthermore, luciferase reporter assays indicate that the receptor modestly stimulates expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In addition, we found that cAMP-induced stimulation of PEPCK expression depends on the RORα response element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Finally, we showed that suppression of RORα expression by siRNA also significantly decreased PEPCK transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Taken together, the data strongly indicate that PEPCK is a direct RORα target.</p>
<p>Consequently, an antagonist of RORα also inhibits PEPCK expression and hepatic glucose production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Conversely, knockdown or inhibition of Rev-erbα, a transcriptional regulator that competes with RORα for binding the RORα response element, enhances PEPCK abundance and glucose production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref024">24</xref>]. Thus, it appears that hepatic gluconeogenesis <italic>via</italic> PEPCK and G6Pase depends crucially on the balance between RORα and Rev-erbα activity. Notably, transcription of the clock gene Bmal1 seems to depend on the same competitive balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition, we found that RORα cooperates with C/EBPβ to synergistically stimulate PEPCK expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0137955.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Indeed, the PEPCK promoter has been previously shown to respond to several multisubunit complexes. For instance, glucocorticoid receptor was recently shown to interact with peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma at the PEPCK promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref030">30</xref>]. Finally, the ability of the promoter to respond to cAMP is mediated by synergistic interaction between the cAMP response element and a complex regulatory element that recruits transcription factors enriched in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>RORα regulates target gene expression mainly by binding as monomers to promoter response elements. For example, the receptor has been shown to directly regulate G6Pase transcriptional activation by the SRC-2 activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref019">19</xref>]. The physiological significance of RORα has been widely characterized. For instance, overexpression of RORα in rat insulinoma cell lines increased expression and secretion of insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref033">33</xref>]. Moreover, the homozygous staggerer (<italic>sg</italic>/<italic>sg</italic>) mouse, which expresses mutated RORα has improved insulin sensitivity and enhanced glucose uptake in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref034">34</xref>]. In addition, a RORα inverse agonist suppresses insulitis and prevents hyperglycemia in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref035">35</xref>]. RORα also potentially regulates transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is associated with Alzheimer’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref038">38</xref>]. Finally, IkappaBzeta cooperates with RORα to regulate the development of T helper 17 cells during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0137955.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, our data suggest that human PEPCK is a direct target of RORα with a functional response element at positions -245 to -234. Our results define possible new roles for RORα in hepatic gluconeogenesis, possibly by regulating PEPCK expression. Finally, understanding the interaction between C/EBPβ and RORα may potentially help design specific drugs to treat inflammation, diabetes, and obesity.</p>
