<p>Maternally administered oxytocin leads to changes in offspring social behavior and neurobiology.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Oxytocin is used in approximately half of all births in the United States during labor induction and/or augmentation. However, the effects of maternal oxytocin administration on offspring development have not been fully characterized. Here, we used the socially monogamous prairie vole to examine the hypothesis that oxytocin exposure at birth can have long-term developmental consequences. Maternally administered oxytocin increased methylation of the oxytocin receptor (<italic>Oxtr</italic>) in the fetal brain. As adults, oxytocin-exposed voles were more gregarious, with increased alloparental caregiving toward pups and increased close social contact with other adults. Cross-fostering indicated that these effects were the result of direct action on the offspring, rather than indirect effects via postnatal changes in maternal behavior. Male oxytocin-exposed offspring had increased oxytocin receptor density and expression in the brain as adults. These results show that long-term effects of perinatal oxytocin may be mediated by an epigenetic mechanism.</p>

<body><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The hormone oxytocin (OXT) triggers uterine contractions at birth, facilitating expulsion of the fetus. In contemporary obstetric care, OXT is the most widely used uterotonic agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>) and is used to both induce and augment labor. Since 1990, the rate of labor induction in the United States has increased from 9.5 to 23.8% of births in 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>). When including labor augmentation, national surveys estimate that approximately 50% of women receive some form of exogenous OXT during labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Conversely, infants delivered by cesarean section have lower levels of OXT than those delivered vaginally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>). It has conventionally been thought that maternal OXT would neither reach the fetus nor produce long-lasting effects. However, this assumption has not been thoroughly tested.</p><p>What might be the consequences on offspring neurodevelopment as a result of exogenous OXT administration at birth? OXT serves a variety of functions in the neonate, all broadly related to helping achieve a transition from the uterine environment to the gradual process of establishing homeostatic independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>). These functions in the fetus/neonate are analogous to how OXT triggers the onset of maternal behavior in the mother’s brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>). At birth, OXT serves to protect the fetal brain from the hypoxic conditions of birth by triggering a transient switch in γ-aminobutyric acid signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>), along with several other related functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). The process by which exposure to a hormone in early life produces an enduring effect in the developing organism is known as “hormonal imprinting,” which has been observed following OXT exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>). The neonatal period appears to be a sensitive period in terms of OXT’s actions within the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>). This suggests that changes in perinatal OXT signaling can alter developmental trajectory. Following birth and across development, OXT regulates a variety of social behaviors typically associated with affiliation, caregiving, and bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>). We therefore hypothesized that OXT exposure at birth could influence subsequent social behavior.</p><p>In humans, labor induction is associated with changes in neonatal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>) and delayed motor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>) in the acute phase soon after birth. There has been little work done on the possible long-term consequences of OXT exposure beyond some inconsistent associations between maternal OXT administration (either induction or augmentation) and heightened risk for later development of autism in offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>). However, all of these associations have been correlational, and we do not know whether this association is due to the administration of exogenous OXT per se or the need for such administration is due to low endogenous OXT levels.</p><p>Here, we used the monogamous prairie vole to experimentally investigate the effects of maternally administered OXT in the immediate prepartum period on the brains and behavior of offspring. As a proof of concept, we tested whether maternal administration of a single IU of OXT (0.03 mg/kg) would produce acute physiological effects in the fetus (plasma OXT levels and c-fos immunoreactivity in the brain). Second, we sought to confirm fetal physiological sensitivity to maternal OXT without the confounding influence of induced uterine contractions and hence tested fetal heart rate following removal from the uterus while still maintaining the umbilical connection. Next, we tested how long-lasting consequences of OXT could be established in the fetal brain via changes to the epigenetic regulation of the OXT receptor (<italic>Oxtr</italic>) following a single administration of OXT (0.125 to 0.5 mg/kg, administered once on the expected day of delivery). Last, we used the intermediate dose of OXT (0.25 mg/kg) administered maternally on the day of delivery to explore the effects on offspring brain and behavior. The range of doses chosen for this study was based on previous work from our laboratory that used 0.4 mg/kg of OXT administered to voles daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>) and 1 mg/kg administered once to pups on the first postnatal day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>). Prairie voles have relatively high levels of plasma OXT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>), so the doses used in the present work are high by the standards of other species but still below threshold to induce labor in the vole.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>The fetus is sensitive to maternally administered OXT</title><p>In experiments 1 and 2, we measured acute physiological responses of the fetus to maternal OXT administration to establish fetal sensitivity to maternal OXT. Maternally administered OXT (0.03 mg/kg) on the expected day of delivery resulted in increased fetal plasma OXT levels (experiment 1, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) as well as an increase in neuronal activity in two OXT-sensitive regions, the paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus, both located within the hypothalamus (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 for both comparisons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). Since OXT produces acute bradycardic effect in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><italic>25</italic></xref>), we assessed the acute effect of OXT on heart rate in fetal voles in experiment 2. Similar to adults, direct administration of OXT (0.25 mg/kg) to vole fetuses produced an acute bradycardic response 5 min after injection (experiment 2, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Next, we tested whether maternally administered OXT would have a similar effect. To remove the confounding influence of uterine contractions restricting blood supply and thereby slowing fetal heart rate, we removed fetal pups from the uterus and excised them via laparotomy while still maintaining a connection to the maternal circulation via the umbilical cord (experiment 2b; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Intraperitoneal administration of OXT to the dam produced a rapid decrease in fetal heart rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). The fetal heart rate decline continued over the course of the 5-min recording, an effect not seen in the group treated with saline vehicle (SAL) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Pretreatment with the OXT antagonist L-368,899 (OTA) completely abolished this effect (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). There were no effects of sex on fetal heart rate. OTA also led to a higher resting heart rate in the fetus, which suggests a tonically bradycardic role for OXT. Thus, we conclude that the fetal vole pup is acutely sensitive to maternally administered OXT.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>The fetus is acutely responsive to maternal OXT.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experiment 1a: Plasma OXT was higher in fetal vole pups after maternal treatment with OXT (0.03 mg/kg, <italic>n</italic> = 6) compared to saline vehicle (SAL, <italic>n</italic> = 7).

To account for the possibility of prenatal OXT affecting maternal behavior and thereby indirectly affecting offspring development, we implemented a cross-fostering paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Because OXT has been shown to affect the production of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in rodent pups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27"><italic>27</italic></xref>), we chose to first examine this behavior. Overall, there were significant effects of age [<italic>F</italic>(22,167) = 5.397, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001], treatment [<italic>F</italic>(22,167) = 2.419, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001], and an interaction between treatment and sex [<italic>F</italic>(44,336) = 1.572, <italic>P</italic> = 0.015] such that male SAL pups vocalized for a longer duration than female SAL pups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.049).

This is the first study to show experimentally that there can be long-term changes in offspring brain and behavior following a single maternal OXT administration in the immediate prepartum. When we administered OXT to the pregnant female, fetal OXT levels increased, and neuronal activity in two OXT source nuclei increased. In addition, fetal heart rate declined after maternal OXT treatment, which was most likely not caused by uterine contractions, as the fetus had been removed from the uterus. Maternal OXT treatment led to dose-dependent increases in <italic>Oxtr</italic> methylation in the fetal brain and increased the <italic>Oxtr</italic> gene expression for a given level of methylation. Offspring exposed to prepartum OXT vocalized more following separation as pups and went on to display more alloparental care, more time in close proximity with adult conspecifics, and less time alone. Adult male offspring of OXT-treated dams showed increases in OXTR and a decrease in V1aR density in regions of the brain known to regulate social behavior and affect. When we used a cross-fostering paradigm to determine the contribution of possible OXT-induced changes in maternal behavior, we saw no effects of rearing condition on any behavior measured. We therefore conclude that the observed changes are via direct action of maternally administered OXT on the fetus, possibly by crossing the placenta, as has been shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33"><italic>33</italic></xref>).</p><p>Evidence continues to grow that OXT acts as a hormonal signal that prepares the fetal brain for the extrauterine environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>). Thus, there is an adaptive reason why the fetal brain would be sensitive to maternal OXT levels, and the observed changes in offspring development may be due to changes in the transition toward homeostatic independence. This hypothesis is supported by the molecular results from fetal brains. Methylation and expression data suggested that the fetal brain becomes more sensitive to OXT as parturition approaches (indexed here via fetal weight), since <italic>Oxtr</italic> methylation levels decreased and mRNA levels correspondingly increased.</p><p>In the brains of adult male offspring of OXT-treated dams, we observed increases in OXTR density in the central amygdala, parietal cortex, and insular cortex and a decrease in V1aR density in the ventral pallidum. It is likely that these effects contributed to the behavioral differences that we observed in these animals, as these are brain regions well known to contribute to the expression of caregiving behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34"><italic>34</italic></xref>). OXT signaling in the central amygdala (CeA) regulates maternal aggressive behavior in defense of pups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35"><italic>35</italic></xref>), while OXT in the NAcc regulates pair bonding and alloparental caregiving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36"><italic>36</italic></xref>). Of particular note were the robust increases in OXTR density along the rostral-caudal extent of the insular cortex, which is associated with caregiving responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34"><italic>34</italic></xref>). In addition to the effects of maternal OXT treatment, pair-bond formation may have also led to changes in OXTR/V1aR densities.</p><p>Although there were no differences in overall levels of <italic>Oxtr</italic> DNA methylation within the brain in adulthood (fig. S7), the differences in OXTR density were somewhat paralleled by similar changes in molecular measures from the corresponding contralateral brain regions. For instance, increases in OXTR density were mirrored by increases in <italic>Oxtr</italic> expression in the amygdala and insular cortex. There was also a significant increase and a trend toward an increase in the ratio of expression to methylation level in the amygdala and insular cortex, respectively. This pattern in the brains of adult offspring resembles the changes in epigenetic regulation of <italic>Oxtr</italic> seen in the fetal brain samples and speaks to a possible mechanism by which perinatal OXT imparts long-lasting effects. At the acute 90-min time point in fetal brains, we observed effects of maternal OXT on fetal methylation and mRNA levels, especially at the high dose. Maternally administered exogenous OXT not only led to increases in methylation of the <italic>Oxtr</italic> promoter but also changed the relationship between methylation and mRNA expression. Because expression relatively increased for a given level of methylation, we hypothesize that this may indicate hydroxymethylation, which has previously been associated with increasing gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37"><italic>37</italic></xref>). Expression levels of the closely related <italic>V1aR</italic> were not affected, suggesting specificity of the effects of maternal OXT.</p><p>This work builds on previous studies that have shown young mammals to be sensitive to the organizational effects of OXT when it is administered directly to the pup on the first postnatal day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>). Previous studies on the developmental consequences of early-life OXT exposure have relied on doses between 1 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><italic>40</italic></xref>) and 5 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>) delivered directly to the pup, rather than to pregnant females as in the present study. Previous work on the acute functions of maternal OXT on fetal preparedness for birth has used doses of 0.05 mg/kg in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>) and 1 mg/kg in guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). This is roughly in line with species differences in plasma OXT between rats and voles, where rat levels are approximately one-third of those in voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>), which implies that higher doses would be needed to induce labor in voles. That said, the doses in the present study (0.03 to 0.5 mg/kg) were below the threshold to induce labor in this species. Thus, it is unlikely that the effects observed here were due to difficulties with the birth process. However, we cannot exclude indirect effects of OXT due to uterine contractions. Note also, that this study does not directly model the use of OXT in human labor. Humans typically receive much lower doses over much longer durations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"><italic>41</italic></xref>). Here, OXT was administered via a single bolus, in contrast to the use of a Pitocin drip, which typically involves regularly increasing administration rates up to a maximum of 40 mU/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42"><italic>42</italic></xref>). Future work should more closely model the dosing regimen used in humans.</p><p>The present findings’ relevance to human health should spur future studies to investigate the possible effects of maternally administered OXT on behavior in human neonates. Currently, approximately 50% of women are given OXT before the third stage of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Translational animal research is needed to experimentally backfill in our understanding of the effects of this widespread practice in humans. Although rodent brains are far less developed than humans’ at birth, all mammals must navigate the transition from fetal life to the extrauterine environment via precise coordination between mother and offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43"><italic>43</italic></xref>). OXT is one facet of this coordinated transition, and practices that affect maternal-fetal hormone signaling may therefore affect the fetus’ initiation of homeostatic independence.</p><p>Previous studies across human populations have found mixed results when examining the links between OXT administration at birth and subsequent autism diagnosis in offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>). The present findings suggest that OXT exposure can produce a gregarious phenotype in offspring, which would support the contention that a correlation between peripartum OXT administration and autism may arise because of a heightened need for OXT supplementation during labor resulting from low endogenous levels. However, the effects of neonatal OXT on subsequent social behavior vary by sex, species, and dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><italic>40</italic></xref>), so direct extrapolation of the present findings to humans is contentious. Even so, these data indicate the importance of consideration of OXT dose during labor in humans.</p><p>OXT administered to either induce or augment labor should be evaluated for potential effects on offspring social/neural development. The fact that it has not up to this point speaks to a need for more cross-talk between obstetrics and neuroscience, and a reevaluation of approaches effectively grandfathered into a widespread obstetric practice before we became aware of the diverse set of actions of OXT in the brain. We anticipate this process to be extremely challenging, as OXT has produced great reductions in fetal and maternal mortality. Any unintended side effects to social functioning resulting from prepartum OXT will need to be measured alongside the well-documented health benefits.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Heterosexual pairs of prairie voles (<italic>Microtus ochrogaster</italic>) were used to generate the subjects for this study. Dams consisted of primiparous adult female voles at 60 to 90 days of age. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of either the University of Illinois at Chicago or Northeastern University. Prairie voles experience both induced estrus and induced ovulation; therefore, we created a timed mating paradigm to best predict the day of delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Untreated sires remained with the dam and litter from conception to weaning. OXT was always administered on the expected day of delivery, which was confirmed either by fetal body weight &gt; 1.7 g or delivery within 24 hours in experiment 4, which focused on long-term consequences.</p><p>In experiment 1a, term pregnant female prairie voles were intraperitoneally injected with either OXT (0.03 mg/kg) or SAL and then rapidly decapitated 10 min later to measure peak plasma OXT levels.

In experiment 2a, the umbilical cord was clamped to prevent transfer, and the fetus was injected directly. In experiment 2b, the fetus was still connected to the maternal circulation via the umbilical cord and the pregnant female was injected. After 5 min of baseline recording, either the pup (experiment 2a, <italic>n</italic> = 7 per group) or pregnant female (experiment 2b, <italic>n</italic> = 6 to 7 per group) was randomly assigned to be injected with either SAL or OXT (0.25 mg/kg) intraperitoneally, and heart rate was recorded for another 5 min. In experiment 2b, a third treatment group received pretreatment with the OXT antagonist L-368,899 (Merck Pharmaceuticals, Kenilworth, NJ) at a dose of 2 mg/kg 10 min before treatment with OXT (<italic>n</italic> = 5).</p><p>In experiment 3, pregnant female prairie voles were randomly assigned to receive one of five treatments: low-OXT (0.125 mg/kg), medium-OXT (0.25 mg/kg), high-OXT (0.5 mg/kg), SAL, or no treatment on the expected day of delivery (<italic>n</italic> = 15 to 22 per group). One male and one female pup were included from each litter. Ninety minutes after treatment, subjects were anesthetized with isoflurane, and fetuses were removed and euthanized. Fetal brains were then extracted and sectioned into thirds, roughly corresponding to forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain, before being frozen in dry ice and placed into −80°C storage.

Dams each fostered litters comprising roughly 50% OXT and 50% SAL pups, balanced by sex as much as possible. What resulted was a 2 × 2 × 2 design: birth treatment (the treatment of the birth dam), rearing condition (the treatment of the foster dam) consisting of either SAL or OXT, and sex. Thus, there were eight groups (<italic>n</italic> = 7 to 18 per group, 101 subjects in total).
