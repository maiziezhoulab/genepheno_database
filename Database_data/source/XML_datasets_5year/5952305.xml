<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Axon guidance in vertebrates is controlled by genetic cascades as well as by intrinsic activity-dependent refinement of connections. Midline axon crossing is one of the best studied pathfinding models and is fundamental to the establishment of bilaterally symmetric nervous systems. However, it is not known whether crossing requires intrinsic activity in axons, and what controls that activity. Further, a mechanism linking neuronal activity and gene expression has not been identified for axon pathfinding. Using embryonic zebrafish, we found that the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) NR1.1 subunit (<italic>grin1a</italic>) is expressed in commissural axons. Pharmacological inhibition of <italic>grin1a</italic>, hypoxia exposure reduction of <italic>grin1a</italic> expression, or CRISPR knock-down of <italic>grin1a</italic> leads to defects in midline crossing. Inhibition of neuronal activity phenocopies the effects of <italic>grin1a</italic> loss on midline crossing. By combining pharmacological inhibition of the NMDAR with optogenetic stimulation to precisely restore neuronal activity, we observed rescue of midline crossing. This suggests that the NMDAR controls pathfinding by an activity-dependent mechanism. We further show that the NMDAR may act, via modulating activity, on the transcription factor <italic>arxa</italic> (mammalian <italic>Arx</italic>), a known regulator of midline pathfinding. These findings uncover a novel role for the NMDAR in controlling activity to regulate commissural pathfinding and identify <italic>arxa</italic> as a key link between the genetic and activity-dependent regulation of midline axon guidance.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>While intrinsic neuronal activity is involved in refinement of axon connections, its role in pathfinding decisions is poorly understood. We found that midline axon crossing is regulated by the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). The NMDAR is expressed on axons that cross the midline, and inhibition or knock-down of the NDMDAR led to fewer axons crossing. Precise optogenetic stimulation of neurons rescued the effects of NMDAR blockade, demonstrating that the NMDAR acts by an activity-dependent mechanism. In turn, the NMDAR affects expression of <italic>arxa</italic>, an important gene for brain development and that is associated with several human neurologic diseases. These results show a critical role for the NMDAR in early axon guidance decisions by control of neuronal activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A key common feature in the CNS of invertebrates and vertebrates is the establishment of a bilaterally symmetric nervous system, which in turn requires forming connections between the two sides. Most axons cross the midline once and do not cross again, while a smaller percentage remain ipsilateral and never cross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Garbe and Bashaw, 2004</xref>). Genetic regulation of the midline crossing decision has been intensely studied since the 1990s, leading to the identification of canonical axon guidance gene families, including the Robos, Slits, Netrins, Dccs, Uncs, Derailed, Frizzleds, and Wnts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Dickson, 2002</xref>). Abnormalities of commissural axon tracts, caused by genetic disorders or premature birth, are associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disabilities ranging from isolated intellectual impairment to autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Hardan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Izzi and Charron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Marsh et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The standard model of pathfinding in vertebrates consists of two parts: an early, “hard-wired” genetically controlled phase; and later, neuronal activity refinement of connections, particularly of synapses. A defined genetic cascade, culminating particularly in the expression of cell-surface receptors and ligands, guides early pathfinding; whereas intrinsic neuronal activity appears to be regulated separately for later aspects of connectivity development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bixby and Harris, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Katz and Shatz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Yamamoto and López-Bendito, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Kutsarova et al., 2017</xref>). However, recent studies have shown an early role for neuronal activity in the development of normal connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Hanson and Landmesser, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Spitzer, 2006</xref>). For example, the terminal projection determination of retinofugal, retinotectal, and commissural axons require neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Schmidt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Dhande et al., 2011</xref>), and interhemispheric coordinated activity is necessary for final targeting of axon projections once they have crossed the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Suárez et al., 2014</xref>). Whether there is a mechanism linking genetic regulation and neuronal activity, or whether the two act independently, is uncertain, with conflicting evidence for both possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Hanson and Landmesser, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Nicol et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Cang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Benjumeda et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, key unresolved questions remain regarding the role of activity and commissural axon projections. First, it is not known whether the choice for midline crossing requires intrinsic activity in the axons. If activity is required for the midline crossing choice, what controls their activity? Second, in early development, during the period classically considered to be primarily hard-wired and genetically regulated, is there a mechanism linking neuronal activity and gene expression?</p>
<p>To address these questions, we tested the role of activity in the midline crossing choice using embryonic zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) to visualize guidance decisions. The embryonic zebrafish is well suited for analysis of axon guidance: it is transparent, facilitating visualization of pathfinding; and experimentally accessible to pharmacological, optogenetic, and genetic manipulation. To explore the requirement for activity, we examined the role of the NMDAR for three reasons: first, because of its known role in axon refinement and branch maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Ben Fredj et al., 2010</xref>); second, because the NMDAR is widely expressed in the early zebrafish embryo CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Cox et al., 2005</xref>); and third, prior work has shown that NMDARs are present in axon growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Gill et al., 2015</xref>), but their involvement in axon guidance has not been studied and no evaluation of their functional role has been performed.</p>
<p>Here, we report that the NMDAR is required for midline axon crossing. We found that the NR1.1 subunit of the NMDAR (<italic>grin1a</italic>) is expressed in a population of commissural axons. Pharmacological inhibition or CRISPR knock-down of <italic>grin1</italic> leads to defects in midline crossing. Inhibition of neuronal activity phenocopies the effects of <italic>grin1</italic> loss. Finally, we use optogenetic stimulation to precisely rescue neuronal activity in pharmacologically treated embryos, demonstrating that the NMDAR’s role in pathfinding is mediated by neuronal activity. We find that the NMDAR may act, via modulating activity, on the transcription factor <italic>arxa</italic> (mammalian <italic>Arx</italic>), a known regulator of midline pathfinding. Thus, our study demonstrates a novel role for the NMDAR in early commissural pathfinding and demonstrates an early requirement for neuronal activity in midline axon guidance.</p>

<title>Scoring tract of the commissure of the posterior tuberculum (TCPTc) C/L ratios</title>
<p>Evaluation of the TCPTc axon midline crossing defects was determined by the following approach. Briefly, a confocal z-stack was taken of the region using identical confocal settings (20× objective, imaging speed: 8 μs/pixel, laser power: 30%, gain: 1.25%, offset: 5%). We used ImageJ to generate a maximum intensity projection of 11 slices (step size: 2 μm); then subtracted the background fluorescence by using a rolling ball radius of 50 pixels. We measured the total fluorescence intensity of a rectangular area (10 × 30 μm) placed over the commissure of TCPT pathway, or of the longitudinal tract before its decussation into the commissure. A ratio of commissural versus longitudinal axon intensity (C/L ratio) was calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Stevenson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Xing et al., 2015</xref>). Since experimental variation was noted, results were only compared between experiments performed on the same day. At least 10 embryos were imaged for each treatment.</p>

<sec id="s3E">
<title>Immunohistochemistry and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization</title>
<p>For <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and immunohistochemistry, embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS overnight at 4°C, washed briefly in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, dehydrated stepwise in methanol (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%), and stored in 100% MeOH at −20°C until use.</p>
<p>Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bonkowsky et al., 2008</xref>). Following fixation and dehydration in methanol, embryos were rehydrated, permeabilized using proteinase K [10 μg/ml in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST)] at 28°C for 60 minutes (min) (8 min for 24 hpf, 20 min for 36 hpf, and 30 min for 48 hpf) without rocking, washed twice in PBST for 5 min then re-fixed for 15 min. Embryos were then washed in PBST, blocked in PBST/1% DMSO/2% BSA/5% normal goat serum (NGS), and then incubated overnight in a primary antibody solution diluted in PBST/1% DMSO/2% BSA/2% NGS at 4°C. The next day embryos were washed in PBST/1% DMSO/1% NGS for a minimum of 6 h, followed by incubation overnight with secondary antibodies, and washed the following day.</p>
<p>Antibodies used were the following: chicken polyclonal green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody 1:1000 (Aves Lab, GFP-1020), rabbit polyclonal anti-VGluT1 1:100 (Abcam, ab77822), mouse anti-acetylated tubulin 1:250 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, 6G7), mouse monoclonal anti-GluN1 1:50 (Synapse System, #114 011), goat polyclonal anti-EphrinB2a 1:20 (R&amp;D Systems, AF496), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-chicken 1:400 (Invitrogen, A-11039), Cy3 conjugated anti-rabbit 1:400 (Invitrogen, A10520), and Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated donkey anti-mouse 1:400 (Invitrogen, A-31570).</p>
<p>Whole-mount in situ hybridization for <italic>NR1.1</italic> was performed using an anti-sense probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Cox et al., 2005</xref>) following our previous protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bonkowsky and Chien, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>For <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry, after <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization was completed, embryos were transferred sequentially through 5%, 15%, and 30% sucrose in PBS. Embryos were then embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT; Tissue-TeK) using a dry ice-ethanol bath and stored at −80°C overnight. Fourteen-micrometer sections were cut for immunostaining. Sections were boiled for 20 min with citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate and 0.05% Tween 20; pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval, and immunostaining was performed as described above.</p>

<title>RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
</title>
<p>The 24 hpf whole embryos or the head tissue of 48 hpf embryos were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Ambion) and total RNA was extracted and purified with the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). An aliquot of each extract was used for spectrophotometry to determine RNA quality and concentration. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (2 μg; 20-μl final reaction volume) with oligo(dT) priming using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting cDNA was diluted 4–20 times for the real time quantitative PCR. Samples were prepared with three independent biological replicates. RT-PCR was performed on an ABI prism 7900 HT instrument (Applied System) with a SYBR green fluorescence label. qRT-PCR for <italic>grin1a</italic> and <italic>grin1b</italic> was performed on 24 and 48 hpf embryos. Reactions were run with the following conditions: 95°C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95°C 20 s (s)/60°C 20 s/72°C 40 s. Each reaction was performed in triplicate and the mean of replicates was calculated; results were normalized to the mRNA level of each gene in normoxia embryos at 24 and 48 hpf with elongation factor 1α (<italic>elf1a</italic>) transcript levels as a control using the 2<sup>−ΔΔCT</sup> method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">Livak et al., 2001</xref>).

<p>Thirty embryos (72 hpf) were deyolked by incubating in deyolking buffer (65 mM NaCl, 1.7 mM KCl and 1.5 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) for 10 min and triturating vigorously. Protein was extracted by grinding embryos with pestle in a 60 μl of lysis buffer [150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, and 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor; 1:100, Sigma] on ice. The extract was centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were transferred to a new tube. The protein extract was then mixed with an equal amount of 2× Laemmli buffer [20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 0.125 M Tris (pH 6.8), and 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol] and heated at 95°C for 10 min.

<p>A total of 40 μl of samples was then run on a 4–20% gradient gel (Miniprotean TGX Gel Bio-Rad), and electro-blotted onto a PVDF membrane. After blocking with 3% non-fat milk in TBS (50 mM Tris, 0.138 M NaCl, and 2.7 mM KCl; pH 8.0) for 30 min with agitation, the membrane was split, and then incubated in mouse monoclonal anti-GluN1 antibody (Synapse System, #114 011, 1:100), anti-EfnB2a (R&amp;D Systems, AF1088, 1:20), or rabbit anti-β-actin (Abcam, ab8227, 1:1000) at 4°C overnight; washed in TBS; and then incubated in HRP-anti-mouse (Cell Signaling, #7076, 1:1000) or HRP-anti-rabbit (Cell Signaling, #7074, 1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature. Following incubation with secondary antibody, the membrane was washed extensively in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then subjected to chemiluminescent detection (WesternBright Quantum, Advansta). The intensity of specific bands was quantitated using ImageJ in three separate experimental replicates.</p>

<title>The NMDAR subunit NR1.1 (<italic>grin1a</italic>) is expressed in crossing axons</title>
<p>To study the role of NMDAR in midline axon pathfinding, we used the transgenic line <italic>Tg(foxP2-enhancerA.2:egfp-caax)</italic>, which expresses membrane-bound GFP in a subset of neurons in the telencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Stevenson et al., 2012</xref>). Tg<italic>(foxP2-enhancerA.2:egfp-caax)</italic> neurons project axons in the anterior commissure, longitudinal pathways, and the diencephalic TCPTc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Wilson et al., 1990</xref>). The TCPTc axons start to extend by 24 hpf; by 36–48 hpf, axons begin to cross the midline; and most axons have crossed by 72 hpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Stevenson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Xing et al., 2015</xref>). The Tg<italic>(foxP2-enhancerA.2:egfp-caax)</italic> line is particularly useful for visualizing midline crossing because it labels a subset of telencephalic neurons and axons (∼500–1000 in each hemi-telencephalon).</p>
<p>We examined expression of the NMDAR subunit GluN1 (<italic>grin1a)</italic>. We found that <italic>grin1a</italic> is expressed in TCPTc axons at 24 hpf, as they extend and prepare to cross the midline (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1<italic>A–B’’</italic></xref>). Next, we evaluated whether there is a source of glutamate that could serve as a ligand for the NMDAR. We observed that TCPTc axons pass near regions expressing Vglut1 (<italic>slc17a7a</italic>), the vesicular glutamate transporter expressed on neurons that release glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">Takamori et al., 2001</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1<italic>C–D’’’</italic></xref>).

<title>Inhibition of NMDAR decreases midline crossing</title>
<p>We used pharmacological inhibition of the NMDAR to test its necessity for midline crossing. To quantify the extent of the crossing defect, we measured the ratio of commissural to longitudinal axon crossing (the C/L ratio) in the TCPT commissural axons of Tg<italic>(foxP2-enhancerA.2:egfp-caax)</italic> using our previous methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Stevenson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Xing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic>,<italic>F</italic></xref>). Using APV (2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid), a competitive NMDAR antagonist that blocks the glutamate binding site; or MK-801 (dizocilpine), an uncompetitive NMDAR antagonist that is use- and voltage-dependent; we found a significant decrease in crossing axons at 72 hpf (one-way ANOVA; control, APV, MK-801; <italic>n</italic> = 32, <italic>n</italic> = 19, <italic>n</italic> = 15; mean C/L 1.0, 0.61, 0.59; SD 0.43, 0.30, 0.23; <italic>F</italic><sub>(2,63)</sub> = 10.3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <italic>post hoc</italic> Tukey’s HSD control versus APV, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; control vs MK-801, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic>,<italic>F</italic>,<italic>I</italic></xref>; Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1 F1">Figs. 1-1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1 F2">1-2</xref>). Importantly, the decrease in crossing axons was not simply due to a delay in development; the C/L ratio was also still significantly different at 96 hpf, &gt;24 h after the end of drug exposure (<italic>n</italic> = 15 each, control and APV, mean C/L 1.0, 0.76; SD 0.20, 0.30; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Student’s <italic>t</italic> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>I</italic></xref>). Also, the effect of APV was not due to an overall change in axon outgrowth. Visualization with the pan-axonal anti-acetylated tubulin antibody showed no difference between control and APV-treated embryos in terms of overall axon staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>G</italic>,<italic>H</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>Treatment with APV or MK-801 did not adversely affect embryo morphology or development. Further, the treatment did not change properties of the reporting transgene: we found that APV did not change fluorescence of the <italic>foxP2.A.2:egfp-caax</italic> transgene line. We measured intensities of the neuron cell bodies and found that in control compared to APV-treated, average total fluorescence pixel intensity was 1.11 × 10<sup>6</sup> versus 1.18 × 10<sup>6</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 8 each, both hemi-telencephalon cell groups counted, SD 5.6 × 10<sup>4</sup> vs 3.3 × 10<sup>5</sup>, Student’s <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.62). These results suggest that NMDAR function is necessary for normal midline crossing.</p>

<title>NMDAR interacts genetically with known modulators of midline crossing</title>
<p>Previous work has shown that the midline crossing decision can be modulated by exogenous signaling due to potential environmental factors, including hypoxia or exposure to serotonergic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Pocock and Hobert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Bonnin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Stevenson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Xing et al., 2015</xref>). Since we had observed that pharmacological inhibition of NMDAR caused a similar midline axon phenotype, this suggested a potential shared or interacting mechanism. To explore this, we tested whether the NMDAR interacted with hypoxia and with serotonin signaling. It has been shown that hypoxia reduces TCPTc crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Stevenson et al., 2012</xref>), and hypoxia is known to affect NMDAR activity and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Kobayashi and Millhorn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Mishra et al., 2001</xref>). We assessed <italic>grin1a</italic> and <italic>grin1b</italic>, the paralogs of the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR. First, we found that hypoxia reduced expression of <italic>grin1a</italic> and <italic>grin1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic>,<italic>B</italic></xref>).

We also explored the interaction between serotonergic signaling and NMDAR’s effects, because it has been shown that the serotonin receptor <italic>htr2a</italic> is necessary for TCPT crossing and is a mediator of hypoxia’s effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Xing et al., 2015</xref>). We found that increasing available serotonin by using fluoxetine, a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, restored a normal ratio of midline crossing in APV-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>E</italic></xref>; one-way ANOVA; control, APV, fluoxetine, fluoxetine with APV; <italic>n</italic> = 16 each; mean C/L 1.0, 0.56, 0.96, 1.0; SD 0.16, 0.21, 0.25, 0.24; <italic>F</italic><sub>(3,66)</sub> = 4.6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; <italic>post hoc</italic> Tukey’s HSD, control vs APV, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; APV vs fluoxetine, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; APV vs APV with fluoxetine, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).

<title>NMDAR regulation of the midline crossing decision is neuronal activity dependent</title>

We had found previously that midline axon crossing of the TCPTc requires down-regulation of ephrinB2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Stevenson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Xing et al., 2015</xref>), and eph/ephrins have been shown to have functional effects on NMDAR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Dalva et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Takasu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Nolt et al., 2011</xref>). We tested whether NMDAR regulated ephrinB2a levels. Following APV treatment, we did not find any changes in ephrinB2a protein levels in the telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>), using Western blotting with four separate experiments of protein extracts derived from embryo heads. This argues against ephrinB2a mediating NMDAR’s effect on pathfinding. However, inhibition of neuronal activity, using the sodium channel blocker tricaine (MS-222) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Ramlochansingh et al., 2014</xref>), reduced TCPT midline crossing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). Further, similar to the observed interaction between APV blockade and rescue with fluoxetine, we found that fluoxetine could rescue the TCPT crossing defect caused by tricaine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>).

<title>Arx is targeted by NMDAR</title>
<p>To investigate how the NMDAR could affect pathfinding, we explored downstream effectors of axon pathfinding. As mentioned above we did not find differences in EphrinB2 expression with NMDAR blockade. We tested effects on the transcription factor <italic>arxa</italic> (the zebrafish ortholog of mammalian <italic>Arx</italic>), which has been shown by mouse knock-outs and in human genetic conditions to be necessary for normal midline commissure formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Shoubridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Simonet et al., 2015</xref>). We found coexpression of <italic>arxa</italic> in <italic>foxP2.A.2</italic> neurons during early development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). To determine if <italic>arxa</italic> might be responsive to changes in NMDAR-modulated neuronal activity, we measured <italic>arxa</italic> expression after pharmacological blockade or genetic knock-down of the NMDAR. We performed qRT-PCR at 48 hpf in experimental triplicates, with <italic>n</italic> &gt; 10 embryos in each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). The relative log2 fold change were calculated relative to wild type, using 28S rRNA standard, SD for each in parenthesis, with <italic>p</italic> values adjusted using Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate. We found significant decreases (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) in <italic>arxa</italic> expression with APV or tricaine exposure, or with <italic>grin1a/b</italic> knock-down: respective log2 fold changes were 0.028 (0.023), 0.068 (0.037), and 0.54 (0.15). These results suggest that <italic>arxa</italic> might act downstream of the NMDAR to affect changes in midline crossing.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Midline axon pathfinding is a critical process in the development of CNS circuitry, and our results indicate an early activity-dependent step regulated through the NMDAR. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that the NMDAR is involved in control of axon pathfinding. Interestingly, our results show that it is by regulating neuronal activity that the NMDAR affects the midline crossing decision, and potentially by targeting the transcription factor gene <italic>arxa</italic>.</p>
<p>NMDARs are known to play other roles in neuronal development including neuronal survival, dendritic and axonal arborization, and synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Ewald and Cline, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Gambrill and Barria, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Chakraborty et al., 2017</xref>). Also, NMDAR expression has been shown at axon growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Gill et al., 2015</xref>) but no functional role had been shown previously.</p>
<p>The classical model of vertebrate axon connectivity development consisted of a relatively discrete two-step process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Katz and Shatz, 1996</xref>). This was defined by an initial stage that was genetically deterministic, leading to the development of a scaffold of axon tracts. Second, an activity-dependent stage then refined axon connections and synapse development. In invertebrates such as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the early genetic regulation of midline commissure formation appears relatively hard-wired, with stereotypy of each neuron and its projection(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Sánchez-Soriano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Chisholm et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>However, recent data have revealed limitations of the classical model for understanding vertebrate axon pathfinding. First, the significant variability in vertebrate axon tracts is not consistent with genetic hard-wiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Finn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>). Second, it is now apparent that transcriptional, translational, and post-translational mechanisms all contribute to regulation of pathfinding choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Stoeckli, 2017</xref>). Third, multiple studies have shown roles for spontaneous activity in guidance decisions earlier than had been realized (for reviewed, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Kirkby et al., 2013</xref>). This includes data showing that pathfinding decisions require rhythmic bursting neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Hanson and Landmesser, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">Menelaou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Dhande et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">Plazas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Burbridge et al., 2014</xref>); and that corpus callosum pathfinding across the midline requires balanced hemispheric activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Suárez et al., 2014</xref>). The spontaneous activity was shown to regulate axon guidance receptor expression, including that of EphA4, EphB1, and PlexinA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Hanson and Landmesser, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Kastanenka and Landmesser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">Plazas et al., 2013</xref>). Whether the activity directly or indirectly regulates the axon guidance receptors was not examined. Finally, environmental, non-genetic factors affect final axon trajectories and overall connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Brun et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data point to an early role for neuronal activity in midline axon crossing mediated by the NMDAR. We found early expression of the NMDAR on midline crossing axons, and inhibition (pharmacologic) or reduction (hypoxia, CRISPR) of the NMDAR disrupted crossing. Using precise optogenetic stimulation, we could rescue NMDAR blockade, suggesting that the NMDAR-dependent pathfinding was regulated by activity.</p>
<p>We showed that the transcription factor <italic>arxa</italic>, a known regulator of downstream guidance receptors and a gene implicated in human midline crossing defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Shoubridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Friocourt and Parnavelas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Simonet et al., 2015</xref>), was down-regulated by NMDAR inhibition or knock-down. Interestingly, we observed that both APV and tricaine cause a greater decrease in <italic>arxa</italic> levels than <italic>grin1a/b</italic> CRISPR knock-down. A possible reason for this difference in effect is that the CRISPR knock-down targets exon 1 in the <italic>grin1a</italic> and <italic>grin1b</italic> subunits, possibly there is residual NMDAR activity by incomplete knock-down or alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Bai and Hoffman, 2009</xref>), the former is consistent with our Western blottings showing that there is still protein expression. In contrast, APV or tricaine block any signaling or activity from the NMDAR.</p>
<p>In summary, these experiments provide evidence for an early activity-dependent step in midline axon pathfinding and provide a possible mechanistic insight into the regulation of activity by the NMDAR and a downstream effector via <italic>arxa</italic>. Understanding a potential link between activity regulated through the NMDAR, and axon pathfinding, may reveal unexpected insights into a range of neurodevelopmental connectivity disorders. For example, premature birth, which exposes the developing nervous system to chronic hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Martin et al., 2011</xref>), is associated with a range of disturbances in connectivity development even in the absence of destructive lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Kwon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Thomason et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
