<abstract>
<p>Gray platelet syndrome is named after the gray appearance of platelets due to the absence of α-granules. It is caused by recessive mutations in <italic>NBEAL2</italic>, resulting in macrothrombocytopenia and myelofibrosis. Though using the term gray platelets for GATA1 deficiency has been debated, a reduced number of α-granules has been described for macrothrombocytopenia due to <italic>GATA1</italic> mutations. We compared platelet size and number of α-granules for two NBEAL2 and two GATA1-deficient patients and found reduced numbers of α-granules for all, with the defect being more pronounced for NBEAL2 deficiency. We further hypothesized that the granule defect for GATA1 is due to a defective control of NBEAL2 expression. Remarkably, platelets from two patients, and Gata1-deficient mice, expressed almost no NBEAL2. The differentiation of GATA1 patient-derived CD34<sup>+</sup> stem cells to megakaryocytes showed defective proplatelet and α-granule formation with strongly reduced NBEAL2 protein and ribonucleic acid expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed 5 GATA binding sites in a regulatory region 31 kb upstream of <italic>NBEAL2</italic> covered by a H3K4Me1 mark indicative of an enhancer locus. Luciferase reporter constructs containing this region confirmed its enhancer activity in K562 cells, and mutagenesis of the GATA1 binding sites resulted in significantly reduced enhancer activity. Moreover, DNA binding studies showed that GATA1 and GATA2 physically interact with this enhancer region. GATA1 depletion using small interfering ribonucleic acid in K562 cells also resulted in reduced NBEAL2 expression. In conclusion, we herein show a long-distance regulatory region with GATA1 binding sites as being a strong enhancer for NBEAL2 expression.</p>

<body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Platelets play a critical role in hemostasis and contain secretory granules that are essential to maintain their normal function. Of the three types of granules (dense, α and lysosomes), α-granules are the most abundant type that store essential proteins for platelet adhesion and blood coagulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-1020695">1</xref></sup> Platelets are shed into the blood stream after the formation of long cytoplasmic extensions from differentiated megakaryocytes (MKs), a process called proplatelet formation. The α-granules are formed in the early MKs and are actively transported along microtubules from the MK cell body towards the proplatelets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-1020695">1</xref></sup> In circulating platelets, these α-granules mature further and proteins will be actively or passively taken up from the plasma by receptor-mediated endocytosis, in addition to the proteins loaded in these granules during their biosynthesis in the MK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-1020695">2</xref></sup> Recently, it has become clear that α-granule proteins play important roles in nonhemostatic events, such as wound healing, cancer, inflammation and innate immunity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-1020695">3</xref></sup></p><p>Gray platelet syndrome (GPS, MIM139090) is a rare inherited platelet disorder characterized by mild to moderate bleeding, macrothrombocytopenia and markedly reduced or absent α-granules that typically results in a grayish appearance of platelets under a light microscope.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-1020695">4</xref></sup> Using three independent next-generation sequencing approaches, recessive mutations in <italic>NBEAL2</italic> were found to cause GPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-1020695">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-1020695">7</xref></sup> NBEAL2 encodes a 2.754 amino acid polypeptide, neurobeachin-like-2, that contains BEACH (named after Beige and Chediak-Higashi), ARM (Armadillo), Con A-like lectin (Concanavalin A-like lectin domain), PH (Pleckstrin Homology-domain like) and WD40 domains. The exact role of BEACH domain-containing proteins remains largely unknown, but they are generally large proteins that are able to control diverse cellular mechanisms such as vesicular transport, apoptosis, membrane dynamics and receptor signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-1020695">8</xref></sup> Interestingly, LYST and NBEA, two other BEACH domain-containing proteins, have been shown to be implicated in platelet dense granule defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-1020695">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-1020695">10</xref></sup> Regarding these proteins, their exact contribution in granule formation and trafficking during MK and platelet formation also remains unknown.</p><p>In addition, the term GPS has been used for macrothrombocytopenia patients with defects in X-linked <italic>GATA1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-1020695">11</xref></sup> (MIM305371), or having an autosomal dominant loss-of-function variant in <italic>GFI1B</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-1020695">12</xref></sup> (MIM187900). Both genes encode for transcription factors that regulate megakaryopoiesis, and defects result in enlarged platelets with fewer (though not absent) α-granules, as studies in additional GATA1 and GFI1B patients illustrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-1020695">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-1020695">18</xref></sup> Based on a recent detailed comparison of clinical and laboratory data for NBEAL2, GATA1 and GFI1B patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-1020695">3</xref></sup> it was suggested not to use the term GPS for other macrothrombocytopenia disorders that comprise abnormal α-granule numbers, except for patients with NBEAL2 defects. Important similarities indeed do exist (e.g., large platelets with paucity of α-granules, myelofibrosis, platelet dysfunction) but also important differences, such as red cell abnormalities that are only described for GATA1 and GFI1B defects and the presence of CD34-positive platelets for GFI1B defects.</p><p>In the study herein, we hypothesized that the α-granule defect found for GATA1 macrothrombocytopenia might be due to reduced NBEAL2 expression. We compared platelet morphology and NBEAL2 protein expression using samples from two NBEAL2 and two GATA1-deficient macrothrombocytopenia patients. <italic>In vitro</italic> megakaryopoiesis from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the GATA1 defective patients was studied with a focus on proplatelet formation, α-granule formation and NBEAL2 expression. Finally, The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and GATA1/GATA2 Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing data were used to predict putative enhancer elements upstream of the <italic>NBEAL2</italic> gene. A long-distance (31 kb upstream) region was identified as a potential enhancer that was characterized using reporter and DNA-binding assays.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patient studies</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-1020695">Table 1</xref> contains clinical and laboratory data for two previously described GATA1-<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-1020695">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-1020695">14</xref></sup> and two NBEAL2-deficient patients.

One GPS patient is homozygous for W2480X, that is predicted to result in a non-functional protein without WD40 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1020695">Figure 1A</xref>). The other GPS patient has a homozygous splice variant c.5721−1G&gt;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1020695">Figure 1A</xref>), predicted to result in an early stop codon M1908X that would delete the PH, BEACH and WD40 domains. Indeed, a similar splice variant, c.5720+1G&gt;A, in another GPS patient has been demonstrated to result in M1908X, based on expression studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-1020695">27</xref></sup> The macrothrombocytopenia patients with GATA1 variants D218G<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-1020695">13</xref></sup> and D218Y<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-1020695">6</xref></sup> were previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-1020695">Figure 1A</xref>). Both mutations are located in the N-terminal finger domain, which is required for association with the coactivator friend-of-GATA1 (FOG1) that contributes to the stability of DNA binding to a palindromic GATA recognition sequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-1020695">28</xref></sup> GATA1 D218Y resulted in a severe clinical phenotype with deep macrothrombocytopenia, while patients with GATA1 D218G only have mild macrothrombocytopenia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-1020695">Table 1</xref>). All patients have macrothrombocytopenia, and blood smears and EM studies of their platelets clearly show a gray appearance of large platelets due to a paucity of α-granules. Myelofibrosis was present in the patient with NBEAL2 W2840X and the patient with GATA1 D218Y. Bone marrow studies observed the presence of megakaryocyte emperipolesis in all patients except the patient with the NBEAL2 M1908X variant. The platelet aggregation defect for the patient with the NBEAL2 M1908X variant was similar to the defect found for the patient with GATA1 D218G. The major difference between these cases is that the GPS patients had normal red blood cells, while dyserythropoiesis was clearly present in GATA1 D218G<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-1020695">13</xref></sup> and severe anemia with dyserythropoiesis in GATA1 D218Y.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-1020695">14</xref></sup></p><fig id="f1-1020695" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Variants in NBEAL2 and GATA1 result in macrothrombocytopenia with a paucity of α-granules.

Remarkably, NBEAL2 expression was absent in GATA1 D218Y compared to control MKs at differentiation day 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1020695">Figure 2C</xref>). As integrin β3 levels were also lower for GATA1 D218Y, we also loaded day 8 differentiated MKs from the control, and these cells expressed comparable integrin β3 levels while NBEAL2 was clearly detectable. NBEAL2 expression was also studied at a later time point in MK differentiation (day 13) for GATA D218G, but its expression remained low compared to control MKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-1020695">Figure 2C</xref>).

GATA2 is essential for the maintenance of HSCs and progenitor cells, whereas GATA1 drives the differentiation of HSCs into megakaryopoiesis. GATA1 represses GATA2 transcription, and this involves GATA1-mediated displacement of GATA2 from chromatin, a process that is called a GATA switch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-1020695">47</xref></sup> It is known that GATA switches play an important role in the differentiation of blood stem cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-1020695">48</xref></sup> Such a GATA switch can occur for the GATA building sites in the enhancer of the <italic>NBEAL2</italic> gene; further studies are needed to unravel this exact mechanism as this might identify the precise moment that NBEAL2 is expressed during megakaryopoiesis.</p><p>In conclusion, the study herein provides an explanation for the phenotypic resemblance between NBEAL2 and GATA1 defective macrothrombocytopenia with paucity of α-granules, as GATA1 is important for NBEAL2 expression during megakaryopoiesis <italic>via</italic> a long-distance enhancer.</p></sec>
