<p>Interferon-γ induces cellular and transcriptomic changes in human neural cells associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Maternal immune activation increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Elevated cytokines, such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), in offspring’s brains play a central role. IFN-γ activates an antiviral cellular state, limiting viral entry and replication. Moreover, IFN-γ is implicated in brain development. We tested the hypothesis that IFN-γ signaling contributes to molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Transient IFN-γ treatment of neural progenitors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells increased neurite outgrowth. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) genes were persistently up-regulated through neuronal differentiation—an effect that was mediated by IFN-γ-induced promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies. Critically, IFN-γ-induced neurite outgrowth required both PML and MHCI. We also found evidence that IFN-γ disproportionately altered the expression of genes associated with schizophrenia and autism, suggesting convergence between genetic and environmental risk factors. Together, these data implicate IFN-γ signaling in neurodevelopmental disorder etiology.</p>

<body><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Multiple lines of evidence point to immune activation during fetal development as an important risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Epidemiological studies consistently find an association between maternal infection during pregnancy and increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>). Animal studies have shown that induction of an antiviral immune response during pregnancy using the double-stranded RNA mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C) leads to behavioral abnormalities in offspring that are thought to be relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders. These include repetitive behavior, decreased social interactions, deficits in prepulse inhibition, and altered cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>). In parallel, transcriptomic studies of both ASD and SZ post-mortem brain tissue consistently show enrichment for inflammatory and innate immune genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). Nonetheless, the pathological mechanisms through which transient inflammatory activation increases susceptibility to neurodevelopmental disorders remain unclear.</p><p>A potential mechanistic link between maternal immune activation and neurodevelopmental disorders is the exposure of the developing brain to inflammatory cytokines. Among the inflammatory cytokines up-regulated during maternal immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is of particular interest. It is an activator of innate cellular antiviral signaling and transcription programs whose primary function is to defend the cell against viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). Mid-pregnancy maternal serum IFN-γ is increased during gestation of offspring with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>), and circulatory IFN-γ levels are elevated in neonates subsequently diagnosed with ASD relative to developmental delay controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>). Intriguingly, within the brain, many antiviral IFN-γ signaling targets also play important roles in neuronal development and synaptic activity, independent of microbial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>). More recently, IFN-γ has also been described to play a role in social behavior in rodents through modulation of inhibitory neuronal GABAergic tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>). Thus, it is now emerging that IFN-γ has a physiological role beyond its antiviral and immune actions.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that antiviral activation establishes enduring cellular changes that persist beyond the acute inflammatory response. Exposure to IFN-γ primes cells to induce an enhanced transcriptional response upon restimulation, allowing cells to mount a faster and more effective antiviral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>). Examination of transcriptional priming at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus revealed a critical role for antiviral promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>). MHC class I (MHCI) gene expression has also been shown to be persistently up-regulated in developing neurons following gestational poly(I:C) exposure in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>). In the brain, seemingly independently of their antiviral functions, both PML and MHCI proteins play important roles in many aspects of neuronal development and function, including neurite outgrowth and axon specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>), synaptic specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>), synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>), and cortical lamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>). All of these processes have been shown to be altered following gestational poly(I:C) exposure in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>). Thus, PML nuclear bodies and MHCI proteins may link antiviral inflammatory activation to neuronal abnormalities. However, the impact of this pathway on neurodevelopment following inflammatory activation has never been examined.</p><p>In this study, we explore the hypothesis that IFN-γ-induced antiviral signaling perturbs neurodevelopmental processes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. We used human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to investigate how transient IFN-γ exposure affects developing human neurons. We demonstrate that exposing hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to IFN-γ led to increased neurite outgrowth in hiPSC neurons, similar to a phenotype observed in hiPSC neurons from individuals with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>). RNA sequencing was used to characterize the acute and persistent transcriptomic responses to IFN-γ. We observed that IFN-γ responding genes were enriched for those with genetic association to ASD and SZ. Moreover, these genes overlapped significantly with those differentially expressed in the brains of individuals with these disorders. Genes of the MHCI protein complex were acutely and persistently up-regulated. This was accompanied by an enduring increase in MHCI protein levels and PML body numbers. Critically, both PML and MHCI proteins were required for IFN-γ-dependent effects on neuronal morphology. Together, these findings highlight a potential mechanism through which antiviral signaling could contribute to intrinsic neuronal phenotypes in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>IFN-γ increases neurite outgrowth in a hiPSC model of neurodevelopment</title><p>We and others have previously observed alterations in the morphology of hiPSC neurons derived from individuals with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>). Since inflammatory mechanisms have been implicated in both neural development and neurodevelopmental pathology, we hypothesized that activation of antiviral signaling pathways influences the development of neuronal architecture. To investigate this, we used hiPSC-NPCs from three typically developing male individuals with no history of psychiatric illness [M1, M2, and M3; table S1 and fig. S1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27"><italic>27</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28"><italic>28</italic></xref>)] and treated these cells with IFN-γ (25 ng/ml) daily on days (D) 17 to 21 of differentiation. Subsequently, IFN-γ was excluded from cell culture media, and neuronal differentiation was continued, resulting in post-mitotic hiPSC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and fig. S1). Cells were fixed on D26, D30, D35, and D40 and stained for βIII-tubulin (Tuj1), and high content automated neurite tracing was carried out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). Total neurite length measurements were averaged for each biological replicate for all three hiPSC lines. A repeated measures (RM) two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, pairing untreated and IFN-γ-treated samples from each biological replicate. The main effects of both IFN-γ treatment and days in culture were associated with a significant increase in total neurite length per cell across the time course examined (IFN-γ treatment: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,24</sub> = 17.02, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0004; days in culture: <italic>F</italic><sub>3,24</sub> = 12.07, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). After demonstrating the effect of IFN-γ on neurite outgrowth across the entire dataset, we used Sidak’s multiple comparison adjustment to compare individual time points. This revealed a significant increase in total neurite length in IFN-γ-treated lines at D30 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.010). We did not observe a significant interaction between IFN-γ treatment and time in culture (interaction of treatment × time point: <italic>F</italic><sub>3,24</sub> = 0.60, <italic>P</italic> = 0.62), indicating that both factors influence neurite outgrowth independently of each other.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>IFN-γ treatment of NPCs leads to enhanced neurite outgrowth in post-mitotic neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the experimental timeline of iPSC differentiation and IFN-γ treatment strategy.

The overlapping up-regulated genes at both time points in both disorders were enriched for GO terms including IFN-γ-mediated signaling pathway and “defense response to virus” (table S4).

As these findings are from adult post-mortem brain tissue, it is unclear whether this signaling pathway is altered from an early developmental time point in ASD brains. To determine whether <italic>PML</italic> and <italic>HLA-B</italic> are similarly increased in hiPSC-derived neural cells in vitro, we differentiated hiPSCs from three male individuals diagnosed with ASD into NPCs, alongside the three control cell lines, as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and fig.

All three individuals (ASD_M1_08, 004_ASM_02, and 010_ASM_02) had a primary diagnosis of ASD (table S1). These ASD cases were considered to be idiopathic as no ASD-associated copy number variations or single-nucleotide variants were detected in these individuals. Furthermore, no serological complications were reported during gestation. We used qPCR to examine relative expression of <italic>PML</italic>, <italic>HLA-B</italic>, and <italic>B2M</italic> in NPCs from the three ASD and three control lines.

We further examined the expression of PML bodies in NPCs from the same ASD and control cell lines using immunocytochemistry (fig. S6D). We observed a significant increase in PML bodies per nucleus in the ASD NPCs relative to the control NPCs (fig. S6E).

Our qPCR experiments demonstrated that IFN-γ-dependent up-regulation of <italic>HLA-B</italic> and <italic>HLA-C</italic> was similarly blocked by As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. However, as <italic>HLA-B</italic> demonstrated the greatest up-regulation in pretreated neurons, we focused on this MHCI gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). We used a probe specific to the pre-spliced <italic>HLA-B</italic> RNA transcript to tag the site of transcription. IFN-γ treatment led to a marked increase in <italic>HLA-B</italic> pre-mRNA (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, I to K</xref>).

Furthermore, costaining for PML and <italic>HLA-B</italic> pre-mRNA revealed a positive correlation in the IFN-γ-treated condition.

A relationship between PML bodies and IFN-γ-induced <italic>HLA-B</italic> transcription is thus strongly supported.</p><p>If PML bodies directly regulate MHCI gene expression, then we would predict them to be in close proximity to the site of transcription. To investigate this spatial relationship, we carried out RNA FISH using the probe described above, specific to pre-spliced <italic>HLA-B</italic> RNA transcript. Because splicing is highly localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>), we reasoned that the site of the pre-spliced transcript could be used as a proxy for the location of transcription. Costaining for PML and <italic>HLA-B</italic> pre-mRNA revealed that, following IFN-γ treatment, <italic>HLA-B</italic> spots were frequently located immediately adjacent to, or overlapping with, PML bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4L</xref>). To investigate this further, we measured the density of PML bodies (spots per micrometer) within <italic>HLA-B</italic> spots or <italic>HLA-B</italic> spot perimeters (see Materials and Methods for full definitions) and compared this to the density of PML bodies across the nucleus as a whole in IFN-γ-treated NPCs and neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, M and N</xref>, and fig S7, C and D). In IFN-γ-treated NPCs, the increased density of PML bodies in <italic>HLA-B</italic> pre-mRNA spot perimeters did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.09). However, in IFN-γ-treated neurons, a significantly higher density of PML bodies was observed in the <italic>HLA-B</italic> pre-mRNA spots (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and spot perimeters (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0007) than the nucleus as a whole, indicating a positive spatial association. By contrast, in untreated NPCs and neurons, PML spots were never observed to overlap with <italic>HLA-B</italic> pre-mRNA spots or spot perimeters (fig. S7, C and D). To confirm the existence of a nonrandom spatial relationship, we carried out random shuffle nearest neighbor analysis on IFN-γ-treated NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><italic>40</italic></xref>). Actual distances between <italic>HLA-B</italic> spots and PML bodies were observed to be significantly shorter than simulated distances following randomization (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), confirming a positive spatial relationship (fig.

We found MHCI proteins to be present in the neurites, growth cones, and cell bodies of untreated neurons. We then examined the effects of IFN-γ- and As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-induced PML disruption on MHCI abundance in neurites and growth cones in neurons from three control hiPSC lines, following the experimental outline schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E(ii)</xref>.

To achieve this, we took advantage of the requirement for the B2M protein for cell surface expression of MHCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"><italic>41</italic></xref>). First, we sought to demonstrate that IFN-γ-induced expression of B2M protein was required for MHCI expression in our NPCs. We observed a significant increase in both B2M and MHCI expression following exposure to IFN-γ (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0011; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6, A to C</xref>). We then knocked down <italic>B2M</italic> in NPCs using a lentiviral vector containing <italic>B2M</italic>-targeting short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in the three control hiPSC lines.

Next, we used a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line, MS3 HLA null, in which the <italic>B2M</italic> gene has been excised using a CRISPR-Cas9 nickase approach. This results in cells lacking cell surface MHCI. We used the MS3 HLA null hESC line to further investigate whether MHCI was required for IFN-γ-induced neurite outgrowth. Five independently cultured biological replicates of MS3 HLA null hESCs were differentiated using the same neural induction protocol used with our neurons and, subsequently, treated with IFN-γ (25 ng/ml) on D17 to D21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and fig.

While the molecular mechanisms that underlie this association are unclear, inflammatory cytokines are thought to play a central role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>). In this study, we used hiPSCs to examine the impact of IFN-γ exposure during human neuronal differentiation. Intriguingly, we observed morphological and transcriptomic changes previously associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. We propose a model where IFN-γ promotes neurite outgrowth by a PML-dependent long-lasting up-regulation of MHCI proteins at neuronal growth cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6I</xref>). To our knowledge, the mechanisms through which transient developmental immune activation cause lasting alterations in neuronal phenotypes have not previously been examined in a human system.</p><p>IFN-γ exposure at the neural progenitor stage increased neurite outgrowth in human neurons. This was measurable as both neurite length and branch number. Our observation is consistent with studies of mouse NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42"><italic>42</italic></xref>) and a human cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43"><italic>43</italic></xref>). This study is the first report of this effect in human neurons. Neurite outgrowth is a fundamental stage of neuronal maturation, where neural progenitors extend processes, which can later become axons or dendrites. However, an increase in neurite outgrowth at an early stage of development may not result in a more extensive dendritic or axonal arbor in mature neurons. Nevertheless, alterations in neurite outgrowth in the developing brain would be predicted to have implications for neuronal connectivity and ultimately brain function. Increased neurite outgrowth has been found in hiPSC neurons derived from individuals with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>). Abnormalities in neurite outgrowth have also been observed in hiPSC neurons from patients with SZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44"><italic>44</italic></xref>). Note that the extent to which cultured hiPSC neurons faithfully recapitulate neuronal morphogenesis in the developing brain is unknown. Nonetheless, post-mortem studies of individuals diagnosed with ASD and SZ have pointed to abnormal cortical neuron organization, dendritic arborization, and dendritic spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45"><italic>45</italic></xref>). Furthermore, the macrocephaly present in some ASD cases has been attributed to increased dendrite number and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46"><italic>46</italic></xref>). Offspring of pregnant dams exposed to a single gestational dose of poly(I:C) also display altered cortical development, with perturbed dendritic and synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>). Further evidence comes from large-scale genetic studies of ASD and SZ, which consistently identify genes encoding synaptic proteins and those involved in neuronal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33"><italic>33</italic></xref>). Thus, although a causative role has not been established, these reports suggest that disturbed neurite outgrowth may be relevant to the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><p>A key question we sought to address was how transient immune activation could have a lasting impact on neuronal phenotype. PML nuclear bodies are chromatin-associated organelles that play an important role in viral infection response and transcriptional regulation. Moreover, PML is involved in neuronal development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>). We found that IFN-γ established a long-lasting increase in PML body number during neuronal differentiation. PML bodies were spatially associated with the site of <italic>HLA-B</italic> transcription, and their disruption prevented IFN-γ-induced MHCI transcription. Furthermore, PML body disruption blocked IFN-γ-induced neurite outgrowth. While this phenomenon has not been examined before in human neurons, IFN-induced transcriptional memory has previously been observed in human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>), mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and mouse bone marrow–derived macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>). In the latter study, IFN-γ pretreated cells were shown to mount an enhanced antiviral transcriptional response, conferring resistance to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>). PML nuclear bodies were shown to mediate IFN-γ-dependent transcriptional memory for the Major Histocompatibility Complex, Class II, DR Alpha (MHCII DRA) gene in human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>). Building on these findings, our data indicate that IFN-γ exposure in NPCs establishes PML-dependent transcriptional memory in MHCI genes that persists through human neuronal differentiation. Both <italic>PML</italic> and <italic>HLA-B</italic> genes are up-regulated in the post-mortem ASD brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). Consistent with this, we also observed increased expression of <italic>PML</italic> and <italic>HLA-B</italic> in NPCs from a small collection of ASD-iPSCs. This indicates that this pathway may be up-regulated during development in ASD brains. Whether altered neurite outgrowth or neuronal/synaptic morphology in ASD brains is associated with elevated expression levels of PML or HLA-B requires further and detailed investigation. Moreover, these findings will need to be confirmed using a larger cohort of ASD-iPSCs generated from both syndromic and idiopathic individuals to understand if these findings could potentially be generalized to a wider population.</p><p>Genes of the MHCI complex were among the top differentially expressed in both neural progenitors and neurons following IFN-γ exposure. They exhibited evidence of transcriptional memory, where expression remained elevated in neurons that received a single IFN-γ treatment at the NPC stage. Furthermore, these genes had a heightened response to neuronal treatment when primed at the progenitor stage. Using super-resolution microscopy, we found that MHCI proteins were enriched in neuronal growth cones. Disruption of PML body formation prevented both MHCI enrichment in growth cones and IFN-γ-induced neurite outgrowth. Moreover, IFN-γ did not elicit the same neurite outgrowth phenotype in cells devoid of MHCI at the cell surface. These data indicate that MHCI proteins are involved in IFN-γ-induced neurite outgrowth. The role that MHCI proteins play in the cellular antiviral response is well established; they present antigens at the cell surface for detection by T cells. In addition, evidence is mounting for nonimmune functions in the central nervous system. MHCI proteins have been found in neurons of the developing mammalian brain, where they have been shown to localize to neurites and neuronal growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><italic>30</italic></xref>). They have been implicated in neurite outgrowth in mouse primary hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>) and synaptic stability in the mouse visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"><italic>41</italic></xref>). Intriguingly, gestational poly(I:C) also leads to an enduring increase in MHCI protein in mouse cortical neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>). Note that the MHC locus has shown the strongest association with SZ in multiple GWASs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47"><italic>47</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48"><italic>48</italic></xref>); however, strong linkage disequilibrium in the region has made identifying the causal variants a challenge. Combined with the existing literature, our results indicate that MHCI proteins are involved in IFN-γ-induced neurite outgrowth. Further research is required to determine the mechanisms through which MHCI proteins alter growth cone dynamics.</p><p>A growing body of evidence indicates that genetic variants associated with SZ and ASD manifest their risk during critical periods of early brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49"><italic>49</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50"><italic>50</italic></xref>). Alterations in the expression and function of risk genes disturb fundamental processes involved in neuronal differentiation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33"><italic>33</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51"><italic>51</italic></xref>). In this study, we found evidence that IFN-γ exposure during human neuronal differentiation disproportionately altered the expression of genes associated with these disorders. More specifically, we found that common variants associated with SZ by GWAS significantly overlapped with genes that were down-regulated by both NPCs and neurons in response to IFN-γ. The association between IFN-γ signaling and genetic risk for SZ was supported by additional analyses of risk genes identified by the PsychENCODE consortium, which revealed enrichment in both genes down-regulated by NPCs and up-regulated by neurons in response to IFN-γ. In total, 104 of the PsychENCODE SZ risk genes responded to IFN-γ in our study. Many high profile candidates were among them, including <italic>FOXP1</italic>, <italic>ATXN7</italic>, <italic>TSNARE1</italic>, and <italic>ZNF804A</italic>. This convergence of genetic and environmental risk factors may speak to the association between maternal immune activation and SZ.</p><p>The extent to which the IFN-γ response overlaps with genetic risk for ASD is less clear. A similar association between IFN-γ-responding genes and common ASD risk variants was not found. This could be due to the fact that GWAS studies have uncovered considerably fewer genome-wide significant loci for ASD to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51"><italic>51</italic></xref>). As common variants are thought to represent less than 20% of genetic risk for ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52"><italic>52</italic></xref>), we also carried out overlap analysis with ASD risk genes from the SFARI database that includes rare single gene mutations. We found enrichment of SFARI category 1 to 4 genes in the gene set down-regulated by NPCs in response to IFN-γ. However, this result was not supported by analysis with the shorter high confidence category 1 to 2 gene list. This inconsistency could be explained either by the reduced sample size of the shorter list reducing statistical power or by the inclusion of false positives in the broader gene list. Regardless, a total of 66 SFARI-defined ASD risk genes responded to IFN-γ in NPCs and neurons. High confidence genes such as <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>TCF4</italic>, <italic>SHANK2</italic>, <italic>NLGN3</italic>, and <italic>NRXN3</italic> were among them. <italic>PTEN</italic> was down-regulated in neurons after IFN-γ exposure in our study, consistent with the reduced activity caused by ASD-associated variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53"><italic>53</italic></xref>). This example illustrates how IFN-γ can influence risk genes in a similar manner to disease-associated genetic variants. It is not clear whether IFN-γ-responding risk genes are involved in the neurite phenotype we describe above. However, similar dysregulation in response to developmental inflammatory stimuli in vivo would be expected to have implications for brain development.</p><p>We also observed a significant overlap between genes that were differentially expressed in response to IFN-γ in our model with those found to be dysregulated in post-mortem ASD and SZ brains. The overlapping genes were enriched for genes of the IFN-γ signaling pathway and antiviral response genes. The up-regulation of immune and inflammatory factors is a consistent finding of transcriptomic studies of ASD and SZ brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). While this signal has typically been assumed to be driven by microglia, our results suggest that it may also have a neuronal origin. This observation provides validity to our model as IFN-γ alters gene expression in a manner consistent with the dysregulation observed in the brains of patients with these disorders.</p><p>In summary, we find that antiviral immune activation in human NPCs induces morphological and transcriptomic changes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. NPCs are thought to be central to the etiology of these conditions. Their disruption can have lasting implications for neuronal migration, maturation, and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54"><italic>54</italic></xref>). Recently, Schafer and colleagues observed that hiPSC neurons from individuals with ASD displayed increased neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>). They demonstrated that this phenotype was mediated by aberrant gene expression in NPCs and could be prevented by bypassing the NPC stage through direct conversion to neurons. In our study, we find that pathological priming of NPCs with IFN-γ has a similar effect. Thus, perturbation of normal gene expression in NPCs, whether genetic or environmental, leads to altered neuronal maturation. The degree to which this phenotype contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders remains an open question. Further investigation is required to determine whether the IFN-γ-responding SZ and ASD risk genes contribute to the neurite outgrowth phenotype and whether PML or MHCI mediates perturbed risk gene expression. Nonetheless, our results highlight IFN-γ signaling as a plausible link between early immune activation and neurodevelopmental disorders. This work provides a framework for future study of immune activation and gene-environment interaction in human neural development.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study design</title><p>The initial objective was to determine whether IFN-γ treatment of hiPSC-NPCs followed by continued differentiation into post-mitotic neurons led to recapitulation of morphological characteristics of hiPSC neurons derived from individuals with ASD.

For neuralization, StemFlex was replaced with a 1:1 mixture of N2- and B27-supplemented medium, made following the manufacturer’s guidelines (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 17502048 and 17504044) to which SMAD and Wnt inhibitors (10 μM SB431542, 1 μM dorsomorphin, and 2 μM XAV939) were added (hereafter known as N2:B27+++). This was replaced daily until D7, when cells were dissociated using Accutase (Life Technologies, A11105-01) and replated at a 1:1 ratio into N2:B27+++ supplemented with Rock inhibitor (Merck, Y27632) to prevent apoptosis. From D8 onward, SMAD and WNT inhibitors were excluded from medium, and cells received daily N2:B27 medium alone. Cells were dissociated and replated on D12, D16, D19, and D21. From D9, a uniform sheet of SOX2/NESTIN-positive cells was observed (fig. S1). From D17, cells were observed to self-organize into neuroepithelial rosettes, expressing apical polarity marker PKCλ with mitotic, PH3-expressing cells located at the apical pole (fig. S1). On D21, cells were plated into poly-<sc>d</sc>-lysine–coated (5 μg/ml; Merck, P6407) and laminin–coated (20 μg/ml; Merck, L2020) plates, in B27 media, supplemented with Notch inhibitor, DAPT (<italic>N</italic>-[<italic>N</italic>-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-<sc>l</sc>-alanyl]-<italic>S</italic>-phenylglycine <italic>t</italic>-butyl ester), to induce cell cycle exit. From this point onward, βIII-tubulin expression and neurite extension were observed (fig. S1). Cells received IFN-γ (Abcam, AB9659) at a concentration of 25 ng/ml on D17 to D21 and D29 to D30 and As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Trisenox, Teva) at a concentration of 1 μM on D16 to D21, as specified.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Embryonic stem cell generation and neuralization and treatment</title><p>The hESC line MasterShef 3 HLA null was cultured as previously described for hiPSCs but using laminin LN-521–coated (5 μg/ml; BioLamina, Sweden) plates. MasterShef 3 HLA null was created using CRISPR-Cas9 nickase technology. Two plasmids containing a mutant Cas9D10A nickase plus different reporter genes green fluorescent protein (GFP) and dTomato [pSpCas9n(BB)_2A_GFP, pSpcas9n(BB)_2A_dTomato] with different guide RNAs targeting the β-2-microglobulin (<italic>B2M</italic>) gene were transfected into the parent line, followed by single cell sorting 4 days later for GFP/dTomato double-positive cells. Single cells were seeded onto LN-521–coated 96-well plates, and colonies were picked after 7 to 10 days. Colonies were screened by PCR for B2M expression, by flow cytometry for MHCI knockout, by T7 mismatch cleavage assay, and, lastly, by Sanger sequencing of chosen clones. hESCs were expanded and differentiated using identical protocols to hiPSC lines described above.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>B2M</italic> knockdown</title><p><italic>B2M</italic> was knocked down using lentiviral particles containing <italic>B2M</italic>-targeting shRNA (OriGene, TL314543V, Virus A). Nontargeting scrambled shRNA from the same kit was used as a control. Cells were exposed to the shRNA on D14 for 18 hours at a multiplicity of infection of 8. NPCs were treated with IFN-γ on D17 for 24 hours and fixed on D18. These experiments were carried out in biological triplicate for all three control hiPSC lines.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>RNA sequencing</title><p>RNA samples were collected in TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596026), and RNA extraction was performed using an RNEasy kit (Qiagen, 74104). Each experimental condition was repeated in the three control hiPSC lines (table S1). Libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, RS-122-2001) by the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000, resulting in an average of 38 million 75–base pair paired-end reads per sample. FASTQ files were processed with Trimmomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57"><italic>57</italic></xref>) to quality trim the reads and remove adapters. The reads were then mapped to the human (GRCh38) reference genome using STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58"><italic>58</italic></xref>). Count matrices were prepared using GenomicAlignments on Bioconductor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59"><italic>59</italic></xref>), and differential gene expression analysis was carried out using the default Wald test in DESeq2 version 1.12.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><italic>29</italic></xref>). All samples were run together using the design formula <monospace>~ cell line + treatment condition</monospace> before using the <monospace>contrast</monospace> argument to extract the comparisons of interest. <italic>P</italic> values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method, and the threshold for differential expression was a BH-adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.

DEG lists were tested for enrichment relative to a background of all genes awarded an adjusted <italic>P</italic> value for that comparison by DESeq2. The threshold for enrichment was a BH-adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p><p>MAGMA 1.07b was used to test whether genes differentially expressed upon IFN-γ treatment were enriched for genes implicated in SZ or ASD according to GWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><italic>31</italic></xref>). GWAS summary statistics were downloaded from the Walters Group Data Repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://walters.psycm.cf.ac.uk/">https://walters.psycm.cf.ac.uk/</ext-link>) and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/download-results/">www.med.unc.edu/pgc/download-results/</ext-link>). Variants corresponding to the extended MHC region (assembly: GRCh37; location: chr6, 25,000,000–34,000,000) were excluded due to the complex linkage disequilibrium structure of this locus. MAGMA was used to identify disease-associated genes as part of a gene-level enrichment analysis step that generates gene-level association statistic adjusted for gene size, variant density, and linkage disequilibrium using the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 European reference panel. Subsequently, MAGMA was used to test whether genes differentially expressed in NPCs or neurons in association with IFN-γ treatment (split into up- and down-regulated sets) were enriched with disease-associated genes identified in the gene-level enrichment analysis. Gene-set enrichment <italic>P</italic> values calculated in MAGMA were corrected for eight tests (two time points, two directions of effect, and two psychiatric disorders tested) using the BH method.</p><p>Additional gene-set enrichment analysis was carried out for SZ risk genes defined by the PsychENCODE Consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33"><italic>33</italic></xref>) and ASD risk genes from the SFARI database (categories 1 to 4 and categories 1 and 2, 15 January 2019 release) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34"><italic>34</italic></xref>). None of the risk genes included in these analyses fell in the MHC region. Enrichment was tested using a two tailed Fisher’s exact test in R to test whether the proportion of risk genes in the differentially expressed set is more or less than expected by chance. Thus, the two variables analyzed were differential expression status (differentially expressed versus not differentially expressed) and risk gene status (risk gene versus not risk gene). Analysis was limited to genes considered expressed in our samples according to the internal filtering criteria of DESeq2. Up- and down-regulated genes were separately tested. <italic>P</italic> values were corrected for 12 tests (two time points, two directions of effect, and three gene lists tested) using the BH method.</p><p>Overlap analysis was carried out between IFN-γ-responding genes detected in this study, and genes found to be DEGs from post-mortem brains of patients with ASD and SZ. The post-mortem data were from the PsychENCODE cross-disorder study, which used 559 SZ, 51 ASD, and 936 control post-mortem frontal and temporal cerebral cortex samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). Enrichment was tested using a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test in R. Up- and down-regulated genes were separately tested. <italic>P</italic> values were corrected for eight tests (two time points, two directions of effect, and two psychiatric disorders tested) using the BH method.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (20 min at room temperature), washed three times in PBS, and permeabilized and blocked using a solution of 4% donkey serum and 0.1% Triton in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature (RT). Primary antibodies (table S5) were diluted in blocking solution and applied overnight at 4°C. Following this, cells were washed three times in PBS, and appropriate Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (A-21202, A-21203, A-21206, and A-21207, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were applied in blocking solution for 2 hours at RT. Cells were then washed three times in PBS and counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Merck, B2261). F-actin was detected using Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated phalloidin (ActinGreen 488 ReadyProbes, Thermo Fisher Scientific, R37110) applied in PBS for 30 min following secondary antibody incubation and three washes in PBS.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>High content cellomic screening</title><p>For the initial neuronal morphology experiments, high content screening was performed using CellInsight (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated by HCS Studio Software for automated measurement of neurite outgrowth. Cells were plated at a density of 9000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in poly-<sc>d</sc>-lysine– and laminin-coated 96 well Nunclon plates (Merck, P8366), stained for βIII-tubulin (Tuj1) for detection of both mature and immature neurites and counterstained with Hoechst 33342 to detect nuclei. The analysis pipeline involved initial detection of Hoechst-stained nuclei, detection of cell bodies using nuclei as seeds, and then detection of neurites originating from cell bodies. The following features were assessed for comprehensive examination of neuronal morphology: neurite total length per cell, neurite average length per cell, neurite count per cell, and branch point count per cell. Averages were then taken for each condition within biological replicates. Identical detection parameters were used between conditions to allow direct comparison and paired statistical analysis. Analogous analysis was carried out for the MS3 HLA null hESC experiment with the Opera Phenix high content screening system (PerkinElmer). Plating and staining were carried out as described above. The Opera Phenix was also used to quantify B2M and MHCI protein levels for the <italic>B2M</italic> shRNAi-mediated knockdown and MS3 HLA null hESC knockout studies. In both cases, cells were fixed and stained immediately after IFN-γ treatment at D18. Protein expression was measured as average cellular intensity normalized to no-primary controls.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Quantitative PCR</title><p>RNA samples were collected in TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596026), and RNA extraction was performed using an RNEasy kit (Qiagen, 74104). DNA digest was performed using a TURBO DNA-free kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM1907) to remove residual genomic DNA from samples. Reverse transcription to generate complementary DNA was performed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen, 18080-044). qPCR was performed using EvaGreen Hot FirePol qPCR Mix Plus (Solis Biodyne, 08-24-00001) in a Bio-Rad Chromo4 PCR detection system. qPCR primer sequences can be found in table S6. Gene expression fold changes between conditions were calculated using the comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>RNA FISH</title><p>RNA FISH was carried out using an RNAScope double Z probe targeting pre-splicing <italic>HLA-B</italic> RNA (ACD, probe named Hs-HLAB-intron). Hybridization and signal amplification were carried out using an RNAScope 2.5 HD Detection Reagent kit (ACD, 322350), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were grown in eight-well chamber slides (Merck, C7057), fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 30 min at RT, washed in PBS, and incubated with the probe for 2 hours at 40°C. Slides were washed, and signal was amplified through a six-step amplification process, followed by signal detection with a Fast-red chromogen label.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Microscopy and image analysis</title><p>Confocal images were taken with a Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope using 405/488/594-nm lasers and a 63× [numerical aperture (NA), 1.4] oil immersion lens (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), operated through Leica Application Suite Advanced Software (v.2.7.3). Super-resolution images were taken using a Visitech-iSIM module coupled to a Nikon Ti-E microscope with a Nikon 100× 1.49 NA total internal reflection fluorescence oil immersion lens (Nikon, Japan) using 405/488/561-nm lasers. Super-resolution images were deconvolved to increase contrast and resolution using a Richardson-Lucy algorithm specific to the iSIM mode of imaging using the supplied NIS-Elements Advanced Research software (Nikon, Japan, v.4.6). Identical laser gain and offset settings were used within each biological replicate to enable direct comparison between conditions.</p><p>Semi-automated image analysis was performed using ImageJ software. Gaussian filters were applied to PML and RNAScope images to reduce noise, and binary images were generated. Nuclei were used as boundaries within which PML and RNAScope spots were counted. Identical processing parameters were applied across conditions to allow paired or grouped statistical analysis. Numbers of PML bodies per micromolar squared were measured within RNAScope spots, within RNAScope spot perimeter regions, and within whole nuclei. RNAScope spot perimeter regions were defined as detected spot perimeters ±0.3 μm, generating a ring-shaped region of interest.</p><p>DiAna, an ImageJ plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><italic>40</italic></xref>), was used to assess the spatial distribution of objects. Binary images were generated from confocal images of PML and RNAScope staining. Center-to-center distances were measured from PML spots to RNAScope spots. Binary images of nuclei were used as a bounding box (mask), and randomized shuffle of objects in both channels was carried out 100 times. Center-to-center distances in shuffled images were computed, and cumulated frequency distributions were calculated for real and simulated distances. This was repeated for nine images across three cell lines. Real and simulated distances within a given image were matched by percentile for paired analysis.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Data collection and statistics</title><p>Details of the statistical tests relating to differential expression and gene set enrichment are described in the “RNA sequencing” section above. All experiments were carried out using three independent iPSC lines derived from three unrelated male control or ASD-diagnosed individuals. Where possible, multiple biological replicates of each line were used (as specified in figure legends). Paired sample tests were used for data obtained from matched treated and untreated pairs of samples from the same cell line and biological replicate. Biological replicates were cultured together until 1 to 2 days before IFN-γ, As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, or combined treatment, whereupon they were passaged into separate wells. All datasets were tested for normal distribution using the D’Agostino and Pearson test before further statistical analysis. Statistical tests used for analysis of each dataset and “<italic>n</italic>” numbers of repeats are specified in the figure legends. Statistical tests used included <italic>t</italic> tests, Mann-Whitney tests, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and one-way and two-way ANOVAs with Tukey and Sidak’s multiple comparison adjustment methods, respectively. Statistical tests used for analysis of each dataset are specified in the figure legends. RM ANOVAs were used for comparison of data from the same cell line and biological replicate. The <italic>t</italic> test and Mann-Whitney test were used for comparison of two groups where data were unpaired and normally or non-normally distributed, respectively. Paired <italic>t</italic> tests and Wilcoxon matched-pairs test were used for comparison of two groups, where data were paired and normally or non-normally distributed, respectively. Normal or RM one-way ANOVAs were performed on datasets with more than two groups, where samples were ungrouped or grouped, respectively. Normal or RM two-way ANOVAs were performed on datasets with two input variables, where samples were ungrouped or grouped, respectively. Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism 8.</p></sec></sec>
