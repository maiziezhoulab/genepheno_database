<p id="P3"><italic>De novo</italic> mutations (DNMs) arising on the paternal chromosome make the largest known contribution to autism risk, and correlate with paternal age at the time of conception. The recurrence risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is substantial, leading many families to decline future pregnancies, but the potential impact of assessing parental gonadal mosaicism has not been considered. We measured sperm mosaicism using deep whole genome sequencing, both for variants present in an offspring and evident only in father’s sperm, and identified single nucleotide, structural, and short tandem repeat variants. We found that mosaicism quantification can stratify ASD recurrence risk due to DNMs into the vast majority with near 0% recurrence and a small fraction with a substantially higher and quantifiable risk, and we identify novel mosaic variants at risk for transmission to a future offspring. Thus, this suggests that genetic counseling would benefit from the addition of sperm mosaicism assessment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P4">Clinicians are facing an ever increasing incidence of ASD in the population, without effective strategies to prevent disease or counsel families. Recent studies have identified gene-damaging DNMs in at least 10– 30% of simplex ASD cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, along with the realization that the number of DNMs increase as a function of paternal age at the time of conception, doubling in DNM number in an offspring every 16.5 years of father’s age at the time of conception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. A DNM, defined as a genetic variant present in an offspring but not detectable in either parent, can have any of several different origins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. While classically considered to occur in the fertilized egg at the one-cell stage, most probably occur either post-zygotically in the offspring, or in a parent, either in the gonads or broadly in a mosaic pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. DNMs that occur during embryogenesis of a parent cause mosaicism in the soma, the gonads, or both, and remain throughout life, yet may be undetectable or barely detectable in blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Parental age is the single largest risk factor for the number of DNMs in a child, with a doubling in DNM number in an offspring every 16.5 years of father’s age at the time of conception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. However, the balance of gonadal-specific compared to broadly distributed DNMs in the father has not been carefully assessed, and thus the role of gonadal mosaicism on DNM recurrence risk remains uncertain.</p>
<p id="P5">Knowledge of the rates and mechanisms by which gonadal mutations arise has been advanced through assessment of multiple transmissions of DNMs within families, where approximately 1.3% of DNMs are shared by siblings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Although only 3.8% of offspring DNMs are detectably mosaic in parental blood, this increases to 57.2% if shared by two or more offspring <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Counterintuitively, DNM recurrence risk decreases by 1.8–2.3% per year of parent age, due to an increase in aging-associated DNMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, thereby decreasing the relative contribution of parental mosaic variants to mutation burden.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Sperm sequencing allows stratification of variants into low and high recurrence risk</title>
<p id="P6">We recruited eight families from our autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> where each father agreed to submit a sperm sample for sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Employing 30× whole genome sequencing (WGS) from blood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, we defined 912 <italic>de novo</italic> single nucleotide variants (dSNVs) in the 14 offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, Methods). We then isolated sperm from the ejaculates and performed 200× WGS on paternal blood and sperm cells to determine which dSNVs were detectable in sperm based on three or more mutant reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig.1</xref>, Methods). We found 23 (2.5%) <italic>de novo</italic> single nucleotide variants (dSNVs) were also detected in paternal blood or sperm, leaving 889 (97.5%) dSNVs undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). Orthogonal validation of a subset with ultra-deep target amplicon sequencing (TAS) showed ~83% validation rate, 15/18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">4</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). All 3 non-validated variants were at allelic fractions (AFs) below 3% and located within repetitive elements (SINE or LINE).</p>
<p id="P7">Using the ratio of mutant to reference reads in blood and sperm, we defined four dSNV classes: Sperm Detectable Only (SDO); Sperm Detectable Enriched (SDE) for which the AF was &gt;3-fold higher in sperm than in blood; Sperm Blood Equal (SBE, enrichment &lt;3-fold); and Blood Detectable Only (BDO) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Of the 23 variants, 34.8% were SDO, 30.4% were SDE, 26.1% were SBE, and 8.7% were BDO. Nanopore long read sequencing of the children allowed phasing of 501 of the 912 dSNVs to the paternal haplotype. Of the 23 mosaic variants, 20 resided on the paternal chromosome (40% as SDO, 35.0% as SDE, 25.0% as SBE, and none were BDO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Thus, assessment of blood underestimates paternal gonadal mosaicism (PGM) for most dSNVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Further, most dSNVs are not present in paternal sperm at this sensitivity level, and thus have little measurable chance to recur.</p>
<p id="P8">The PGM burden was roughly equally distributed among the eight families (0–5 PGM variants/male), with AFs varying between 17% to the lower detection limit of 1.3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Neither number of mosaic variants nor their AF correlated with paternal age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). We observed a mutational signature for PGM variants consistent with a developmental origin, not observed for the non PGM DNMs (e.g. relative decrease in T&gt;C variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). While PGM variants above 7% AF were often also detectable in blood (10/11 SBE or SDE), variants below this level were typically restricted to sperm (7/12 SDO). Together, these data are consistent with an origin of PGM during embryonic development of the father, with those occurring earlier showing broader tissue distributions and higher AFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.We next assessed the potential of sperm/blood sequencing to measure PGM for <italic>de novo</italic> structural variants (dSVs) and <italic>de novo</italic> short tandem repeats (dSTRΔs) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). Among the eight families, F01 had two <italic>de novo</italic> deletions (dDels) and F06 had one <italic>de novo</italic> duplication (dDup) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). One of these variants was detectably mosaic in paternal sperm with an AF of 2–6% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">d</xref>). Among the eight families we identified 126 different dSTRΔs; 15 (11.9%) were mosaic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">j</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5e</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 5</xref>). Because 12 of 15 variants were SDO or SDE, recurrence risk assessment from blood only would be erroneous for 80%.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>PGM extends to ASD pathogenic variants</title>
<p id="P9">We next assessed whether clinically significant DNMs could be detected in parental sperm, which could impact clinical decision-making. We assessed a cohort of 14 families in which an offspring had ASD attributed to a dSNV or 1 basepair dDel based upon ACMG guidelines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Text</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). Using ddPCR, three of 14 (21.4%) DNMs were detected as mosaic in sperm, with AFs of 14.47% (F09), 0.56% (F10), and 8.09% (F13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 3</xref>). We were successful in phasing the 14.47% and the 0.56% AF variants to the paternal haplotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">6</xref>). Three variants phased to the maternal haplotype posed no risk of PGM; seven variants could not be phased, including the 8.09% AF variant. The F13 variant was absent in paternal blood (SDO), and the F09 variant was substantially reduced (SDE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">c</xref>). These results, while representing a small number of DNMs, suggest that a substantial fraction of paternally phased as well as unphased disease-related DNMs are detectable as PGM, and thus recurrence risk can be estimated directly.</p>
<p id="P10">Two variants showed sperm AF that predict substantially elevated recurrence above the basal 1% risk in families (F09 at 14.47% AF and F13 at 8.09% AF). While F13 had a single child, F09, with a c.1007+1G&gt;A known pathogenic variant in <italic>GRIN2A</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), had two older siblings lacking criteria for ASD, but deeper questioning revealed that both siblings showed neurodevelopmental abnormalities without a known cause (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The middle child showed ADHD and speech impairment, and the oldest child had ADHD and seizures, all consistent with <italic>GRIN2A</italic> haploinsufficiency. We collected DNA samples from the whole family and found that the <italic>GRIN2A</italic> c.1007+1G&gt;A variant was heterozygous in all three children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6e</xref>). Thus, the mosaic variant in father’s sperm at 14.47% was transmitted to all three offspring, an unlikely but confirmed event, resulting in pleiotropic clinical features.</p>
<p id="P11">In our larger ASD cohort five families had dSVs detected with standard WGS that were considered as risk alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Text</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. These included the <italic>de novo</italic> 22q12.3 dDel in F01 and the 1p36.32 dDup in F06 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), as well as F18 with a 7q11.23 dDup and a 16p13.11 dDel, F19 with a 15q13.1-q13.3 dDel and F20 with a 10q21.3-q22.1 dDup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Several of the CNVs (e.g. 15q13.1-q13.3) were flanked by directly oriented segmental duplications, suggesting that they may have arisen during meiosis through nonallelic homologous recombination (NHR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. A meiotic origin of these variants would preclude any possibility of mosaicism; however, as NHR may also occur during mitosis, these were still included for this analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P12">We phased all of these variants and found that all except the 7q11.23 dDup phased to the paternal haplotype. Probe sets were designed to interrogate these variants from sperm using PCR and ddPCR copy number assessment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 7</xref>). These assays confirmed the presence of the dSV in all tested probands, but did not reveal sperm mosaicism in any additional cases beyond F01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">i</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig.7e</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">h</xref>). The 22q12.3 variant in F01 was mosaic in father’s sperm sample based upon the presence of a junction fragment matching the band in the proband and assessment of the deletion by nested PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">h</xref>). ddPCR quantification showed 0.9382 mutant allele abundance in the proband (i.e. heterozygous), whereas father sperm showed a 0.1538 abundance and father’s blood showed 0.0023 abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>), suggesting that 7.69% of sperm carry the deletion. Thus, one of five dSVs was detectably mosaic in parental sperm at AF that could be considered clinical significant since it would increase recurrence risk by over 7-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7e</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">h</xref>). The specificity of these assays precluded the confident exclusion of mosaicism in paternal sperm except for one additional variant (F20 with a 10q21.3-q22.1 Dup) and thus a negative predictive value is more difficult to calculate for most dSVs.</p>
<p id="P13">For three of the four pathogenic variants that were mosaic in sperm, a second semen sample, collected 1–4 months apart, was subjected to mosaicism analysis by ddPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig.7d</xref>). While all three tested variants were detected at similar AF in both, the <italic>NR2F1</italic> mutation exhibited a slight, but significant difference between the two samples (P&lt;0.001). This suggests that mosaicism at these higher AFs is relatively stable over time.</p>

<title>Unbiased analysis of sperm mosaicism detects 9 to 23 mosaic variants in sperm</title>
<p id="P14">While our data demonstrate the value of sperm sequencing to determine if DNMs are mosaic in sperm, we also wanted to assess its value in identifying gonadal mosaicism for variants not yet observed in children. Using the 200× sperm WGS on the eight fathers, we identified mosaic variants using the intersection of variants of MutTect2 and Strelka2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, both optimized for mosaic variant detection in one tissue <italic>compared</italic> with another, as well as MosaicHunter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, optimized for mosaic variant detection shared <italic>between</italic> two tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 8</xref>). This method identified 6/23 DNMs (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) as PGM, since many of the DNMs occurred in repetitive sequences that were masked by these callers. This low recall rate was partially due to optimization of the pipeline for specificity (TAS: ~90% validation rate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>). To increase power for subsequent analyses on variants detected in blood and sperm, we defined three major groups of mosaic mutations SDO, BSS (consisting of SDE, SBE and blood detectable enriched - BDE) and BDO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). We identified 62 SDO, 61 BSS and 568 BDO, the latter likely reflecting clonal hematopoiesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> (CH) primarily arising from the father of F02 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). There were 9 to 23 variants in the sperm of each father, each with the potential to transmit to an offspring.</p>
<p id="P15">The AF of PGM variants ranged from a maximum of ~35% to the lower limits of detection of ~1.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Compared with the sperm AF, blood AF showed two trends: At higher sperm AFs, blood AFs were similar to sperm AF; at lower sperm AFs, the blood AFs were very low or undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9d</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">f</xref>). This suggested two separate origins of PGM during paternal embryogenesis: the former occurring before and the latter after germ cell specification. The AF distributions of SDO, BSS and BDO was consistent with this model, where most SDO variants occurred at AFs&lt;10%, whereas BSSs showed an AF range up to 35% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">f</xref>). BDO AFs tended to mimic SDOs, but there was a distribution tail with higher AFs likely reflecting CH. These BDO variants, while numerous, have little chance to transmit to an offspring because they were absent in sperm. Therefore, sequencing only blood to identify potentially transmissible variants would not distinguish BDO from BSS and would miss SDO variants completely.</p>

<title>Mutational signatures suggest an embryonic origin of PGM</title>
<p id="P16">We then combined all mosaic SNVs detected in both approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) to observe common patterns for these variants. While there was no clustering along or enrichment across chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10a</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 9</xref>), we observed distinct mutational signatures differentiating variant classes. Assessing the relative contribution of each of the six possible base substitutions, mosaic variants differed from the background of gnomAD variants in several categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10c</xref>).The early shared BSS mosaics differed from SDO and BDO variants that were similar to each other.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P17">Our results represent a significant improvement over previous strategies, where only assessment of parental blood mosaicism was used to predict future offspring in combination with advanced population statistics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The role of sperm mosaicism has been increasingly recognized in single gene disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and our work complements these efforts by providing a more general assessment of sperm mosaicism. Our data suggest a model of three major types of PGM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>): type I arise during the terminal differentiation of sperm and never recur. Type II arise in proliferating spermatogonial stem cells (SCCs) and include those that are extant clonally (IIa) or those under positive selection (IIb), akin to the ‘selfish sperm’ hypothesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Type IIa likely represent mutations accumulating in individual SSCs and proposed to underlie the increased mutational load with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, although their importance in this process is controversial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Multiple inheritance is rare for IIa, whereas IIb are similar to IIa, as they have the same origin, but their selective advantage results in over-proliferation of the SSC clone and the potential for population-wide recurrence.</p>
<p id="P18">Type III arise during paternal embryonic development, prior to primordial germ cell (PGC; the early embryonic progenitors of gonadal stem cells) specification or within the PGC population, and may be detectably mosaic in sperm, resulting in the potential for recurrence. The timing of a mutation likely determines its abundance and patterns of mosaicism between sperm and somatic tissue, and our data suggest distinct mutational mechanisms between BSS and SDO variants.</p>
<p id="P19">Employing our methods, a distinction between the contribution of Type I and Type II mosaicism to the male-specific mutational burden is not possible, as both are below the detection limits; similarly, Type III PGM occurring after PGC specification is probably not possible, unless it is positively selected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. In contrast, our work focuses on the detection of Type III mosaicism that can stratify risk of recurrence. Considering the fraction of mosaic variants detected for each father, we estimate that on average 2.9% (95% CI: 1.4–4.4%) of variants fall within this category; and this number increases to 4.3% (95% CI: 1.6%−7.1%) if a variant can be phased to the paternal haplotype. Yet, based on our data and those of previous, gene-centric studies on sperm mosaicism, even within this group, risk can vary by an order of magnitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P20">Thus, the patterns of sperm mosaicism and the resulting framework for its detection that we present have the potential to impact clinical testing in two ways. First, direct assessment of previously transmitted pathogenic variants in paternal sperm allows for the stratification of fathers with low and high recurrence risk through TAS or ddPCR analysis. Second, even without any prior risk or family history, prospective fathers who may want to know their risk of transmitting a high-impact variant to their child could undergo deep sequencing of their sperm, followed by mosaic analysis of these data. This potential is highlighted by our finding that one of the SDO variants (F06:chr9:g.131380333G&gt;A; NP_001123910.1:p.Arg1849Gln; 3.7% AF) was located in <italic>SPTAN1</italic>, a known gene causing infantile epileptic encephalopathy (MIM: 613477)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. While this specific variant has not been previously reported, it was predicted to be “potentially disease-causing” by MutationTaster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, had a MutPred2 score of 0.687<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, and a different non-synonymous change in this same amino acid residue has been reported in affected children in ClinVar (SCV000243194.10, SCV000553140.2; p.Arg1849Trp). Based on our results, we would predict that this variant, which has the potential to be pathogenic, has a 3.7% inheritance risk for any subsequent child of the father in F06.</p>
<p id="P21">There are still several limitations and impediments for the application of sperm mosaicism testing. First, both approaches require the assessment of suspected high-penetrance variants and currently ignore modifiers and polygenic risk scores. This limitation is exemplified by the <italic>GRIN2A</italic> variant in family F09, where it is unclear whether the variability in expressivity is due to environment, genetic modifiers, or stochasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Second, the absence of detectable mosaicism in paternal sperm can only stratify the family into low risk if the mutation of interest has been phased to the paternal haplotype. While phasing can be achieved through several experimental approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, including the nanopore sequencing we present in this manuscript, its implementation into clinical practice is still uncommon. Third, while we show examples of resampling for three of the pathogenic variants and the relative stability of mosaicism between samples, it is unclear whether this is true across all mosaic variants and should be studied systematically in future. Yet, it is a problem that would be less relevant when testing sperm samples that are directly used for <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization. Finally, our framework for the unbiased detection of mosaicism is tuned for specificity and may therefore miss clinically relevant variants. Similarly to mosaic analysis of cancer, implementation of sperm analysis for mosaic risk mutation has to be tuned for clinical application and may require large-scale secondary validation by methods such as TAS.</p>

We processed these reads through our standard mapping and somatic variant calling pipelines (see below), and calculated sensitivity to detect mosaic variants at each AF as the fraction of simulated variants called by our dSNV pipeline or both MuTect 2/Strelka 2 and MosaicHunter.</p>

WES trio analysis for F09-F12 was performed on DNA extracted from lymphocyte cell lines (generated by the NIMH Repository) and results were confirmed in saliva samples, WGS trio analysis for F01–08 and F13–20 was performed on DNA derived from blood. Each father provided a single sperm samples, with the exception of F01, F09, and F13, where a second sample was obtained 1, 3.5, and 4 moths, respectively, after the first. Patients were all part of two independent cohorts, assembled to identify dSNVs and dSVs through trio sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>: the REACH cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, consisting of 265 families with a proband with general features of ASD, recruited at Rady Children’s Hospital San Diego (J.S.) and at Mutua Terrassa Hospital Barcelona (M.A., H.A., and J.S.), and one focusing on 98 probands with ASD and an additional diagnosis of epilepsy, recruited at NYU Medical School (O.D. and J.G.G; unpublished).

Intellectual function was assessed by IQ score. Speech was assessed by a speech therapist fluent in the child’s native language. Brief videos of each affected member were collected during the examination as part of the clinical assessment. Autism was assessed by a clinical psychologist using ADIR, ADOS, and CARS, developmental milestones were assessed with the Vineland and hyperactivity with the Conners Parent/Teacher Scale, all administered in the child’s native language by a trained psychologist. Epilepsy was assessed by a trained specialist and included history of daytime and nighttime seizures, seizure types, length, onset, and resolutions, and treatment history. EEG was assessed awake and asleep using minimum 21 electrodes and “10 to 20” system placements recommended by the IFCN. In specific subjects, a 24 hour EEG was recorded to evaluate the possibility of nighttime seizures and to identify seizure foci. All subjects were recruited between the ages of 3–8 years.

Variant calling for SNVs and InDels was according to GATK’s best practices by first calling variants in each sample with HaplotypeCaller and then jointly genotyping them across the entire cohort using CombineGVCFs and GenotypeGVCFs. Variants were annotated with SnpEff (v4.2) and SnpSift (v4.2) and allele frequencies from the 1000 Genomes Project and the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. <italic>De novo</italic> variants were called for probands using Triodenovo (v0.06) with a minimum <italic>de novo</italic> quality score (minDQ) of 2.0 and subjected to manual inspection.

Among all 912 variants only 4 showed a significant deviation from an expected 0.5 AF using a binomial model; this effect was prior to multiple testing and disappeared following a Bonferroni correction. This lack of PMVs in our data is most likely a reflection of limited sequencing depth (~40×) and cannot conclusively exclude the existence of PMVs in our data. Nevertheless, conservatively, we assumed that all 912 dSNVs were true DNMs. We further interrogated F01–08 for possible paternally mosaic variants that might have been erroneously reported as inherited heterozygous variants; such artifacts might result in an underestimation of mosaicism and overestimation of SDO and SDE variants. However, multiple filtering approaches did not result in the identification of any such variants. While we cannot exclude their existence, we believe that their contribution to mosaicism – if any – is minor in our dataset.</p>

Phase-informative SNPs were those where the child was heterozygous and either 1) one parent was heterozygous or homozygous for the alternate allele while the other parent was homozygous for the reference allele, or 2) one parent was heterozygous while the other parent was homozygous for the alternate allele. Second, where applicable, long-reads (Oxford Nanopore reads, average length 5,349 bp) were identified that contained both a dSNV and one or more phase-informative SNPs. The number of dSNV and phase-informative SNP combinations that were present in reads and consistent with the dSNV occurring on a maternal or paternal haplotype were counted. Reads containing an InDel flanking either the dSNV or the phase-informative SNP were excluded from the analysis. Finally, the dSNVs were assigned to maternal and paternal haplotypes if there were: 1) a minimum of two counts, and 2) the haplotype with the majority of counts had at least 2/3 of total counts.

<p id="P33">Using the Primer3Plus web interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, the amplicon and probes for wild-type and mutant were designed to distinguish reference and alternate allele (settings in Supplementary Information under Additional Information). Probes were required to be located within 15 bp up- and 15 bp downstream of the mutation and adjusted, so melting temperatures (Tm) were matched between reference and alternate probe. In addition, if possible, amplicons were kept at 100 bp or shorter and probes at 20 bp or shorter. Specificity of the primers was assessed using Primer-BLAST. Custom primer and probe mixes (primer to probe ratio of 3.6) were ordered from IDT with FAM-labeled probes for the alternate, and HEX-labeled probes for the reference allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 10</xref>). Optimal annealing temperature, specificity, and efficiency were tested using custom gblocks (IDT) or patient DNA at a range of dilutions. ddPCR was performed on a BioRad platform, using a QX200 droplet generator, a C1000 touch cycler, a PX1 PCR Plate Sealer, and a QX200 droplet reader with the following reagents: ddPCR Supermix (BioRad, 1863024), droplet generation oil (BioRad, 1863005), cartridge (BioRad, 1864008), and PCR plates (Eppendorf, 951020346). Aiming for 30–60 ng per reaction, up to 8 μl of DNA solution were used in a single reaction. Data analysis was performed using the software packages QuantaSoft and QuantaSoft Analysis Pro (BioRad). Each run included technical duplicates or triplicates (as indicated in figure legends). For direct comparison of sperm samples we used seven technical replicates, except for F09, where the total amount of sperm DNA was limiting. Across all ddPCR reactions that were designed for SNV detection, we determined that the minimum AF that we could reliably detect was 0.1%. Therefore, we set this as threshold of detection.

<title>Targeted amplicon sequencing (TAS)</title>
<p id="P34">PCR products for sequencing were designed with a target length of 160–190 bp with primers being at least 60 bp away from the base of interest. Primers were designed using the command-line tool of Primer3 with a python wrapper (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 10</xref>). PCR was performed according to standard procedures using GoTaq Colorless Master Mix (Promega, M7832) on sperm, blood, and an unrelated control. Amplicons were either enzymatically cleaned with ExoI (NEB, M0293S) and SAP (NEB, M0371S) treatment or gel extraction where necessary (Zymo Research, D4007). Following normalization with the Qubit HS Kit (ThermFisher Scientific, Q33231), amplification products were processed according to the manufacturer’s protocol with SureSelect SPRI Beads (Beckman Colture, A63881) at a ratio of 1.2x. Library preparation was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol using a Kapa Hyper Prep Kit (Kapa Biosystems, KK8501) and barcoded independently with unique dual indexes (IDT for Illumina, 20022370). After sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 with 100 bp paired-end reads, reads were mapped to the hg19 reference genome (1000Genomes version 37) and processed according to GATK v3.8 best practices. Across all amplicons, read numbers (mean ± SD) were 636,636 ± 382,226 in sperm, 831,556 ± 530,332 in blood, and 857,289 ± 570,612 in control. Overall, read depth reached between 93–3,138,968x, with 99% &gt;261x and 95% &gt;1809x. Putative mosaic sites were retrieved using samtools mpileup and pileup filtering scripts described in previous TAS pipelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Variants were considered validated if 1) their lower 95% CI boundary was above the upper 95% CI boundary of the control; 2) their AF was &gt;0.5%.</p>

<sec id="S22">
<title>Mosaic dSNV analysis</title>
<p id="P35">Using the read depth information generated by HaplotypeCaller, the AF for previously called dSNVs was determined. Additionally, dSNVs that fell in repetitive regions of the human genome were annotated using the repeatMasker (rmsk.txt) file from UCSC. Variants that were homozygous alternate in the father and heterozygous in the proband, as well as variants that were present in both blood and sperm at AFs that suggested an inherited heterozygous SNP (i.e. AF&gt;35% in both blood and sperm) were removed. Variants were further filtered to include only those with a gnomAD frequencies &lt;0.01<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Mosaic variants were categorized based on their presence or absence in sperm and blood (≥3 reads minimum requirement in one of them; if ≥3 reads were present for one, the other only had to show ≥1 reads). The 3 read minimum was based on an expected Illumina per base error rate of Q30/0.1% (i.e. ~0.033% error rate to substitute to the expected dSNV). Given a read depth of 200×, a minimum of 1 read as evidence would result in a falsely assigned mosaic variant with ~6.5% probability, with 2 reads this drops to ~0.2%, with 3 reads to ~0.005%. Given the number of interrogated dSNVs is ~1000, this would result in ~60, ~2, and ~0.05 false positive variants. To be called sperm enriched, a variant’s AF had to be three times higher in sperm than in blood (α&gt;3), which was an arbitrarily determined threshold, mainly based on the size of the 95% CI at ~200× at low AF. To assess the sensitivity of 200× WGS, in one family we also performed Multiplex Accurate Sensitive Quantitation (MASQ) on sperm DNA, which is capable of detecting AFs as low as 10<sup>−4</sup>-10<sup>−6</sup> (A.B.M., Z.W., unpublished). We selected dSNVs where sperm WGS did not suggest gonadal mosaicism for the majority of variants, in order to assess whether additional mosaics might be identified. From 73 such dSNVs in F01, MASQ assay design was successful for 23, two of which were already detected as mosaic from 200× WGS of sperm. MASQ confirmed these two, but did not detect any additional variants that were mosaic in sperm. Only 1 of these variants remained unphased, confirming that the remaining 20 paternally derived dSNVs even at this level of detection were not found to be mosaic in sperm, and that they likely arose either later in the sperm lineage, zygotically, or post-zygotically.</p>

<title>MuTect 2/Strelka 2 and MosaicHunter mosaic variant calling</title>
<p id="P36">Sperm- and blood-specific SNVs were called in the 200× WGS data using two somatic variant callers with default parameters, MuTect 2 (v2.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and Strelka 2 (v2.9.2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, setting the sperm sample as “tumor” and the blood sample as “normal” and vice versa. High confidence calls for somatic mosaicism for each sperm-blood and blood-sperm comparison was performed by taking the intersection of variants identified by both callers (MS). These candidates were further filtered to reduce potential false positives as follows: we removed those that fell into repetitive regions, that fell within 5 bp of a germline InDel, that were part of a homopolymer or dinucletide repeat, or that were present in gnomAD at allele frequencies &gt;0.01. The latter filter was employed as common variants that appear to be mosaic are most often artifacts. Shared mosaic variants (and some tissue-specific variants missed by MS) were called using the whole genome single mode provided by MosaicHunter v1.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> (MH). Additionally, variants had to be within the 5<sup>th</sup> and 95<sup>th</sup> percentile (76&lt;read depth&lt;280) for sequencing depth across all variants to control for artifacts, had to be absent or at an allele frequency &lt;0.01 in gnomAD, could not be recurrent in our data set, had to have a major allele consistent with the reference allele in hg19, and had to have an AF below 30% in at least one tissue (to remove likely heterozygous calls). If a mosaic variant was only found in one tissue by MH, the variant was only determined to be shared mosaic if there were ≥3 reads supporting the alternative allele in the second tissue. Calls from both methods (MS and MH) were then combined to obtain tissue-specific and shared mosaicism.</p>

<title>Assessment of the location of the genome-wide distribution of mosaic variants</title>
<p id="P37">In order to assess the distribution of mosaic variants along the chromosomes, an equal number of variants (for mosaic dSNVs and unbiased calls that were sperm-specific, sperm mosaic, blood mosaic, or blood-specific) was randomly generated with BEDTools from the called region from Strelka 2 with or without subtraction of the repeatMasker (rmsk.txt) file from UCSC as appropriate. This process was repeated 10,000 times to generate a distribution of the mean and standard deviation of the distance of neighboring variants according to a broken stick model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Mutational signatures</title>

In order to obtain a 95% band of expectation, an equivalent number of variants was randomly chosen from the gnomAD VCF. This process was performed for a total of 1,000 times to obtain a distribution and the 2.5<sup>th</sup> and 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile of the simulated mutational signatures. Significance was reported if a mutational signature was outside the permuted 95% bands.</p>

<title>Mosaic dSV analysis of WGS data</title>
<p id="P39">We searched for evidence for mosaicism of structural variants in the fathers using depth of coverage, split-reads, discordant paired-ends, and B-allele frequency in deeply sequenced paired-end genomes. Depth of coverage was estimated as the median per base-pair coverage within the SV locus, while omitting positions that overlapped assembly gaps, RepeatMasker elements, short tandem repeats, and segmental duplications. We estimated copy number by dividing the median depth of coverage by the median coverage of the chromosome and multiplying by the ploidy number (2 for autosomes). Standard deviation of copy number was calculated by sampling the estimated copy number of 1,000 random non-overlapping regions of the same length of the dSV, ensuring each region did not overlap more than 50% to exclude elements listed above. Since the reported copy number of the <italic>de novo</italic> duplication appears to be elevated in related non-carriers, we opted to estimate the standard deviation of copy number while controlling for repeat content. Hence, sampled regions contained a RepeatMasker content in the range of 30–35% (dSV=33%). Split-reads (also known as chimeric reads) are those with multiple alignments to the genome. Generally, if a read spanned a deletion or tandem duplication breakpoint, two alignments were generated with each segment mapping to opposite ends of the breakpoint. Similar to split-reads, discordant paired-ends had read fragments that span the SV breakpoint, but the SV breakpoint resided in the unsequenced insert of the fragment. Consequently, the paired-ends mapped to opposite ends of the breakpoint producing an insert size approaching the size of the SV. We searched ±250 bp from the predicted breakpoint for SV supporting reads, which were unique reads that were either split or contained discordant paired-ends with breakpoints that overlap at least 95% reciprocally to the SV. We reported the proportion of supporting reads to non-informative reads (those that do not support the SV) within the ±250bp windows, which roughly estimates proportion of mosaicism. Additionally for the <italic>de novo</italic> duplication SV, we searched for deviations in B-allele frequency defined as the proportion of reads that support the alternate variant to all reads covering the variant in question. Normalized sequencing depth calculations generated by CNView<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> was derived from binned coverages in 45Kb non-overlapping windows.</p>

<title>dSTRΔ calling and mosaicism detection</title>
<p id="P40">Analysis of STR expansions and contractions were performed using HipSTR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> (version v0.6) jointly on all BAM files (40× trios and &gt;200× blood and sperm of fathers). The reference STR set provided by HipSTR for GRCh37 (GRCh37.hipstr_reference.bed) and default options were used except for: --def-stutter-model and --output-gls. Furthermore, a modified version of HipSTR’s denovofinder tool was run on each of the 40× trios. The posterior probability of a <italic>de novo</italic> mutation was calculated using HipSTR genotype likelihood and STR loci mutation rates as priors. Strict quality filters to detect <italic>de novo</italic> STRs were applied within trios. STR loci were excluded from analysis if they were in segmentally duplicated (UCSC hg19.genomicSuperDups table)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> regions. Genotype STR calls in all family members were required to have a minimum genotype quality of 0.9, a maximum of 15% of reads with stutter or InDel, at least ten spanning reads, and at least 20% of reads to support each allele. STR loci were excluded if homozygous in the child or if they contained homopolymers and dinucleotide repeat motifs. <italic>De novo</italic> STR mutations were further required to have a posterior probability of <italic>de novo</italic> mutation ≥0.8. Mutations were excluded if they were not a multiple of the repeat motif unit, or if the <italic>de novo</italic> allele was found in one of the parents at &gt;0.1 allele frequency. STR mutations were further only considered if the repeat unit was ≥3 as homopolymers and dinucleotide repeats were enriched for false-positive calls. The remaining loci were annotated with their phase where possible and <italic>de novo</italic> allele frequencies in the &gt;200× sperm and blood samples. dSTRΔs were qualified as inconclusive if mosaicism was detected in mother and father, as true <italic>de novo</italic> if no mosaicism was detected in the parents, as maternal if mosaicism was only detected in the mother, and as paternal if mosaicism was detected in blood, sperm, or both. As for dSNVs, sperm-enriched variants were annotated as such if the AF was more than 3 times higher in sperm than blood. Phase of STR was inferred from genotypes: if a unique allele was inherited from one of the parents, the STRΔ was assumed to be derived from the other.</p>

Sperm (left, green) and blood (right, orange). Dashed line and grey box: upper 95% CI of an unrelated control and the area beneath to visualize likely false positive variants. y-axis: allelic fraction (%) for a log2 transformation of the data. Plots are split by the three categories: SDO (<bold>a</bold>), BSS (<bold>b</bold>), and BDO (<bold>c</bold>). Red text denotes variants that were considered to have failed orthogonal validation: 13/19 (<bold>a</bold>), 21/21 (<bold>b</bold>), and 33/34 (<bold>c</bold>) were successfully confirmed. Underlined variants were confirmed, but likely annotated as the wrong class (i.e. they are actually BSS for SDO and BDO variants in <bold>a</bold> and <bold>c</bold>, or are SDO (green text) or BDO (orange text) for BSS variants in <bold>c</bold>). For all data points, the estimated fraction and CI are based on the fraction of mutant reads, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">8</xref>. <bold>d-f</bold>, Ranked plot of the estimated sperm and blood AF with 95% confidence intervals (estimated fraction ± binomial CI; based on the fraction of mutant reads, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 8</xref>) for all variants detected in the three categories. SDO (<bold>d</bold>) and BDO (<bold>f</bold>) variants both show curves that are reminiscent of exponential decay, consistent with an increase of the number of mutations with expansion of the progenitor pool at a constant mutational rate. However, BSS (<bold>e</bold>) mosaicism for the first 40 variants appears to be more linear, suggesting that mutation rates for early division might be higher than those for later. This is consistent with previous models that estimated an elevated mutation rate in early embryonic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p>

Only the 22q12.3 deletion in F01 showed gonadal mosaicism, as also described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">d</xref>. <bold>f</bold>, Genomic <italic>CACNG2</italic> locus (22q12.3) and the pathogenic 128,195 bp deletion in F01. Below: primers for nested PCR for deletion detection. <bold>g</bold>, Agarose gel for the primary PCR products from blood (bl) and sperm (sp). <italic>CACNG2</italic> deletion: 801 bp band detected in DNA from affected and paternal sperm; 519 bp reference band detected in all samples as a control. <bold>h</bold>, Agarose gel for nested PCR products (arranged as in <bold>g</bold>). <bold>g</bold> and <bold>h</bold> show representative gels from two independent replicates. <bold>i</bold>, ddPCR showed CN mosaicism at 0.1538 copies or~7.5% AF in sperm and 0.0023 copies or ~0.1% in blood from father, 0.9382 copies or ~47.0% AF in blood from the affected individual, undetectable in samples from mother and control (n=3 experimental replicates for each sample, shown are mean ± SEM and individual values).</p>

<title>Unbiased analysis of sperm mosaicism reveals that sperm sequencing reclassifies risk for ~50% of mosaic variants.</title>
<p id="P63"><bold>a</bold>, Blood and sperm from 8 fathers was subjected to 200× whole genome sequencing (WGS) followed by detection of mosaicism using the intersection of MuTect 2 and Strelka 2 and union with MosaicHunter. <bold>b-c</bold>, Total number of mosaic variants (<bold>b</bold>) and those found in each father (<bold>c</bold>) that were SDO, blood/sperm shared (BSS; includes SDE, SBE, and blood detectable enriched - BDE), or BDO. F02 showed a substantially increased number of BDO variants, most likely related to clonal hematopoiesis/collapse due to his advanced age at sampling (70 years). <bold>d</bold>, Ranked plot of the estimated sperm and blood AF with 95% confidence intervals (estimated fraction ± binomial CI; based on the fraction of mutant reads, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Data 8</xref>) for all 123 gonadal mosaic variants that were detected as mosaic in sperm. Lower plot shows the log10 transformed ratio of sperm and blood AFs (0 replaced with 1*10<sup>−8</sup>) and the rolling average over 20 data points to display the local trend. <bold>e</bold>, Violin plots with inner box plots (showing median and quartiles) of AFs of all three types of variants as indicated (n=62 SDO variants, 61 BSS, and 568 BDO). <bold>f</bold>, Sperm vs. blood AF for all detected mosaic variant coded by individual. BDO and BSS mosaic variants reached higher AF than those that were SDO. Grey area denotes region of variants that are detectable in both sperm and blood.</p>

<title>Sperm mosaic variant mutation patterns support a developmental origin.</title>
<p id="P64"><bold>a</bold>, Mutational signatures (6 categories) for the three classes of mosaicism, compared to the overall gnomAD signature and a permuted subset (n=1,000 permutations for n=68 (SDO), 72 (BSS), and 568 (BDO) gnomAD SNVs; shown is the 95% band). Asterisks indicate observed signatures that lie outside the 95% band of the permuted variants. SDO and BDO showed signatures that differed from gnomAD and the BSS variants; BSS variants likewise showed a mutational signature that was distinct from the gnomAD population. <bold>b</bold>, Mutational signatures (96 categories; trinucleotide environment) of the three classes of mosaicism. <bold>c</bold>, Model for four types of PGM from testis tubule cross-section, with spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) at perimeter, and mature sperm at lumen. Type I and IIa PGM occurs in a single sperm (I) or SSC (IIa), thus contributing to only a fraction of total sperm and associate with non-recurrent disease. Type IIb and III mutations lead to selective growth advantage and elevate population-level recurrence risk (IIb), or occur during paternal embryogenesis, leading to multiple independent mutant SSCs and associate with mutational recurrence (III). <bold>d</bold>, Type III PGM mosaicism occur (i) during early paternal embryogenesis, seeding sperm and somal progenitors at equally high AFs, (ii) during late embryogenesis, seeding stochastically at variable AFs between tissues, or (iii) in early primordial germ cell (PGC) differentiation, seeding only gonads. Note: PGCs are the early embryonic progenitors of SSCs.</p>
