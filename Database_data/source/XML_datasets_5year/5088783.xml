<abstract>
<p id="P1">Normal brain function depends on the interaction between highly specialized neurons that operate within anatomically and functionally distinct brain regions. Neuronal specification is driven by transcriptional programs that are established during early neuronal development and remain in place in the adult brain. The fidelity of neuronal specification depends on the robustness of the transcriptional program that supports the neuron type-specific gene expression patterns. Here we show that PRC2, which supports neuron specification during differentiation, contributes to the suppression of a transcriptional program that is detrimental for adult neuron function and survival. We show that PRC2 deficiency in striatal neurons leads to the de-repression of selected, predominantly bivalent PRC2 target genes that are dominated by self-regulating transcription factors normally suppressed in these neurons. The transcriptional changes in PRC2-deficient neurons lead to progressive and fatal neurodegeneration in mice. Our results point to a key role of PRC2 in protecting neurons against degeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Neuron-lineage and subtype-specific transcription factors play a critical role in the differentiation and functional specification of neurons during brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and in the adult brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The transcription factor-driven enforcement of neuronal specification overlaps with the suppression of genes that, in their own right, can drive differentiation of non-neuronal cells or neurons of other types. Much of the negative gene regulation in developing neurons is achieved by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The function of the PRC2 is mediated by its enzymatic components, Ezh1 or Ezh2, which catalyze histone H3 lysine 27 di- and tri-methylation (H3K27me2/3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 leads to gene silencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, which is consistent with the role of the PRC2 in preventing the expression of non-neuronal genes in developing neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">The presence of the lysine methyltransferases Ezh1 and Ezh2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> as well as the non-enzymatic PRC2 components Suz12 and Jarid2 in adult neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) suggest that even after the completion of neuronal differentiation, PRC2-mediated gene silencing remains operational in adult neurons. Moreover, the age-dependent increase in the levels of H3K27me3 in adult neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1a</xref>) indicates the potential relevance of high levels of H3K27me3 in the maintenance of adult neuronal function. In addition to PRC2, which catalyzes H3K27me3, H3K27me3 levels depend on the H3K27me3 specific demethylases Jmjd3/Kdm6b and Utx/Kdm6a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, both of which are expressed in adult neurons (Allen Brain Atlas). The levels of neuronal H3K27me3 can be modulated by environmental factors. The activity of the H3K27me3-specific demethylases depends on the intracellular levels of a-ketoglutarate, which can fluctuate significantly in response to neuronal metabolic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Additionally, neuronal activation can lead to the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 (H3S28) followed by the dissociation of the PRC2 from chromatin and an ensuing loss of H3K27me3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Changes in PRC2 activity and alterations in H3K27me3 levels and distribution have recently been implicated in several human neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, including Huntington disease (HD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Recent studies identified the PRC2 as a direct target for the huntingtin protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Moreover, the expression of mutant huntingtin in mouse ES cells or neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) alters the pattern of genome-wide H3K27me3 distribution in both cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The possible link between PRC2 and HD is further supported by the loss of neuronal PRC2/H3K27me3 sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and the up-regulation of some of the PRC2 target genes in the HD affected human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. While these studies suggest that the PRC2 might represent a common target of different pathological processes that drive neurodegenerative diseases, the role of the PRC2 in the regulation of neuronal specification, function and survival in the adult brain is not known.</p>
<p id="P4">To address the significance of the PRC2 in adult neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>, we have generated mice with a PRC2 deficiency in highly specialized medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum. We found that the PRC2 is essential for the MSN-specific gene expression and function. The deficiency in PRC2 directly impacts a selected group of PRC2 target genes that encode transcription factors normally suppressed in MSNs as well as death promoting proteins. The ectopic expression of non-MSN and non-neuronal lineage specific transcription factors in PRC2-deficient MSNs is associated with a down-regulation of genes that are required for MSN-specific functions. These collective changes in gene expression are accompanied by altered neuronal physiology and the development of progressive and fatal neurodegeneration.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Conditional inactivation of the PRC2 in adult neurons</title>
<p id="P5">PRC2 deficiency in MSNs has been accomplished by combining a null-mutation in the <italic>Ezh1</italic> gene (<italic>Ezh1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) with the conditional ablation of the <italic>Ezh2</italic> gene in different types of neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). To achieve the forebrain neuron-specific <italic>Ezh2</italic> gene inactivation, we combined <italic>Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and <italic>Camk2a-Cre</italic> alleles in <italic>Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Camk2a-Cre</italic> mice, which allow Cre-mediated recombination of <italic>loxP</italic>-modified genes in projection neurons in the striatum, cortex, and hippocampus at 2 weeks of age. Neuronal development and maturation are associated with a switch from a predominantly Ezh2 to a mostly Ezh1 containing PRC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). However, neither Ezh1 nor Ezh2 deficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>) alone has an impact on the overall levels or the genome-wide distribution of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b, c</xref>), and only the combined Ezh1 and Ezh2 deficiencies lead to a loss of H3K27me3 in MSNs in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-d</xref>). The global loss of H3K27me3 in the MSNs becomes evident around 6 weeks of age and approximately 3-4 weeks after PRC2 inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). As expected, the H3K27me3 deficiency in <italic>Ezh1<sup>-/-</sup>; Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Camk2a-cre</italic> mice is strictly neuron specific. The glia cells from these mice express wild type levels of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">The delayed, with respect to the timing of PRC2 inactivation, ablation of H3K27me3 in MSNs suggests that most of the postnatal MSN development in <italic>Ezh1<sup>-/-</sup>; Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Camk2a-cre</italic> mice occurs in the presence of wild type-like H3K27me3 levels. This finding argues against a possible developmental impact of the PRC2 deficiency on adult MSN gene expression in <italic>Ezh1<sup>-/-</sup>; Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Camk2a-cre</italic> mice.</p>
<p id="P7">To inactivate PRC2 specifically in specialized adult neurons, we have limited the inactivation of the PRC2 to specific neuron types. In particular, we have generated mice with PRC2 inactivation specifically in dopamine D1 or D2 receptor expressing neurons. This has been achieved by breeding <italic>Drd1a-Cre</italic> or <italic>Drd2-Cre</italic> mice to the <italic>Ezh1<sup>-/-</sup>; Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>.). To exclude any potential developmental impacts of the PRC2 ablation, we use an AAV-based approach to inactivate the PRC2 in the striatum of 10-week old <italic>Ezh1<sup>-/-</sup>; Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Finally, we employ the Purkinje cell specific Cre-expressing mouse strain <italic>Pcp2-cre</italic> to inactivate the PRC2 in postnatal cerebellar Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). The details of the neuron type-specific inactivation of the PRC2 will be discussed below in the context of the cell-type specific impact of PRC2 deficiency on gene expression and cell function.</p>

<title>PRC2 targets non-neuronal, non-MSN and death-promoting genes in adult MSNs</title>
<p id="P8">To elucidate the role of the PRC2 in the regulation of neuronal cell type-specific gene expression, we first have identified the PRC2 target genes in MSNs of adult mice. To address the chromatin state of genes in MSNs, we have conducted our studies on highly purified <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated MSN nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>) We found that genes associated with H3K27me3 in adult MSNs are transcriptionally silent and lack Pol II or the activation associated H3K27acetyl at the transcriptional start sites (TSS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). The majority of the H3K27me3 enriched genes include genes that are normally expressed either in cells of non-neuronal lineages or in non-MSN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">A large fraction of H3K27me3-enriched (FPKM &gt; 1.2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) and transcriptionally silent genes in MSNs possess H3K4me3 at their TSS, which is commonly associated with transcriptional activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, d, e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The simultaneous presence of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, which is defined as chromatin bivalency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, has been validated by the sequential immunoprecipitation of H3K27me3 associated chromatin from <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated adult MSNs followed by H3K4me3 immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Approximately 65% (544/835, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) of the bivalent genes in MSNs overlap with genes that have been previously identified as bivalent in ES cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, while the rest of the bivalent genes are MSN specific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">The most abundant class of bivalent loci in MSNs is represented by genes that encode transcriptional regulators associated with non-MSNs as well as with non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 g</xref>). Notably, the MSN bivalent genes include genes that encode important regulators of cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>), such as <italic>Pmaip1/Noxa, Bik, Cdkn2a/b, Trp73, Gas1, Wt1</italic> and <italic>Ccnd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Selective PRC2 target gene up-regulation in the absence of the PRC2</title>
<p id="P11">The PRC2 targets thousands of genes in adult MSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). However, the deficiency in PRC2 leads to highly selective changes in MSN gene expression that occur with a significant delay after the onset of H3K27me3 deficiency. While MSNs in the striatum of six week-old <italic>Ezh1<sup>-/-</sup>; Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Camk2a–cre</italic> mice display no changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), we observe upregulation of PRC2 target genes at three months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). By six months of age, we observe an increase in both the number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, left panel) of up-regulated genes in MSNs. The majority of up-regulated genes are direct targets of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> right panel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>), and more than 50% display a bivalent chromatin state in wild type MSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, right panel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). These data suggest that PRC2 plays a specific role in the suppression of bivalent genes in MSNs but does not explain the selectivity and time–dependent up-regulation of PRC2 target genes.</p>
<p id="P12">The up-regulated genes are greatly enriched for genes encoding non-MSN-expressed transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 4</xref>), which are expressed at levels sufficient for <italic>in situ</italic> detection in the mutant neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The majority of the induced transcriptional regulators encode homeobox genes including numerous Hox genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>) that are normally silenced in MSNs during early developmental stages.</p>
<p id="P13">The transcriptional control of more than 25% of the transcriptional regulators that become up-regulated in the absence of the PRC2 entails the formation of positive auto-regulatory feedback loops as described in the earlier studies or as identified by the analysis of cis-regulatory elements (oPPOSUM and GENOMATIX analysis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). A large fraction of the transcriptional regulators that become up-regulated in PRC2-deficient MSNs have experimentally proven (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, right panel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>) or sequence-predicted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 5</xref>) co-regulatory functions that may allow the formation of transcriptional networks reinforcing the expression of these genes. Our data suggest that while the majority of H3K27me3 target genes in MSNs are surprisingly insensitive to PRC2 deficiency, a selective group of predominantly bivalent PRC2 targets become expressed at relatively high levels due to the ability to form mutually reinforcing transcriptional network(s). The formation of self-controlled mutually reinforced transcription loops among PRC2 target genes represents a possible mechanism for the selective and progressive up-regulation of PRC2 target genes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6" sec-type="background">
<title>PRC2 deficiency is associated with a down-regulation of MSN–specific genes</title>
<p id="P14">The ectopic expression of the PRC2 target genes in MSNs is associated with a concurrent down-regulation of 119 MSN-expressed genes in <italic>Ezh1<sup>-/-</sup>; Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Camk2a–cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). The down-regulated genes are not associated with H3K27me3 in wild-type MSNs and hence cannot be directly regulated by the PRC2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). The down-regulated genes are significantly enriched (38/119, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Odds Ratio: 25.16) for key regulators of MSN identity and specialized functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). PRC2-deficient MSNs display reduced expression levels of genes that encode important regulators of MSN-specific functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), including neurotransmitter receptors (<italic>Drd2</italic>, <italic>Drd1a</italic>, <italic>Adora2a</italic>,), signaling proteins (<italic>Arpp21</italic>, <italic>Rgs9</italic>, <italic>Pde10a</italic>), and MSN-specific transcription factors (<italic>Rxrg</italic>, <italic>Foxp1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Many of the down-regulated genes have been linked to neurological disease processes in humans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4 c</xref>). The reduced expression of selected MSN genes is highly specific and is in contrast to the wild type-like expression levels of the majority of MSN-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). The PRC2-deficient D2 MSNs, while present at wild type numbers in the striatum of 5 month-old mutant mice, express significantly lower levels of the D2 MSN-specific gene <italic>Drd2</italic> as compared to control D2 MSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">Based on the known pattern of <italic>Camk2a</italic> expression in neurons, the conditional PRC2 deficiency may affect not only MSNs but also other forebrain projection neurons, including layer 5/6 cortical neurons, which directly innervate MSNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. It is therefore conceivable that the down-regulation of MSN-specific genes could reflect changes in their cortical innervation. To address this possibility, we have employed mice with D1 or D2 neuron-specific PRC2 inactivation. The <italic>Ezh1<sup>-/-</sup>; Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Drd1-Cre</italic> or <italic>Ezh1<sup>-/-</sup>; Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Drd2-Cre</italic> mice were bred to <italic>Drd1-TRAP</italic> or <italic>Drd2-TRAP</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>) for D1- or D2-neuron specific ribosome-associated mRNA analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. The D1 or D2 MSN-specific PRC2 deficiency leads to the up-regulation of the same PRC2 target genes as well as a down-regulation of MSN specific genes that are observed in the MSNs of <italic>Ezh1<sup>-/-</sup>; Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Camk2a–cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). These findings support the MSN cell-intrinsic nature of transcriptional changes that follow PRC2 deficiency in MSNs.

The loss of the PRC2 in postnatal cerebellar PC impairs the PC phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). The alterations in gene expression in PRC2-deficient PCs follow a similar pattern of gene expression changes observed in the PRC2-deficient MSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). The PC-specific TRAP analysis of <italic>Ezh1<sup>-/-</sup>; Ezh2<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Pcp2-cre</italic>; <italic>Pcp2-TRAP</italic> mice reveals that PRC2-deficient PCs up-regulate PRC2 target genes.

As in PRC2-deficient MSNs, the de-repression of the PRC2 target genes is associated with the down-regulation of genes that are critical for PC function and survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>, right panel). The reduced expression of genes controlling PC function and survival may augment the effect of potential death-promoting PRC2 target genes that are up-regulated in PRC2-deficient PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>).

<p id="P22">PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 is one of the hallmarks of developmentally determined gene silencing that critically contributes to the differentiation of cells of various types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Our studies address the role of the PRC2 in adult neurons where neuronal lineage specification is associated with highly specialized neuron type-specific gene expression programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. We show that the maintenance of H3K27me3 in adult neurons requires the presence of either Ezh1 or Ezh2, which represent homologous but structurally distinct enzymatic components of the PRC2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Although Ezh2 expression levels decline sharply during early postnatal brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, this enzyme is able to compensate for a deficiency in Ezh1, which dominates the PRC2 in adult neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The redundancy between Ezh1 and Ezh2 may reflect specific features of post-mitotic neurons since Ezh1 cannot substitute Ezh2 in dividing cells during brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P23">In MSNs, H3K27me3 remains at wild type levels for at least 2 weeks after ablation of the PRC2. The stability of H3K27me3 in neurons does not reflect the existence of another, not yet identified H3K27me3 specific histone methyltransferase, as deficiency in Ezh1/2 ultimately leads to H3K27me3 loss. The durability of H3K27me3 in the absence of the PRC2 cannot be attributed to the lack of expression of the H3K27me3 specific demethylases Jmjd3 and Utx. Both enzymes are expressed at wild type levels in PRC2-deficient MSNs (data not shown). In the most likely scenario, the stability of H3K27me3 reflects the low rate of histone H3 turnover in non-dividing cells including neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> in combination with the slow kinetics of lysine demethylation by Jmjd3 and Utx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P24">We identified 2057 PRC2 target genes in MSNs, which are associated with high levels of H3K27me3 at their TSS. Many of these PRC2 targeted gene are associated with H3K27me3/HK4me3 bivalent chromatin (835/2057). In ES cells as well as in cells of other types, the chromatin bivalency supports the plasticity of cell differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. However, it is unlikely that fully differentiated MSNs could benefit from the expression of genes that can potentially alter MSN differentiation and function. It is possible that the bivalent state of these transcriptional regulators is a reflection of their specific DNA sequence. A majority of bivalent promoters contain CpG islands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, and the PRC2 is commonly recruited to GC-rich sequence elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P25">The TSS-associated H3K4me3 is not only an indicator of a gene's transcriptional potential but can also be a marker of promoter-associated transcription. In turn, it has been shown that transcription can promote the recruitment of the PRC2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is possible that the presence of H3K4me3 is required for the recruitment of the PRC2 and subsequent gene silencing. One can envision a scenario in which the presence of H3K4me3 on bivalent genes may support low levels of transcriptional activity, i.e. promoter-associated transcription, which may not yield the full-length RNA but is necessary and sufficient for the recruitment and/or maintenance of the PRC2 required for gene silencing.</p>
<p id="P26">Our data suggest that the function of PRC2 in adult neurons lies in the suppression of bivalent genes, while the majority of H3K27me-associated gene suppression does not depend on PRC2 activity. The necessity of PRC2 for bivalent gene silencing in adult neurons is consistent with a similar role of PRC2 in bivalent gene suppression-mediated patterning of the tissue-specific gene expression patterns in the adult mouse intestine, blood, and skin cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P27">The PRC2 deficiency in MSNs leads to a surprisingly delayed -with respect to the timing of the onset of the H3K27me3 deficiency- up-regulation of a limited group of bivalent PRC2 targets that are enriched for genes encoding other cell/neuron type-specific transcriptional regulators. These selective changes in gene expression may reflect the ability of many of the up-regulated transcription factors to form auto- or co-regulatory transcriptional networks. It is possible that loss of H3K27me3 and the ensuing acquisition of H3K27Ac may lead to a transcriptionally promiscuous state of a large number of PRC2 targets. However, only those that can form auto-/co-regulatory networks will reach detectable RNA expression levels over time. The selective up-regulation of genes in PRC2 deficient cells may therefore reflect not only the role of H3K27me3 in transcriptional silencing but also the specific transcriptional features of the de-repressed PRC2 gene targets. Our data suggest that the H3K27me3 target genes may not be particularly sensitive to PRC2 deficiency but may become expressed at relatively high levels due to the ability to form mutually reinforcing transcriptional network(s).</p>
<p id="P28">The slow, age-dependent up-regulation of non-MSN specific transcriptional regulators does not lead to an induction of other cell/neuron type-specific gene programs but is associated with the subsequent down-regulation of MSN-specific genes. The PRC2-dependent changes in MSN gene expression, physiology, and survival, while having distinct mechanistic foundations, are likely to reinforce each other causing progressive and fatal neurodegeneration. For example, the ectopic expression of <italic>Ccnd1</italic>, which is associated with excitotoxic neuronal death, and <italic>Wt1,</italic> which is implicated in mediating neuronal degeneration in AD, can trigger cell death in neurons <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. At the same time, attenuated expression of MSN-specific neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels, such as <italic>Kcnd2,</italic> in PRC2 deficient MSNs can lead to pathological neuronal excitability, which may initiate secondary PRC2-independent events that promote cell death in a cell-intrinsic or -extrinsic fashion. The neurodegenerative process, while initially triggered by PRC2-deficiency, may progress with the help of PRC2 independent mechanism. This scenario could preclude the identification of a single factor downstream of PRC2 that is responsible for the progression of neurodegeneration.</p>
<p id="P29">The progressive neurodegeneration in mice lacking the PRC2 in MSNs or PCs reinforces the notion of the involvement of PRC2 in neurodegenerative diseases in humans. We found that the loss of the PRC2 in adult forebrain neurons leads to HD-like changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). 20-30% of the PRC2-target genes that become up-regulated in PRC2-deficient MSNs, including <italic>Pou4f1/2, Hand2, Nkx2-5</italic>, <italic>Twist1</italic>, <italic>Tal1, Wt1</italic>, and numerous <italic>Hox</italic> genes, significantly overlap with genes that are up-regulated in the postmortem human brains of HD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> or HD mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Table 7</xref>).</p>
<p id="P30">Similarly to the up-regulated genes, ∼50% of the genes that become down-regulated in PRC2 deficient MSNs (54/119, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Table 7</xref>) significantly overlap with genes that are down-regulated in the brain of HD patients or mouse models of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P31">In addition to the overlap in gene expression, PRC2 deficient MSNs display alterations in MSN physiology in a fashion that resembles mouse MSNs affected by HD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Similar to HD-affected neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, PRC2-deficient MSNs display enhanced intrinsic excitability in combination with increased input resistance. Moreover, cellular alterations, including the presence of γH2ax loci and the dark cell degeneration phenotype, are reminiscent of neurodegeneration in HD in mice and in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Concurrent with the alterations in MSN-specific gene expression and function, mice with a forebrain neuron specific PRC2 deficiency develop progressive and fatal neurodegeneration that is similar to HD in mice and in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Despite obvious phenotypic similarities between molecular, cellular and behavioral defects caused by neuronal PRC2 deficiency and neurons affected by HD, it would be naïve to equate these two conditions. HD is a complex disorder in which the mutant huntingtin protein can affect various cytoplasmic as well as nuclear processes that collectively contribute to MSN degeneration. However, our data give more credence to the contribution of epigenetic mechanisms, particularly to PRC2-mediated gene expression regulation, in HD pathology and possibly in other neurodegenerative processes.</p>
<p id="P32">The general relevance of the PRC2 in neurodegenerative processes is further supported by studies that show changes in PRC2 activity and a genome-wide redistribution of H2K27me3 during ATM deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and a de-repression of PRC2 target genes in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P33">In summary, our data reveal the important role of the PRC2 in the maintenance of adult neuron specification, function and survival. Exposure to cell extrinsic or intrinsic stressors that can alter neuronal activity and/or metabolism may destabilize the neuronal subtype-specific gene expression patterns by affecting the bivalent state of non-neuronal genes or genes of other neuronal types. As discussed, changes in PRC2 function could be triggered either transiently, by non-persisting events such as seizures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, or permanently, by the expression of pathogenic proteins such as mutant huntingtin protein, which can directly interfere with PRC2 recruitment and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. In view of our findings, the presence of the large number of self-regulatory transcription factors among PRC2 targets suggest that changes in proteins that control H3K27me3 levels or chromatin distribution globally or locally can trigger self-propagating transcriptional processes that set neurons on a path of neurodegeneration. Altered neuron specification may interfere with coordinated function of neuronal networks and may be harmful for overall brain function. It is plausible that neurons possess an intrinsic mechanism that triggers the elimination of neurons with defective specification during development. It is tempting to speculate that the activation of the PRC2-controlled death-promoting genes may represent this check-point mechanism that enables the elimination of neurons with impaired PRC2 function. While short-term activation of such a mechanism could be beneficial for ensuring brain integrity, persistent changes in the activity or recruitment of PRC2, as well as other H3K27me3 controlling enzymes, may lead to systemic neurodegeneration.</p>

Purification with the IPure kit was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions with the addition of Proteinase K treatment (Roche, 03115828001) for one hour at 55 °C after the de-crosslinking step. Immune-enriched chromatin was further purified with phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25:24:1) and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. ChIP-sequencing libraries were prepared using the ChIP-Seq DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, IP-102-1001) using an adapter oligo dilution of 1:25 for all samples. Prepared samples were amplified onto flowcells using the Illumina Cluster Station or cBot per manufacturer protocol and sequenced on either the Illumina GAIIx for 36 cycles or the HiSeq 2000 platform for 50 cycles. Raw sequencing data was processed using the onboard SCS/RTA software yielding 36 bp reads for GAIIx data. Datasets from the HiSeq 2000 platform were trimmed back to 36 bp to compare with the GAIIx data.</p>

<title>ChIP-Sequencing analysis</title>
<p id="P42">Sequences were aligned using bowtie v0.12.7, allowing for ≤ 2 mismatches to the reference in 36bp. We generated sets of high quality and uniquely (&lt; 60%) aligned reads for H3K27me3, H3K4me3, PolII, and H3K27acetyl from wild-type C57Bl/6 neuronal and glia nuclei. For the Ezh1 and Ezh2 and Ezh1/2 mutant MSN nuclei, ChIP sequencing experiments yielded high quality and uniquely aligned reads (&lt; 60%) for H3K27me3. Uniquely mapped reads were used for subsequent analysis. Browser files were made with IGV Tools using the count option, extending the reads 100 bp to account for the anticipated size of the immunoprecipitated fragments. Peak calling was performed using MACS v1.4, and CCAT v3.0. ChIP-Seq profiles were created by counting the number of reads in 50 bp bins upstream and downstream of the indicated genomic feature for the length indicated on the x-axis. TSS coordinates were obtained from RefSeq gene annotations downloaded from the UCSC genome browser. Reads were extended 100 bp to account for the size of the fragment isolated by the ChIP reaction. Integrated profiles were created by averaging the observed signal for each bin for the selected set of relevant genes; values displayed indicate fragments per 50 bp bin per million mapped reads. Using a very restrictive false discovery rate (FDR) = 5% as a cutoff and a significance score (fold-change score over input) of 2, we identified 9471 genes, and 15052 genes for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, respectively. An FPKM cutoff of &gt; 1.2 was applied to yield high H3K27me3 (2057) and H3K4me3 (10007) genes, which were also used to identify gene bivalency. Heatmap displays were generated by ordering all genes by the indicated ranking (gene expression/H3K27me3 enrichment) and generated with Java TreeView. FPKM values were computed by calculating the number of reads per million per kb with respect to the TSS coordinates of RefSeq transcript. A pseudocount of one read per 25 million mapped reads was added to avoid division by zero errors. Values were rank-ordered and used for iPAGE analysis. iPAGE analysis was performed as described in Goodarzi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Briefly, genes are organized into even-numbered bins based on specific criteria; in this case genes were rank ordered according to H3K27me3 enrichment with respect to the TSS. Each bin and its neighboring bins are assessed for over/under-representation of ontology terms. This approach allows for the simultaneous display of specific terms or pathways that are over or under-represented in either of both, high or low ranking transcripts. Gene ontology was analyzed using the online DAVID gene ontology program specifying for biological processes. P-values of representative GO categories are displayed in bar graphs.</p>

The networks connecting the genes up-regulated in PRC2-deficient MSNs at 6 month of age are based on experimental evidence from published ChIP-sequencing datasets from ChEA and ENCODE. Only studies in mice were included. TFs are colored in pink, non-TF genes are colored in blue. Nodes with outgoing links have evidence from ChIP-sequencing data. The size of the nodes is proportional to their connectivity degree.</p>
