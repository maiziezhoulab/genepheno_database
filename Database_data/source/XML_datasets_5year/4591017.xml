<abstract>
<p>Despite many years of study into inversions, very little is known about their functional consequences, especially in humans. A common hypothesis is that the selective value of inversions stems in part from their effects on nearby genes, although evidence of this in natural populations is almost nonexistent. Here we present a global analysis of a new 415-kb polymorphic inversion that is among the longest ones found in humans and is the first with clear position effects. This inversion is located in chromosome 19 and has been generated by non-homologous end joining between blocks of transposable elements with low identity. PCR genotyping in 541 individuals from eight different human populations allowed the detection of tag SNPs and inversion genotyping in multiple populations worldwide, showing that the inverted allele is mainly found in East Asia with an average frequency of 4.7%. Interestingly, one of the breakpoints disrupts the transcription factor gene <italic>ZNF257</italic>, causing a significant reduction in the total expression level of this gene in lymphoblastoid cell lines. RNA-Seq analysis of the effects of this expression change in standard homozygotes and inversion heterozygotes revealed distinct expression patterns that were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Moreover, we have found a new fusion transcript that is generated exclusively from inverted chromosomes around one of the breakpoints. Finally, by the analysis of the associated nucleotide variation, we have estimated that the inversion was generated ~40,000–50,000 years ago and, while a neutral evolution cannot be ruled out, its current frequencies are more consistent with those expected for a deleterious variant, although no significant association with phenotypic traits has been found so far.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Since the discovery of chromosomal inversions almost 100 years ago, how they are maintained in natural populations has been a highly debated issue. One of the hypotheses is that inversion breakpoints could affect genes and modify gene expression levels, although evidence of this came only from laboratory mutants. In humans, a few inversions have been shown to associate with expression differences, but in all cases the molecular causes have remained elusive. Here, we have carried out a complete characterization of a new human polymorphic inversion and determined that it is specific to East Asian populations. In addition, we demonstrate that it disrupts the <italic>ZNF257</italic> gene and, through the translocation of the first exon and regulatory sequences, creates a previously nonexistent fusion transcript, which together are associated to expression changes in several other genes. Finally, we investigate the potential evolutionary and phenotypic consequences of the inversion, and suggest that it is probably deleterious. This is therefore the first example of a natural polymorphic inversion that has position effects and creates a new chimeric gene, contributing to answer an old question in evolutionary biology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polymorphic inversions have been known for a long time to segregate in the genomes of multiple species, ranging from insects to plants and animals, and constitute one of the most studied paradigms in evolutionary biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref003">3</xref>]. Given that they just change the orientation of a chromosomal segment and often do not result in gain or loss of DNA, inversions could easily be considered neutral variants, but far from this, their adaptive value and phenotypic effects are becoming increasingly clear. For example, in several species of <italic>Drosophila</italic> inversions affect characters like body size or developmental time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref002">2</xref>], and some of them exhibit latitudinal or altitudinal clines that strongly suggest adaptation to different environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref004">4</xref>]. Inversions have also been attributed roles in flowering time and reproductive isolation between two ecotypes of monkeyflower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref005">5</xref>], wing-pattern morphs in mimetic butterflies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref006">6</xref>], stickleback fish freshwater adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref007">7</xref>], or in the social behavior and plumage color in sparrows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref008">8</xref>], and even a human 900-kb inversion in chromosome 17 is thought to affect fertility and be positively selected in European populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>However, the molecular mechanisms by which inversions are able to affect phenotype are not yet clear. Two main mechanisms have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref010">10</xref>]. One is based on the effective suppression of recombination within the inverted sequence between standard and inverted chromosomes. This suppression can occur both through the reduced pairing and crossing over due to the formation of inversion loops in heterozygotes, and by selection against the unbalanced gametes resulting from unique crossovers within the inverted segment. In this case, the advantage of an inversion could be caused by the capture of a favorable combination of alleles maintained together in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) due to the reduction of recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref012">12</xref>]. Another option is that the phenotypic consequences of inversions depend on the mutational effect of their breakpoints on adjacent genes. Breakpoints can disrupt genes as happens in several disease-causing mutations in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref015">15</xref>] or modify gene expression by separating coding regions from their regulatory elements or by providing new regulatory regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref017">17</xref>]. One striking example is the <italic>Rose-comb</italic> mutation in chickens, in which ectopic expression of a gene relocated by a 7.4-Mb inversion causes altered comb morphology and a gene disrupted by the same inversion has been associated to poor sperm motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref018">18</xref>]. Also, in humans, certain inversions mediated by repeats of complex structure seem to predispose to microdeletions that cause genetic disorders in the offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref020">20</xref>], although in these cases, the disease-causing mutation is the deletion rather than the inversion. Nevertheless, very few cases of position effects have been identified for polymorphic inversions in natural populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Inversions represent a special challenge in complex genomes such as that of humans, not only due to their balanced nature, but also because their breakpoints are usually located within highly identical inverted repeated sequences that can reach large sizes (&gt;100 kb). For these reasons, inversions have often been set aside in favor of other structural variants that are easier to detect, like copy number variants (CNVs). In recent years, the use of high-throughput techniques like paired-end mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref024">24</xref>] has allowed the detection of multiple candidate regions to contain inversions in the human genome, but it is necessary to validate them since many represent different types of errors rather than real polymorphic variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref025">25</xref>]. Besides, large projects that try to characterize all human variation like the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref026">26</xref>] might miss many inversions, either because short next-generation sequencing reads and paired-ends are not able to cross long repeats causing inversions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref027">27</xref>], or due to the low coverage and difficulty of mapping reads containing simple breakpoint sequences.</p>
<p>So far, only a few polymorphic inversions not directly related to pathological processes have been studied in detail in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref030">30</xref>]. Some of them have been associated to different expression levels of genes contained within the inverted sequence, such as the polymorphic inversion in chromosome 17q21 that is associated to a decreased <italic>MAPT</italic> expression, among other expression changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref031">31</xref>], or the 4.5-Mb inversion at 8p23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref029">29</xref>] and the 0.45-Mb inversion at chromosome 16p11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref032">32</xref>], where computationally-predicted inversion alleles correlate with expression levels of several genes. However, we do not know if these expression changes are consequence of position effects caused by the inversion breakpoints or of specific nucleotide changes captured by the inversion. These inversions have also been associated with certain phenotypes, such as recombination, fertility and several neurodegenerative diseases for the 17q21 inversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref034">34</xref>], or asthma and obesity for the 16p11 inversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref032">32</xref>], but the mechanisms linking the differentially expressed genes in the inverted region to their phenotypic consequences have not been completely elucidated. Other inversions have breakpoints located in positions where effects on adjacent genes would be expected. This is the case of a recently-described 16.5-kb polymorphic inversion that disrupts chymotrypsinogen precursor genes <italic>CTRB1</italic> and <italic>CTRB2</italic> by exchanging their respective first exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref030">30</xref>], although as both genes belong to the same family, complete copies are reconstructed in the inverted arrangement.</p>
<p>In this work, we describe a new polymorphic inversion found at a 4.7% frequency in East Asians, which represents one of the few inversions genotyped in several worldwide populations that show a limited geographical distribution. In addition, the inversion disrupts and inactivates a transcription factor gene and generates a new transcript in inverted chromosomes, thus providing mechanisms by which it may be directly affecting phenotype. Finally, we show that these changes are able to generate distinct genome-wide expression patterns and investigate the inversion’s functional and evolutionary impact.</p>

<title>Identification of inversion breakpoints</title>
<p>Using available fosmid paired-end mapping data in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref022">22</xref>], HsInv0379 inversion was predicted in chromosomal band 19p12 in a region close to the centromere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref025">25</xref>]. This inversion was supported by five discordant fosmid clones belonging to a Japanese individual, NA18956, who also has concordant clones in the same genomic region. The analysis of available partial sequences from fosmid ABC9-45236600J18 insert obtained by 454 shotgun sequencing confirmed the presence of an inversion breakpoint, since these sequences map in two different regions separated by more than 400 kb on the GRCh37 (HG19) reference genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Therefore, a fragment of 7 kb including the inversion breakpoint 1 (BP1) was amplified by PCR from the fosmid DNA and analyzed by restriction mapping with several enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), which allowed us to locate the breakpoint within a 1.5-kb segment. Primers flanking this region were then used to amplify and sequence a 1,894-bp band containing the breakpoint directly from individual NA18956 genomic DNA. The alignment of this sequence in the inverted chromosome (<italic>Inv</italic>) with the reference genome (<italic>Std</italic>) revealed BP1 exact position, defining regions A (outside the inversion) and B and C (inside the inversion) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The mapping in the reference genome of sequence C allowed us to locate breakpoint 2 (BP2) and an 850-bp BD PCR product was amplified and sequenced from NA18956 genomic DNA.</p>

</fig>
<p>The analysis of BP1 and BP2 sequences revealed clean breaks with no insertions or deletions that were located at HG19 chr19 positions 21830133–21830134 (BP1) and 22245260–22245261 (BP2), resulting in a 415-kb inversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g001">Fig 1</xref>). BP1 falls within the first copy (42.9-kb long) of a pair of inverted segmental duplications located 24.5 kb apart, although they show only a 91.6% identity and present multiple indels that make the mapping of BP1 unequivocal. Both inversion breakpoints are located within blocks of transposable elements (TEs) of 14.3 kb in BP1 and 4.9 kb in BP2 formed by a LINE element with several <italic>Alu</italic> sequences inserted inside at different positions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Even though the composition of both blocks is similar, the nucleotide identity between them is very low and the inversion breakpoints occurred within <italic>L1</italic> elements of different subfamilies in a direct orientation with respect to each other, which suggests that the inversion was not generated by non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). No microhomology was detected at the breakpoints either. Therefore, the most plausible generation mechanism for this inversion is non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). These TE blocks also indicate that the <italic>Std</italic> chromosome corresponds to the ancestral arrangement because the <italic>L1</italic> copies are abruptly interrupted at the breakpoint in the derived <italic>Inv</italic> sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). In addition, the <italic>Std</italic> arrangement is found in the chimpanzee genome sequence (PanTro4 assembly).</p>

<title>Inversion frequency and geographical distribution</title>
<p>To find out its distribution and frequency in different human populations, inversion HsInv0379 has been genotyped using three different strategies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005495.t001">Table 1</xref>). First, 534 individuals from seven human HapMap populations (CEU and TSI of European origin, YRI and LWK of African origin, and GIH, CHB and JPT of Asian origin; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005495.t001">Table 1</xref> for details) were genotyped by multiplex PCR across the breakpoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Only five individuals carrying the inversion in heterozygosis were found, all in East Asian populations (ASN), two CHB (2.2% <italic>Inv</italic> frequency) and three JPT (3.3% <italic>Inv</italic> frequency), and inversion genotypes fit perfectly Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<italic>P</italic> = 0.4636).</p>

<title>HsInv0379 genotyping and frequency in different populations.</title>
<p>Number of individuals genotyped by PCR across inversion breakpoints, tag SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium with the inversion, and sequence reads spanning inversion breakpoints (BreakSeq). The number of unrelated individuals genotyped is also given together with genotype counts and allelic frequencies for each analyzed population.</p>

<p>Second, taking advantage of the fact that many individuals genotyped by PCR had been sequenced in the 1000GP Phase 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref026">26</xref>], we searched for SNPs in LD with the inversion. The comparison of the SNP genotypes in the inverted segment plus 20 kb of flanking sequence revealed three tag SNPs (rs150182828, rs142395395 and rs148316037) with alleles that segregate in complete LD with the inversion (<italic>r</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = 1). For these three SNPs, which span 400.8 kb, all <italic>Std</italic> chromosomes carry the ancestral reference alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g001">Fig 1</xref>) while the five heterozygote individuals are the only ones with the alternative alleles, also in heterozygosis. Two tag SNPs are located within the inverted sequence in intergenic regions and the third one right outside, in an intron of gene <italic>ZNF257</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The analysis of the recently released SNP calls for 2,535 genomes included in 1000GP Phase 3 (ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/) together with the already published 1,092 genomes in Phase 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref026">26</xref>], and 96 Malay genomes from the Singapore Sequencing Malay Project (SSMP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref035">35</xref>] allowed us to identify 56 additional candidate individuals to carry the inversion based on the tag SNPs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005495.t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s006">S1 Table</xref>). All these individuals carry the alternative alleles for the three SNPs except five individuals, which have only two of the alleles, and HG02152 (CDX), that is homozygous for two alternative SNP alleles. The predicted inversion genotypes were confirmed by PCR in six of the new heterozygotes and the <italic>Inv</italic> homozygote. Interestingly, almost all the potential inversion carriers belong to East Asian populations (CHB, JPT, CHS, CDX, KHV and Malays), but we also identified a Bengali (BEB) and a Mexican (MXL) individual that are clearly heterozygous for the three tag SNPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s006">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we performed similarity searches against the reads of 1,892 individuals from 19 populations available at the 1000GP ftp site on summer 2013 (including both mapped and unmapped reads) using 100-bp sequences spanning the two breakpoints in each arrangement as queries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s007">S2 Table</xref>). Reads containing at least one of the inversion breakpoints (from either <italic>Std</italic> or <italic>Inv</italic> orientation) were retrieved for 482 individuals, with an average of just 3.6 reads/individual due to the low coverage of many of these genomes. Of those, <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes were detected in 19 of 20 candidate <italic>Std</italic>/<italic>Inv</italic> heterozygotes according to the tag SNPs (the remaining individual having one <italic>Std</italic> read), whereas only reads corresponding to the <italic>Std</italic> arrangement were recovered from the 462 predicted <italic>Std</italic>/<italic>Std</italic> individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s006">S1 Table</xref>). <italic>Std</italic> alleles were also detected in nine of the inversion carriers, validating their heterozygote status. In total, we have independent PCR and/or breakpoint-sequence confirmation of the <italic>Inv</italic> allele for 25 of the 61 individuals (41%) predicted by the tag SNPs to carry the inversion (59 unrelated; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s006">S1 Table</xref>). Therefore, we can confidently use these SNPs as proxies to detect <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes. Overall, inversion genotypes were determined for 2,771 individuals (2,667 excluding related individuals; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005495.t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s006">S1 Table</xref>), of which 197 individuals from different populations have been genotyped by the three methods and results are in complete agreement. These genotypes reveal an inversion frequency of 1.12% worldwide and of 4.73% in East Asia, which ranges from ~2.5% in the Northern populations to ~7% in the Southern populations (being Malays an exception with a frequency of 3.65%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005495.t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Functional consequences of the inversion</title>
<p>The HsInv0379 inverted segment contains three protein-coding genes: <italic>ZNF100</italic>, <italic>ZNF43</italic> and <italic>ZNF208</italic> and at least one long intergenic non-coding RNA (reported in GENCODE v19 gene annotation). A fourth protein-coding gene, <italic>ZNF257</italic>, appears to be disrupted by BP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g001">Fig 1</xref>). <italic>ZNF257</italic> encodes a transcription factor with a <italic>Krüppel</italic>-associated box (KRAB) repressor domain and 13 zinc fingers. This gene has two main transcripts of 3,520 and 3,641 nucleotides, which are transcribed from the same promoter but differ in the presence of an extra non-coding second exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The inversion removes the first two exons as well as the promoter of this gene, which are relocated 415 kb away in the <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes. Thus, total <italic>ZNF257</italic> expression (both isoforms included) was quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) of 15 <italic>Std</italic>/<italic>Std</italic> and 11 <italic>Std</italic>/<italic>Inv</italic> individuals from the CHB and JPT populations, plus the <italic>Inv/Inv</italic> homozygote (CDX). A 2.9-fold decrease (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0047) was found in the inversion carriers compared to the homozygote <italic>Std</italic> individuals and no expression was detected in the <italic>Inv/Inv</italic> individual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), indicating that, as expected, this gene is not expressed from the <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes. However, five <italic>Std</italic>/<italic>Std</italic> individuals showed an extremely low <italic>ZNF257</italic> expression, comparable to the levels in inversion carriers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). These individuals are all from the CHB population and most likely carry some regulatory variant in <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> that causes a lower expression of <italic>ZNF257</italic> not related to the presence of the inversion. In fact, an analysis of Geuvadis RNA-Seq data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref036">36</xref>] in LCLs from European and YRI populations (which include only <italic>Std/Std</italic> homozygotes) indicates that <italic>ZNF257</italic> is among the top 10% genes with highest variation in expression among those with similar low expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In addition, several studies including the recent results from the GTEx project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref037">37</xref>] suggest the existence of eQTLs for the gene, with 13 SNPs significantly associated to <italic>ZNF257</italic> expression in different tissues, although due to the transformation of the data during the analysis the biological interpretation of the observed effects is not easy. In our data set, each of these SNPs explains 9.8–19.8% of the variation of <italic>ZNF257</italic> expression in <italic>Std</italic>/<italic>Std</italic> homozygotes, which contrasts with the 27.6% explained by the inversion across all the samples assuming an additive model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s008">S3 Table</xref>).</p>

The longer transcript includes an extra 121-bp alternative non-coding exon in its 5’ UTR and in theory encodes a 32-aa shorter protein because of the shift in the methionine (Met) used as translation initiation from the three last nucleotides of the first exon to the third exon, common to both isoforms.

</fig>
<p>Since <italic>ZNF257</italic> is a transcription factor that may be controlling the expression of other genes, we searched for genome-wide expression changes associated to the inversion by analyzing the RNA-Seq profiles of LCLs in eight of the previous <italic>Std</italic>/<italic>Std</italic> and <italic>Std</italic>/<italic>Inv</italic> individuals showing discrepant levels of <italic>ZNF257</italic> expression (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s009">S4 Table</xref> for RNA-Seq summary results). We detected 56 differentially expressed protein-coding genes and 27 non-coding RNAs (False Discovery Rate, FDR &lt; 0.1), of which 49 were down-regulated and 34 up-regulated, although 60 of them (72.3%) have an FDR &lt; 0.05. These genes exhibit moderate to high fold changes (1.2–8.7) with the greater variation corresponding to non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s010">S5 Table</xref>), and none of them are located within or close to the inverted sequence. Because only four individuals of each genotype were compared, the results could be confounded by differences between the two groups other than the presence of the inversion. Thus, we repeated the analysis for the 18 possible permutations exchanging two individuals from each genotype class (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). The median proportion of genes differentially expressed between the two groups in the permutations was 0.17%, which is ~3 times less than those identified between <italic>Std/Std</italic> and <italic>Std/Inv</italic> individuals using the same criteria (0.47%, at a nominal FDR &lt; 0.1). Besides, none of the genes identified in the permutations were in the differentially expressed list from the inversion genotype comparison. We also performed 400 simulations of read counts with the mean and dispersion of the real data and searched for differentially expressed genes with FDR &lt; 0.1 in each case. Only 5.5% of the simulations had a higher number of differentially expressed genes than the comparison of individuals with different inversion genotypes.</p>
<p>Next, several enrichment analysis tools (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Methods</xref>) were used to try to detect functional relationships among the differentially expressed genes, but no statistically significant functional categories have been uncovered based on current knowledge. However, immune response was the most significant biological process gene-ontology category in the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool (<italic>P</italic> = 0.00091), although significance was lost after correcting for multiple testing. Thus, we selected 11 genes involved in the immune system with different fold-change values and FDRs to validate their expression in the whole set of available LCL RNAs (15 <italic>Std/Std</italic>, 11 <italic>Std/Inv</italic> and 1 <italic>Inv/Inv</italic>) using qPCR. All the genes except one showed good validation when considering only the eight individuals used in the RNA-Seq analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005495.t002">Table 2</xref>). In the large sample set, the expression difference was always in the expected direction (up or down regulated) except for one gene (<italic>NFATC1</italic>), but qPCR validation depended on the gene’s FDR. For FDR &lt; 0.05, significant differences between <italic>Std/Std</italic> and <italic>Std/Inv</italic> were obtained for three genes, while the other three were marginally significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005495.t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Of the three genes with FDR = 0.05–0.10, only the expression difference of the <italic>CACNB2</italic> gene (FDR = 0.077) could be validated, while none of the two genes tested with higher FDR showed significant differences. As for <italic>ZNF257</italic>, <italic>w</italic>e also see a significant or marginally-significant correlation between the expression levels and inversion genotype (<italic>Std/Std</italic> or <italic>Std/Inv</italic>) for five genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005495.t002">Table 2</xref>), in which inversion genotype explains between 10% and 19% of the variation in gene expression. Therefore, there is a clear association between inversion genotypes and gene expression of several genes in <italic>trans</italic>. In the case of the <italic>Inv/Inv</italic> sample, it behaves as expected from the expression change observed in heterozygotes in 7 of the 11 genes tested, although since expression levels for any given gene can be affected by many variables, it is difficult to draw reliable conclusions with a single individual.</p>

<p>Since we found five <italic>Std/Std</italic> individuals with low expression levels of <italic>ZNF257</italic> mRNA, we have an opportunity to test the relationship between this gene and the detected expression changes. A marginally significant correlation between the <italic>ZNF257</italic> expression values and that of the other genes tested by qPCR in the 26 <italic>Std/Std</italic> or <italic>Std/Inv</italic> individuals was found for two genes, <italic>SNHG5</italic> and <italic>BCL11A</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005495.t002">Table 2</xref>), which indicates that a low <italic>ZNF257</italic> expression level is associated to an increase in the two genes. Accordingly, for these genes the significance of the expression change between <italic>Std/Std</italic> and <italic>Std/Inv</italic> is higher when the five <italic>Std/Std</italic> with low <italic>ZNF257</italic> expression are removed from the homozygous <italic>Std</italic> group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0140 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.0096, respectively). Conversely, this does not happen for other genes like <italic>CACNB2</italic>, which shows no clear association with <italic>ZNF257</italic>, suggesting that these expression changes depend more on inversion genotype than on <italic>ZNF257</italic> level.</p>
<p>Another important effect of the inversion is that it brings the <italic>ZNF257</italic> promoter and first exons to a completely different part of the genome, where they might induce the transcription of new chimeric transcripts. Therefore, we specifically searched for transcripts generated by the <italic>ZNF257</italic> promoter around BP1 in <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes. By mapping RNA-Seq reads to a construct with the inverted sequence, we detected a spliced fusion transcript formed by the first exon of gene <italic>ZNF257</italic> and a completely new 296-bp exon made up of fragments of LINE and <italic>Alu</italic> elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g004">Fig 4</xref>). We confirmed the existence of this RNA by amplifying most of it by RT-PCR and by sequencing the exon-exon junction in individual NA18956. Indeed, both by RT-PCR and qPCR the fusion transcript was found in the 11 inversion carriers analyzed, with 1.7-fold higher expression levels in the <italic>Inv/Inv</italic> individual, while it is not expressed in any of the <italic>Std</italic>/<italic>Std</italic> individuals tested (including three non-East Asian individuals) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g004">Fig 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The complete new transcript is short, with only 468 bases, and its longest ORF contains only 75 aa. It does not show homology to any other known transcript either. However, according to the RNA-Seq reads mapping to the <italic>ZNF257</italic> exon 1 (common to the two genes) in inversion heterozygotes that express both transcripts and in <italic>Std</italic> homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g004">Fig 4</xref>), the level of expression of the fusion transcript is at least 7.4 times higher than that of <italic>ZNF257</italic>.</p>

<p>Because the inversion tag SNPs are not included in SNP genotyping arrays, the potential functional effects of the inversion have been missed by typical genome-wide association studies. Therefore, based on the lymphoblast transcriptomic results, we made an attempt to associate the inversion allele with general blood-related phenotypic traits by genotyping the inversion tag SNP rs148316037 in 3,787 Japanese individuals of the Nagahama cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref041">41</xref>]. The inversion showed a frequency of 1.95% in this population with a single homozygote and 146 heterozygotes, which fits perfectly the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<italic>P</italic> = 0.71). A regression analysis was performed to assess the effects of the inversion on immunological, hematological and metabolic measures from blood samples available for this cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s011">S6 Table</xref>). However, no significant associations have been detected between HsInv0379 inversion alleles and the phenotypical traits analyzed, including disease indicators for diabetes and cardiovascular or liver disease, as well as alterations in blood cell counts or presence of certain antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s011">S6 Table</xref>). Only red blood cell count shows a decrease in inversion carriers (<italic>P</italic> = 0.036), but this association is lost after multiple testing correction.</p>

<sec id="sec006">
<title>Origin and evolutionary history of the inversion</title>
<p>The presence of tag SNPs and identical breakpoints in the reads of all <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes indicate that the inversion was generated only once from the ancestral <italic>Std</italic> orientation. Thus, to investigate the evolutionary history of the inversion, we first estimated the age of the derived <italic>Inv</italic> allele. We used in this analysis the unphased Malay population SNP data set from the SSMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref035">35</xref>] because it provides accurate SNP genotypes for 96 individuals based on &gt;30x coverage sequencing. In 381,827 bp of the inverted region we identified 30 SNPs that are polymorphic exclusively in the seven <italic>Std</italic>/<italic>Inv</italic> heterozygotes (out of 2,005 SNPs without missing values). Of these, one corresponds to the tag SNP rs142395395 and four SNPs are found only in three heterozygotes, so they most likely represent variants specific of the <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes (the probability that one such variant belongs to <italic>Std</italic> chromosomes is <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001). The remaining 25 variants are singletons, and 22 were attributed to the seven <italic>Std</italic> chromosomes in heterozygotes (on average there are 3.12 singletons/chromosome), leaving 3 singletons in <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes. Based on this variation, we determined a nucleotide diversity (π) of 8.86 × 10<sup>−4</sup> for <italic>Std</italic> and 9.73 × 10<sup>−6</sup> for <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes. We used the divergence between the human and chimpanzee genomes (d<sub>H-C</sub> = 0.0134) to establish a local substitution rate for this region. Taking into account this substitution rate and the pairwise divergence between <italic>Std</italic> and <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes (d<sub>S-I</sub> = 9.95 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), after subtracting the variation among ancestral <italic>Std</italic> haplotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref042">42</xref>], we estimated the age of the inversion in 43,450 years (95% confidence interval (CI): 14,934–93,438) or 52,140 years (95% CI: 17,921–112,126), assuming a divergence time between human and chimpanzee of 5 or 6 mya, respectively.</p>
<p>Next, to understand better the effects of the inversion on the nucleotide variation patterns, we phased the SNPs for a 4-Mb region around the inverted segment in the 286 1000GP Phase 1 East Asian individuals (97 CHB, 100 CHS and 89 JPT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref026">26</xref>] to infer <italic>Std</italic> and <italic>Inv</italic> haplotypes. In this case, there are two main challenges for SNP phasing. First, the inversion has a low frequency and there are no <italic>Inv</italic>/<italic>Inv</italic> homozygotes in the 1000GP Phase 1 dataset from where to recognize SNP variants present exclusively in the derived arrangement (which are always found in <italic>Std</italic>/<italic>Inv</italic> individuals and are difficult to place in one of the chromosomes unequivocally). Second, inversion length increases the possibility of phasing errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref043">43</xref>]. To minimize these effects, we used the BEAGLE software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref044">44</xref>] to filter and call the SNP genotypes based on their likelihoods in each individual, and then to phase the different variants (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Methods</xref> for details). A total of 15,799 high-quality SNPs in 570 phased haplotypes (excluding the two chromosomes of one heterozygote individual, in which a phasing error between inversion breakpoints was detected) were finally included in posterior analyses.</p>
<p>These haplotypes were used to estimate the proportion of each chromosome that belongs to a number K of hypothetical ancestral populations with the software STRUCTURE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref045">45</xref>]. Notably, the <italic>Inv</italic> arrangement shows a single component even when a high number of ancestry components (K = 10) is considered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). At the well-supported value of K = 5, the proportion of the <italic>Inv</italic> component in <italic>Std</italic> chromosomes is 12.9% in JPT, 6.3% in CHB and 10.5% in CHS, which suggests that <italic>Inv</italic> haplotypes are similarly related to any group of <italic>Std</italic> chromosomes and probably appeared before the establishment of the different East Asian populations, as the estimated age suggests. In addition, this highlights the highly homogeneous composition of <italic>Inv</italic> haplotypes due to its relatively recent and unique origin as well as the lack of gene flow between arrangements. Similar results were obtained by building an haplotype network, in which all the haplotypes with the inversion form a closely related and monophyletic group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Although phasing and SNP imputation errors might affect nucleotide variation estimates, we have also examined the global variation patterns of π and Tajima's D statistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref046">46</xref>] along and beyond the inverted region in the 1000GP Phase 1 dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Consistent with the age estimates, there are low levels of nucleotide diversity and negative values of Tajima's D within the inverted haplotypes, which extend outside the breakpoints. We then tried to determine the effects of the inversion on recombination by inferring population-scaled recombination rates (4N<sub>e</sub>r/kb) between each pair of consecutive SNPs in the 24 <italic>Inv</italic> and 24 randomly sampled <italic>Std</italic> phased chromosomes from the three East Asian populations. As expected since most <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes are found in heterozygotes, there is a marked reduction in recombination within the inverted segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g005">Fig 5</xref>), which shows a genetic length of 83 4N<sub>e</sub>r units in <italic>Std</italic> East Asian chromosomes and only 5 in <italic>Inv</italic>. Accordingly, the distribution of F<sub>st</sub> values between SNPs in <italic>Std</italic> and <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes shows increased differentiation within the inverted region, which is maximal at the breakpoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This reduction of recombination in heterozygotes is apparent even taking into account that the phased chromosomes used in this analysis can include a higher proportion of shared variants due to the phasing problems explained above. In fact, in the high-coverage SSMP data only two SNPs with enough read support were found to be shared between arrangements and were likely generated by gene conversion.</p>

<p>Finally, we looked for evidences of natural selection acting on this inversion with two approaches. First, we searched for recent partial selective sweeps in this region by applying the integrated haplotype score (iHS) test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref047">47</xref>] to the 5,890 SNPs with available ancestral state information (37.3% of the phased SNPs). Although this test may be affected by recombination inhibition, no significant signals of recent positive selection were detected for the proximal (<italic>P</italic> = 0.67) or distal (<italic>P</italic> = 0.83) breakpoints or any SNPs in high LD with the inversion. Second, we used forward-in-time simulations to compare the observed frequency of the inversion with that expected under a human demographic model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref049">49</xref>] and different evolutionary scenarios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Population-scaled selection coefficient (N<sub>e</sub>s) values corresponding to positive (+10 and +5) and purifying selection (-5, -10, -15, -20, -25 and -30) acting on a mutation of ~43,450 years were considered, together with a neutral change (N<sub>e</sub>s = 0). The results show that the probabilities to observe the actual frequencies (2.4–8%) in positive selection simulations are lower than those from a neutral mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g006">Fig 6</xref>). On the other hand, these probabilities are higher with increasingly negative selection coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g006">Fig 6</xref>), which suggests that the inversion could be evolving under purifying selection and therefore that it may have negative consequences for its carriers. However, the likelihoods of negative selection coefficients are not significantly different from that of a neutral allele according to the log-likelihood ratio test, and the possibility that the inversion is neutral cannot be ruled out.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work we analyze in detail a new human polymorphic inversion (HsInv0379) that is the first with a clear effect on genes. Unlike other previously described long human polymorphic inversions that are mediated by large and complex repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref050">50</xref>], in the present variant breakpoints are very simple, without repeats or even microhomology sequences, which suggests that it was probably generated by non-homologous mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref052">52</xref>] and has a unique origin. After genotyping 2,667 independent individuals from 27 worldwide populations using three methods (PCR across breakpoints, reads spanning inversion breakpoints, and tag SNPs), we have determined that this inversion is almost exclusively found in East Asian populations with an average frequency of 4.7%, although frequency varies between 2.4 and 8% with populations located at the southern part of China exhibiting a higher frequency of the <italic>Inv</italic> allele.</p>
<p>Although the low frequency of the inversion complicates age calculations, our estimates using high-coverage sequencing data from a single population indicate that the inversion is 40,000–50,000 years old, which is relatively young compared to other human polymorphic inversions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref053">53</xref>]. Accordingly, we propose that this inversion was generated from the ancestral <italic>Std</italic> chromosome after the out-of-Africa event around the time of the split between Asian and European populations 20,000–40,000 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref055">55</xref>], which agrees well with its distribution across all the analyzed East Asian populations as well as in one Bengali individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref056">56</xref>]. The finding of the <italic>Inv</italic> tag SNPs in a single Mexican individual whose genome does not have any component indicative of a recent ancestor of Asian origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref057">57</xref>], is consistent with the inversion predating the migration into the Americas ~15,000–23,000 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref058">58</xref>] and opens the possibility that the inversion might be present at low frequency in some American populations as well. The low nucleotide variation within <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes with only a few polymorphisms specific of this arrangement also supports a recent origin for inverted haplotypes, which have not had time to accumulate much variation.</p>
<p>Inversions are known to affect phenotype in many species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref009">9</xref>], but the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref003">3</xref>]. In the case of HsInv0379, no expression differences have been detected for any of the genes captured within the inverted segment, but one of the inversion breakpoints completely disrupts a gene, thus raising the possibility of phenotypic consequences derived from this mutational effect. The decrease of <italic>ZNF257</italic> expression level in inversion carriers and complete absence in the <italic>Inv/Inv</italic> individual indicate that this gene is not being expressed from the <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes, although there is some degree of variation in the expression of the gene in <italic>Std</italic> chromosomes. In particular, variability is high among <italic>Std</italic>/<italic>Std</italic> individuals in available RNA-Seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), but it is not significantly different from that of other genes with low expression levels, which complicate their accurate quantification. However, despite the existence of other regulatory genetic variants, we have seen that the inversion is the main determinant of <italic>ZNF257</italic> expression in the carriers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s008">S3 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>ZNF257</italic> belongs to the largest family of human transcription factors (KRAB-zinc finger proteins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref059">59</xref>] and it is positioned within a cluster of many similar genes. KRAB-zinc finger proteins are able to interact with chromatin-remodeling factors to repress transcription and have been involved in processes as diverse as development, differentiation, metabolism, apoptosis or cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref059">59</xref>]. <italic>ZNF257</italic> was first isolated in bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref060">60</xref>] and appears to be expressed in multiple tissues, mainly in testis, LCLs, ovary and thyroid (according to RNA-Seq data on different human tissues from both GTEx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref037">37</xref>] and Illumina Body Map (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-513">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-513</ext-link>). The type of cellular process it regulates or any target genes under its control are not yet known, although different evidences point towards a non-essential role of this gene. Based on exome data, <italic>ZNF257</italic> has been classified as a gene tolerant to functional genetic variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref061">61</xref>] and it shows loss-of-function mutations in heterozygosis in two individuals out of 1,092 in the 1000GP Phase 1 dataset. In addition, as expected by the inversion frequency, we have detected two <italic>Inv</italic>/<italic>Inv</italic> homozygotes where this gene is completely inactivated. Also, <italic>ZNF257</italic> is conserved in non-human primates, where it appears to be under purifying selection (dN/dS = 0.5443 with chimpanzee), but does not present a one-to-one ortholog in other mammal species. Here we provide support for an association between <italic>ZNF257</italic> down-regulation and expression changes in other genes in <italic>trans</italic>: (1) Expression differences in the same direction are observed independently using a different technique and a larger number of samples; and (2) <italic>Std</italic>/<italic>Std</italic> individuals with low <italic>ZNF257</italic> expression show expression levels similar to those of inversion carriers in at least two of the genes tested by qPCR (and in both cases the genes are up-regulated in inversion carriers, which is consistent with a lower amount of a transcriptional repressor like ZNF257). It is important to note that the detection of expression changes in <italic>trans</italic> is complicated by several facts: (1) many factors can determine the level of expression of a given gene and the inversion just alters the levels of one transcription factor; (2) the effects of <italic>ZNF257</italic> disruption in heterozygotes might be moderate due to buffering by <italic>ZNF257</italic> functional copy and they are likely to be larger in <italic>Inv</italic>/<italic>Inv</italic> individuals; and (3) lymphoblasts may not be the tissue where <italic>ZNF257</italic> expression reduction has its main effects. Still, this represents the best approach available to detect the functional consequences of this polymorphic inversion.</p>
<p>Biological relevance of <italic>ZNF257</italic> decrease due to the inversion may be questioned in light of the range of expression levels detected for this gene in <italic>Std/Std</italic> individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s003">S3</xref> Figs). However, gene disruption is not the only mechanism by which this inversion may be affecting gene expression and having potential phenotypic consequences, since it also generates a fusion transcript at BP1. In fact, at least one of the differentially expressed genes validated by qPCR (<italic>CACNB2</italic>) showed a level of expression in <italic>Std/Std</italic> individuals with low <italic>ZNF257</italic> closer to that in the other <italic>Std</italic>/<italic>Std</italic> individuals than to inversion carriers, suggesting that the expression change is associated with the inversion itself, rather than with <italic>ZNF257</italic> decrease, and the fusion transcript could be involved. This transcript has no homology to known transcripts, but coding of short peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref062">62</xref>] or binding to proteins or microRNAs cannot be ruled out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref064">64</xref>]. The new exon is entirely transcribed from TE sequences, but it contains the sense strand for both <italic>Alu</italic> and <italic>L1</italic> fragments and it should not bind RNAs from other TE copies. The higher expression level compared to <italic>ZNF257</italic> when both are driven by the same promoter suggests that the fusion transcript is taking advantage of new regulatory elements in its new position or operating without the influence of negative regulators, supporting the effect of chromosomal position on gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref016">16</xref>], although post-transcriptional mechanisms could play a role as well. Nevertheless, additional knockdown or overexpression experiments would be needed to really show a causal link between <italic>ZNF257</italic> and the fusion gene to other gene-expression changes.</p>
<p>Although we tried to establish functional relationships among the differentially expressed genes in inversion carriers, no clear significant categories emerged that could indicate the cellular processes that may be affected. However, there are several genes that may have important functions in the cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s010">S5 Table</xref>), like <italic>BCL11A</italic> that acts as a switch between fetal and adult hemoglobin in erythrocytes, is essential for B-lymphocyte development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref065">65</xref>] and has recently been involved in autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref066">66</xref>], or <italic>APP</italic>, a protein involved in autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref067">67</xref>]. Moreover, several non-coding RNAs of unknown function show quite high fold changes in inversion carriers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s010">S5 Table</xref>), such as the processed pseudogene RP11-343H5.4 (8.7-fold increase), or the lincRNA <italic>SNHG5</italic> (4.0-fold increase), whose introns produce snoRNAs and is located at the breakpoint of a chromosomal translocation involved in B-cell lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref068">68</xref>].</p>
<p>Assuming that any moderately long inversion should have some negative consequences due to the generation of unbalanced gametes by recombination in heterozygotes, the mutational effects at the breakpoints could result in several possible evolutionary scenarios. The inversion could behave as positively selected, neutral or nearly neutral depending on whether the potential beneficial effects of the <italic>ZNF257</italic> disruption, fusion transcript and the associated expression changes overcome the negative fertility effects or if the fertility effects are very small. On the other hand, if both effects are negative, the inversion could range from slightly to strongly deleterious. Thus, we have simulated the evolution of a mutation arising ~43,000 years ago under a human demography model with neutrality and different strengths of positive and purifying selection. While the observed inversion frequencies are compatible with both neutrality and negative selection and the age uncertainty might alter the simulation outcomes, the actual values are more likely under the assumption that the inversion is a deleterious polymorphism that cannot rise in frequency in the population due to its negative effects.</p>
<p>A human individual typically carries ~20 genes completely inactivated, but in more than ¼ of these only some transcripts are affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref069">69</xref>]. Loss-of-function mutations tend to occur in genes that are part of a family and less evolutionary conserved and this type of changes show low frequencies, all of which fit perfectly our situation (although according to a recent study in the Icelandic population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref070">70</xref>], 85% of loss-of-function mutations have a frequency below 0.5%, which is much lower than the 4.7% detected for the present inversion in East Asians). However, many genes involved in late-onset diseases will behave as neutral variants from an evolutionary point of view, but still may have functional consequences able to impact human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref071">71</xref>]. Alternatively, if we consider that recombination is not physically inhibited in the inverted region in heterozygotes, we can use its genetic length in <italic>Std</italic> chromosomes, 83 (in 4N<sub>e</sub>r units), as a proxy for the population-scaled selection coefficient (4N<sub>e</sub>s) acting on the inversion associated to the probability of harboring crossovers within the inverted sequence between <italic>Std</italic> and <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes, which results in a N<sub>e</sub>s ≈ -21. Since similar (or even higher) negative coefficients seem to be the parameters that best fit the observed inversion frequencies, both mechanisms (recombination and gene disruption) may have a role in causing the negative effects of this inversion. In that case, gene surfing during the expansion of humans in Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref072">72</xref>] could help to explain the observed frequencies of such a deleterious variant. So far we have been unable to detect an association of the inversion with disease markers and other phenotypic traits from blood tests in a Japanese cohort. Nevertheless, future association analysis with a higher number of individuals to overcome the reduced power to detect significant effects for low-frequency variants like HsInv0379 (just 1.95% in the analyzed population) and a more complete battery of phenotypes tested, should contribute to elucidate the possible functional consequences of this inversion.</p>

A total of 413 million single reads were produced (51.7 million per sample on average; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s009">S4 Table</xref>).

<p>To search the <italic>Std</italic> and <italic>Inv</italic> sequences at inversion HsInv0379 breakpoints among the individuals sequenced by the 1000GP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref026">26</xref>], we prepared a fasta file with the 100 bases surrounding the two breakpoints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s007">S2 Table</xref>). If the 1000GP reads had already been aligned to the reference genome, only unmapped reads and reads mapped to the breakpoint regions were downloaded from the ftp server in SAM format with SAMtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref080">80</xref>], and then converted to fastq. Otherwise, the raw fastq files were downloaded, avoiding color-space sequences and exome reads. The reads were processed with a slightly modified version of BreakSeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref052">52</xref>] as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref081">81</xref>]. Reads overlapping at least 10 bases of either side of a breakpoint were retained (regardless of their length), and only those mapping uniquely to an <italic>Inv</italic> or <italic>Std</italic> breakpoint with no other hits in the reference genome were counted as allele observations. A total of 1,892 individuals from the 1000GP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref026">26</xref>] were analyzed sequentially between January and August 2013. For inversion genotyping with the three tag SNPs, SNP calls were obtained from the 1000GP Phase 3 vcf files (20130502 release).

Only SNPs in perfect LD with the inversion (<italic>r</italic>
<sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 1) were considered tag SNPs. Next, haplotypes were inferred using BEAGLE package v3.3.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref044">44</xref>] from 1000GP Phase 1 SNP data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref026">26</xref>] in the inverted region and 1.8 Mb of flanking sequence at each side for 286 East Asian individuals. Both inversion breakpoints were included in their corresponding genomic positions as extra variants with two alleles (<italic>Std</italic> and <italic>Inv</italic>) to assess the presence of switch errors in phasing. Two different phasing strategies were used. The first phasing run was carried out with default (fast) parameters including all 1000GP SNPs but using genotype likelihoods to call SNP genotypes. The second one was aimed to increase accuracy by excluding all markers with allelic <italic>R</italic>
<sup><italic>2</italic></sup> &lt; 0.9 in the first run (larger values of allelic <italic>R</italic>
<sup><italic>2</italic></sup> indicate more accurate genotype imputation), and increasing to 20 both the number of iterations of the phasing algorithm and the number of sampled haplotype pairs for each individual during each iteration. In the accurate phasing, a switch error between breakpoints was detected in only one inversion carrier (compared to only two inverted chromosomes correctly retrieved using the first phasing run).</p>
<p>To determine the genetic substructure within the inverted region and the likely number of ancestral population groups (K) of the 570 phased East Asian chromosomes, we used a Bayesian genetic clustering algorithm (STRUCTURE v2.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref045">45</xref>]. We assumed the admixture model and ran 100,000 Markov chain Monte Carlo iterations with a burn-in period of 100,000. We also ran STRUCTURE assuming the linkage model, and we obtained equivalent results. We did not use prior population information and K values between 1 and 10 were tested to estimate their posterior probability. Estimates of recombination rate were obtained using the <italic>rhomap</italic> program distributed within the LDHat package v2.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref083">83</xref>] and the same strategy used in Alves <italic>et al</italic>. 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref084">84</xref>]. For each pair of adjacent SNPs we obtained five estimates of the population recombination rate (<italic>p</italic> = <italic>4N</italic>

Recombination was estimated separately in a random sample of 24 <italic>Std</italic> phased chromosomes and the 24 phased <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes. π [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref085">85</xref>] and Tajima's D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref046">46</xref>] statistics were estimated at non-overlapping windows of 80 SNPs. The alteration of the site frequency spectrum produced by the phasing algorithm has a minor effect on recombination rate estimates or population structure inference, but it could have a big effect on polymorphism level estimates. Thus, the Tajima's D distribution was Z-transformed and centered at 0 to try to correct for the systematic overestimation caused by the preferential filtering of low frequency variants during the phasing procedure.</p>

Nucleotide variation was analyzed in the inverted region (chr19: 22245260–21863433), excluding the segmental duplication copy at BP1 (chr19:22245260–21863433), which shows an increased nucleotide diversity that may alter final results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1005495.g005">Fig 5</xref>), and 2.3% of SNPs with missing values for some individuals. We assumed that variants in heterozygotes found also in <italic>Std</italic> homozygotes belonged to the <italic>Std</italic> chromosome, while those variants found exclusively in more than one heterozygote had appeared in <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes. A proportion of the singletons found in heterozygotes were assigned to <italic>Std</italic> chromosomes based on the observed singleton frequency in <italic>Std</italic> homozygotes, and the rest were attributed to <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes. We calculated the net pairwise nucleotide differences between orientations (<italic>d</italic>

<italic>/2s</italic> (where <italic>T</italic> is time and <italic>s</italic> is the local substitution rate). The 95% confidence intervals for age estimates were obtained with 1,000 bootstrap resamplings of 96 individuals. The local substitution rate was estimated with the same formulas as before using chimpanzee as outgroup and assuming a divergence time with humans of 5–6 Mya.

All extinct or fixed iterations were discarded and only the first 1,000 iterations still segregating were kept for analysis. Years were converted to generations by rescaling to the ancestral population size of 7,310 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1005495.ref048">48</xref>] and assuming 30 years per generation.

<title>Breakpoint sequence analysis and identification.</title>

<bold>A.</bold> Breakpoint 1 (BP1) isolation from fosmid ABC9_45236600_J18. The fosmid 40-kb insert is represented by a black line (top) with sequenced segments shown below as grey bars. Primers designed within the innermost sequences mapping in distinct regions of the reference genome (A1 and C1) were used to amplify a 7-kb PCR product containing the inversion BP1. This PCR product (bottom) was digested with restriction enzymes <italic>EcoR</italic>I (E), <italic>Pst</italic>I (P) and <italic>Hind</italic>III (H) and by comparison with the expected restriction patterns from these regions in the reference genome, BP1 was localized within a 1.5 kb segment marked with a red box. Primers A4 and C5 were used to amplify and sequence this fragment. <bold>B.</bold> RepeatMasker results showing annotations of transposable element (TE) blocks of 14.3 kb at BP1 (top) and 4.9 kb at BP2 (bottom) in the reference genome (<italic>Std</italic>) and in the sequenced region of individual NA18956 inverted chromosome (<italic>Inv</italic>). LINE (dark green) and SINE (light green) fragments are depicted as arrows indicating TE orientation. The nucleotide identity between the two blocks is very low, with only several fragments of ~250 bp corresponding to <italic>Alu</italic> sequences showing 78–85% identity. TEs are interrupted exactly at BPs in <italic>Inv</italic> chromosomes, which suggests that <italic>Std</italic> is the ancestral orientation. <bold>C.</bold> Multiplex PCR assay used for inversion genotyping in seven HapMap populations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen.1005495.t001">Table 1</xref>). A heterozygote and a <italic>Std</italic>/<italic>Std</italic> homozygote are shown. PCR products and sizes are also indicated.</p>

<title>Assessment of the reliability of the differential expression analysis.</title>
<p>
<bold>A.</bold> Differentially expressed genes detected in 18 permutations of the four <italic>Std/Std</italic> and <italic>Std/Inv</italic> samples with RNA-Seq data in which two individuals of each genotype group have been exchanged. False positive rate (FPR) indicates the proportion of genes identified between the resulting groups in each of the permutations, and the red line marks the proportion of differentially expressed genes (0.47%) in the comparison of the four individuals with each inversion genotype. Out of the 18 possible combinations, 14 show a lower number of genes compared to the groups determined by inversion genotype. The remaining four permutations all contain certain pairs of individuals in the two groups compared (NA18621 and NA18973 in one, and NA18632 and NA18951 in the other, where both pairs are formed by individuals with different sex, population, and inversion genotype) and might reflect some difference between these pairs of samples not taken into account. <bold>B.</bold> Histogram of the number of de-regulated genes in 400 simulations generated with the <italic>rnbinom</italic> function in R to simulate a negative binomial distribution of the read counts for eight samples with the mean and dispersion of the real data calculated by DESeq2. The red line shows the corresponding number of differentially expressed genes between the <italic>Std/Std</italic> and <italic>Std/Inv</italic> analyzed by RNA-Seq, which according to the results of the simulations has a p-value (<italic>P</italic>) of 0.055. In both the permutations and the simulations the analysis was done with DESeq2 using the same parameters and criteria than in the analysis of real data of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1005495.s010">S5 Table</xref> (FDR &lt; 0.1), with the exception that the sex chromosomes were excluded and only coding genes were taken into account.</p>

<p>PCR results, tag SNP genotypes and number of reads containing <italic>Std</italic> or <italic>Inv</italic> breakpoints are shown for each individual. Individuals shaded in red are related to other individuals in the list and were not considered for frequency calculations. Relationships were established according to family information available at Coriell Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://catalog.coriell.org/">https://catalog.coriell.org/</ext-link>) and 1000GP Phase 3 analysis (ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/20140625_related_individuals.txt). SNP calls are those of the 1000GP Phase 3 or SSMP vcf files. Read support for each allele is also shown in inversion carriers except for the Malay population where data were not available. SNP alleles are always in the order Reference/Alternative that corresponds to <italic>Std</italic>/<italic>Inv</italic>. Discordant SNP genotypes among the three inversion tag SNPs are shaded in grey and an alternative allele call in two or more of the SNPs is required to be considered enough evidence of the inverted haplotype.
