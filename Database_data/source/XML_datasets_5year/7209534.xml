<title>Abstract</title>
<p>
<bold>Context:</bold>
<italic>PTEN</italic> Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PHTS) comprises a collection of rare clinical disorders characterized by germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene <italic>PTEN.</italic> Current guidelines recommend screening for thyroid tumors beginning in pediatric age at the time of PHTS diagnosis; however, the benefit of early surveillance has not been well defined. <bold>Patients/Objective:</bold> We conducted a retrospective, single-site cohort investigation of patients followed at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia with diagnosis of PHTS between January 2003 - June 2019. In total, 81 patients under 18 years of age were identified. Clinical features, <italic>PTEN</italic> mutation codon, thyroid and gastrointestinal (GI) features were extracted from the electronic health record. The aim of the study is to assess genotype-phenotype, the incidence of thyroid and gastrointestinal disease, and to determine whether current recommendations for thyroid surveillance are improving outcomes. <bold>Results:</bold> The most common clinical feature at presentation was macrocephaly (85%) followed by impaired development (42%), skin/oral lesions (31%), and autistic spectrum disorder (27%). GI polyps were the presenting feature in 5 patients, with 14 of 81 patients ultimately diagnosed secondary to constipation (71%), rectal bleeding (64%), and/or abdominal pain (50%). All polyps were benign. A total of 58 of 81 patients underwent thyroid surveillance, with 30 patients (52%) found to have a nodule(s). Ultimately, 16 patients underwent thyroidectomy, with 31% (5/16) diagnosed with thyroid cancer. All thyroid cancer patients were greater than 10 years of age at diagnosis and all displayed low-invasive behavior (ATA low-risk). Of the patients &amp;lt 10 years at the time of thyroid ultrasound (US) surveillance, 74% (14/19) had a normal US. The remaining five patients who underwent thyroid surgery all had benign histology. No genotype-phenotype relations were found; however, patients with identical mutations were found to have similar clinical features. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with macrocephaly associated with impaired development, skin/oral lesions, thyroid nodules and/or early onset GI polyps should undergo germline testing for PHTS. There does not appear to be a clinical advantage to initiating thyroid US surveillance prior to 10 years of age. Early detection may not improve outcome of thyroid cancer as the majority of thyroid cancers display low-invasive behavior. In PHTS patients with a normal physical exam, thyroid ultrasound surveillance can be delayed until after 10 years of age. Early onset GI polyps may be the presenting diagnosis of PHTS.</p>
