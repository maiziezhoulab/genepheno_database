<p id="Par1">Hemorrhagic disease caused by grass carp reovirus (GCRV) has severely threatened the grass carp (<italic>Ctenopharyngodon idella</italic>) cultivation industry. It is noteworthy that the resistance against GCRV infection was reported to be inheritable, and identified at both individual and cellular levels. Therefore, this work was inspired and dedicated to unravel the molecular mechanisms of fate decision post GCRV infection in related immune cells. Foremost, the resistant and susceptible CIK (<italic>C. idella</italic> kidney) monoclonal cells were established by single cell sorting, subculturing and infection screening successively. RNA-Seq, MeDIP-Seq and small RNA-Seq were carried out with C1 (CIK cells), R2 (resistant cells) and S3 (susceptible cells) groups. It was demonstrated that genome-wide DNA methylation, mRNA and microRNA expression levels in S3 were the highest among three groups. Transcriptome analysis elucidated that pathways associated with antioxidant activity, cell proliferation regulation, apoptosis activity and energy consuming might contribute to the decision of cell fates post infection. And a series of immune-related genes were identified differentially expressed across resistant and susceptible groups, which were negatively modulated by DNA methylation or microRNAs. To conclude, this study systematically uncovered the regulatory mechanism on the resistance from epigenetic perspective and provided potential biomarkers for future studies on resistance breeding.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Grass carp (<italic>Ctenopharyngodon idella</italic>), a member of the <italic>Cyprinidae</italic> family, has remarkable aquaculture value in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, the development of the industry has been severely influenced by diversiform bacterial and viral diseases, of which grass carp hemorrhagic disease caused by grass carp reovirus (GCRV) infection is especially damaging and disturbing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">In a former study conducted with 10, 000 GCRV infected fish, the resistant individuals were identified within familial groups, indicating that GCRV resistance trait has high heritability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Considering <italic>C. idella</italic> kidney (CIK) cell line stems from the major immune organ as well as exhibits significant cytopathic effect (CPE) post GCRV infection, it is customarily served as the research model for hemorrhagic disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The phenomena that a handful of survivors could always be observed post GCRV infection and further proliferate into cell clusters separately still with the resistance trait, which inspired us to reveal the regulatory mechanism on resistance against GCRV. And the discrepancies on phenotype are reflected in a profound change on gene expression, which is regulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">DNA methylation, a key epigenetic modification, generally occurs in the fifth position of cytosine (5-methylcytosine, 5-mC) and scatters over the gene body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. It is frequently described as a “silencing” mark acted on gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. And the transcription could be negatively modulated by aberrant methylation especially in CpG islands (CGIs) at two levels: inhibiting the binding of specific transcription factors directly or recruiting methyl-CpG-binding proteins repressing chromatin remodeling activities indirectly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a kind of small (approximately 18–22 nucleotides), endogenous and non-coding RNA molecules, play important regulatory roles in post-transcriptional gene silencing, which are energetically involved in crucial biological processes such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. miRNAs could recognize the targeted mRNA sequences generally located in the 3′UTR and repress gene expression by impeding translation initiation or promoting mRNA deadenylation and degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">Accumulating evidences have demonstrated that the diversiform diseases result from aberrant DNA methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Accordingly, it could provide valuable insights into pathogenesis in cancer, mental disorders as well as several autoimmune disorders by revealing the methylation patterns of functional genes especially over genome-wide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. To date, there are an increasing number of researches revealing the regulatory mechanisms of diverse traits from DNA methylation standpoint in teleost, primarily focused on the fields of sexual development, genetic breeding and ecotype, while few studies were reported in diseases and immunology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. As the foremost regulator at post-transcriptional level, miRNAs have explicitly demonstrated the crucial roles in the development and various physiological processes in teleost fishes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. And the landscapes of miRNAs have been composed in nine fish species involving zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic>), Fugu (<italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>), Japanese medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>), common carp (<italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>), Tetraodon (<italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic>), olive flounder (<italic>Paralichthys olivaceus</italic>), channel catfish (<italic>Ictalurus punctatus</italic>) and Atlantic halibut (<italic>Hippoglossus hippoglossus</italic>) in the latest released database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mirbase.org/">http://www.mirbase.org/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Thereafter, the miRNAs were profiled and functionally characterized in marine medaka (<italic>Oryzias melastigma</italic>) and nile tilapia (<italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Recently, researchers provide comprehensive identification of miRNAs in <italic>C. idella</italic>, revealing the molecular responses against decabromodiphenyl ethane in natural water body and miRNA targets associated with motile <italic>Aeromonad septicemia</italic>

<p id="Par6">In the present study, we first established the resistant and susceptible monoclonal cell models against GCRV through rigorous screening. Further, we investigated DNA methylation over genome-wide and constructed mRNA and miRNA transcription profiling by high-throughput sequencing of the resistant and susceptible cells. By integrated analysis of DNA methylation and miRNAs with gene expression, the regulatory mechanism in <italic>C. idella</italic> against GCRV was revealed from the epigenetic perspective, and multiple functional genes modulated by DNA methylation and miRNAs were excavated as the potential biomarkers contributing to breeding for disease resistance (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>).

<title>Establishment of resistant and susceptible monoclonal cells</title>
<p id="Par7">To establish research models for the resistant and susceptible traits, CIK cells were sorted in virtue of the flow cytometry, and 384 single cells were obtained (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A</xref>). By subculturing, 66 monoclonal cell strains were ultimately reaped and applied for the experimental subjects screening, which were numbered S1501 to S1566 sequentially. Eight cell strains were preliminary identified as susceptible cells which exerted conspicuous CPE at 6 h post GCRV infection, mass mortality after 48 h as well as scarcely any survival 72 h later. Eight cell strains, showing no obvious CPE and still having massive living cells at 72 h post GCRV infection, were initially defined as resistant cells. By performing cell proliferation assay in combination, cell viability (CV) in S1517, S1536 and S1558 exceeded that in CIK cells, which were eventually defined as the resistant cells; and CV in S1501, S1519 and S1523 was inferior to that in control, which were ultimately confirmed as the susceptible ones. The CV situations of 16 candidate cells were shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1B</xref>. The morphology of the determined resistant and susceptible cell strains at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h post GCRV infection were demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>. To eliminate the discrepancies among cell strains, blended samples were taken as the experimental subjects embracing the resistant pool (R2) and the susceptible pool (S3), the primordial CIK cells (C1) were served as the control. The antiviral activity assay was whereafter proceeded to verify the veracity of the definition on resistant and susceptible cell strains. The results displayed that the living cell counts in the resistant cells were significantly more than those in the susceptible ones at 48 h and still existed at 96 h post GCRV infection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1C</xref>). The cell status in C1, R2 and S3 groups at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h post GCRV infection were shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1D</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Establishment of resistant and susceptible monoclonal cells.

<title>mRNA expression discrepancies between R2 and S3</title>
<p id="Par8">The high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) were performed to search for the discrepancies on mRNA expression profiles between the resistant and susceptible traits against GCRV. By Illumina HiSeq<sup>TM</sup> 2500 paired-end (2 × 125 bp) sequencing, approximate 18.5 Gb of clean data were obtained from the 3 libraries, and 21,250 genes were identified via mapping the genome of <italic>C. idella</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The number of clean reads eliminated the reads mapped to rRNA and the mapping ratio were listed in the Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>.</p>
<p id="Par9">Abundance distribution of expression analysis demonstrated that the expression profile of S3 was in the propensity for C1 and at a higher level with respect to R2 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S4A</xref>). In addition, C1 and S3 aggregated at one branch and were away from R2 by the clustering analysis (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S4B</xref>). Similarly, principal component analysis (PCA) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S4C</xref>) and correlation heat map (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S4D</xref>) elucidated that S3 possessed the similar expression profile to CIK cell line. Above all, it could be demonstrated that the aboriginality of CIK cells was gravitated to the susceptible trait for the high sensitivity to GCRV.</p>
<p id="Par10">It was detected a mass of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by RNA-Seq, comprising 5,889 genes between R2 and S3, 3,351 genes between C1 and S3, 6,887 genes between C1 and R2 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>). The percentage of up-regulated genes in S3 was more than 81.1% compared with R2, outdistancing the ratio of down-regulated ones. To demystify the molecular mechanism causing the distinct phenotypes resistance/susceptibility against GCRV, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway database (KEGG) analyses were performed in the DEGs between R2 and S3. It was observed that the expression level of <italic>lysosomal-trafficking regulator</italic> was significantly higher in S3 than that in R2, which was enriched in cell killing (biological process). Conversely, five genes enriched in antioxidant activity (molecular function), including <italic>glutathione peroxidase</italic>, <italic>glutathione peroxidase 3 precursor</italic>, <italic>manganese superoxide dismutase</italic>, <italic>microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1</italic> and <italic>leukocyte elastase inhibitor</italic>, possessed higher expression levels in R2 than those in S3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2A</xref>). It could be legitimately deduced that R2 possesses more forceful antioxidant activity than S3 while S3 encounters stronger cell killing activity than R2, which might be the primary principles causing the disparate resistance/susceptibility traits against GCRV. By KEGG analysis, it was surprised to discover that DEGs between R2 and S3 were uppermost enriched in the insulin signaling pathway, likewise between C1 and R2. Additionally, DEGs between C1 and S3 mainly enriched in the cell cycle pathway (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2B</xref>). Insulin signaling pathway and cell cycle pathway were reported principally participated in cell proliferation regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Accordingly, it could be evolved that resistance and susceptibility traits discriminately existed in CIK cells might be tightly related to cell proliferation. Therefore, it was specifically essential to carry out the interaction network analysis of cell proliferation-related pathways for excavating the pivotal molecules involved in the regulation on cell proliferation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2C</xref>). And the potential molecules were listed in the Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S12</xref> in detail which would lay the foundation for the future researches. Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of DEGs enriched in cell apoptosis related pathways were up-regulated in S3 compared with R2, while most DEGs enriched in cell proliferation related pathways were up-regulated in R2 rather than those in S3, which were consistent with the results yielded by GO analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2D</xref>). To authenticate the reliability of RNA-Seq data as well as the rationalization of the above interpretations, mRNA expressions of 31 genes were thoroughly investigated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). And the expression profiles of almost all genes validated by qRT-PCR were consistent with the RNA-Seq data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2E</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Characteristic comparisons of RNA-Seq dataset.

<title>DNA methylation and small RNA profiling</title>
<p id="Par11">In the present study, approximate 17.7 Gb of data bulk were obtained from three groups by MeDIP sequencing (MeDIP-Seq). The amount of the mapped reads in C1, R2 and S3 groups were 37,436,470, 37,565,439 and 45,846,648, respectively (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>). Most of the methylated cytosines were in a CHH context (H = C, T, or A), and a small fraction were in CHG and CG among C1, R2 and S3 samples (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>). Genome coverage ratio of the methylation enrichment regions addressed as peaks in S3 was 9.72% and obviously higher than coverage ratio in R2 which was just approximate 8.71% (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>). It indicated that the methylation level in S3 was higher than that in R2. To verify the above statement, global DNA methylation status in three groups were detected by assay kits, and the results were essentially in agreement with the data of MeDIP-Seq (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3A</xref>). Genomic distribution of peaks showed that methylation were detected at all chromosomes. The methylation levels of numerous peaks in S3 were significantly higher than those in R2, roughly accordant with the genome coverage ratio of peaks as well as the global DNA methylation status among three groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3B</xref>). The distribution of peaks were subsequently analyzed in the upstream2k, coding sequence (CDS), intron and downstream2k regions. Overall, the most of peaks distributed in introns, followed by CDSs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>). 925 genes harbored differentially methylated regions (DMRs) on the distinct functional elements, henceforth referred to as differentially methylated genes (DMGs). The distribution of DMGs on functional elements among three samples were exhibited in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3C</xref>. To reveal the regulatory mechanisms of phenotypic differentiation from DNA methylation standpoint, DMGs between groups would be therewith made a thorough inquiry.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Genome-wide compound analyses of MeDIP-Seq and small RNA-Seq data.

</p>
<p id="Par12">By high-throughput small RNA sequencing (small RNA-Seq), 1337 miRNAs were identified in three groups altogether which included 673 novel miRNAs, and the expression profiles were shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S8A</xref>. The majority of miRNAs were centralized at 22 nt in length tallying with the feature of animal’s miRNAs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S8B</xref>). Chromosomal distribution of miRNAs in three groups were exhibited in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S8C</xref>. By the nucleotide bias analysis, the first nucleotide bias in all three groups was notoriously biased in favor of uracil not only in known miRNAs but in novel miRNAs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S9A</xref>). Unexpectedly, multiple positions in both known and novel miRNAs possessed entirely discrepant nucleotide bias among three groups which might provide a meaningful perspective to dissect the regulatory mechanism of resistance/susceptibility against GCRV (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S9B</xref>). The most noteworthy was that the sequencing data unearthed 36 differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) between R2 and S3 groups, which were recognized as potentially major players in gene expression regulation at the post-transcriptional level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3D</xref>). To authenticate the reliability of small RNA-Seq data, eight DE-miRNAs between R2 and S3 were randomly selected for carrying out qRT-PCR verification subsequently, displaying the coincident expression patterns compared with the sequencing results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3E</xref>). Furthermore, DE-miRNAs binding target genes (DETs) would be implemented integrated analysis with gene transcription, aiming at bringing insights into the regulatory mechanism from the perspective of miRNAs.</p>

<title>Integrated analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression</title>
<p id="Par13">Aberrant DNA methylation generally is associated with gene repression, particularly when it occurs at CGIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. To gain insights into the regulatory mechanism of DNA methylation acted upon the phenotype of CIK cells, we carried out the integrated analysis of DMGs and negatively correlated DEGs between R2 and S3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4A</xref>). The results manifested that the transcription levels of 29 genes might be negatively regulated by methylation. Through in-depth analysis, three representative immune-related genes, including <italic>CD80-like protein</italic>, <italic>S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase-like 1</italic> (<italic>AHCY-like 1</italic>) and <italic>B2 bradykinin receptor-like</italic>, were screened out as the candidate genes for distinguishing phenotype of CIK cells, given that the methylation occurred in CGIs as the principal regulatory elements. Subsequently, bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) assay was performed to further corroborate the filtered results as well as excavate the specific CpG sites acted upon mRNA expressions. The methylation profiles at all CpG sites in candidate CGIs encompassed by peaks were represented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4B</xref>. It was demonstrated that the methylation levels at total CpG sites located in the thirteenth intron’s CGI in <italic>CD80-like protein</italic>, +13, +28 and +38 nt in the twelfth intron’s CGI in <italic>AHCY-like 1</italic> as well as +692 nt in the 3′UTR’s CGI in <italic>B2 bradykinin receptor-like</italic> were all significantly higher in S3 than those in R2. And the statistical analysis of each CpG site in above three genes were detailedly listed in the Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8–10</xref> respectively. By integrated analysis, methylation levels at above CpG sites possessed tightly negative correlation with gene expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4C</xref>). Accordingly, the methylation at above CpG sites might be served as negative modulator of gene expression as well as the potential biomarkers for the resistance/susceptibility phenotype against GCRV in CIK cells.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>The integrated analysis and biomarker screening.

<title>Functional miRNA screening as the potential biomarkers of the resistant/susceptible trait</title>
<p id="Par14">miRNAs are proverbially recognized as the major negative players in gene expression regulation by inducing direct mRNA degradation or translational inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Consequently, integrated analysis of DETs and DEGs between R2 and S3 was carried out to reveal the regulatory mechanism of the resistance/susceptibility against GCRV in CIK cells at the post-transcriptional level. The results indicated that 705 genes were up-regulated by lower expressed miRNAs as well as 166 genes were impeded by overexpressed miRNAs between R2 and S3 groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4A</xref>). By further screening the above DETs, four representative immune-related genes, involving <italic>LGP2</italic>, <italic>NLRC5</italic>, <italic>SOCS3B</italic> and <italic>TBK1 binding protein</italic>, were indicated to be negatively modulated by mir-34-y, mir-722-y and novel-m0076-5p respectively and designated as the potential biomarkers for resistance/susceptibility against GCRV in CIK cells. Thereupon, the dual luciferase reporter assay was performed to verify the relationship between the miRNA and the corresponding predicted target. The results showed that luciferase activity of pmirGLO-WT vectors were all significantly restrained, in parallel with the luciferase activity of pmirGLO-MUT vectors without significant discrepancy or strengthened compared with the NC groups post miRNA mimics transfection, demonstrating the candidate targets were modulated by the corresponding miRNAs and identified as the potential biomarkers for the phenotypic trait in CIK cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par15">GCRV is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus pertaining to the genus <italic>Aquareovirus</italic> which could cause severe hemorrhagic disease with approximately 85% mortality in fingerling and yearling <italic>C. idella</italic> as well as the enormous economic losses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Over the past decades, with the progresses of molecular and cellular biology technologies, multifarious GCRV detection techniques have been developed such as the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification, antigenic serodiagnosis and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification combined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. And more attempts are focused on proposing the effective preventive and therapeutic strategies for hemorrhagic disease. The most direct approaches are the exploitation of vaccines and medicines, of which the viral vaccines have experienced three stages: inactivated vaccine and attenuated vaccine, recombinant subunit vaccine and DNA vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. And mycophenolic acid, chestnut, and quebracho woods have been confirmed to specifically inhibit GCRV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Beyond that, some original antiviral strategies have been proposed to block the virus proliferation, such as RNAi, GCRV interfering particles and protease inhibitor strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, or in the other way to improve the antiviral immunity of organism in response to viral invasion, such as the immune adjuvant CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Although the above strategies provided novel avenues undeniably, grass carp hemorrhagic disease has not been controlled completely so far. Taken together, it is crucial to thoroughly revealing the regulatory mechanism of antiviral immunity in <italic>C. idella</italic> from the perspectives of genetic and epigenetic levels.</p>
<p id="Par16">In the present study, transcriptome analysis elucidated that R2 possessed the stronger antioxidant activity and multiplication capacity while S3 held stronger apoptotic activity. Those pathways might be crucial to determining the discrepant resistance/susceptibility traits against GCRV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2A,D</xref>). It was deserved to be mentioned that the most of immune-related genes were in higher expression state in S3, implying unstable state of the susceptible cells compared with the resistant ones, which could be interpreted as an error or deviation from a healthy state by the biosemiotic entropy theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. That might be another crucial factor determining the resistance or susceptibility and the potential pathogenesis causing the hemorrhagic disease.</p>
<p id="Par17">To explore the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms on the antiviral differential gene expression, we investigated the DNA methylation profiles and miRNA expression patterns in R2 and S3. It has been demonstrated gene expressions of <italic>RIG-I-like receptors</italic> could be negatively-regulated by the aberrant methylation post GCRV infection in our previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. In accordance, our data implied that the antiviral gene expressions were extensively modulated by DNA methylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3A</xref>). Intriguingly, the proportion of triple nucleotides mCHH was the highest in CIK cells rather than the most common functional mCG which has been reported in zebrafish (<italic>D. rerio</italic>) and half-smooth tongue sole (<italic>Cynoglossus semilaevis</italic>) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. In vertebrates, mutation occurred in mCG is the most frequent among all base substitutions, and the significantly reduced mCG in <italic>C. idella</italic> might be closely related to the increasing deamination rates which potentially raise numerous nonsynonymous substitutions and subsequent amino acid replacements for driving the evolution or adapting to varying environmental stresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Hence, high mCHH methylation distribution may be a characteristic modulator in <italic>C. idella</italic>. By comparison with the previous researches, this study first comprehensively depicted the miRNA expression profiles in CIK cells and identified 1337 miRNAs, with 673 novel miRNAs enormously replenishing the miRNA database of <italic>C. idella</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Most importantly, 36 DE-miRNAs were identified between the resistant and susceptible groups. This might provide some hitting-points and open up a new prospect for revealing the antiviral gene expression at post-transcriptional level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3D</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par18">According to the integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression patterns, a number of hyper-methylated genes were identified with lower expression level in susceptible cells, such as <italic>CD80-like protein</italic>, <italic>AHCY-like 1</italic> and <italic>B2 bradykinin receptor-like</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4C</xref>). <italic>CD80</italic> and <italic>CD86</italic>, the two most important cell co-stimulatory molecules, interact with <italic>CD28</italic> triggering the production of <italic>interleukin-2</italic> by activated T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. It has been indicated that the failure of immune surveillance mechanisms in non-inflammatory colon carcinogenesis may be linked to genomic methylation directly or indirectly affecting <italic>CD80</italic> expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. In this study, the methylation of CGI in the 13<sup>th</sup> intron was investigated increased, while the expression was decreased in S3 compared with R2, manifesting that <italic>CD80-like</italic> may contribute to the resistance. <italic>AHCY</italic> is regarded as one of the most potent methyltransferase inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. And it has been reported that <italic>AHCY</italic> deficiency may represent an ideal model disease for studying the molecular origins and biological consequences of DNA hypermethylation due to impaired cellular methylation status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Consequently, it could be legitimately deduced that <italic>AHCY-like 1</italic> expression in S3 was restrained by hypermethylation. <italic>B2 bradykinin receptor</italic> could induce cell proliferation and modulate the activity of antioxidant enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Our data implied that the expression of <italic>B2 bradykinin receptor-like</italic> might be impeded by the hypermethylation at +692 nt, which might alter the antioxidant and multiplication capacity of S3. Beyond that, it has been demonstrated that a series of representative immune-related genes involving <italic>LGP2</italic>, <italic>NLRC5</italic>, <italic>SOCS3B</italic> and <italic>TBK1 binding protein</italic> were negatively-modulated by the oriented miRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4D</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par19">Taken together, this study first acquired the resistant and susceptible monoclonal cells and established novel research models for pathogenesis mechanism of hemorrhagic disease.

<p id="Par22">All the monoclonal cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a cell density of 5 × 10<sup>4</sup>/well, and identified as resistant, susceptible or ambiguous by following strategies: (1) CPE analysis. Cell morphology, CPE as well as survival were photographed at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h post GCRV infection employing Leica DMI6000 B inverted deconvolution microscope (Germany) with a 10 × lens, preliminarily identifying the resistant and susceptible cells.

Ultimately, the 140–160 bp PCR products were enriched to generate a cDNA library and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq<sup>TM</sup> 2500. All tags were filtered to get clean data which were aligned with small RNAs in GenBank database (Release 209.0) and Rfam database (11.0) to identify and remove rRNA, scRNA, snoRNA, snRNA and tRNA. Subsequently, they were aligned with reference genome to remove fragments mapped to exons, introns and repeat sequences. The known and exist miRNAs were identified in virtue of the miRBase database (Release 21), and the novel miRNA candidates were predicted by software Mireap_v0.2 according to their genome positions and hairpin structures. The miRNA expression level was calculated and normalized to transcripts per million (TPM). DE-miRNAs were defined based on the general principles (fold change ≥ 2, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The candidate target genes coupled with miRNAs were predicted by three softwares RNAhybrid (v2.1.2), Miranda (v3.3a) and TargetScan (Version: 7.0), and the intersection of these results would provide more credibly predicted miRNA target genes.
