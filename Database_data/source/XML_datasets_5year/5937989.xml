<p id="P1">Translation is a critical process in protein synthesis, but translational regulation in antigen-specific T cells <italic>in vivo</italic> has not been well defined. Here we have characterized the translatome of virus-specific effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during acute LCMV infection of mice. Antigen-specific T cells exerted dynamic translational control of gene expression that correlated with cell proliferation and T cell antigen receptor (TCR) stimulation. Translation of mRNAs that encode translation machinery including ribosomal protein mRNAs was upregulated during the T cell expansion phase, followed by translational inhibition of these transcripts when the effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells stopped dividing just prior to the contraction phase. This translational suppression was more pronounced in terminal effector cells compared to memory precursor cells, and was regulated by antigenic stimulation and mTOR signals. Our studies show that translational activity of transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins is regulated during effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation and may play a role in fate decisions involved in the formation of memory cells.</p>

<p id="P2">CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells play a crucial role in controlling intracellular infections and anti-tumor immunity. During acute infection, naive antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells proliferate and differentiate into effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that eliminate the pathogen-infected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The majority of these effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells die after pathogen clearance, and then long-lived memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population is formed. The differentiation of effector and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is accompanied by dynamic changes in the phenotype and function of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, as revealed by genome-wide transcriptomic analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In addition, it is increasingly apparent that epigenetic regulation is significantly involved in effector and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">In addition to these transcriptional and epigenetic analyses, investigations into the post-transcriptional regulation of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses are required for a better understanding of the precise picture of cellular events that occur during effector and memory differentiation in these cells. Translation is a key target for post-transcriptional regulation as it is a critical process in protein synthesis from genetic information encoded in mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The translational regulation of gene expression is involved in many cellular events, and its dysregulation can result in clinical manifestations, including cancer and mental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. It is increasingly apparent that translation plays an important role in controlling both innate and adaptive immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Certain cytokine production in effector T cells (T<sub>eff</sub> cells) is translationally regulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Distinct translational signatures were found in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and Foxp3<sup>−</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Translation could also regulate the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response during the antigen-triggered activation in physiological immune settings such as pathogen infections, vaccination and cancer because mTOR, a major regulator of translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, plays an essential role in the differentiation of effector and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. However, it has not been studied how translation of individual mRNAs is regulated in these activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and it is unclear if translation activity is changed during the process of differentiation into effector and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>
<p id="P4">In this study we have examined the translational profiles and protein synthesis in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated <italic>ex vivo</italic> during acute infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in mice. Genome-wide translational analyses indicated that expression of a group of genes encoding the translational machinery was dynamically regulated by translational mechanisms in activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Furthermore, we found that antigenic stimulation as well as mTOR signals were involved in this translational regulation. Our studies provide a framework for understanding translational profiling of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells activated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells change their translational activity</title>
<p id="P5">To define how the translation of mRNA is regulated in activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during acute infection, we compared the translation profiles of naïve (T<sub>n</sub>), effector (T<sub>eff</sub>) and memory (T<sub>m</sub>) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells using P14 transgenic mice, which express a transgenic T cell receptor (TCR) specific for the H2-D<sup>b</sup>-restricted LCMV gp33 epitope. CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>n</sub> cells were isolated from spleen of uninfected P14 mice. To obtain T<sub>eff</sub> and T<sub>m</sub> cells, we adoptively transferred naive CD45.1<sup>+</sup> P14 CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into wild-type (CD45.2) mice, followed by infection with the Armstrong strain (Arm) of LCMV. As described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, LCMV Arm infection resulted in viral clearance at 8 days after infection and showed significant expansion of the population of antigen specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the spleen, followed by the contraction phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>n</sub> cells in spleen of uninfected P14 mice maintained a small cell size, did not proliferate and did not express the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b–d</xref>). On the other hand, CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>eff</sub> cells isolated from spleen at day 5 post infection (D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells hereafter) were larger in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and were actively proliferating in response to viral antigens compared T<sub>n</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a and d</xref>). In addition, they expressed cytotoxic molecule granzyme B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). On day 8 post-infection, at the peak of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response, the cell size of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells hereafter) was comparable to that of naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), and they were not proliferating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), but had high expression of granzyme B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). After the contraction phase, CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>m</sub> P14 cells (&gt; 30 days after infection) in spleen were small, did not take up BrdU, similar to T<sub>n</sub> and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells, and expressed less granzyme B protein compared to D5 T<sub>eff</sub> and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b–d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">We next examined the polysome profiles of T<sub>n</sub>, D5 T<sub>eff</sub>, D8 T<sub>eff</sub> and T<sub>m</sub> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>n</sub> cells, isolated from spleen of uninfected P14 transgenic mice and ultracentrifugated on a sucrose gradient, had a low polysome content compared to the monosome peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), confirmed by low amounts of RNA isolated from the polysome fractions compared to the monosome fraction in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>,). These data suggest low translation activity in CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>n</sub> cells, consistent with the status of naive T cells as quiescent cells. In contrast to CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>n</sub> cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> D5 T<sub>eff</sub> P14 cells, purified from spleen, showed multiple clear spikes in polysome fractions and a high amount of RNA in these fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), indicating active mRNA translation during the clonal expansion phase. The polysome profile of P14 CD8<sup>+</sup> D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells, isolated from spleen at the peak of the T cell response (day 8 post-infection) were similar to those observed in T<sub>n</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). These results suggest that activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells down-regulate mRNA translation when they stop dividing, (at day 8 p.i). CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>m</sub> P14 cells, isolated from spleen at day 40–60 post infection, had a low polysome content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), indicative of quiescent translation, and suggesting that mRNA translation in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells correlated with cell proliferation.</p>
<p id="P7">Next, we examined incorporation of L-homopropargylglycine (HPG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, a non-radioactive amino acid analog of methionine that can be measured by flow cytometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, to assess protein synthesis in T<sub>n</sub>, T<sub>eff</sub> and T<sub>m</sub> CD8<sup>+</sup> cells. Splenocytes were cultured for 2 hours at 37 °C with HPG, in the presence or absence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, used as control. In accordance with the polysome profiling data, very few T<sub>n</sub> P14 cells incorporated HPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>), indicating minimal protein synthesis. In contrast, at day 5 post-infection 40% of P14 T<sub>eff</sub> cells were HPG<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). At day 8 post-infection the frequency of HPG<sup>+</sup> was much lower (&lt;10%) among D8 T<sub>eff</sub> P14 cells compared to D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>), and by day 12 post-infection the frequency of HPG<sup>+</sup> in P14 cells became similar to that observed in T<sub>n</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>), indicating that active protein synthesis was transient. Low levels of HPG incorporation were also seen in T<sub>m</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Together, these results suggest that protein synthesis increased at day 5 p.i. in proliferating antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, followed by a rapid reduction of protein production concurrent with the peak of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses at day 8 p.i. as the cells stopped dividing.</p>

<title>Translational control of gene expression in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is selective</title>
<p id="P8">To investigate the regulation of translation for mRNAs known to be expressed in activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we examined the sedimentation of specific mRNAs across the fractions of a sucrose gradient. T<sub>n</sub> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were directly obtained from spleen of P14 transgenic mice, and T<sub>eff</sub> CD8<sup>+</sup> P14 cells were isolated from spleen of LCMV Arm-infected mice, which P14 cells were adoptively transferred before infection. Translation of <italic>Ifng</italic> mRNA is known to be required for production of IFN-<bold>γ</bold> protein in <italic>in vitro</italic> activated T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. <italic>Ifng</italic> mRNA was transcriptionally up-regulated in both D5 and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> P14 cells compared to T<sub>n</sub> P14 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), as shown previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells, <italic>Ifng</italic> mRNA was broadly distributed in the sedimentation gradient and about 40% of the total <italic>Ifng</italic> mRNA was located in polysome fractions, while only about 20% of <italic>Ifng</italic> mRNA was detected in polysome fractions in D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, c</xref>). It was previously shown that the peak of IFN-γ protein in serum and organ homogenates following LCMV infection occurs prior to day 8 p.i. and that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are the main contributor of IFN-γ protein production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. We found that the amount of IFN-γ protein in serum peaked at day 5 post-LCMV infection and then significantly decreased by day 10 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Direct <italic>ex vivo</italic> intracellular cytokine staining showed that D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells produced more IFN-γ protein compared to D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), consistent with the <italic>Ifng</italic> mRNA translation data and indicating the translation of <italic>Ifng</italic> mRNA was more active in proliferating activated D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells compared to D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells that stopped proliferating.</p>
<p id="P9">We also examined the translation of <italic>Tbx21</italic> mRNA, encoding the transcription factor T-bet. <italic>Tbx21</italic> mRNA was induced in D5 and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells compared to T<sub>n</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). However, in contrast to <italic>Ifng</italic> mRNA, there was no difference in translation of <italic>Tbx21</italic> mRNA between D5 and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g, h</xref>) and about 80% of <italic>Tbx21</italic> mRNA was detected in polysomes in both T<sub>eff</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>), indicating that translation of <italic>Tbx21</italic> mRNA was more efficient than that of <italic>Ifng</italic> and that translation of <italic>Tbx21</italic> is distinctly regulated from that of <italic>Ifng</italic> in T<sub>eff</sub> cells.</p>
<p id="P10"><italic>Cd8a</italic> mRNA is constitutively expressed in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells through all activation and differentiation stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). 50~70% of <italic>Cd8a</italic> mRNA was found in polysome fractions in all subsets of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells examined (T<sub>n</sub>, D5 T<sub>eff</sub>, D8 T<sub>eff</sub> and T<sub>m</sub>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>), indicating that translation of <italic>Cd8a</italic> mRNA was highly active in quiescent and activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, despite dynamic changes in overall translation status. <italic>Il7r</italic> mRNA, which encodes CD127 and is essential for memory T cell maintenance and <italic>Sell</italic> mRNA, encoding the lymph node homing receptor CD62L, were transcriptionally downregulated in D5 and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells compared to T<sub>n</sub> cells, and re-expressed in T<sub>m</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). The amount of individual mRNAs in polysome fractions was indistinguishable between T<sub>n</sub> and T<sub>m</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). <italic>Gzmb</italic> mRNA, which encodes the cytotoxic mediator gramzyme B, was transcriptionally increased in D5 T<sub>eff</sub>, D8 T<sub>eff</sub>, and T<sub>m</sub> compared to T<sub>n</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). The amount of <italic>Gzmb</italic> mRNA in polysome fractions was similar and active in D5 T<sub>eff</sub>, D8 T<sub>eff</sub> and T<sub>m</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). Together, these results indicate the selective control of translation for distinct genes in activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which can also be dynamically regulated depending on the effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells status.</p>

<title>Translatome reveals translational program of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation</title>
<p id="P11">Next, to define the genome-wide control of translation in antigen specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells after acute infection, we performed microarray analysis of polysome-associated mRNA isolated from splenic T<sub>n</sub>, D5 T<sub>eff</sub>, and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> P14 cells after sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, as well as microarray analysis of total mRNA isolated from the same cells before sucrose gradient. To obtain basic information of translational control in antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we plotted microarray expression values of individual genes in total mRNA against translation activity, which represents recruitment of mRNAs to polysome and was calculated by dividing expression values of polysome associated mRNA by those of total mRNA. In these analyses, four groups of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">3</xref>) were determined: group I contained mRNAs with low expression and efficient recruitment to polysome, group II, low mRNA expression, inefficient recruitment to polysome, group III, high mRNA expression, efficient recruitment to polysome, and group IV, high mRNA expression, inefficient recruitment to polysome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Gene ontology analyses of these four groups of genes revealed that the pattern of translation activity of T<sub>n</sub> and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells was relatively similar compared to that of D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Genes with low expression but translated actively (group I) in T<sub>n</sub> and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells were related to multiple biological processes, including cellular response to DNA damage and intracellular protein transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). On the other hand, genes in group IV (high mRNA expression but inefficient recruitment to polysome) were associated with mitochondrion organization, translation-ribosome, and oxidative phosphorylation. Particularly, translation activity of genes related to translation itself (translation-ribosome), which includes ribosomal protein mRNAs, was downregulated in D8 T<sub>eff</sub> compared to T<sub>n</sub> and D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">Although the above analyses provide basic information of translation activity in CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>n</sub>, D5 T<sub>eff</sub>, and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells, it was not clear whether and how translation activity of individual genes was changed when T<sub>n</sub> cells differentiate into D5 and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells. To address this, the fold changes of gene expression of total mRNAs in D5 and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells relative to T<sub>n</sub> cells were compared to those of polysome-associated mRNAs, and the relationship of the fold changes between total mRNAs and polysome-associated mRNAs was examined. We found a marked correlation of the fold changes between total mRNAs and polysome-associated mRNAs in D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells relative T<sub>n</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), indicating that transcriptional regulation was directly related to the amount of polysome-associated mRNAs and that the fold changes of majority of polysome-associated mRNAs could be explained by the increase or decrease of gene expression in total mRNA when T<sub>n</sub> cells differentiate into D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells. A similar strong correlation of the fold changes between total and polysome-associated mRNAs was observed in D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells relative to T<sub>n</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Next, we examined the number of genes that were transcriptionally or translationally regulated. Compared to T<sub>n</sub> cells, 1932 gene probes were transcriptionally upregulated, 1975 gene probes were downregulated and 12001 gene probes were unchanged in D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Between 1 to 10% of genes in these three groups were identified as translationally regulated genes that were defined when fold changes of translation activity were significantly up- or down-regulated (&lt;−1.5 fold change or &gt;1.5 fold change) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Similar to D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells, the proportion of translationally regulated genes in D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells was in the range of about 1 to 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). When comparing the translationally regulated genes in D5 and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells relative to T<sub>n</sub>,we found that the majority of genes were uniquely regulated in each T<sub>eff</sub> cell population (n=812 for D5 T<sub>eff</sub>, n=545 for D8 T<sub>eff</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), suggesting that mRNA translation was differentially and dynamically regulated between D5 and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells.</p>
<p id="P13">To define the biological activity and/or the pathways regulated by translation, we used gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> to analyze the gene-expression of total mRNA and polysome-associated mRNA in T<sub>n</sub>, D5 T<sub>eff</sub> and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells and compared the GSEA data of total mRNA with those of polysome-associated mRNA. This analysis indicated that compared to T<sub>n</sub>, D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells in total RNA upregulated substantial numbers of gene-sets related to cell proliferation and cell division including cell cycle, mitosis, DNA repair-DNA replication, RNA processing, transcription, splicing, DNA metabolism, tRNA aminoacylation and chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), and a comparable upregulation was observed in polysome-associated mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), indicating that the majority of these transcriptionally upregulated genes in D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells were loaded on polysomes. In accordance with this notion, analysis of mRNAs responsible for enrichment of these proliferation-related gene sets by GSEA indicated a marked correlation of fold changes between total and polysome-associated mRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">The gene-sets related to cell proliferation and division were also upregulated in both total and polysome-associated mRNA of D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells compared to those of T<sub>n</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). However, the number of gene sets upregulated in D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells was substantially lower than that in D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>), suggesting gene expression associated to cell proliferation and division was decreased in D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells relative to D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells, as indicated also by direct comparison of D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells to D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells by GSEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">These analyses also revealed significant differences in enrichment by GSEA between total and polysome-associated mRNA.

Furthermore, gene sets related to biosynthetic processes and translation initiation were translationally down-regulated in D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells compared to D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The significant differences in enrichment of the ribosome-translation cluster between total and polysome-associated mRNAs was mostly due to translational downregulation of cellular ribosomal proteins in D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells compared to T<sub>n</sub> and D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 6</xref>).

<p id="P17">To further investigate whether the translation of genes related to the immune responses was differentially regulated in D5 and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells, we performed GSEA using ImmuneSigDB, immunology-specific gene sets that can detect immunological gene signature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.

<p id="P18">Next, to examine if most or only a fraction of mRNAs for cellular ribosomal protein were translationally regulated, we compared the fold changes of translation activity of all cellular ribosomal protein mRNAs to those of all mRNAs in the microarray data. Translation activity of ribosomal protein mRNAs between D5 T<sub>eff</sub> and T<sub>n</sub> cells was modestly upregulated in D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells compared to all mRNAs, while translation activity of ribosomal protein mRNAs in D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells relative to T<sub>n</sub> or D5 T<sub>eff</sub> showed significant downregulation compared to all mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>), indicating that the translation of most ribosomal protein mRNAs is suppressed at the peak of T<sub>eff</sub> response.</p>
<p id="P19">To validate the microarray results, we examined the sedimentation of ribosomal protein mRNAs in sucrose gradient in CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>n</sub>, D5 T<sub>eff</sub> and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> P14 cells by qRT-PCR. T<sub>n</sub> P14 cells were directly obtained from spleen of uninfected P14 transgenic mice while T<sub>eff</sub> P14 cells were isolated from spleen of LCMV Arm-infected mice in which P14 transgenic T cells were adoptively transferred before infection. About 20% of <italic>Rpl29</italic> mRNAs, encoding ribosomal protein L29 and one of the components of the large subunit of ribosome, in T<sub>n</sub> cells was located in the polysome fractions and there was a clear peak, about 40% of <italic>Rpl29</italic>, in the monosome fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b, c</xref>). In D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells, a monosome peak became smaller but the amount of mRNA in polysome fractions was maintained or slightly higher compared to T<sub>n</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b, c</xref>).

The amount of mRNAs for ribosomal proteins in polysome fractions in T<sub>n</sub>, D5 T<sub>eff</sub>, and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells was also examined in individual cells. Because the overall RNA content per cell is much higher in D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells due to cell growth and proliferation, the amount of ribosomal protein mRNAs per cell in a D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cell increased relative to that of T<sub>n</sub> and D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig, 4</xref>). Thus, a D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cell expressed significantly higher ribosomal protein mRNAs in polysome fractions per cell compared to T<sub>n</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). On the other hand, the amount of ribosomal protein mRNA in polysome fractions per cell in D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells decreased compared to both naive and day 5 effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P24">Here we found that the extent of overall translation in activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells strongly correlated with cell proliferation status and was dependent on TCR stimulation. We observed the selective translational control of gene expression in activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Translation of genes such as <italic>Tbx21, Cd8a</italic>, <italic>Il7r</italic>, <italic>Sell</italic> and <italic>Gzmb</italic> was efficient throughout the course of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, while translation of <italic>Ifng</italic> was dynamically altered during T<sub>eff</sub> cell responses. The translation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins was upregulated in activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during the clonal expansion phase, likely to help production of higher amount of proteins in proliferating cells, followed by striking downregulation of translation of these genes in D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells, at the peak of the anti-viral response, even below levels found in naive T cells.</p>
<p id="P25">While both T<sub>n</sub> and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells were not dividing, translational suppression of ribosomal protein mRNAs was evident in D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells. The peak of the T<sub>eff</sub> cell response represents a turning point of metabolic reprogramming to shift from anabolic processes and rapid cell division to catabolic processes and arrest in cell proliferation accompanied by massive cell death. Thus, cellular events that trigger this T<sub>eff</sub> death might result in the translational suppression of ribosomal protein mRNAs. Alternatively, translational suppression of ribosomal protein mRNAs might contribute to induction of cell death by limiting the availability of ribosomes to synthesize proteins in T<sub>eff</sub> cells.</p>
<p id="P26">T<sub>n</sub> and T<sub>MP</sub> cells had high amounts of monosome-associated ribosomal protein mRNAs but translational activity of ribosomal protein mRNAs was distinct between these cells. In particular, the amount of ribosomal protein mRNAs in polysome fractions in T<sub>MP</sub> cells was substantially lower compared to T<sub>n</sub> cells. mTOR may be involved in the translational regulation of ribosomal protein mRNAs. mTOR has two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. mTORC1 promotes translation of 5′TOP mRNAs that include ribosomal protein transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and our data showed that known 5′TOP mRNAs were translationally suppressed in D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells, consistent with mTORC1-mediated inhibition of translation. Furthermore, D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells showed translational downregulation of genes encoding mitochondria-related proteins, whose translation is at least partly regulated by mTORC1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Thus, our results indicate that inhibition of translation in D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells might be dependent on mTORC1 signals. Indeed, rapamycin treatment reduced ribosomal protein mRNAs from polysome fractions in antigen specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells without changing the amount of monosome-associated ribosomal protein mRNAs. Because inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin or RNAi promotes T<sub>m</sub> cell formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, polysome-dependent translation of ribosomal protein mRNAs could contribute to T<sub>m</sub> cell differentiation. An important question is whether and how polysome-dependent translation regulates effector and memory differentiation. Inhibiting mTORC2 signals enhances generation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>m</sub> cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Since mTORC2 can be activated through the interaction with ribosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, the inhibition of polysome-dependent translation of ribosomal protein mRNAs in D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells may lead to limited mTORC2 activity that could have impact on T<sub>m</sub> cell differentiation. Thus, it will be important to investigate the possible interplay between mTORC1 and mTORC2 during CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>m</sub> cell differentiation.</p>
<p id="P27">Transcriptional downregulation of a group of ribosomal protein mRNAs was previously reported in exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that arose after chronic infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Recently, two distinct subsets of virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were identified during chronic infection: Tim3<sup>+</sup> TCF1<sup>−</sup> PD1<sup>+</sup> terminally-differentiated exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and Tim3<sup>−</sup> TCF1<sup>+</sup> PD1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with stem-cell like properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Ribosomal protein mRNAs was significantly downregulated in Tim3<sup>+</sup> TCF1<sup>−</sup> PD1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to Tim3<sup>+</sup> TCF1<sup>−</sup> PD1<sup>+</sup> stem-cell like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. In addition, similar transcriptional inhibition of a large number of ribosomal protein mRNAs was seen in CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>m</sub> cells repeatedly stimulated with multiple rounds of acute infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. A common feature between Tim3<sup>+</sup> TCF1<sup>−</sup> PD1<sup>+</sup> exhausted T cells and repeatedly-stimulated T<sub>m</sub> cells is the poor proliferative capacity. Because protein synthesis is a key process for T cell proliferation, it seems that transcriptional downregulation of ribosomal protein mRNAs plays a major role in the limited proliferative responses of these CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Similarly, D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells exhibit minimal proliferative capacity compared to T<sub>n</sub> and primary T<sub>m</sub> cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Thus, translational downregulation of ribosomal protein mRNAs in D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells might also contribute to poor proliferative responses.</p>
<p id="P28">We showed that antigen stimulation and mTOR signals were involved in translational regulation of ribosomal protein mRNAs in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, translation can be also regulated by other factors. IL-7 might have a role in translational control in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. T<sub>n</sub> cells and T<sub>MP</sub> cells express CD127 (the IL-7 receptor), while T<sub>TE</sub> cells lose CD127 expression. Our data show that the amount of monosome-associated ribosomal protein mRNAs is positively correlated with the expression levels of CD127 when T cells are not stimulated with antigen. In addition, IL-2 might be involved in translational regulation. IL-2 has an essential role in T<sub>eff</sub> and T<sub>m</sub> cell differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. IL-2Rα was transcriptionally upregulated in D5 T<sub>eff</sub> cells in our microarray data, and this increased expression of IL-2Rα was concurrent with the higher amount of polysomes. Furthermore, we found transcriptional increase of multiple inhibitory receptors including PD-1, Tim3 and 2B4 in D5 and D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells. Thus, once antigenic TCR stimulation is lost due to viral clearance, these inhibitory receptors might contribute to translational suppression in D8 T<sub>eff</sub> cells. Thus, it will be interesting to examine if such cytokine signals and inhibitory receptors regulate translation in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>

<p id="P33">Single cell suspension of splenocytes were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies) containing 10% dialyzed FBS (Life Technologies), and then were further cultured for 2 hours at 37 °C in the presence of HPG (final concentration 100 μM, Life Technologies). Cycloheximide (final concentration 100 μg/ml) was added for negative control. HPG incorporation in P14 cells was stained with Click-iT Plus Alexa Fluor 488 Picolyl Azide Toolkit (Life Technologies) and was detected by flow cytometry.</p>

<title>qRT-PCR</title>
<p id="P34">Total RNA was isolated from P14 cell lysate before sucrose gradient by Trizol reagent. 18s rRNA was used as an internal control of gene expression for total RNA. To examine the sedimentation of mRNAs across the fractions of a sucrose gradient, a standard protocol was applied as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Briefly, 10 pg of luciferase mRNA was added to individual fractions of sucrose gradient for normalization and then RNA was extracted by Trizol reagent. Primers used in this study for qRT-PCR were QuantiTect primers purchased from Qiagen except for luciferase primers. The followings are sequences for luciferase primers: forward; 5′-GAGATACGCCCTGGTTCCTG-3′, reverse; 5′-ATAAATAACGCGCCCAACAC-3′. qRT-PCR was carried out by QuantiFast SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen). Values of gene expression determined by qRT-PCR in individual fractions of sucrose gradient were normalized to luciferase quantity, and then distribution of the gene expression in the gradient was plotted. To examine relative copy numbers of ribosomal protein mRNAs, RNA amount per cell was calculated. Briefly, 10 pg of luciferase mRNA was added to cell lysates before total RNA isolation for normalization, and then RNA was extracted by Trizol reagent. RNA extraction efficiency was calculated by qRT-PCR of luciferase mRNA, and RNA amount per cell was determined from RNA extraction efficiency, RNA concentration, and initial cell number. qRT-PCR for ribosomal protein mRNAs was performed using 200 pg of total RNA, and relative copy numbers of these mRNAs per cell was calculated from qRT-PCR data and RNA amount per cell.</p>

<title>Translatome analysis</title>
<p id="P35">Total RNA and polysome-associated RNA (3 or more ribosomes) from purified P14 cells were isolated by Trizol, and then were treated with DNase, followed by RNA purification with column. Three biological replicates for total and polysome-associated RNA of each time point (naive, day 5 effector, and day 8 effector) were prepared. Amplified cDNAs were generated from these total and polysome-associated RNA samples using Ovation Pico WTA System V2 (Nugen), and were hybridized on mouse 430.2 Affymetrix microarray chips at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Prior to analysis, microarray data were preprocessed and normalized with robust multichip averaging in GenePattern (Broad Institute). Microarray data are available at GEO database (GEO accession code: GSE71643). To determine the pattern of translation in naive, day 5, and day 8 effector CD8<sup>+</sup> P14 cells, expression values in total mRNA microarray data and translation activity were plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>. Translation activity was calculated by dividing expression values in polysome-associated mRNA microarray data by those in total mRNA microarray data. High or low expression levels of genes in total mRNA (x-axis) were defined using z-score cut-off of +/−1. To determine significant difference in translation activity, we used a cut off of p-value&lt;0.05, FDR&lt;0.05, and translation activity values +/−1.5. 4 groups of genes were determined; I) low mRNA levels, efficient recruitment to polysome, II) low mRNA levels, inefficient recruitment to polysome, III) high mRNA levels, efficient recruitment to polysome, IV) high mRNA levels, inefficient recruitment to polysome. To define transcirptionally up- or down-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig, 4b</xref>), we used a cut off of p-value&lt;0.05, FDR&lt;0.05, and fold-changes of expression values &gt;2. GSEA analysis was performed in GenePattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Gene-sets used for GSEA analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> was generated by combining three gene set groups (c2 canonical pathways, c5 GO, and hallmark gene-sets) obtained from GSEA Molecular Signatures Database. Gene-sets used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> were c7 ImmuneSigDB from GSEA Molecular Signatures Database. In these GSEA analyses, we used a cut off of FDR&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.001. Mutually overlapping gene-sets in GSEA data were clustered together using Enrichment Map and Auto Annotate programs on a Cytoscape software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. These gene-set cluster data made in Cytoscape were further visualized with a heat map in which FDR values were plotted. Translationally regulated gene sets were determined when FDR values of GSEA data in polysome-associated RNA were less than 1/100 compared to those in total RNA. To identify genes responsible for translational regulation of gene set enrichment, we determined leading-edge genes in translationally regulated gene sets of polysome-associated RNA microarray data. The leading-edge genes are a core group of genes essential for the gene set enrichment signal. From these leading-edge genes, translationally regulated genes were further extracted. Translationally regulated genes were defined as below. First, translational activity for each gene was calculated as (polysome-associated RNA microarray expression value)/(total RNA microarray expression value). Second, values of the translation activity from biological replicates were averaged, and then fold changes of translation activity was calculated between two different stages of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (e.g. naive versus day 8 effector). Third, p-values of translation activity between two different stages were determined by a two-tailed Student’s t test, and then FDR was calculated by qvalue program in R software. Finally, we used a cut off of p-value&lt;0.05, FDR&lt;0.15, and fold-changes of translation activity&gt;1.5 as a translationally regulated gene. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c, d</xref>, the translationally regulated genes were further analyzed by Metascape (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://metascape.org/gp/index.html#/main/step1">http://metascape.org/gp/index.html#/main/step1</ext-link>) to determine gene ontology categories overrepresented in a set of genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>.</p>

<p id="P37">Flow cytometric analyses were performed with LSR II or Canto II (BD Biosciences). Single cell suspensions of spleen cells and PBMCs were prepared, and cell surface staining were carried out as shown previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The following antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences; anti-CD8a (53-6.7), anti-IFN-γ (XMG1.2), and isotype (R3-34) control for IFN-γ. Anti-KLRG1 (2F1) antibody was purchased from SouthernBiotech. Anti-CD127 (A7R34) antibody was purchased from eBioscience. Anti-CD45.1 (A20), anti-CD45.2 (104), anti-Thy-1.1 (OX-7) and anti-Ly6G (1A8) antibodies were purchased from Biolegend. For direct <italic>ex vivo</italic> intracellular IFN-g staining, cell surface staining of spleen cells was performed to detect P14 cells, and then spleen cells were stained with anti-IFN-g antibody after permeabilization. Isotype control antibody for IFN-g was used to determine the background.</p>

<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showing biological themes and pathways up- or down-regulated in total or polysome-associated RNA (T<sub>n</sub> vs D5 T<sub>eff</sub>, T<sub>n</sub> vs D8 T<sub>eff</sub>, and D5 T<sub>eff</sub> vs D8 T<sub>eff</sub>). Gene sets were obtained from Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB); c2 canonical pathways, c5 gene ontology, and hallmark gene sets were combined. Mutually overlapping gene sets cluster together. Each row represents an individual gene set. Heat maps showing FDR values of GSEA data. (<bold>b</bold>) Classification of genes responsible for translationally downregulated-gene sets (ribosome/translation, biosynthetic process/translation initiation, panel (<bold>a</bold>)) in D8 Teff cells in comparison with either T<sub>n</sub> or D5 Teff cells. (<bold>c</bold>) Corresponding gene ontology terms by metascape analysis for genes responsible for translational upregulation of the immune related gene set cluster in panel (<bold>a</bold>) in D8 Teff cells compared to D5 Teff cells. (<bold>d</bold>) Corresponding gene ontology terms for translationally up- or down-regulated genes identified from GSEA analysis using immune signature database (ImmuneSigDB) in D8 Teff cells compared to D5 Teff cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Microarray data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> were used for this analysis. T<sub>n</sub>, D5 Teff, D8 Teff indicate naive, day 5 effector, and day 8 effector CD8<sup>+</sup> P14 T cells, respectively.</p>

<title>Translational inhibition of ribosomal protein mRNAs and 5′TOP mRNAs occurs in effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells when the cells stopped dividing just before the contraction phase</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Fold changes of translation activity of all ribosomal protein (RP) mRNAs in effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to all mRNAs in microarray data obtained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>. μ and σ indicate mean and standard deviation, respectively. Fold changes of translation activity, D5 Teff relative to T<sub>n</sub> (top), D8 Teff relative to T<sub>n</sub> (middle), D8 Teff relative to D5 Teff (bottom). (<bold>b</bold>) qRT-PCR data showing the amount of <italic>Rpl29</italic> mRNA in fractions of sucrose gradient of T<sub>n</sub>, D5 Teff, and D8 Teff P14 cell lysate, calculated as a percentage of the total in all fractions. (<bold>c</bold>) Percentage of RP mRNAs in polysome fractions. (<bold>d</bold>) Fold changes of RP mRNA amount per cell in polysome fractions. (<bold>e</bold>) Percentage of 80S ribosomes- (monosome and polysome) free RP mRNAs. (<bold>f</bold>) Fold changes of translation activity of 5′TOP mRNAs except for RP mRNAs in effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Microarray data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> were used for this analysis. In (b)-(e), Teff P14 cells were obtained from spleen of LCMV-infected mice, in which P14 transgenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were adoptively transferred before infection. Naive P14 cells were isolated from spleen of uninfected P14 transgenic mice. Data (<bold>b</bold>) are representative of three independent experiments with samples pooled from 3-10 mice per each group. The mean mRNA level in polysomes (<bold>c-e</bold>) was calculated from 3 independent experiments with samples pooled from 3-10 mice per each group. Error bars are mean +/− s.e.m. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001 (one-way ANOVA). T<sub>n</sub>, D5 Teff, D8 Teff indicate naive, day 5 effector, and day 8 effector CD8<sup>+</sup> P14 T cells, respectively.</p>
