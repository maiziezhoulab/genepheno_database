<p id="Par1">Cerebral organoids are 3D stem cell-derived models that can be utilized to study the human brain. The current consensus is that cerebral organoids consist of cells derived from the neuroectodermal lineage. This limits their value and applicability, as mesodermal-derived microglia are important players in neural development and disease. Remarkably, here we show that microglia can innately develop within a cerebral organoid model and display their characteristic ramified morphology. The transcriptome and response to inflammatory stimulation of these organoid-grown microglia closely mimic the transcriptome and response of adult microglia acutely isolated from post mortem human brain tissue. In addition, organoid-grown microglia mediate phagocytosis and synaptic material is detected inside them. In all, our study characterizes a microglia-containing organoid model that represents a valuable tool for studying the interplay between microglia, macroglia, and neurons in human brain development and disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Microglia are the resident innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). While microglia originate from the mesoderm lineage, other CNS cells like neurons and astrocytes are derived from neuroectodermal progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Besides their immune functions, microglia also control the number of neuronal precursor cells, synapse formation, and synapse elimination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Impaired interaction between microglia, neurons, and astrocytes is increasingly linked to neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), autism, and schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The majority of studies on neuron-glia interactions are performed in rodents, due to a lack of adequate human model systems that recapitulate the development of microglia in vivo and the interplay between microglia, macroglia, and neurons in a 3D context. Human model systems, however, will be vital to understand how neuron-glia interactions impact human CNS development, physiology, and pathology.</p>
<p id="Par4">Recently, stem cell-derived organoid models offer the possibility to study cellular development and inter-cellular interactions within a 3D human brain microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Organoids are generated by culturing embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into embryoid bodies with the potential to develop progenitors from all the three germinal layers: endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm. The embryoid body is pushed into a specific tissue fate, like CNS, by complementing the cell culture medium with growth factors and/or inhibitors. Due to their self-organizing capacity, cell aggregates will then develop into CNS organoids consisting of neuronal sub-types and macroglia, forming specialized CNS-areas such as cortex, hippocampus, and retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. A reported limitation of CNS organoid protocols is that they drive cells into the neuroectoderm lineage by inhibiting mesoderm and endoderm formation. Consequently, CNS organoids have been suggested to lack the complete combination of cells derived from different germ layers that are present in the brain in vivo, including microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">Dual-SMAD inhibition is commonly used to quickly induce neuroectoderm formation in directed differentiation protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, Lancaster and colleagues published a protocol to generate cerebral organoids without the use of any inhibitors or molecular pathway manipulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This approach led to the first 3D organoid model containing distinct brain regions like hippocampus, retina, and different cortical domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Their study reports that non-neuronal cell types are expelled from inside the organoids upon matrigel embedment and that the remaining cells are from the neuronal lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The lack of dual-SMAD inhibition in cerebral organoid generation might explain why Quadrato et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> recently reported the presence of mesoderm-derived progenitors in this model. We hypothesized that these mesodermal progenitors are able to differentiate into mature microglia instructed by the CNS microenvironment provided by neuroectodermal cells. Our results show that cells with a typical microglia molecular phenotype, morphology, and function are present in human cerebral organoids. This 3D organoid model in which microglia, macroglia, and neurons are present is important for studying microglia development, but also for studying neuron-glia interactions in human brain development and disease.</p>

<title>Cerebral organoids contain progenitors from all germ layers</title>
<p id="Par6">Cerebral organoids were generated from human iPSCs according to the protocol described by Lancaster et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> with some minor modifications (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Two of the three iPSC lines used for the organoid cultures have previously been described by us (iPSC 1, 3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and iPSC 5 was similarly generated and characterized (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a–h</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). Ectodermal (PAX6), mesodermal (brachyury), and endodermal (AFP) progenitors were present at an early stage of organoid development (day 17; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). The presence of neuronal architecture and of astrocytes was confirmed by using a range of markers at day 31 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1i–p</xref>). Cleaved-caspase 3 immunostaining at several timepoints and batches (iPSC 1, 3, and 5; at day 17, 38, 52, and 66) showed constant sparse cell death in the organoids.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Mesodermal progenitors develop into microglia-like cells within cerebral organoids. <bold>a</bold> Schematic overview of the cerebral organoid protocol depicting the essential steps in the differentiation process.

<title>Mesodermal progenitors develop into microglia-like cells</title>
<p id="Par7">Next, temporal expression of the mesodermal marker brachyury and the classical microglia marker IBA-1 was examined to assess if the mesodermal cells differentiate into microglia. Brachyury+ cells were present on day 17, 24, and no longer detected at day 52. IBA-1+ cells were detectable in low numbers on day 24 and had populated the organoids at day 52 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). This transition took place around day 24, as at this timepoint a population of cells co-expressed both IBA-1 and brachyury (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). IBA-1<sup>+</sup> cells were initially present in clusters distributed at specific sites in the organoid (day 31; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>), but at later stages were found throughout the organoid (day 52; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>). The fraction IBA-1<sup>+</sup> cells within organoids showed limited variation between batches, timepoints, and donors (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a–c</xref>), and microglia quantity was positively correlated with TUJ1 expression (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2d</xref>). Furthermore, microglia-containing organoids demonstrated proper neuronal development and cortical layer organization, based on expression of NEUN, PAX6, CTIP2, and TBR1 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2e</xref>). In rodents, microglia have a rounded morphology (amoeboid) at the moment they invade the brain parenchyma. At later stages, these cells develop characteristic ramifications. This process of differentiation is mirrored in the human organoids. IBA-1<sup>+</sup> cells had a round morphology up to day 31, and showed a significant increase (Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> = 0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03) in ramifications by day 52, here shown by an increase in perimeter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f, g</xref>). Microglial complexity progressed in time as IBA-1<sup>+</sup> cells showed further ramification at day 66 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref>).</p>

<title>Microglia-specific molecular signature in cerebral organoids</title>
<p id="Par8">To determine whether the microglia within cerebral organoids developed in analogy to microglia in vivo, we assessed the expression of genes crucial for microglia development and function.

<p id="Par10">To further validate the microglia phenotype of oMG, we performed RNAseq transcriptomic profiling of oMG isolated from three independent organoid donors (oMG1, 3 and 5) at day 38 and day 52. Inter-donor variability was small (oMG <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.91 ± 0.001) when examined with Spearman correlation coefficients (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering shows that oMG clustered separately from adult microglia (adult MG1) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4b</xref>). When comparing the data with the original iPSC lines and fibroblasts from the same donors, unsupervised hierarchical clustering, Spearman correlation coefficients, and principal component analyses (PCA) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a, b</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4c</xref>) showed that both at day 38 and day 52 oMG closely resemble adult MG1.

<p id="Par11">The effect of the organoid CNS microenvironment on the development and differentiation of oMG was further evaluated by comparing the transcriptional landscape of these cells to previously published microglia datasets. For this purpose transcriptomic data from fetal microglia (fetal MG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, a 2-dimensional (2D) iPSC-microglia model (iPSC MG 1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, and data from other acutely isolated adult microglia (adult MG 2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> was included. The transcriptomes were compared for all available transcriptome data, but also using a panel of transcription factors that are expressed by microglia in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The study by Gosselin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> describes that in the absence of other CNS cell types, microglia lose expression of these adult microglia-related transcription factor families. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of all available transcriptome data revealed that both day 38 and day 52 oMG cluster with adult MG1 and previously published adult MG2, whereas iPSC MG clustered with fetal MG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3f</xref>). Interestingly, iPSC MG and fetal MG first clustered with iPSC and fibroblasts prior to clustering with the oMG and adult MG 1 and 2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3f</xref>). Despite this clustering, Spearman correlation coefficients showed that the transcriptomic profiles of all microglia and microglia-like cells were relatively similar (<italic>ρ</italic> = 0.7 ± 0.07) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4d</xref>). The Spearman correlation analyses of the transcriptomes of oMG day 52, adult MG1, iPSC MG and fetal MG by using microglia-specific transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) showed a strong correlation between iPSC MG and fetal MG (<italic>ρ</italic> = 0.96), whereas transcription factor profiles of oMG correlated most with those of adult MG1 (<italic>ρ</italic> = 0.8). The correlation between adult MG1 and fetal MG was low (<italic>ρ</italic> = 0.37) in this analysis (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4e</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par12">Taken together, transcriptome comparisons showed that oMG strongly correlate with adult MG1 and 2, whereas the 2D iPSC MG model highly correlate with fetal MG.</p>
<p id="Par13">To further analyze differences in gene expression between oMG and adult MG, we analyzed transcriptomic differences between day oMG and adult MG1 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4f–h</xref>). Sample variability and size resulted in high Log2fold changes and therefore shrinkage correction was performed. 1220 genes remained that were significantly upregulated in oMG day 52 and 1271 genes in MG1 (FDR &lt; 0.05) whereas 2400 genes were significantly upregulated in oMG at day 38 and 2070 in adult MG1 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4i, j</xref>). Top 100 upregulated genes in oMG day 52 included <italic>FN1, CDH4, COL1A2</italic> and <italic>COL3A1</italic> for oMG and, <italic>CDHR1</italic>, <italic>CXCR1</italic> and <italic>ACKR2</italic> for adult MG1 (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">1</xref>). Functional gene classification with Panther GO-Slim<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> on the top 100 upregulated genes in both day 52 oMG and adult MG showed that the significantly upregulated genes in both samples belong to similar biological processes suggesting only subtle differences between oMG and adult MG. GO-pathway analysis on all DEGs did not show any significantly enriched pathways in adult MG1 vs. oMG, whereas oMG showed enrichment for “collagen catabolic process”, “extracellular matrix organization”, “negative chemotaxis”, “positive regulation of synapse assembly”, and “endodermal cell differentiation” compared to adult MG1 (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">2</xref>). Myeloid function-related terms were detected by GO-pathway analysis of common genes (between adult MG1 and day 52 oMG), such as “nervous system development”, “interleukin-12-mediated signaling pathway”, and “neutrophil degranulation” (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">2</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par14">Thus, both at the whole transcriptome level and when comparing microglia-specific factors and biological pathways, oMG are very similar to adult MG.</p>

Due to this lower number, no significantly enriched pathways were detected when comparing day 38 and day 52 oMG.

<p id="Par20">Immunohistochemistry for IBA-1 and TUJ1 followed by epifluorescent microscopy showed that although during early development (day 31) oMG were still in an amoeboid state these cells were already located in close proximity to neurites (TUJ1) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). Upon further ramification, these oMG and their processes became more intertwined with neuronal processes (day 52, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). As microglia have been reported to regulate synaptic morphology and function we tested whether functional synapses are present in the organoids. Indeed, postsynaptic responses to presynaptic release of glutamate were detected at day 52 as evidenced by spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1q</xref>). Further, voltage-dependent sodium channels were present as inward currents were registered in response to evoked increases in membrane potential (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1r, s</xref>). These data suggest that cerebral organoids contain functional synapses and could be used for studying the potential effect of microglia on synapse function. But can oMG processes be found in close proximity to neuronal synaptic structures? To address this question, we applied super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy to study the distribution of microglia (IBA-1) in relation to the postsynaptic marker PSD-95 in cerebral organoids. High-resolution images from the STED experiment showed significant overlap between IBA-1 and PSD-95 signals, with PSD-95 material either inside IBA-1<sup>+</sup> oMG processes or being in contact with or partially engulfed by oMG ramifications (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>oMG form functional interactions with neurons and respond to inflammatory stimuli in situ. <bold>a</bold> Microglia (IBA-1)–neuron (TUJ1) interaction at an early (day 31) and late (day 52) timepoint was visualized by immunostainings.

<sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par23">The current consensus is that cerebral organoids mainly consist of differentiated cells from the neuroectodermal lineage. This is a commonly mentioned drawback of this otherwise innovative model as cells derived from other lineages, such as microglia, play a crucial role in brain development, physiology, and pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Our data refutes this assumption, as we show that microglia can innately develop within cerebral organoids. Single-cell RNAseq analyses of cerebral organoids by Quadrato et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> did show the presence of mesodermal progenitors in cerebral organoids, but these did not display signs of microglial differentiation. In our study, instead of adding extra BDNF to the differentiation cocktail, like Quadrato et al., we reduced levels of the neuroectoderm stimulant heparin and delayed matrigel embedment of the organoids. Although we also detected oMG following the original protocol of Lancaster et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, we found that this adaptation improved the yield of microglia. These oMG display a characteristic ramified morphology, express microglia-specific markers, mediate inflammatory responses, and have phagocytotic capacity.</p>
<p id="Par24">The development of in vitro models to study human microglia has been a major challenge in the field. Primary microglia can be isolated from fresh human brain tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and microglia can be derived from iPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, but both methods have their own specific limitations. For example, acutely isolated microglia from post mortem brain or surgery tissue yields a limited number of cells. Another confounding factor is the quality of the post mortem tissue, and phenotypic changes induced by 2D in vitro culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Several recently published human iPSC-derived microglia differentiation protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> partly circumvent these limitations. However, although these studies represent great advances in the field, they still do not provide for the 3D interaction of microglia throughout brain development with neurons and astrocytes in a human physiological setting. To generate microglia from iPSCs, protein cocktails are used that are known to drive microglia development in rodents, such as CSF1, IL34, and TGFβ1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Interestingly, these factors are innately expressed by cerebral organoids as shown in the present study. It is thought that these previously identified factors act in concert with other yet undefined factors secreted or expressed by neurons and astrocytes to induce microglia differentiation and regulate microglia phenotype. This idea is supported by a recent paper describing that co-culture of iPSC-derived microglia with neurons changes the phenotype of microglia into a more homeostatic one<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Therefore, although every method to isolate or generate human microglia will have its own limitations, the advantage of oMG may be that these cells develop simultaneously with other cell types that provide for essential molecular factors in a 3D brain environment.</p>
<p id="Par25">To validate the microglia identity of oMG, cells were phenotypically and functionally characterized and compared to adult MG. At a cellular level, oMG resembled adult MG in several ways. For example, when comparing the expression levels of extracellular surface markers, the response of oMG and adult MG to inflammatory stimuli, and the phagocytic response to iC3b-coated-particles. Functional synapses were detected in the organoids and microscopy-based approaches detected microglial ramifications in close proximity to neuronal processes and synaptic material. Different mechanisms of synaptic pruning have been described, including synaptic stripping, phagocytosis, and trogocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Our super-resolution microscopy data detected postsynaptic material inside and in close proximity to oMG, suggesting these different mechanisms may be at play as has been reported for MG. Future studies are needed to dissect these mechanisms for oMG in cerebral organoids, but our data further identify the organoid model as a valuable tool for studying human microglia-neuron interactions in 3D brain tissue.</p>
<p id="Par26">At the transcriptome level, comparison between oMG and adult MG1, showed that oMG expressed key microglia markers (e.g., <italic>SPI1, AIF1, CSF1R, TLR4</italic>) at similar levels to MG found in human post mortem samples. Some key genes like <italic>P2RY12, TREM2</italic>, and <italic>TMEM119</italic> that were lowly expressed in oMG cultured for 52 days compared to adult MG, increased when oMG were held in culture longer (119 days). Whole transcriptome comparison with other datasets, including adult MG from this study, and previously published datasets of adult MG, fetal MG and iPSC MG, consistently validated the microglial identity of oMG. Our data replicated the finding of Muffat et al. that iPSC MG cluster with fetal MG rather than adult MG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. When comparing a selection of transcription factors that are important for microglia in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, adult MG had the lowest correlation with fetal MG, which could reflect a maturation effect. Simultaneously, oMG strongly correlated with adult MG, whereas fetal MG correlated with iPSC MG. Still, comparisons between multiple available datasets, including the ones in this study, have inherent limitations due to differences in sample processing of the different resources. Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that the mature phenotype of oMG may result from their interaction with other cell types in 3D, interactions during differentiation not present in recently published iPSC MG studies.</p>
<p id="Par27">Our finding that microglia are present in cerebral organoids provides novel opportunities for studying the human brain. First, this model can be used to study the development of human microglia in association with other developing human brain cells. Gene editing of the iPSCs can be used to study the role of specific factors that mediate the interaction between neurons and glia. Second, this model will be useful to investigate how microglia are involved in the development of human neurons and astrocytes, including processes such as neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and synaptic pruning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Third, this human cell model can be used to study the pathogenesis of brain infections by viruses such as Zika virus and HIV-1. Microglia are considered to be an important target for these viruses and their immune reaction is likely to play a role in the brain pathology caused by these pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Fourth, this model can be used to understand the role of microglia, macroglia and neurons in neurodevelopmental diseases, especially diseases with a clear genetic component, such as autism and schizophrenia. Fifth, it opens new avenues to study diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and ALS in which a role for microglia and their interaction with astrocytes and neurons is increasingly recognized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par28">Although the organoid model presented here is the first method to develop iPSC-derived human microglia in a 3D neuronal niche, it has a number of limitations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. An important limitation is the fact that organoids are still far from representing the human brain as they, for example, lack vasculature and cross-talk with other tissues in the developing embryo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Another limitation is that the heterogeneity of cell types in cerebral organoids, due to the absence of SMAD inhibition, co-occurs with an increase in organoid-to-organoid variability. Although microglia where detected in all organoids generated in our study, their distribution was variable. A promising application to limit variability instigated by the use of multiple iPSC donors is the use of isogenic controls to study the role of specific proteins or genetic risk variants on microglia development, phenotype and function. In addition, although it is important to study microglia in the 3D context, there are inherent technical challenges as compared to studying these cells in 2D cultures. Fortunately, many tools have been developed in the past decade to study specific cell types in complete tissue, such as tissue clearing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, cell-type specific expression of fluorescent reporters, and advanced microscopic techniques, including light sheet, super-resolution, and live-cell imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Similar approaches can be employed to study microglia in the organoid in situ, but these will need further optimization.</p>
<p id="Par29">In conclusion, here we report a method to develop iPSC-derived microglia in a 3D neuronal niche. The potential to study neuron/microglia interactions within human brain tissue will significantly further our knowledge of the structural, functional, and molecular mechanisms underlying microglia (dys)function in the intact and diseased human brain.</p>

Approximately 11,500 cells per microwell were left to form embryoid bodies overnight. After 48 h, embryoid bodies (EB; 325 + /- 40 μm) were transferred to ultra-low attachment 96-well plates (Corning, 3474). Medium was replaced at day 4 by hESC0 (hESC without bFGF) and at day 6 by neural induction medium (NIM). At day 13, organoids (570 + /- 50 μm) were embedded in matrigel (Corning, 356234) and kept in organoid differentiation medium without retinoic acid (RA). Four days later they were transferred to spinning bioreactors on a magnetic platform (27.5 rpm; Pfeiffer, 183-001). No changes were made in the composition of the medium compared to the original protocol with exception of Heparin in the NIM where we used 0.1 μg/mL instead of 1 μg/mL.

FASTQ files were mapped to the hg19/GCh37 reference human genome (iGenomes). For adult MG1, oMG day 38 and oMG day 52 Bowtie2 (version 2.1.0) and TopHat2 (version 2.0.14) software was used for read alignment. TopHat2 (version 2.0.13) was used for alignment of fibroblast and iPSC reads. Read counts per transcript were determined using HTSeq software (version 0.6.1).

Two batches of organoids from oMG 1, 3, and 5 were used for this experiment.</p>

<p id="Par50">Anti-human IL6, TNF-α, and IL10 ELISA Ready-Set-Go<sup>®</sup> kits (eBioscience, 88706688, 88734688 and 88734688, respectively) were used according to manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were analyzed in a Varioskan™ Flash (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA) with an optical density (OD) of 450 nm. Blank subtraction was performed and the value of the samples was based on the standard curve.</p>

<title>Protein expression analysis</title>
<p id="Par52">In all, 8*10<sup>5</sup> single cells from fresh human brain material and cerebral organoids were stained in a 96-well V-bottom plate using the following antibodies from Ebioscience (San Diego, CA): CD45 (#119459), CD11b (#12011841), CD14 (clone 61D3, #90170149025), CD11c (clone 3.9, #11011641), HLA-DR (clone LN3, #17995641), CX3CR1 (clone eB149/10H5, #17609941), IgG1 (#114714 and #17471441), IgG2b (#17403181); antibodies from BD Bioscience: CD206 (#561763); antibodies from BioLegend IgG2b (#400319). Protein expression was quantified on a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FACSDiva software (Version 8.0.1, BD Biosciences). Protein expression was measured in cells that were gated to be alive, single, and CD11b<sup>+</sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5b</xref>). The geoMFI mean was subtracted from the geoMFI of the corresponding isotype control.</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p id="Par53">Organoids were cut in two and continuously perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 32 <bold>°</bold>C ± 1, containing 120 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 1.3 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM <sc>d</sc>-glucose, and 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4. Patch pipettes for recording were produced from borosilicate glass (1.5 mm outer diameter, 0.86 mm inner diameter; Harvard Apparatus Limited, Holliston, Massachusetts, USA; pipette resistance ~4–5 MΩ) on a P-97 Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, USA) and filled with pipette solution containing (in mM): 120 Cs methane sulfonate, 17.5 CsCl, 10 Hepes, 2 MgATP, 0.1 NaGTP, 5 BAPTA; pH was 7.4, adjusted with CsOH. Whole cell voltage clamp recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California, USA) amplifier. Responses were filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz using Digidata 1322 A (Axon Instruments, USA). Data was analyzed using pClamp 9.0 and Clampfit 9.2 (Axon Instruments). Recordings with a series resistance of less than 2.5 times the pipette resistance were accepted for analysis. The holding potential for spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents was kept at –65 mV. The voltage-dependent sodium currents were activated with depolarizing voltage steps with duration of 100 ms starting from –60 mV with increments of 10 mV to + 40 mV (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2E</xref>). Series resistance was compensated for approximately 70%. Due to the very small voltage-dependent potassium and calcium currents, it was not necessary to block these currents.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p id="Par54">Statistical comparisons were performed with Friedman’s ANOVA, two-tailed Mann–Whitney (non-paired data) and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank (paired data) tests by using GraphPad Prism software version 6 (Graphpad Software, CA), as normality assumptions were not met. R version 3.0.2 software (CRAN:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org">https://www.r-project.org</ext-link>) was used for RNA sequencing data analysis. Immunofluorescent images were analyzed and quantified by using FIJI version 1.49 software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). A significance level of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was used.</p>
