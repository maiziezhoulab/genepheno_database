<p id="Par1">WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing 3 (<italic>WDFY3</italic>; also known as Autophagy-Linked FYVE or Alfy) is an identified intellectual disability, developmental delay and autism risk gene. This gene encodes for a scaffolding protein that is expressed in both the developing and adult central nervous system and required for autophagy and aggrephagy with yet unexplored roles in mitophagy. Given that mitochondrial trafficking, dynamics and remodeling have key roles in synaptic plasticity, we tested the role of Wdfy3 on brain bioenergetics by using <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> mice, the only known <italic>Wdfy3</italic> mutant animal model with overt neurodevelopmental anomalies that survive to adulthood. We found that Wdfy3 is required for sustaining brain bioenergetics and morphology via mitophagy. Decreased mitochondrial quality control by conventional mitophagy was partly compensated for by the increased formation of mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDV) targeted to lysosomal degradation (micromitophagy). These observations, extended through proteomic analysis of mitochondria-enriched cortical fractions, showed significant enrichment for pathways associated with mitophagy, mitochondrial transport and axon guidance via semaphorin, Robo, L1cam and Eph-ephrin signaling. Collectively, our findings support a critical role for Wdfy3 in mitochondrial homeostasis with implications for neuron differentiation, neurodevelopment and age-dependent neurodegeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">The human central nervous system has relatively high energy demands, with approximately 20% of total metabolic expenditure being incurred by about 2% of body mass. The majority of this energy is spent on the principal neuronal function of firing action potentials and neuronal communication through chemical synapses by providing support to the Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Mitochondria, via the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through a process named oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), sustains the Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity and cellular growth and proliferation. Based on the critical role of mitochondria in neurons, mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with several neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders as well as major psychiatric illnesses, including depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Adequate mitochondrial function relies on the fine balance between mitochondrial biogenesis and the selective autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria or mitophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Remarkably, these processes not only preside mitochondrial morphology and number <italic>per</italic> cell, but also cellular bioenergetics. It is therefore not unreasonable to hypothesize that deficits in mitophagy could be associated with impaired cellular energetic balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and importantly, with clinically significant psychiatric and neurological disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">Among the autophagy-regulating factors that play a role in neurodevelopment, brain function and mental health, Wdfy3 (WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing 3, also known as autophagy-linked FYVE or Alfy) is of particular interest. Human <italic>WDFY3</italic> has been shown to be a risk gene for intellectual and developmental disabilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and has been associated with familial microcephaly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> as well as ASD with macrocephaly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. <italic>Wdfy3</italic> encodes a key adaptor molecule in autophagy likely involved in autophagosome to lysosome fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Wdfy3 belongs to the BEACH (<bold>BE</bold>ige <bold>A</bold>nd <bold>CH</bold>S proteins) protein family and contains, in addition to its BEACH domain, five WD40 repeats and a <italic>C</italic>-terminal FYVE (<bold>F</bold>ab1/<bold>Y</bold>OTB/<bold>V</bold>ac1/<bold>E</bold>EA1) domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A</xref>). Wdfy3 has been shown to interact directly with the lipid membrane component phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate through its FYVE domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, with Atg5 through its WD repeats (WDR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and with the ubiquitin-binding protein P62/Sqstm1 via its BEACH domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A</xref>). In particular, Wdfy3’s interaction with Atg5 connects it with the core macroautophagic machinery through a greater network that involves additional components, including Atg12, Atg16L and LC3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1B</xref>). While the exact function of the Wdfy3 BEACH domain is still not completely understood, some insight arises from our previous studies on <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup><italic>disc</italic></sup> mice, an animal model that lacks both WD40 repeats and the zinc-finger-FYVE domain (stop at amino acid 3064), but still preserves the BEACH domain resulting in a substantially milder phenotype compared to the <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup><italic>lacZ</italic></sup> mice [with disruption at amino acid 191, and hence missing BEACH domain, WD40 repeats and zinc-finger-FYVE domain; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>]. Gene ontology analysis of Wdfy3-associated biological pathways shows significant involvement of Wdfy3 in macroautophagy, but also in selective autophagy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1C</xref>), a process that involves the elimination of specific cellular structures, which if not properly removed, could lead to cellular damage (e.g., mitophagy, nucleophagy, among others; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1C</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Wdfy3 protein domains, protein network and pathways.

<p id="Par4">Recent findings on WDR- and BEACH-containing proteins have shed light on their involvement in neurological diseases. WDR40-47, a microtubule-associated protein, is relevant for both autophagy and brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and among the &gt;200 WDR genes annotated in both human and murine genomes, mutations in ~10% of the WDR genes have been implicated in brain disorders, including intellectual disability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Homozygous genetic ablation of <italic>Wdfy3</italic> in mice leads to perinatal lethality and global long-range connectivity defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Loss of bchs, the Wdfy3 homologous protein in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2A</xref>), results in altered endolysosomal transport, neurodegeneration and shorter lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, comparable to some human neurodegenerative disorders [e.g., Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Wallerian neurodegeneration and spastic paraplegia]. Deficits or pathogenic mutations in BEACH-containing proteins other than WDFY3 in humans (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2B</xref>) are associated with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, epilepsy, ASD, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, ALS and Parkinson’s disease (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2B</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Involvement of BEACH-containing proteins in diseases.

For the case of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the effect of Bchs deficiency in the context of human disease was obtained from multiple studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e552" xlink:href="41598_2018_29421_Fig2_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par5">In the present studies, we investigated the role of Wdfy3 on selective autophagy (mitophagy) by utilizing <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> mice, the only known heterozygous <italic>Wdfy3</italic> mouse model that displays overt neurodevelopmental anomalies and that also survive to adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The rationale for our search for potential deficits in mitochondrial function of <italic>Wdfy3</italic> haploinsufficiency is based on (i) the high expression of <italic>Wdfy3</italic> in both the developing central nervous system and adult brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>; (ii) the critical role of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation at controlling the transition from neural stem cells (NSC) to intermediate progenitor cells (IPC) in the mammalian neocortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>; and (iii) the premise that clearance of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy is vital to proper mitochondrial trafficking, an essential aid to brain plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. To this end, we assessed the role of Wdfy3 in brains from adult <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> and wild type (WT) mice via detailed biochemical, microscopic, and proteomic methods. Our analysis confirmed deficiencies in mitochondrial function of <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> mice resulting from defective mitophagy. Our observations indicate that the clearance of damaged mitochondria in the setting of <italic>Wdfy3</italic> haploinsufficiency may be partly abrogated through the formation of mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDV), subsequently targeted to lysosomes for degradation in a process named micromitophagy. We complemented this work by a global proteomics approach which indicated dysregulated cellular pathways consistent with the brain abnormalities and biochemical changes observed in <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> mice. Specifically, we observed significant over-representation of pathways regulating not only mitophagy and autophagy, but also mitochondrial transport, axonal transport and remodeling of the axonal cytoskeleton, with the involvement of Semaphorin, Robo, L1cam, and Eph-ephrin signaling.</p>
<p id="Par6">Herein, we present substantial evidence (<italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>) that Wdfy3 is required for mitophagy as well as for mitochondrial transport, likely leading to accumulation of defective mitochondria and impaired brain bioenergetics. The accumulation of defective mitochondria compromises fatty acid β-oxidation, thereby affecting neuron differentiation and/or NSC-to-IPS transition during neurodevelopment. These findings provide a mechanism for the increased developmental neurogenesis due to an enlarged NSC pool that arises through an expansion of self-renewing divisions of radial glial cells with perinatal gains in cerebral length observed in the <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and likely a functional link for this gene to intellectual and developmental disabilities as well as ASD.</p>

<title>Wdfy3 deficits result in perinatal mortality</title>
<p id="Par7">All experiments were conducted on WT controls and age-matched <italic>Wdfy3</italic>-haploinsufficient mice due to the perinatal lethality of the homozygous mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The C57BL/6NJ genetic background was chosen because the more widely available C57BL/6J mice carry a deletion encompassing the <italic>Nnt</italic> gene resulting in negligible mitochondrial nicotinamide transhydrogenase activity, with consequent increased background-levels of mitochondrial oxidative stress, affecting bioenergetic capabilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par8"><italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup><italic>lacZ</italic></sup> mice, whose generation was previously described in detail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, carry a knockout first, <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter-tagged insertion construct integrated between exons 7 and 8 (disruption at aa 191)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Previously reported Western blot analysis confirmed that the <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup><italic>lacZ</italic></sup> allele is a hypomorph with overt loss of the largest ~400-kD isoform, but with the retention of smaller bands (possibly isoforms of smaller MW that cross-reacted with the antibody).</p>
<p id="Par9"><italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> mice, just as other transgenic models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, were born at Mendelian ratios (<italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup>/WT ratio = 0.7 ± 0.2, mean ± SD; <italic>n</italic> = 518 mice born). <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> dams compared to WT ones had smaller litter sizes at both birth and weaning (decreased by about 20–25%; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3A</xref>). Several haploinsufficient pups died within the first postnatal weeks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3A,B</xref>), resulting in lower-than-Mendelian ratios of survivors at weaning (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3C</xref>). Changing the mating scheme from haploinsufficient female × WT male to haploinsufficient male × WT female improved the litter size as well as their survival by &gt;20% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3A,B</xref>). Deficits in rearing success by <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> dams, compared to WT, were inferred from the wean-to-born ratio, which when calculated by <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> dams was significantly decreased (by 24%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.023; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3B</xref>) compared to either WT dams or published ratios for C57BL/6J<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. While a significant loss of <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> pups was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3C</xref>), <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> females appeared to survive at a greater extent than males at weaning (by 7–10 mice; <italic>p</italic> = 0.092; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3C</xref>). As a result, the proportion of females was higher in the post-weaned <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> group than in WT (62.7% vs. 54.3%, respectively; <italic>p</italic> = 0.018; Z-statistics 2.361; 95%CI = 55.52 to 69.49).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Perinatal mortality and survival of <italic>Wdfy3</italic> insufficient pups.

<p id="Par10">In previously reported findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, we noticed cerebral lengthening and mild cortical abnormalities in <italic>Wdfy3</italic>-haploinsufficient mice at birth. To explore whether overt neuropathological abnormalities were observed in adult <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> mice, we examined brains by whole-mount imaging and in sections (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). While we noted a trend towards increased brain size in adult <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> mice, analysis of whole-mount brains by wet weight did not reveal significant differences between genotypes (Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.301). Further histological examination of hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections also did not reveal any differences in brain morphology between genotypes confirming that any perinatal structural anomalies are transient in nature and absent in adult life (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). To gain a better understanding of Wdfy3’s role in adult brain, we evaluated Wdfy3 expression by following the endogenous expression of the <italic>lacZ</italic>-reporter gene inserted into the <italic>Wdfy3</italic> locus through X-gal staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4A–D</xref>, top panels). X-gal staining confirmed that Wdfy3 was widely expressed in adult cortex and cerebellum as well as in other brain structures, with highest levels seen in accessory olfactory bulb, hippocampal CA3 region, lateral cortical aspects, and cerebellar Purkinje cell layer.

Overall, a greater proportion of cells expressing Wdfy3 was visualized in cerebellum than cortex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4B–D</xref>), consistent with the reported proteomic profile of Wdfy3 expression in WT mice (Wdfy3 expression cerebellum-to-cortex = 70-to-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>).

<p id="Par13">An important neurodevelopmental phenomenon apparently connected to Wdfy3 involves mechanisms that help dendrites originating from a single neuron practice self-avoidance in order to be arranged in spatially non-overlapping patterns, a process requiring contact-dependent recognition and repulsion.

<title>Wdfy3 is critical for mitophagy, mitochondrial function and distribution in neuronal projections</title>
<p id="Par14">Synaptic function and plasticity rely on mitochondrial function and efficient trafficking of mitochondria to neuronal projections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The attachment of mitochondrial organelles to microtubule-based motor proteins contributes to anterograde trafficking to provide energy and metabolic turnover needed to sustain neurotransmission and calcium regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The opposite mechanism, retrograde transport of compromised mitochondria, is essential for their clearance <italic>via</italic> mitophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Considering the role of Wdfy3 in autophagy and the critical role of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation in sustaining neural stem cell self-renewal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> we sought to assess mitochondria dynamics (i.e., distribution and morphology) and bioenergetics (i.e., ATP generation by mitochondria) in <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> mice.</p>
<p id="Par15">To visualize mitochondrial dynamics, primary cortical neurons from cortex of sex- and age-matched WT and <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> mice were stained with MitoTracker, a dye that accumulates and is retained by polarized mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Mitochondria from WT cortical neurons were elongated and tubular, extending from soma to projections (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6C</xref>). In contrast, cortical neurons from haploinsufficient mice showed fewer polarized mitochondria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6D</xref>). This observation is consistent with other microscopy-based assessments, notably the smaller total mitochondrial area <italic>per</italic> cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6E</xref>), as well as the average perimeter and area <italic>per</italic> mitochondrion; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6F</xref>). Further, in <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> neurons, mitochondria were organized within more sparse networks with fewer, shorter branches (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6G</xref><bold>)</bold>, indicating issues with mitochondrial transport along projections. Independent evaluation of mitochondrial mass (not related to polarization) was performed by assessing citrate synthase activity in cortex from WT and haploinsufficient mice (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). This activity was significantly higher in <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> cortex vs. controls; however, the difference was only by ~9%, thus supporting the idea that the decreased polarized, functional mitochondria was not the result of lower content of mitochondria.</p>
<p id="Par16">While mitochondrial depolarization is a key event for triggering Pink1- and Parkin-dependent mitophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, the accumulation of depolarized mitochondria in <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> was suggestive of halted or defective mitophagy. Moreover, some mitochondria in primary cortical neurons from haploinsufficient mice exhibited budding protrusions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6C,D</xref><bold>)</bold>, sometimes surrounded by smaller mitochondrial particles. These structures were reminiscent of mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDV) detected in an autophagic process termed micromitophagy that occurs independently of Pink1- and Parkin-dependent mitophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Micromitophagy (also known as Type 3 mitophagy) includes the release of cargo-selective vesicles that bud off mitochondria independently of the mitochondrial fission machinery. Based on the most recent reports on MDV, these vesicles differ from mitochondrial fragments by at least three distinct criteria: (i) the nature of the cargo incorporated within vesicles; (ii) formation through a Drp1-independent manner; and (iii) morphology, in that they have a limited diameter of &lt;200 nm containing either a single outer membrane or a double membrane-bound structure lacking cristae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Proteomics analyses performed on both mitochondria-enriched fractions and MDV-enriched fractions revealed that cortical mitochondria from <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> were enriched with mitochondrial proteins located at the intermembrane space, inner membrane and matrix and mostly depleted of proteins at the outer membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7A,</xref> inset 1). The ratio of the sum of all mitochondrial proteins identified in the MDV fraction in haploinsufficient mice relative to WT was 2.1 ± 0.2 (mean ± SE; <italic>n</italic> = 109 proteins) suggesting that cortical neurons had 2-fold enrichment of MDVs compared to WT. Furthermore, the MDV fraction was enriched in specific mitochondrial proteins, as well as a few proteins from the retromer complex and from endosomes as observed by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7B</xref>), and also enriched in some, but not all, subunits of Complex IV, Complex V and isocitrate dehydrogenase, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7B</xref>). Taken together, the presence of smaller and budding mitochondria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>), decreased mitochondrial envelope cargo in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>), an estimated size of MDV of &lt;200 nm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>), and cargo composition of the MDV fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>) are highly indicative of the activation of micromitophagy. Furthermore, the lack of differences in the abundance of fission proteins between the two genotypes in cortical mitochondria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7A</xref>, inset 2), except Mief1, as well as in the MDV-enriched fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7B</xref>) are indicative of a process that took place without significant input from the fusion-fission machinery. The lower abundance of the mitochondrial dynamics protein of 51 kD (Mief1) in the cortical mitochondrial fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7A</xref>, inset 2) suggests that there might be down-regulation of the recruitment and association of Drp1 to the mitochondrial envelope as this protein is a key factor at regulating Drp1 GTPase activity as well as Drp1 oligomerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par18">Consistent with the concept of halted mitophagy and enhanced micromitophagy, Pink1 (required for mitophagy activation <italic>via</italic> Parkin-phosphorylation), Mfn2 and Vdac (substrates of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination), as well as LC3I and LC3II levels (in which an increased LC3II-to-LC3I ratio is considered a marker of autophagy activation) were not significantly different between genotypes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). But the expression levels of Parkin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8C,D</xref>) and Lamp2 (a lysosomal marker; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8C,D</xref>) were significantly increased in mitochondria-enriched fractions of haploinsufficient mice (Parkin by 2- and 3-fold in cortex and cerebellum, respectively; Lamp2 by 2-fold in cortex and hippocampus, and by 3-fold in cerebellum) with a lower recruitment of Sqstm1/p62 to mitochondria (by 27% and 30% of WT in cortex and cerebellum, respectively; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8C,D</xref>). These results were further confirmed by filtering the mitochondrial proteomics data by keywords related to mitophagy and autophagy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>). Of note, the relatively higher levels of Parkin in cortex and cerebellum in haploinsufficient mice vs. WT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8B,C</xref>) were consistent with the reported dependence of the formation of MDVs on Parkin levels in HeLa and U2OS cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>; this and our results are in contrast with the previously reported suppression of MDVs by high levels of Parkin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. This discrepancy is likely due to differences in cell type (neurons vs. immune cells), effectors (Wdfy3 haploinsufficiency vs. immune triggers) and level of Parkin (about 2-fold, this study, vs. GST-tagged Parkin overexpression).<fig id="Fig9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Differential expression of proteins involved in autophagy and mitophagy in brain of WT and <italic>Wdfy3</italic> mice.

We also noted lower CCO activity, as well as a decreased spared respiratory capacity (SRC) and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS)/proton leak. Overall, the most consistent deficit across brain regions (excluding olfactory bulb) was a decrease in cristae density (decreases by 35%, 21% and 33% of the CCO/CS ratio for cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus, respectively). The magnitude of this deficit was comparable to the overall decreased OXPHOS capacity in cortex and cerebellum. The decreases in ATP production (sustained by NAD<sup>+</sup>- or FAD<sup>+</sup>-linked substrates), CCO activity and spared respiratory capacity observed in cortex of haploinsufficient mice did not seem to be associated with a consistent decreased levels of mitochondrial respiratory chain protein complexes, as some of them (Ndufa1, Ndufa12, ND4) showed higher and others (Atp5e, Ndufaf2, Coq9) lower levels than WT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7A</xref>). As indicated before, although a statistically significant difference in the activity of the matrix marker citrate synthase was noted in cortex and cerebellum of <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> mice relative to WT, the extent of this difference argues against its biological relevance <italic>in vivo</italic> (9% for both brain areas). Thus, this suggests that variations in mitochondrial biogenesis are not relevant to the phenotypes we have observed, and instead emphasizes the accumulation of damaged proteins within mitochondria as a primary mechanism preventing their normal assembly into super-complexes and ATP production.</p>
<p id="Par21">The above results obtained <italic>in vivo</italic> were supported by <italic>in vitro</italic> findings utilizing a different, yet relevant, biological model. This model consisted of siRNA-mediated <italic>Wdfy3</italic> knockdown in murine neuronal (striatal) progenitor cells (NPCs), which resulted in <italic>Wdfy3</italic> levels reduced by &gt;70%. Concomitant gene expression levels, evaluated by qPCR were reduced to 22% of control levels and protein expression by immunocytochemistry to 28% of levels seen in scrambled-RNA-treated NPCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10A</xref>). Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor and autophagy activator rapamycin increased LC3 staining (a marker of autophagy) and number of LC3<sup>+</sup> puncta in control neurons, a response that was significantly blunted in Wdfy3-deficient neurons (by 70%; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10B</xref>). Thus, as seen <italic>in vivo</italic>, in this cellular model the LC3-dependent step, shared by both autophagy and mitophagy, was halted (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>).<fig id="Fig10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>Dampening of autophagy activation in <italic>Wdfy3</italic>-deficient neuronal progenitor cells is accompanied by decreased mitophagy.

<p id="Par22">Because mitochondria of cultured <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> primary cortical neurons displayed defective morphology and distribution, we used confocal microscopy to evaluate total mitochondrial mass (assessed by the abundant β-subunit of the mitochondrial F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase or ATP5B) and visualize polarized mitochondria following MitoTracker staining in NPCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10C</xref>). Total mitochondrial mass in Wdfy3-deficient NPCs was comparable to controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10C</xref>), whereas the mass of polarized mitochondria was decreased by 30–40% in Wdfy3-deficient NPCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10C,D</xref>). Comparable to our observations in cortical primary neurons from haploinsufficient mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6D,F</xref>), but more pronounced due to the almost complete loss of Wdfy3 induced by siRNA knockdown, mitochondria from <italic>Wdfy3</italic>-silenced NPCs were smaller (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10E,F</xref>), less tubular in shape (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10G</xref>), and as part of a disrupted network (less networks with smaller branches; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10H,I</xref>) compared to the more tubular and evenly distributed mitochondria of scrambled RNA-treated control NPCs. Furthermore, most Wdfy3-deficient NPC mitochondria had a noticeably perinuclear distribution, with fewer organelles localized in the cellular periphery and projections (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10J</xref>). Taken together, these results were highly indicative of an imbalance between antero- and retrograde trafficking of mitochondria along neuronal projections as observed in some neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> and fragileX-associated tremor and ataxia syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par23">Overall, our results pointed to a critical role for Wdfy3 in maintaining mitochondrial health and bioenergetic properties.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par24"><italic>Wdfy3</italic> encodes a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding protein that functions as a master conductor of autophagy and aggrephagy (i.e., clearance of protein aggregates)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Through its role in autophagy or other yet undescribed properties, Wdfy3 exerts profound effects during embryonic development. These include the regulation of division and migration of neural progenitors, which depending on heterozygous or homozygous mutations, result in excess mitoses of radial glial cells and increased neurogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In regards to neurodevelopment, <italic>Wdfy3</italic> has emerged as a risk gene in ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, likely through its role in developmental neurogenesis and/or possibly through additional functions it may exert later in life. Incidentally, homozygous mutant mice die perinatally, but heterozygotes survive to adulthood. The link between Wdfy3 (as an extension for autophagy) and psychiatric disorders has received support by recent findings of brain-specific downregulation of beclin1 in schizophrenic individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, while indirect evidence was provided by studies showing that lithium, widely used of the treatment of bipolar disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, along with commonly used antidepressants, induce autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Parkin and Pink1, two proteins implicated in mitophagy, are associated with familial Parkinson’s disease, in which sustained dysregulation of neuronal mitochondrial quality control can lead to neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par25">Mitochondrial homeostasis is the result of a fine balance between biogenesis and clearance by autophagy, raising the possibility of a close association between autophagy dysfunction and accumulation of defective mitochondria. At early stages of life, such dysfunction may affect neurodevelopment or over time may lead to neurodegeneration, ensuing in associated psychiatric disorders. Consequently, we evaluated whether Wdfy3 was implicated in brain mitochondrial quality control through mitophagy. In the process, we confirmed that deficits in Wdfy3 are associated with a decline in Atg12-Atg5-Atg16l complex (as previously shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>) suggesting that <italic>Wdfy3</italic> haploinsufficiency alters the progression of Atg3/LC3I to Atg5/Atg12/Atg16L1/Wdfy3, likely preventing LC3I lipidation. This is supported by the constant levels of LC3I expression present in all tissues of both genotypes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>), the lack of genotype differences in the expression of LC3II, Atg7, Atg3, or Atg4b, but the lower levels of Atg16l1, GBRL2, and WIPI2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>). Our findings are in line with an autophagic role reported for Wdfy3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and another WDR-containing protein, WDR40-47<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, but expanding the role of Wdfy3 to include the selective clearance of defective mitochondria (mitophagy) and mitochondria trafficking.</p>
<p id="Par26">Decreased mitophagy and autophagy activity (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10</xref><bold>)</bold> along with the presence of MDV (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref><bold>)</bold>, as well as higher levels of Parkin and Lamp2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>), accompanied by a relatively modest decrease in overall OXPHOS capacity (~70% of WT; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8E</xref>) are consistent with the activation of micromitophagy as an apparent compensatory cellular response to partially clear some of the damaged mitochondria. In the presence of Wdfy3 haploinsufficiency, the accumulation of defective mitochondria indicates that diminished mitochondrial quality control could not be fully compensated for by the activation of micromitophagy. This can be interpreted as Wdfy3 being also required for micromitophagy, or alternatively, that micromitophagy, even at its full capacity, cannot abrogate all mitochondrial clearance deficits. The results obtained with primary cortical neurons are consistent with the ones obtained with NPCs, as partial (by ~50%; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>) or nearly total (by ~70%; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10</xref>) loss of Wdfy3 results in accumulation of damaged (depolarized) mitochondria with aberrant morphology and distribution.</p>
<p id="Par27">At the molecular level, deficits in bioenergetics entailed lower OXPHOS capacity and Complex IV (normalized by CS) at comparable levels in both cortex and cerebellum. Notably, Complex IV (CCO) is highly reliant on the mitochondrial inner membrane lipid composition as illustrated by biological models with defects in cardiolipin synthesis (ceramide synthase 2 KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> and Barth syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>). As autophagy is triggered under starving conditions to favor the recycling of proteins as well as lipids, a block in mitophagy or autophagy may challenge this process, compromising the lipid composition of cell membranes, including the inner mitochondrial membrane, and the stabilization of the respiratory chain super-complexes. This may explain both the lower overall OXPHOS capacity and CCO/CS ratio in cortex and cerebellum from haploinsufficient mice. Consistent with this premise, <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants for the <italic>Wdfy3</italic> homologous <italic>blue cheese</italic> gene (<italic>bchs</italic>) showed an imbalance in ceramide metabolism with altered autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The differences in severity of mitochondrial defects between cerebellum and cortex vs. hippocampus might be explained by the relatively shorter maturation period and slower neuronal migration and dispersion pattern reported for hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, in addition to the higher turnover of hippocampal cells due to adult neurogenesis. Whatever the causes for differential outcomes in mitochondrial bioenergetics may be, neuron-to-glia ratios appear not to be relevant in this context, as they differ widely between cortex (1:4 ratio) and cerebellum (4:1 ratio)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par28">In parallel with mitophagy, deficits in Wdfy3-affected mitochondrial dynamics (distribution and morphology) in murine brains; similarly, <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis in <italic>Wdfy3</italic>-silenced NPCs showed disrupted mitochondrial dynamics, with an accumulation of damaged mitochondria due to impaired clearance by LC3-dependent autophagy. When the proteomic data were analyzed against the KEGG database, pathways affected in Wdfy3 haploinsufficiency were shared with those related to neurodegenerative diseases (ALS, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, Prion diseases) as well as those involved in vesicular transport, and dopaminergic and GABAergic synapses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5E,F</xref>), pointing not only to decreased mitophagy, but also to defective intracellular transport (likely including mitochondria) and neuron development and/or organization. In addition, pathways inherent to OXPHOS, including fatty acid β-oxidation, were noted as down-regulated (Supplementary Dataset under “pathways” and “biological processes” tabs). Consistent with the notion that fatty acid β-oxidation is key in controlling the NSC-to-IPC transition in the mammalian embryonic brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, a lower abundance of proteins associated with neuron differentiation was observed in <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> mice (i.e., spectrins, voltage-dependent channels; Supplementary Dataset under “biological processes” tab). These findings are consistent with a recent report utilizing <italic>Wdfy3</italic> transgenic mice (gene trap and constitutive knockout) indicating a central role for Wdfy3 in the establishment of forebrain long-range connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This study aligns with our own observations that Wdfy3 is required for <italic>de novo</italic> generation of axons and axon guidance (as evidenced by the pathway analyses of our proteomic survey), as well as for the correct localization of glial guidepost cells as shown in the <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup><italic>disc</italic></sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par29">Defective mitochondrial quality control provides a link to synaptic plasticity, as proper synaptic function strongly depends on effective mitochondrial turnover to maintain local bioenergetic requirements. In support of this notion, several proteins involved in mitophagy (e.g., Parkin, Pink1, Optn, Sqstm1/p62, Tbk1, and Ndp52, among others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>) have been implicated in neurodegeneration. Furthermore, the majority of human cases reported to date carrying gain or loss of <italic>Wdfy3</italic> copy number variation (9 of 16) are affected by intellectual disability, global developmental delay and ASD (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>), while other cases carrying either <italic>de novo</italic> nonsense or frameshift alleles, shown under Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A</xref>, have also been associated with ASD and intellectual disability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The connection between Wdfy3 and behavior in our model of Wdfy3 haploinsufficiency is manifested as a significantly reduced rearing success of <italic>Wdfy3</italic><sup>+/<italic>lacZ</italic></sup> dams, likely the result of reduced attentiveness towards their pups. In support of this premise, pups raised by WT dams survived at greater rates irrespective of pup genotype. But beyond survival, it is important to highlight that maternal care modulates neurobiological systems that impact long-term cognitive, social, and emotional development of the offspring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Increased perinatal mortality was also reported in different <italic>Wdfy3</italic> mouse models, but was attributed to a selective maternal rejection of <italic>Wdfy3</italic> mutant pups due to deficits in their righting reflex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, while our haploinsufficient pups did not show any major developmental issues (none of 16 developmental milestones including righting reflex from PND2-PND14 reached statistical significance), the fostering experiments do not support this mechanism. Instead, Eph-ephrin signaling, one of the pathways identified as affected by Wdfy3 deficiency (Supplementary Dataset, under “Pathway analysis-reactome” tab), appears of particular interest. Our proteomic data showed a significant decrease in cortical EphA4 (log2 FC = −0.65; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>). EphA4 is implicated in the development of the corticospinal tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, axon guidance for specific subsets of motor neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>, neuroblast and glia organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> and cerebellar wiring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Its homozygous deletion results in impaired short-term habituation and novelty detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. To date, no data are available in the literature on the role of EphA4 on nurturing behavior; however, the loss of the paralog EphA5, which has comparable embryonic and adult expression in brain, showed, in agreement with our study, a decreased survival rate in pups that were born and reared by <italic>EphA5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> females compared to those born and reared by WT (55% vs. 80%) and the higher mortality was directly correlated to altered maternal rearing behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that adaptation to the nurturing response requires substantial neuronal circuit remodeling, which will likely increase energy demand as well as autophagic flux, a concept supported by the fact that defective autophagy impairs synaptic pruning and neuronal remodeling, both processes also reportedly affected in ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. In other models, the link between Wdfy3 and atypical behaviors, including ASD, has been previously reported as a loss of habituation (suppression of startle response to a repeated non-adverse stimulus) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> subjected to inducible Wdfy3 knockdown in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Notably, habituation is a prerequisite for higher cognitive functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, and altered habituation may substantially contribute to defective filtering, also identified as one of the features in ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par30">Overall, our findings support the concept that Wdfy3 is critical for the maintenance of mitochondria quality control by regulating their turnover through mitophagy, a process required for sustaining neuronal circuitries. Deficits in recycling of building blocks, a lower capacity to clear damaged, unfolded or no-longer required proteins, along with the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria all may affect synaptic pruning as well as remodeling of neural circuits. The occurrence of these processes may all set the stage for energy shortage and neurotransmission imbalances, especially critical at the projections where mitochondria are essential for synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter metabolism.</p>

Thirty-five µg of proteins were solubilized in SDS sample buffer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and loaded onto a 4–12% bis-tris gel (Life Technologies) as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. After transferring proteins with an iBlot apparatus (Life Technologies), membranes were blocked with LI-COR blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) for 1 h at 20 °C and subsequently probed overnight at 4 °C with the following antibodies: anti-Lamp2 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA; 1:1,000 dilution), anti-LC3 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO; 1:1,000 dilution), anti-Mfn2 (Proteintech, Rosemont, IL; 1:500 dilution), anti-MnSOD (Millipore, Billerica, MA; 1:1,000 dilution), anti Sqstm1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA; 1:500 dilution), anti-Park2 (Abcam; 1:500 dilution), and anti-Pink1 (Novus Biologicals; 1:1,000 dilution). As a loading control, we used anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, MO; 1:20,000 dilution, 1 h at 20 °C). Secondary antibodies were from LI-COR (Lincoln, NE; 1:10,000 dilution). Membranes were visualized with the use of the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR) and densitometry analysis carried out with ether the Carestream or ImageJ softwares.</p>

<title>Cell culture of neuronal progenitor cells (NPC)</title>
<p id="Par36">Murine striatal neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) were described in detail and characterized elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Cells were grown in high glucose DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg Streptomycin/ml and 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 33 °C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, never exceeding passage #10. For silencing experiments, siRNA-lipid complexes were formed using 1 ml Opti-MEM I Medium (Gibco) without serum, 43 μl of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 145 pmol scrambled siRNA or <italic>Wdfy3</italic> siRNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #AM4611 and AM16708, ID: 95113, respectively). Cells were then added to the siRNA-lipid complex at a concentration of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> in 9 ml of growth medium. After 48 h, cells were collected and viability (&gt;85%) checked by trypan blue staining (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with the use of a TC20 Automated Cell Counter (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Concentration and purity of RNA was measured at 260 nm and 280 nm on a Tecan Infinite M200 Nanoquant (Tecan, Austria). Subsequently, QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen) with provided RT Primer Mix was used for cDNA synthesis. Assessment of <italic>Wdfy3</italic> silencing efficiency was performed by qPCR using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. <italic>Wdfy3</italic> gene expression levels were assessed using forward 5′CTGAATGGGGCCAGATCCTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAGGAGAGCCTGCTTGAGTG-3′. For gene expression fold change analysis, the delta-delta Ct method was used. Gene expression levels were normalized to <italic>Gapdh</italic> expression used as a housekeeping gene.</p>

<title>Protocol and analyses of immunofluorescence by confocal microscopy</title>
<p id="Par37">Cells (either primary cortical neurons from mice or NPCs, 1 × 10<sup>5</sup>) were seeded on sterile cover slips and grown over night at 37 °C. After desired confluence was achieved, cells attached to coverslips were stained with 500 nM of MitoTracker Deep Red FM (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR, USA) diluted in growth media, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, and subsequently blocked/permeabilized for 30 min in 20% goat serum, 0.1% BSA, 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (GS-PBS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Evaluation of total mitochondrial mass and distribution was obtained in NPCs by staining with anti-ATP5B antibody (1:200 dilution in GS-PBS; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), overnight at 4 °C. For evaluation of LC3 or Wdfy3 levels, upon fixation and blocking/permeabilization of the cells, NPCs were probed with anti-LC3 antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and anti-Wdfy3 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), both at 1:100 dilution in GS-PBS overnight at 4 °C. The following day, cells were washed in PBS and probed with a goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 antibody (1:1.000 in 2% GS-PBS; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) for 1 h at 20 °C. NPCs were subsequently counterstained with 1 µg/ml 4′,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and mounted on glass slides with ProLong Gold anti-fading mounting media (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Fluorescent images were obtained using a Leica TCS SP8 <italic>STED 3</italic>X confocal microscope (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL) and analyzed with the Leica LAS X Core software. De-convolution was carried out with the use of the Huygens Professional software. Self-crossing in cortical neuronal projections was visualized with ImageJ and their frequencies counted manually. The projections were identified by using an algorithm within ImageJ to recognize soma vs. projections. For mitochondrial morphology quantification, images were further analyzed with two macro tools designed for ImageJ (Fiji)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup> to allow the quantification of mitochondrial mass, morphological features and network integrity.</p>

In brief, animals were anesthetized, and tissues mildly fixed by transcardial perfusion with 2% PFA in PBS. Brains were dissected, processed through 15% and 30% sucrose/PBS and cryoprotectively frozen in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek USA Inc., Torrance, CA). Subsequently, sections were cut at 40 μm, mounted on glass slides, stained, and counterstained with nuclear fast red (Sigma).
