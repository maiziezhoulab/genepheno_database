<abstract>
<p>Expansion of a CGG-repeat tract in the 5’-untranslated region of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene to &gt;200 repeats results in epigenetic silencing of the gene by a mechanism that is still unknown. <italic>FMR1</italic> gene silencing results in fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common heritable cause of intellectual disability. We have previously shown that reactivation of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene in FXS cells with 5-azadeoxycytidine (AZA) leads to the transient recruitment of EZH2, the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) component responsible for H3K27 trimethylation, and that this recruitment depends on the presence of the <italic>FMR1</italic> transcript. However, whether H3K27 trimethylation was essential for <italic>FMR1</italic> re-silencing was not known. We show here that EZH2 inhibitors increased <italic>FMR1</italic> expression and significantly delayed re-silencing of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene in AZA-treated FXS cells. This delay occurred despite the fact that EZH2 inhibition did not prevent the return of DNA methylation. Treatment with compound 1a, a small molecule that targets CGG-repeats in the <italic>FMR1</italic> mRNA, also resulted in sustained expression of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene in AZA-treated cells. This effect of 1a was also associated with a decrease in the levels of H3K27 trimethylation but not DNA methylation. Thus, our data show that EZH2 plays a critical role in the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene silencing process and that its inhibition can prolong expression of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene even in the presence of its transcript.</p>
