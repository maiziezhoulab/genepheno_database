<abstract>
<p>Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disease that leads to intellectual deficit, motor disability, epilepsy and increased risk of sudden death. Although in up to 95% of cases this disease is caused by <italic>de novo</italic> loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene, it is a multisystem disease associated also with mitochondrial metabolic imbalance. In addition, the presence of long QT intervals (LQT) on the patients’ electrocardiograms has been associated with the development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death. In the attempt to shed light on the mechanism underlying heart failure in RTT, we investigated the contribution of the carnitine cycle to the onset of mitochondrial dysfunction in the cardiac tissues of two subgroups of RTT mice, namely <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NQTc and <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice, that have a normal and an LQT interval, respectively. We found that carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 A/B and carnitine acylcarnitine translocase were significantly upregulated at mRNA and protein level in the heart of <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice. Moreover, the carnitine system was imbalanced in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice due to decreased carnitine acylcarnitine transferase expression. By causing accumulation of intramitochondrial acylcarnitines, this imbalance exacerbated incomplete fatty acid oxidation, which, in turn, could contribute to mitochondrial overload and sudden death.</p>

<body>
<p>Rett syndrome (RTT) (OMIM ID: 312750) is a severe X-linked dominant neurological disorder, mainly affecting young females, that is the second most common cause of intellectual disability in women after Down syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. In up to 95% of cases, this autism spectrum disorder is caused by <italic>de novo</italic> loss-of-function mutations in the gene mapped in human chromosome Xq28 that encodes the transcriptional regulator methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. RTT is characterized by early neurological regression (starting during the first 6–16 months of life). It severely affects motor, cognitive and communication skills, and often leads to deceleration of head growth, autistic features and stereotyped hand movements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The life expectancy of RTT patients is reduced and the mortality rate is 1.2% per annum; 26% of deaths are sudden and unexpected (mortality is 300-fold higher in RTT patients than in the general population)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Epilepsy, brainstem autonomic failure, and respiratory failure/apnea have been implicated in sudden death in RTT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Some RTT patients show prolonged QT intervals (LQT) on electrocardiograms, which is an electrophysiological condition that predisposes to the development of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. LQTs are present also in a subgroup of the murine model of RTT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p>
<p>The cause of LQT in RTT is unknown, although several studies suggested that it may be related to mitochondrial dysfunctions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. This concept is in line with the finding that mice with an <italic>Mecp2</italic> null allele develop a metabolic syndrome characterized by insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, and altered cholesterol metabolism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, all of which are signs of mitochondrial metabolic imbalance. Moreover, an excess of unprocessed fatty acids and an abnormal carnitine profile have been identified in the serum of children affected by RTT but not in controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, which suggests an interplay among mitochondrial function, energy metabolism and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). In this context, the therapeutic potential of carnitine or carnitine derivatives has been evaluated in RTT mouse models and in clinical trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In particular, treatment of RTT patients with acetyl-L-carnitine and L-carnitine improved sleep, energy level, communication, cardiac function, and neuronal morphology in the hippocampus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Acetyl-L-carnitine also improved a number of electrocardiographic parameters in RTT patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> thereby reducing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and mitigating the risk of sudden death. Given the low plasma level of L-carnitine in some RTT patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and in patients with other autism spectrum disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, carnitine deficiency has been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart dysfunction in RTT patients. However, Schaevitz <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. found no significant differences in plasma carnitine levels between control and RTT mice although they did find that carnitine treatment prevented metabolic abnormalities and improved cognitive function in <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null mice. These conflicting results are compatible with the concept that it is a perturbation of the carnitine system rather than a carnitine deficiency <italic>per se</italic> that is involved in the pathogenesis of heart failure in RTT patients.</p>
<p>Mitochondrial FAO is the major metabolic pathway for producing both ATP, NADH and NADPH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, and needs the carnitine system to import fatty acids into the mitochondria. The carnitine cycle requires L-carnitine and is composed of two acyltransferases, carnitine palmitoyltransferases 1 and 2 (CPT1 and CPT2), and carnitine acylcarnitine translocase (CACT), which is a mitochondrial carrier (aka SLC25A20)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. CPT1 catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction in the transesterification of acyl-CoA to acylcarnitine. CACT transports acylcarnitines across the inner mitochondrial membrane in exchange for a free carnitine molecule. CPT2 completes the cycle in the mitochondrial matrix by reconverting acylcarnitine into an acyl-CoA. Although involved mainly in mitochondrial acyl-CoA import, CPT2 and CACT can operate in the reverse direction in case of an increase in intramitochondrial acyl-CoA levels. Also carnitine acetylcarnitine transferase (CRAT), which is involved mainly in the formation of short-chain acylcarnitines, cooperates with CACT in decreasing the intramitochondrial acyl-CoA/CoA ratio<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. This mechanism facilitates the export of FAO intermediates as acylcarnitines from the mitochondria to the cytosol.</p>
<p>In the attempt to shed light on the mechanism underlying heart failure in RTT, we investigated the contribution of the carnitine cycle to the onset of mitochondrial dysfunction in RTT cardiac tissue using an <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model. Here we provide evidence that acylcarnitines and components of the carnitine system orchestrate the interplay between the metabolism of fatty acids in the cardiac mitochondria and heart failure in RTT patients. Indeed, the upregulation (in terms of expression and activity) of mitochondrial CPT1, CACT and CPT2 associated with downregulation of CRAT found in the LQT RTT subgroup of mice could impair metabolic flexibility, which is required for maintenance of normal cardiac function.</p>

<title>Grouping of RTT mice</title>
<p>An LQT in electrocardiograms, which reflects abnormal cardiac phenotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, is a frequent feature of RTT patients and in RTT mice models. In a preliminary study conducted to determine the age at which to perform metabolic analyses, we recorded surface ECGs from birth to 18 months in female RTT mice (B6.129P2(C)-Mecp2tm1.1Bird/J, designated <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup>), and found that, compared with WT mice, significantly more 7-month-old <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice had LQT intervals. This percentage increased to ~37% in 11-month-old mice. No ECG abnormalities were found in WT mice. Representative baseline ECGs are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>. We then grouped <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice on the basis of their QT interval, and euthanized them at 11 months of age. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NQTc mice exhibited QTc values between 380 and 410 ms (mean: 401 ms), while the corrected QT interval of <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice ranged between 460 and 550 ms (mean: 480 ms), which is significantly higher than that recorded in WT and <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NQTc mice (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>

<title>Analysis of the carnitine cycle</title>
<p>The heart’s continuous contractile activity is sustained primarily via β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Therefore, to determine if the mitochondrial dysfunction in heart tissue might involve the carnitine system, we investigated Cpt1a, Cpt1b, Cpt2, Cact and CrAT expression and functionality in the explanted heart of <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NQTc and <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and c, qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed significantly higher Cpt1a, Cpt1b and Cact levels in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NQTc and <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice versus WT, and the statistical significance was greater in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice. Surprisingly, the level of the Crat gene and protein was significantly lower in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc than in WT and <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NQTc mice. In addition, <italic>Cpt1a</italic> expression was lower than <italic>Cpt1b</italic> expression in the cardiac tissues of all mice examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), in agreement with the finding that CPT1B protein expression was higher than the isoform A in the post-neonatal heart of mice and humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p>
<p>The analysis of enzyme activity on mitochondrial enriched fractions isolated from heart tissues of <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NQTc and <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice confirmed an increase in CPT1 and CACT and a loss of function of CrAT activity compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In particular, CPT1 activity was 70% higher and CACT activity 41% higher in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NQTc mice than in WT mice. In <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice, CPT and CACT activities increased by 96% and 77%, respectively versus WT mice. Conversely, CrAT activity was significantly lower ( &gt; 70%) in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice than in either <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NQTc or WT mice (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 <italic>versus Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NQTc and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 <italic>versus</italic> WT).</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Acylcarnitine profile</title>
<p>To verify if perturbation of the carnitine system could result in accumulation of toxic lipid intermediates, we evaluated the acylcarnitine profile in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NQTc and <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc heart tissue extracts. We used tandem mass spectrometry to analyze free carnitine (C0) and 55 independent acylcarnitine species ranging in size from 2 to 24 carbons (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). This analysis provides a realistic snapshot of mitochondrial efficiency and is commonly used to detect metabolic dysfunctions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Acetylcarnitine (C2) and propionylcarnitine (C3) levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>) were significantly lower in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice than in WT animals (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, respectively), in accordance with the decrease observed in CrAT activity. In addition, several medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines were more abundant in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>–d).</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Acetyl-CoA content and PDH activity</title>
<p>Acetyl-CoA is a potent allosteric inhibitor of glycolysis and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in the regulation of the homeostatic mechanism that controls circulating concentrations of glucose and fatty acids (Randle cycle)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Given that CrAT lowers acetyl-CoA and regenerates free CoA, impairment of CrAT function can increase the mitochondrial acetyl-CoA level, which in turn induces glucose oxidation inhibition via PDH phosphorylation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, concentrations of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA were significantly higher in both <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NQTc and <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup>LQTc mice than in WT mice. Acetyl-CoA accumulation was more evident in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice than in either <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NQTc or WT mice (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, respectively).</p>
<p>To verify whether the increase in mitochondrial acetyl-CoA level inhibited PDH activity, we measured mitochondrial PDH activity in the presence and absence of carnitine. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, PDH activity was significantly higher (about 2-fold, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) in WT and <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NQTc mice treated with carnitine than in untreated mice, whereas PDH activity remained unchanged in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice. These results suggest that CrAT deficiency in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice could result in persistent PDH inhibition also in the presence of carnitine.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Substrate oxidation</title>
<p>Measurement of pyruvate and palmitate oxidation in mitochondria can reveal how pyruvate and fatty acids compete for energy production pathways in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> compared to WT mice. The measurement of pyruvate oxidation provides an index of tricarboxylic acid cycle function in response to different palmitoylcarnitine concentrations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, in the absence of long-chain fatty acids, pyruvate oxidation was similar in the three experimental groups, although pyruvate oxidation capacity was slightly reduced in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice at the highest pyruvate concentration used. Palmitoylcarnitine supplementation inhibited pyruvate oxidation in all groups, although this effect was significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) more pronounced in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice versus controls, whereas 5 μM and 20 μM palmitoylcarnitine produced the same effect in WT mice already in the presence of 0.5 mM pyruvate.</p>
<p>To evaluate metabolic inflexibility in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, we determined the dose-dependent pyruvate inhibition of fat oxidation as both complete (CO<sub>2</sub> production, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>) and incomplete (acid soluble metabolite [ASM] production; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>) palmitate oxidation. In the absence of pyruvate (basal condition), mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to CO<sub>2</sub> was lower, and incomplete oxidation to ASMs was higher in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NQTc and <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice than in WT mice. In detail, <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice exhibited a significant decline in complete palmitate oxidation to CO<sub>2</sub> (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 versus WT) and a significant increase in incomplete oxidation to ASMs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 versus WT), which indicates a remarkable imbalance in the ratio of incomplete to complete fat oxidation. In addition, in WT and <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NQTc mice, 5 mM pyruvate induced a decrease in palmitate oxidation to CO<sub>2</sub>, which is a sign of correct substrate switching, whereas the pyruvate-mediated inhibition of fat oxidation was abolished in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice. Taken together these results indicate that <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice were unable to switch their metabolism correctly according to substrate availability, thereby leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and imbalance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction is related to perturbation of the carnitine cycle in the heart muscle of a mouse model of RTT. The link between mutations in the <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene and mitochondrial dysfunction is unclear, although such clinical signs as hypotonia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> and myocardial dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> correlate with mitochondrial dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. In addition to ultrastructural alterations of mitochondria (i.e., vacuolization, granular inclusions and membranous changes)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, a decrease in NADH cytochrome c reductase, succinate cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> has been reported in muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and brain biopsies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> of RTT patients and of the RTT mouse model. Recently, an association has been suggested between FAO deficiencies and developmental brain disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, to which RTT belongs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. The altered circulating levels of carnitine and/or acyl-carnitine (i.e., phenotypes suggestive of deficiencies in the long-chain FAO) present in RTT children would support this hypothesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. As a consequence of these mitochondrial alterations, mitochondrial energy production would be less efficient and lead to reduced ATP levels, as detected in a magnetic resonance study on <italic>Mecp2</italic>-deficient mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Although these data are indicative of widespread mitochondrial dysfunction, the cause of defective mitochondria is unclear, and it remains to be determined whether and how alterations in the mitochondrial metabolic pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders and cause functional impairment of organs, as in the case of cardiac dysfunction observed in both RTT patients and animal models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.</p>
<p>We evaluated carnitine-dependent mitochondrial metabolic pathways in two subgroups of 11-month-old RTT mice: <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NQTc mice that have a normal QT interval, and <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice that have an LQT interval. We carried out these experiments on explanted hearts to evaluate whether alterations of the carnitine profile and the carnitine cycle were present at tissue level in either of these two conditions. In addition, the two groups of mice did not differ in terms of body weight, insulin resistance or O<sub>2</sub> consumption/CO<sub>2</sub> expiration (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>). Again, the cardiac ATP level practically overlapped in the two groups of animals, which suggests that alteration of the carnitine cycle has a relevance that goes beyond the energetic aspect (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>).</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate significantly upregulated expression of CPT1A/B and CACT at mRNA and protein level in the heart of <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice. Interestingly, the increase in these proteins has been linked to high rates of incomplete fat oxidation and intracardiac accumulation of fatty acylcarnitines, which are byproducts of lipid catabolism, in both groups of <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice. The high level of myocardial acylcarnitines induced by increased CPT1 activity might indicate that the rate of fatty acid catabolism exceeds the flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In this case, the accumulating intramitochondrial acyl-CoA intermediates are converted back to acylcarnitines, which can then exit the organelle and tissue via CACT. Indeed, in addition to its role in fatty acid oxidation, carnitine enables mitochondrial export of excess carbon fuel, thereby buffering intramitochondrial imbalances between the acyl-CoA load and Krebs cycle activity. Here we show that the protein level and activity of CrAT were significantly reduced only in the <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice. CrAT resides in the mitochondrial matrix and converts acetyl-CoA, which derives from fatty acid, glucose and amino acid catabolism, to membrane permeant acetylcarnitine. Thus, CrAT facilitates the trafficking and efflux of short-chain acyl-CoA intermediates from the mitochondrial compartment to other cellular and extracellular sites.</p>
<p>It is now recognized that the carnitine cycle and CrAT play important roles in regulating metabolic flexibility and mitochondrial substrate switching in mouse skeletal muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Moreover, several findings indicate an interplay between CrAT and PDH. First, acetyl-CoA antagonizes PDH activity by directly and indirectly inhibiting the enzyme complex, while carnitine treatment, which increases tissue acetylcarnitine efflux, stimulates the PDH complex in human muscle mitochondria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Second, muscle-specific deletion of CrAT in mice and human myocytes decreases glucose tolerance and metabolic flexibility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Third, insulin resistance and lipid stress inhibit PDH and CrAT in muscle mitochondria thereby increasing susceptibility to mitochondrial dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Our finding that inhibition of pyruvate oxidation by palmitoylcarnitine was significantly more pronounced in heart mitochondria from the <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc group reinforces the role played by CrAT in myocardium metabolism. Moreover, the difference between genotypes was amplified by the addition of pyruvate, which inhibited palmitate oxidation more robustly in the <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc group. In aggregate, our findings established that CrAT deficiency resulted in abnormal fuel selection and a corresponding decline in metabolic flexibility.</p>
<p>Cardiac metabolism is primarily aerobic, with 60 to 90% of heart ATP produced via mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain fatty acids whereas the remaining 10% to 40% derives from oxidation of glucose and lactate, and from small amounts of ketone bodies and certain amino acids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. The adult heart can switch energy sources according to metabolic demand, oxygen, and substrate availability, as in the Randle cycle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. The switch towards glucose metabolism improves myocardial contractile efficiency by increasing the stoichiometric ratio of ATP production to oxygen consumption, besides minimizing oxidative losses through mitochondrial respiratory chain uncoupling associated with free fatty acid metabolism. Thus, the failure to maintain the metabolic flexibility of the heart is closely related to cardiovascular disease and heart failure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Remodeling of cardiac metabolism in RTT mice, characterized by abnormally high myocardial dependence on fatty acid metabolism, has been reported in animal and human studies of metabolic syndrome, insulin-resistance or high adrenergic states; the derangements most often-cited being enhanced fatty acid oxidation and impaired glucose utilization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. A loss of <italic>Mecp2</italic> contributes to metabolic syndrome by increasing insulin secretion and decreasing insulin signaling – a process that leads to a complete dissociation between insulin levels and the appropriate metabolic effects of insulin on glucose regulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>.</p>
<p>It remains to be clarified why CrAT expression decreases with aging in RTT patients and whether or not this decrease is associated with the <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutation. In this context, carnitine supplementation to RTT mice might mitigate this mitochondrial stress by shunting surplus acetyl-CoA towards the CrAT reaction. Indeed, although the release of acetylcarnitine from the heart is a valve for acetyl production, the flow through this valve is limited by the cardiac pool of carnitine. It is noteworthy, however, that in case of CrAT deficiency, carnitine supplementation might not exert therapeutic effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we demonstrate that the carnitine cycle plays a central role in shuttling carbon fuels between cell compartments associated with <italic>de facto</italic> regulation of mitochondrial and intracellular trafficking of acetyl- and other reactive acyl-CoA moieties. Indeed, the imbalanced carnitine system in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> LQTc mice exacerbates incomplete FAO, which accumulates intra-mitochondrial acylcarnitines that could contribute to mitochondrial overload. In conclusion, our data suggest that the simultaneous presence of a long QT interval and the onset of metabolic inflexibility may be the cause of sudden death in RTT.</p>
