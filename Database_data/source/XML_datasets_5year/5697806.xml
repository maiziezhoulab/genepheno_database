<abstract>
<p>Myelin abnormalities are increasingly being recognized as an important component of a number of neurologic developmental disorders. The integration of many signaling pathways and cell types are critical for correct myelinogenesis. The PI3-K and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways have been found to play key roles. mTOR is found within two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 activity has been shown to play a major role during myelination, while the role of mTORC2 is not yet well understood. To determine the role of mTORC2 signaling in myelinogenesis, we generated a mouse lacking the critical mTORC2 component <italic>Rictor</italic> in oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs). Targeted deletion of <italic>Rictor</italic> in these cells decreases and delays the expression of myelin related proteins and reduces the size of cerebral white matter tracts. This is developmentally manifest as a transient reduction in myelinated axon density and g-ratio. OPC cell number is reduced at birth without detectable change in proliferation with proportional reductions in mature oligodendrocyte number at P15. The total number of oligodendrocytes as well as extent of myelination, does improve over time. Adult conditional knock-out (CKO) animals do not demonstrate a behavioral phenotype likely due in part to preserved axonal conduction velocities. These data support and extend prior studies demonstrating an important but transient contribution of mTORC2 signaling to myelin development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Myelin abnormalities are implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodevelopmental disorders including Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref001">1</xref>], autism spectrum disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref002">2</xref>] and Angelman syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref003">3</xref>]. Elucidation of signaling pathways and cell types responsible for normal myelin development is critical to understanding disease mechanisms and developing better treatments for these disorders.</p>
<p>Translational studies involving multiple sclerosis (MS), a neurological disorder associated with myelin inflammation, have extended our knowledge of myelin formation and tissue response to injury. While the <italic>in vivo</italic> signals for oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation are not precisely defined, important proteins include neuregulin, IGF-1, and Laminin-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref004">4</xref>]. While contributions of other pathways are less clear, a role for PI3-K/Akt signaling has recently become more evident. The nature of this role remains unclear, however, with conflicting reports involving downstream components of the signaling pathway. Multiple studies indicate that Akt phosphorylation and subsequent mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation promote myelin formation and increase myelin thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref006">6</xref>] with loss of Akt/mTORC1 activity being associated with decreased myelination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref007">7</xref>]. In contrast, Lebrun-Julien et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref008">8</xref>] and our group[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref009">9</xref>] demonstrated an opposite requirement for mTORC1 with decreased myelination due to mTORC1 hyperactivity following loss of <italic>Tsc1</italic> in the spinal cord or <italic>Tsc2</italic> in the brain and spinal cord.</p>
<p>There is growing interest in defining the contribution of the mTORC2 complex in the central nervous system and in myelination. The mTORC2 complex is differentiated from the mTORC1 complex by inclusion of the Rictor (rapamycin insensitive companion of mTOR) protein. The biologic role of mTORC2 is still being defined with the initial studies suggesting a role in cytoskeletal support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref010">10</xref>]. mTORC2 functions as a serine/threonine kinase with targets that include SGK1, PKCα and Akt. Full activation of Akt requires phosphorylation by both PDK1 at threonine-308 and by mTORC2 at serine-473. A role for Rictor in the central nervous system was first described in 2010, with <italic>Rictor</italic> ablation in neurons demonstrating decreased cortical Akt phosphorylation, deficits in sensorimotor gating and reduced prefrontal dopamine content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref011">11</xref>]. A role for mTORC2 in oligodendrocytes is supported by data demonstrating a mild hypomyelination following inactivation of either <italic>Rictor</italic> or <italic>mTOR</italic> in oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref013">13</xref>]. This is in contrast to deletion of <italic>Raptor</italic> (regulatory associated protein of mTOR), a critical component of the mTORC1 complex, which results in a much more severe reduction in myelin related proteins.</p>
<p>In TSC patients and in TSC animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref014">14</xref>], mTORC1 activity is increased due to disruption of the hamartin/tuberin heterodimer, which typically represses mTORC1 activation. Feedback inhibition due to excessive mTORC1 activity leads to phosphorylation of Rictor and reduced mTORC2 activity. We hypothesized that reduced mTORC2 activity contributes to behavioral abnormalities in TSC. Utilizing a mouse model with conditional inactivation of <italic>Rictor</italic> in neural progenitor cells (including oligodendrocyte precursors), we demonstrated that decreased mTORC2 activity alone contributes to TSC relevant phenotypes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref015">15</xref>]. In addition to seizures and behavioral abnormalities following deletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic> or <italic>Rictor</italic> from neuroprogenitor cells, respectively, cortical hypomyelination was observed[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref014">14</xref>]. Based on these findings, we sought to determine the relative contribution of mTORC2 signaling to oligodendrocyte development and function following the deletion of <italic>Rictor</italic> in oligodendrocyte precursor cells.</p>
<p>In this manuscript, we describe a conditional knockout (CKO) of <italic>Rictor</italic> using an <italic>Olig2-Cre</italic> driver to investigate the role of mTORC2 signaling in oligodendrocyte precursors. Our findings in <italic>Rictor</italic> deficient OPCs recapitulate and extend those seen from targeting mature oligodendrocytes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref013">13</xref>]. We demonstrate cortical and subcortical hypomyelination, with eventual normalization to levels seen in wild type littermates. Despite the clear hypomyelination phenotype, loss of <italic>Rictor</italic> from OPCs did not significantly alter locomotor activity or demonstrate changes in anxiety related behaviors, consistent with the preserved conduction velocity across the corpus callosum. These findings suggest a modest requirement for mTORC2 signaling during myelination by oligodendrocytes.</p>

<p>Mice were housed within Vanderbilt’s animal housing facilities under normal environmental conditions with a standard 12-hour light-dark cycle and unrestricted access to water and food. Mice were monitored daily and their physical appearances observed for any adverse effects (i.e. weight loss, hunched posture, scruffy appearance). Weekly weights were taken to ensure maintenance of normal food and water intake. No adverse effects pertaining to the loss of the Rictor protein from oligodendrocytes were noted and animals maintained normal physical appearance, fertility and lifespan until they were retired from breeding and/or euthanized following CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation or anesthesia for tissue harvesting, methods in accordance with AVMA guidelines.

<p>Brain tissues were dissected from <italic>Rictor</italic> CKO and littermate controls as previously described[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref017">17</xref>]. Briefly, animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and perfused (P5 and older) with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS (pH 7.4). Brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose prior to sectioning. For immunofluorescence studies, sections were blocked with 5% goat serum and 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4°C. APC and Ki67 detection required antigen retrieval, performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref012">12</xref>]. Ki67 antigen retrieval consisted of a 1 hour incubation in 10 mM pH 6 citrate buffer, which had been heated to boiling. For APC expression, modified superblock (10% BSA, 10% FBS and 0.5% Triton X-100) was used with no additional permeabilization step. After washing with PBS, sections were probed with species appropriate secondary antibodies (anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-rat Alexa 488, 555, 647 fluorochromes, Invitrogen, Watham, MA, USA) for one hour at room temperature. Photomicrographs were obtained with an AMG Evos epifluorescence microscope (ThermoFisher, Watham, MA, USA). Image analysis was performed with ImageJ (version 1.47, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MA, USA) and Adobe Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA). For APC cell counts, a defined area of the corpus callosum was identified and all APC positive cells within that specified region were counted.

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>For brain slice preparation, postnatal day (P) 32–42 mice were decapitated under anesthesia with isoflurane and brains were quickly removed and placed in ice-cold cutting solution containing sucrose (200 mM), KCl (1.9 mM), Na2HPO4 (1.2 mM), MgCl2 (6 mM), CaCl2 (0.5 mM), glucose (10 mM), and NaHCO3 (25 mM). Coronal slices (400 μm) containing the corpus callosum were obtained using a Leica VT1200S vibratome. Slices were immediately transferred to holding chambers containing warmed (30°C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing NaCl (125 mM), KCl (2.5 mM), Na2HPO4 (1.25 mM), MgCl2 (1.3 mM), CaCl2 (2.0 mM), glucose (10 mM) and NaHCO3 (25 mM). Following 30 minutes of recovery, slices were maintained at room temperature for a minimum of 1 hour before being transferred to a recording chamber. The recording chamber was perfused with oxygenated ACSF at a rate of 2.0 mL/min. Experiments were conducted at 25°C and temperature was controlled by in-line and bath heaters (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Field recordings were performed using an Axon MultiClamp 700B amplifier, filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz using a Digidata 1440A analog to digital converter (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). The corpus callosum was identified using a Nikon Eclipse FN1 microscope equipped with infrared-differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) imaging. To measure field potentials, glass recording microelectrodes (3 to 5 MΩ) were placed at varying distances from the stimulating electrode as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref022">22</xref>].

<p>Decreased mTORC2 activity secondary to loss of <italic>Rictor</italic> from oligodendrocytes has been reported to decrease expression of myelin related proteins in a mouse model targeting mature oligodendrocytes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref013">13</xref>]. To determine if loss of mTORC2 activity from oligodendrocyte precursor cells decreases cortical myelination, cortical lysates from <italic>Rictor</italic> CKO mice were analyzed with immunoblotting and demonstrated a marked reduction of in the expression of myelin related proteins MBP, CNPase, and MAG, with the most pronounced abnormalities between P15 and P30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188417.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The degree of hypomyelination decreased over time and by P137, both MAG and CNPase levels had normalized though MBP remained slightly, but significantly reduced. These findings are consistent with those of Bercury et al.(13), and support a role for Rictor/mTORC2 during cortical myelination.</p>

High resolution T<sub>1</sub>-weighted imaging demonstrated clear reductions in size of myelinated tracts.

An increase in myelinated axon density can be appreciated with age in both control and CKO animals. The g-ratio, the ratio of axon diameter to myelinated axon diameter is unchanged between control and the <italic>Rictor CKO</italic> at P20, though is significantly increased at P30 in the CKO. By P60, the g-ratio is again the same as the control. This closely parallels the changes in axon diameter over time, with bias towards myelination of larger diameter axons preferentially in the CKO vs. the control. The density of myelinated axons as well as the myelin fraction both increase over time, though both are significantly reduced in the CKO at P30 vs. the controls. In total, these data support a delay in myelination due not to a change in the amount of myelin per axon, but due to a temporal reduction in the density of myelinated axons.</p>

<p>Open field activity was recorded for 50 minutes in a sound-proofed chamber. Total distance, average velocity and thigmotaxis, the percent of time in which the animal stayed near the walls of the chamber, were recorded. To characterize anxiety phenotypes, the elevated zero-maze was utilized with distance traveled in the open regions, time in the open regions and duration of visits to the open regions determined. The buried marble assay characterized compulsive digging as measured by the total number of marbles buried.

<p>Thin or dysfunctional myelin has the potential to cause functional defects due to reduced axonal conductive properties and impaired communication between the cerebral hemispheres, potentially manifesting in autism relevant behaviors. To evaluate anxiety and obsessive-compulsive-like phenotypes, the elevated zero maze and buried marble tests were utilized, respectively. There were no differences observed in distance traveled, time spent in the open arm, or number of entries into the open arms of the zero maze (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188417.t001">Table 1</xref>). No significant changes were seen in the number of marbles buried. Lastly, to assess if coordination difficulties could contribute to the lack of an observed behavioral phenotype, Rota rod testing was performed with no differences between genotypes observed.</p>
<p>Finally, to assess spatial learning and memory, mice were trained for 3 days on the Barnes maze and on day 4, latency to finding an escape route, distance travelled and velocity were measured. No significant differences were seen in latency to enter the target zone, distance traveled, or velocity within the maze. Thus, in contrast to <italic>Rictor</italic> loss from neuroprogenitors which resulted in marked hyperactivity and a reduced anxiety phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref015">15</xref>], the loss of Rictor from OPCs did not result in an observable behavioral phenotype.</p>
<p>The absence of a clear behavioral phenotype was unexpected, but could be explained if the degree of hypomyelination was not sufficient to alter neuronal function. To address this hypothesis, we measured axonal conduction velocity across the corpus callosum. An N1 signal, representing conduction across myelinated axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188417.g006">Fig 6</xref>), was readily obtained in live brain slices from control and CKO mice. The conduction velocity was essentially identical in both the control and CKO groups.</p>

<p>During development, Olig2 is involved in the specification of a variety of cell types, including interneurons[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref025">25</xref>]. As interneurons are known to play a role in oligodendrocyte development and migration, we sought to determine the relative contribution of <italic>Rictor</italic> loss in interneurons to the observed hypomyelination phenotype. Cortical parvalbumin and GAD67 positive interneurons were counted at P15, a time at which both expression of myelin proteins and oligodendrocyte number was markedly reduced in the <italic>Olig2-Rictor</italic> CKO. Unlike OPC and oligodendrocyte numbers, interneuron number was not significantly altered in the CKO cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188417.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Additionally, we analyzed myelin protein expression in <italic>Nkx2</italic>.<italic>1-Rictor CKO mice</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref026">26</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>During the past decade, a myriad of signaling pathways have been found to converge on the mTOR kinase. While mTORC1 signaling in the CNS has been well characterized, the role of Rictor and the mTORC2 complex has received much less scrutiny. As mTORC2 signaling is reduced in animal models of TSC, likely due to feedback inhibition, we hypothesized that loss of mTORC2 activity contributes to the disease phenotypes seen in TSC. We previously demonstrated marked behavioral alterations and hypomyelination resulting from loss of <italic>Rictor</italic> in neuroprogenitor cells, including a subset of OPCs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref015">15</xref>]. Utilizing a mouse model that results in loss of <italic>Rictor</italic> in oligodendrocyte precursor cells, we now demonstrate that loss of <italic>Rictor</italic> in OPCs is sufficient to cause a developmental hypomyelination.</p>
<p>Our data demonstrate a mild hypomyelination phenotype following loss of <italic>Rictor</italic> in oligodendrocyte precursor cells, consistent with the findings of Bercury et al. who targeted mature oligodendrocytes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref013">13</xref>]. Ultrastructural analysis of myelination over time demonstrated a significantly reduced g-ratio, myelinated axon density, and myelin fraction at P30 in the CKO which was nearly normalized by P60. These data suggest that the overall decrease in myelin content represents a decrease in the number of myelinated axons versus a dramatic decrease in the amount of myelin per axon. The increase in g-ratio at P30 is likely due to preferential myelination of larger caliber axons in the CKO.</p>
<p>To determine the etiology for this reduction in myelin content, we counted both OPCs and oligodendrocytes, noting a significant reduction in numbers of both OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes from white matter tracts. The relative degree of hypomyelination did improve over time, commensurate with a trend towards an increased density of mature oligodendrocytes. While the overall expression levels of proteins are similar between our study and that reported by Bercury et al., subtle differences may be related to technique (we included CC with cortex), selection of Cre driver and time points studied. One clear difference is that Olig2 is expressed very early in oligodendrocyte development whereas CNPase is expressed at a later developmental stage. The proportional reduction of PDGFRα positive OPCs seen at P0 and P5 with APC positive oligodendrocytes at P15 is consistent with the observation of Bercury et al. that oligodendrocyte maturation is not affected by loss of <italic>Rictor</italic>. Additionally, as post-natal proliferation was not different in the CKO, this suggests an embryonic role for <italic>Rictor</italic> in OPC generation, though whether the embryonic proliferation rate is reduced is not clear. The improvement in myelination over time may be due in part to population of the cortex by cortically derived OPCs which were not specified by <italic>Olig2-Cre</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>As <italic>Olig2</italic> plays a role in specification of a variety of cell types during normal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref028">28</xref>], altered embryonic specification may both decrease OPC numbers and alter expression of other cell types, including interneurons. Given the possibility that targeting of interneurons may potentially confound our findings, we determined that interneuron number, unlike OPC number, is not significantly reduced in the <italic>Olig2-Cre Rictor</italic> CKO. Further, we determined that expression of myelin proteins is not significantly altered upon preferential targeting of <italic>Rictor</italic> in interneurons using <italic>Nkx2</italic>.<italic>1-Cre</italic>. These data suggest that the observed myelination changes in <italic>Olig2-Rictor</italic> CKO mice are not due to non-cell autonomous effects of <italic>Rictor</italic> inactivation in interneurons.</p>
<p>Abnormalities in myelination are increasingly being associated with neurodevelopmental diseases, including cryptogenic autism and autism related to TSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref029">29</xref>]. We hypothesized that the altered myelination following loss of <italic>Rictor</italic> may contribute to neurobehavioral sequelae. Loss of Rictor from neurons has been shown to alter prepulse inhibition and the dopamine to norepinephrine ratio[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref011">11</xref>]. We previously reported hyperactivity and reduced anxiety in the <italic>Emx1-Rictor CKO</italic> mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref015">15</xref>] in which neural progenitor cells (including oligodendrocyte and astrocyte precursors), were targeted. In contrast, the adult <italic>Olig2-Rictor</italic> CKO, did not demonstrate differences in activity, spatial memory, or anxiety phenotypes from the control animals. These findings are not unexpected in context of the mild hypomyelination and unaltered conduction velocity. The extent of dysmyelination by P60 was not sufficient to alter the myelin’s resistive properties, thus preserving conduction velocity down the axon. Additionally, as conduction velocity also depends on axonal radius to the fourth power, the slight increase in axon diameter seen in the genu and splenium of the CKO[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref018">18</xref>] may represent a compensatory mechanism which maintains normal velocity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>As noted above, the underlying mechanism for the reduction in OPC number is not entirely clear and may be due in part to decreased progenitor proliferation or decreased OPC specification during embryogenesis. As we also reported decreased oligodendrocyte number after loss of <italic>Tsc2</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref009">9</xref>], we hypothesize that decreased Akt activity and an mTORC1 independent process is contributing to the decrease in oligodendrocyte number. Bcl-2 associated death promoter (BAD) and GSK3β are both negatively regulated by Akt, thus decreased Akt activity may lead to increased apoptosis or reduced cell proliferation, respectively, and subsequent reductions in OPC numbers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Our findings reinforce and expand on published data demonstrating a contributing role for mTORC2 activity in myelination[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref013">13</xref>]. In contrast to severe and sustained hypomyelination caused by attenuated mTORC1 activity, the role of mTORC2 activity in myelination is significant, but minor compared to mTORC1. We postulated that decreased mTORC2 activity may significantly contribute to the hypomyelination observed following loss of <italic>Tsc2</italic>, though the stark differences in the magnitude of the hypomyelination between the <italic>Olig2-Rictor</italic> and <italic>Olig2-Tsc2</italic> models suggests that mTORC1 over activation is the major contributor to hypomyelination in the <italic>Olig2-Tsc2</italic> model. Lastly, the absence of a behavioral phenotype in <italic>Olig2-Rictor</italic> CKO mice and the marked phenotypes in the neuroprogenitor <italic>Emx1-Rictor</italic> CKO and the neuronal <italic>Nestin-Rictor</italic> CKO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0188417.ref011">11</xref>] suggest a pervasive role for mTORC2 activity in neuronal function versus a transient role in oligodendrocyte development.</p>
