<abstract>
<p>The contribution of MEF2 TFs to the tumorigenic process is still mysterious. Here we clarify that MEF2 can support both pro-oncogenic or tumor suppressive activities depending on the interaction with co-activators or co-repressors partners. Through these interactions MEF2 supervise histone modifications associated with gene activation/repression, such as H3K4 methylation and H3K27 acetylation. Critical switches for the generation of a MEF2 repressive environment are class IIa HDACs. In leiomyosarcomas (LMS), this two-faced trait of MEF2 is relevant for tumor aggressiveness. Class IIa HDACs are overexpressed in 22% of LMS, where high levels of MEF2, HDAC4 and HDAC9 inversely correlate with overall survival. The knock out of HDAC9 suppresses the transformed phenotype of LMS cells, by restoring the transcriptional proficiency of some MEF2-target loci. HDAC9 coordinates also the demethylation of H3K4me3 at the promoters of MEF2-target genes. Moreover, we show that class IIa HDACs do not bind all the regulative elements bound by MEF2. Hence, in a cell MEF2-target genes actively transcribed and strongly repressed can coexist. However, these repressed MEF2-targets are poised in terms of chromatin signature. Overall our results candidate class IIa HDACs and HDAC9 in particular, as druggable targets for a therapeutic intervention in LMS.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The tumorigenic process is characterized by profound alterations of the transcriptional landscape, aimed to sustain uncontrolled cell growth, resistance to apoptosis and metastasis. The contribution of MEF2, a pleiotropic family of transcription factors, to these changes is controversial, since both pro-oncogenic and tumor-suppressive activities have been reported. To clarify this paradox, we studied the role of MEF2 in an aggressive type of soft-tissue sarcomas, the leiomyosarcomas (LMS). We found that in LMS cells MEF2 become oncogenes when in complex with class IIa HDACs. We have identified different sub-classes of MEF2-target genes and observed that HDAC9 converts MEF2 into transcriptional repressors on some, but not all, MEF2-regulated loci. This conversion correlates with the acquisition by MEF2 of oncogenic properties. We have also elucidated some epigenetic re-arrangements supervised by MEF2. In summary, our studies suggest that the paradoxical actions of MEF2 in cancer can be explained by their dual role as activators/repressors of transcription and open new possibilities for therapeutic interventions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>MEF2 is a family of transcriptional regulators involved in the control of pleiotropic responses during development and adult life. In vertebrates four members, MEF2A/B/C/D, compose the family. MEF2 are characterized by the presence of a highly conserved N-terminal MADS/MEF2 domain involved in dimerization and DNA-binding, followed by the less conserved C-terminal transactivation region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref001">1</xref>]. Although some actions of MEF2 are redundant, functional studies have also credited specific activities to each member of the family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The transcriptional programs under MEF2 supervision diverge in different cell types. MEF2-targets include genes involved in various differentiation activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref009">9</xref>]. Some of these targets must be switched off, if they are not part of the ongoing differentiation program, even though a transcriptionally active MEF2 is present in the same cell. Dominant epigenetic regulations and/or the existence of multiple MEF2 transcriptional partners contribute to orchestrate the context-dependent MEF2 transcriptional landscape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref008">8</xref>]. The four family members and their splicing variants can provide further layers of complexity to the MEF2 transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref013">13</xref>]. Furthermore, MEF2 can be converted into transcriptional repressors after the binding to Cabin1, G9a or class IIa HDACs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref016">16</xref>]. Among these transcriptional co-repressors, class IIa HDACs (HDAC4/5/7/9) play a pivotal role and their activity is subjected to tight cellular and environmental controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Dysfunctions in MEF2 characterize several pathological conditions, including cognitive disorders, cardiac hypertrophy and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref021">21</xref>]. Specifically, pro-oncogenic roles of MEF2 have been reported for certain hematological malignancies and hepatocarcinomas, which are linked to the increased expression, mutations or genetic rearrangements of these TFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref027">27</xref>]. By contrast, actions as tumor suppressors have been described in the case of soft-tissue sarcomas or in the case of mutations, mostly of MEF2B, in non-Hodgking lymphomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>The antagonistic roles of MEF2 in oncogenesis, suggested by these studies, cannot be completely explained by the context-dependent regulation of their target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref032">32</xref>]. In this scenario, the ability of MEF2 to act either as transcriptional activators or as repressors on varying the environmental and genetic backgrounds has been so far underestimated. Hence, we decided to address this point by dissecting the contribution of MEF2 to the tumorigenic process using the leiomyosarcomas (LMS) as a model. LMS are rare soft tissue sarcomas showing certain degrees of smooth muscle differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref034">34</xref>]. In this manuscript we have explored the transcriptional landscape and the epigenetic modifications under the control of these TFs in relation to the tumorigenic process.</p>

<title>The MEF2-HDAC axis in leiomyosarcomas</title>
<p>We have previously observed that among STS, LMS evidenced the highest repression of a MEF2 signature, identified in HDAC4-transformed mouse fibroblasts and described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s001">S1 Table</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref028">28</xref>]. Hence, we used the LMS as a model to better explore the role of MEF2 on tumor aggressiveness. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g001">Fig 1A</xref> confirms that the MEF2-signature was significantly repressed in uterine LMS compared to benign leiomyomas and normal tissues. This repression could be mediated by the activation of the PI3K/AKT/SKP2 pathway, which triggers the degradation of MEF2 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref035">35</xref>]. Alternatively, it might depend on the engagement of MEF2 transcriptional repressors. In LMS, among the different MEF2-repressors, only HDAC4 and HDAC9 mRNA levels negatively correlate with the expression of MEF2-targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). We validated these data by IHC analysis, scoring HDAC4, MEF2C and SKP2 levels in a Tissue-MicroArray (TMA) of 57 LMS. HDAC4 levels were increased in tumors featuring higher proliferative activity (Ki67 positivity and high mitotic index M.I.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s002">S2 Table</xref>). Moreover, a negative correlation between SKP2 and MEF2C was significant only in samples characterized by low (&lt;20) M.I. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s002">S2 Table</xref>). This observation suggests that SKP2-dependent degradation of MEF2C occurs preferentially in low proliferating tumors. Interestingly, in LMS showing the highest expression of MEF2, the Kaplan-Meier analysis indicates that high levels of class IIa HDACs are associated with reduced patients’ survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g001">Fig 1H</xref>).</p>

The latter are characterized by a significant (Kruskal-Wallis p&lt;0.1) repression of MEF2 targets. B-C) The mRNA expression levels of the MEF2 targets in malignant leiomyosarcoma (GSE21124) were clustered in two sub-groups according to the expression levels of well-known MEF2 repressors (<italic>HDAC4</italic>, <italic>HDAC5</italic>, <italic>HDAC7</italic>, <italic>HDAC9</italic>, <italic>CABIN1</italic>). Only in the case of HDAC4 and HDAC9 a higher expression is significantly correlated to a decrease in the expression of MEF2 targets, as depicted in the Turkey box-plots. Mann-Whitney p&lt; 0.05. D) Top pictures representing a case of uterine LMS with low Ki67 and weak and focal HDAC4 cytoplasmic expression; bottom pictures representing a case of uterine LMS with high Ki67 and diffuse cytoplasmic expression of HDAC4. E) IHC analysis of HDAC4 protein levels in LMS samples, clustered into two groups according to Ki67 positivity (1<sup>st</sup> quartile = low; 3<sup>rd</sup> quartile = high) (left) and M.I. (1<sup>st</sup> quartile = low; 3<sup>rd</sup> quartile = high) (right). Mann-Whitney p&lt; 0.05. n = 22. F) A case of uterine LMS with nuclear expression of SKP2 in the majority of the cells and weak and focal cytoplasmic expression of MEF2C.

<p>To prove the role of the MEF2-HDACs axis in LMS, we used well-established LMS cell lines. As a first step, we investigated if the repression of MEF2-target genes observed in LMS could be recapitulated in a cellular model. Two LMS cell lines, SK-LMS-1 and SK-UT-1, originally isolated from tumors with different grading (G2 and G3 respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref036">36</xref>], evidenced a robust decrease of MEF2 transcriptional activities, when compared to normal smooth muscle cells (SMC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). Therefore, they could be used for our purpose.</p>

<title>Differential regulation of MEF2 proteins in leiomyosarcoma cells</title>
<p>SK-LMS-1 and SK-UT-1 cells were characterized for the expression of MEF2D, MEF2C and HDAC4. The levels of HDAC4 were slightly increased in SK-UT-1 cells, whereas MEF2C and MEF2D levels were dramatically augmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Importantly, proteasome inhibition increased MEF2 levels only in SK-LMS-1. The UPS-independence and the high-levels of MEF2C and MEF2D in SK-UT-1 cells can be explained by the presence of a cytoplasmic retained, splicing variant of SKP2, the E3 ligase responsible for MEF2 poly-ubiquitylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref037">37</xref>].</p>

<title>Defect in UPS-mediated MEF2-degradation in the most aggressive LMS cell line.</title>
<p>A) Immunoblot analysis of HDAC4, SKP2 and MEF2 family members in LMS cells. Cells were treated for 8 hours with 2.5μM of the UPS inhibitor MG132. RACK1 was used as loading control. B) Immunoblot analysis of MEF2D isoforms in LMS cells engineered to express the dominant negative version of SKP2 (DN). RACK1 was used as loading control. C) Immunoblot analysis of MEF2D in LMS cells engineered to express an inducible version of SKP2 fused to ER as indicated. SKP2 was induced for 30 hours with 0.5μM 4-OHT. RACK1 was used as loading control and the nuclear relocalization of SKP2 after 4-OHT treatment was scored by immunofluorescence. D) Cellular lysates obtained in SK-LMS-1 cells expressing the DN mutant of SKP2 were immunoprecipitated using anti-MEF2Dα1 antibody and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Immunoblots with total lysates (input) are also included. E) Cellular lysates obtained in SK-UT-1 cells expressing the DN mutant of SKP2 were immunoprecipitated using anti-MEF2Dα1 isoform and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.

<p>We also evaluated the expression of the ubiquitously expressed MEF2Dα1 isoform and of the muscle-specific splicing variant MEF2Dα2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref010">10</xref>]. MEF2Dα2 was expressed only in SK-LMS-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), in agreement with the less aggressive G2 phenotype. MG132 treatment did not influence MEF2Dα2 levels. This result indicates that the exon-switch allows escaping from inhibitory controls, probably because the α2 isoform is defective in SKP2-binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref035">35</xref>]. Similarly to MG132 treatment, the introduction of a dominant negative version of SKP2 (SKP2DN) augmented MEF2Dα1, but not MEF2Dα2 levels and only in SK-LMS-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). By contrast, introduction of an inducible version of SKP2 (SKP2-ER) diminished MEF2D levels in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Finally, poly-ubiquitylation of MEF2Dα1 can be abrogated in SK-LMS-1 cells in the presence of SKP2DN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), whereas this poly-ubiquitylation was almost undetectable in SK-UT-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). In summary, these data demonstrate that in the two LMS cells the MEF2-HDAC axis is subjected to different regulations.</p>

<title>Context dependent pro-oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles of MEF2D</title>
<p>To clarify the contribution of MEF2 to the tumorigenic process, we knocked down (KD) MEF2D expression in SK-LMS-1 using two different shRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). MEF2D silencing was accompanied by the down-regulation of CDKN1A. mRNA quantities of a set of MEF2-target genes (<italic>CDKN1A</italic>, <italic>KLF2</italic>, <italic>RHOB</italic>, <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, <italic>JUN</italic>, <italic>CNN1</italic>, <italic>IRS1</italic>) were reduced in MEF2D silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In SK-LMS-1 cells, MEF2D KD increases the number of cells in S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), the random cell motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) and invasiveness, as scored by <italic>in vitro</italic> Matrigel invasion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g003">Fig 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s005">S1 Fig</xref>). Finally, to complete the analysis of the tumorigenic properties, we investigated the ability to grow in soft agar.

<p>When MEF2D expression was down-regulated in SK-UT-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g003">Fig 3G</xref>) the scenario was the opposite. <italic>CDKN1A</italic> was not affected, and other MEF2-targets showed a heterogeneous behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). <italic>RHOB</italic> and <italic>CNN1</italic> expression was down-regulated, whereas <italic>KLF2</italic>, <italic>JUN</italic> and <italic>IRS1</italic> were up-regulated. DNA replication was not augmented, instead a trend toward a slight reduction was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g003">Fig 3I</xref>). The random cell motility, the invasiveness properties and the growth in soft agar were all impaired in SK-TU-1 cells KD for MEF2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g003">Fig 3J, 3K and 3L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s005">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To exclude that the opposite tumorigenic functions of MEF2D were due to the presence of the muscle-specific MEF2Dα2 splicing variant only in SK-LMS-1 cells, we specifically silenced the MEF2Dα1 isoform. We then compared the phenotype with the KD of both α1 and α2 isoforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s006">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). Expression of MEF2-target genes was similarly repressed in cells silenced for both isoforms or for only the α1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s006">S2C Fig</xref>). In addition, the impact on the growth in soft agar was undistinguishable between cells KD for both isoforms or only for the MEF2Dα1 splicing variant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s006">S2D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>After MEF2D, MEF2A is the MEF2 paralogue more expressed in LMS. We then asked whether also MEF2A plays a similar bi-faced role. MEF2A silencing in SK-LM-1 cells photocopied the MEF2D KD in terms of MEF2-target genes expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s007">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>), proliferation, cell motility, invasiveness and growth in soft agar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s007">S3C, S3D, S3E and S3F Fig</xref>). Also in SK-UT-1 cells MEF2A silencing replicated MEF2D KD. Certain MEF2-targets were up-regulated <italic>(KLF2</italic>, <italic>JUN</italic>, <italic>IRS1)</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s007">S3G and S3H Fig</xref>), random cell motility, invasiveness and growth in soft agar were all impaired in MEF2A silenced cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s007">S3J, S3K and S3L Fig</xref>).

<title>HDAC4 binding to promoters of MEF2-target genes is increased in SK-UT-1 cells</title>
<p>Our data indicate that only in SK-UT-1 cells MEF2 can exert a dominant repressive influence on certain targets. Well-known repressive partners of these TFs are the class IIa HDACs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref017">17</xref>]. Hence, we compared the status of HDAC4 among the two cell lines. HDAC4 levels were increased in SK-UT-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and also its nuclear/pan fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In both LMS cells, HDAC4 underwent nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling, as proved by the nuclear accumulation in response to leptomycin treatment.</p>

<title>Analysis of MEF2D-HDAC4 repressive complexes in LMS cells.</title>
<p>A) Quantitative analysis of the immunofluorescence studies. LMS cells were treated or not for 2 hours with 5ng/ml leptomycin B (LC Laboratories).

The same amounts of cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated and the immunoblot were developed under the same circumstances.

<p>Also the pool of MEF2D in complex with HDAC4 was greater in SK-UT-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).

<p>By scrutinizing a public available database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org/">http://www.cbioportal.org/</ext-link>), we noticed that also the expression of HDAC5 and HDAC9, but not of HDAC7, was augmented in certain LMS patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Collectively, approximately 22% of patients present increased expression of a class IIa HDAC member. This feature is mirrored in the SK-UT-1 cells, which are characterized by high levels of HDAC9 and by a reduction in HDAC7 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Only in SK-UT-1 cells, proteasome inhibition increased the amount of HDAC9. Conversely, MG132 treatment stabilized MEF2A in SK-LMS-1 cells but not in SK-UT-1 cells, as above described for MEF2C and MEF2D. The high levels of HDAC9 in SK-UT-1 cells correlate with the augmented levels of the corresponding mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Luciferase assay using the HDAC9 promoter demonstrated that the high levels of HDAC9 in SK-UT-1 cells arise from an increased transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). ChIP on this promoter demonstrated a dramatic enrichment of an epigenetic signature (H3K27ac and H3K4me3), typical of open chromatin/active transcription only in SK-UT-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Finally, ChIP experiments demonstrated a selective binding of HDAC9 to the promoters of certain MEF2-target genes (<italic>KLF2</italic> and <italic>IRS1</italic>) only in SK-UT-1 cells. By contrast, MEF2A binding to the same promoters occurs in both LMS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g005">Fig 5F</xref>).

<title>MEF2A and MEF2D-dependent transcriptional landscapes in LMS cells: definition of <italic>classical</italic> and <italic>atypical</italic> target genes</title>
<p>To comprehend the molecular basis responsible for the antagonistic effects of MEF2 on cancer aggressiveness, we compared the transcriptomes of the different MEF2 KD LMS cells. Several genes resulted modulated in a MEF2-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In addition to a pool of genes commonly regulated by MEF2D and MEF2A, we observed that in both cell lines some genes are under the specific regulation of one of the two paralogues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). For the purposes of this work we focused our attention only on genes commonly regulated by MEF2D and MEF2A. Gene-Ontology analysis revealed that in SK-LMS-1 cells, the KD of MEF2 elicits the down-modulation of genes involved in the epithelial/mesenchymal transition and in inflammation, while genes involved in proliferation and cell-cycle progression were up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g006">Fig 6B</xref> upper part). Interestingly, both MEF2 KDs show opposite effects in SK-UT-1 cells, since genes involved in inflammation and epithelial/mesenchymal transition were instead up-regulated, while the E2F targets were repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>Several genes down-regulated after MEF2D and MEF2A KDs in SK-LMS-1 cells were, on the opposite, up-regulated in SK-UT-1 cells after the same KDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). This evidence suggests that MEF2 can preferentially behave as transcriptional activators in SK-LMS-1 cells and as transcriptional repressors in SK-UT-1 cells. To better clarify this occurrence, we focused our analysis on 85 genes, which, in SK-LMS-1 cells, were repressed after MEF2D as well as after MEF2A silencing and that were also significantly modulated in SK-UT-1 cells (|FC|&gt;1.5, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s003">S3 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>Many (n = 58) of these 85 MEF2-target genes were up-regulated in SK-UT-1 cells after MEF2 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>). We defined as “<italic>atypical loci</italic>” genes that were up-regulated after MEF2 silencing in SK-UT-1 cells, and as “<italic>classical loci</italic>” genes repressed by the KD of MEF2 in both cell lines. By contrast, the majority of genes up-regulated by MEF2 KD in SK-LMS-1 cells (n = 52) were also up-regulated (n = 45) by MEF2 KD in SK-UT-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). Hence, the “atypical” behavior specifically originates in SK-UT-1 cells, because of a shift towards a repressive environment under MEF2 supervision. These common MEF2-target genes, with divergent behavior, could be responsible for the antagonistic effects of MEF2 on cancer aggressiveness in the two LMS cells.</p>
<p>We also compared the absolute levels of expression of the classical and atypical genes between the two LMS cells. Only the atypical genes were significantly less expressed in SK-UT-1 compared to SK-LMS-1 cells, both in our microarray experiments and in another dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g006">Fig 6G</xref>).</p>
<p>To validate the microarray studies, we performed qRT-PCR analysis on sets of classical <italic>(ALDH2</italic>, <italic>ALDH6A1</italic>, <italic>MDX4</italic>, <italic>FUCA1)</italic> and atypical <italic>(ALPK2</italic>, <italic>COL1A2</italic>, <italic>IL8</italic>, <italic>SMOX</italic>, <italic>LEPREL1)</italic> MEF2-targets. The expression of all classical genes was reduced in both LMS cells when MEF2A or MEF2D were silenced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s009">S5A, S5B, S5C and S5D Fig</xref>). By contrast, only in SK-UT-1 cells the expression of the atypical MEF2-targets was up-regulated after MEF2A or MEF2D KD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s009">S5B and S5D Fig</xref>). We also compared the binding of MEF2 to the promoters of the newly identified genes in both LMS cells. The positions of the MEF2 binding sites in the regulatory elements of these genes are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s004">S4 Table</xref>. All tested MEF2-targets contain the consensus-binding site for MEF2, although at different distances from the TSS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s009">S5E Fig</xref>). MEF2D equally binds the promoters of classical and atypical genes and this binding was dramatically reduced in MEF2D silenced cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s009">S5E Fig</xref>). In summary these data demonstrate that MEF2 can exert opposite transcriptional influences in different contexts.</p>

<title>MEF2 differentially supervise epigenetic changes at the promoters of classical and atypical genes</title>
<p>We hypothesized that the differential transcriptional impact of MEF2 KD in the two LMS cells might reflect a specific epigenetic reprogramming. Since MEF2 can recruit HATs and HDACs onto promoter/enhancer of target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref038">38</xref>], levels of H3K27 acetylation were measured for a selected set of atypical genes (<italic>ALPK2</italic>, <italic>COL1A2</italic>, <italic>IL8</italic>, <italic>KLF2</italic>, <italic>SMOX</italic>) and of classical genes (<italic>ALDH6A1</italic>, <italic>FUCA1</italic>, <italic>MDX4</italic>, <italic>RHOB)</italic>. We also evaluated the status of H3K4me3 at the TSSs, since this modification is associated to transcriptionally active open chromatin.

<p>The repression of the atypical genes in SK-UT-1 cells correlated with a dramatic reduction of H3K4me3 at the respective promoters.

For all the classical genes, only minor differences were observed between the two cell lines in the case of the three investigated parameters.</p>
<p>After MEF2D silencing in SK-LMS-1 cells the abundance of the mRNAs, as well as H3K27ac and H3K4me3 levels, at the respective regulative regions and TSSs for all tested genes, were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). When the contribution of MEF2D was evaluated in SK-UT-1 cells the scenario was different. mRNA levels of atypical genes were augmented, as well as H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). H3K27ac was significantly increased only for <italic>KLF2</italic> and <italic>COL1A2</italic> (modestly) and reduced for <italic>SMOX</italic>. In the case of the classical genes, their expression and the two histone-modifications linked to open chromatin were all reduced after MEF2D silencing, similarly to SK-UT-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g007">Fig 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall this analysis suggests that MEF2 can concurrently supervise H3K27 acetylation/deacetylation and H3K4 methylation/demethylation on different promoters in the same cell population.</p>

<title>HDAC9 is the critical player for switching MEF2 towards a repressive influence and it is required for the transformed phenotype of LMS cells</title>
<p>The dominant repressive influence exerted by MEF2 on some promoters in SK-UT-1 cells could stem from their assembly into a repressive complex. Likely candidates for this role are HDAC4 and HDAC9. To prove this hypothesis, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref039">39</xref>] to generate SK-UT-1 cells knock-out (KO) for <italic>HDAC4</italic> or <italic>HDAC9</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1006752.s012">S8 Fig</xref>).

In SK-UT-1 <italic>HDAC9-/-</italic> cells the expression of the atypical genes was augmented, except for <italic>SMOX</italic>, which was weakly up-regulated only in the clone 2. The expression of the classical genes was not influenced by the absence of HDAC9, with the exclusion of <italic>RHOB</italic>, which expression was slightly augmented. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g008">Fig 8C</xref> extended this analysis to 8 atypical and 6 classical genes and confirmed the specific effect of <italic>HDAC9</italic> deletion on the atypical genes.

<title>The binding of HDAC9 to the promoter of MEF2-target genes correlates with the classical or atypical behavior</title>
<p>In SK-UT-1 cells, the differential impact of MEF2 on transcription could depend on the selective recruitment of HDAC9-repressive complexes onto the promoters of atypical and classical MEF2-target genes. ChIP experiments proved that HDAC9 can be isolated, as a complex, from promoters of the atypical but not from promoters of classical genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g009">Fig 9A</xref>).

<p>To further confirm the contribution of HDAC9 to LMS development, 26 cases of LMS were transcriptionally profiled by RNAseq and scrutinized for class IIa HDACs expression levels. Similarly to the TCGA dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), also in our LMS series HDAC9 turned out to be the most expressed class IIa HDAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). Moreover, isoform quantification analyses reveled that MITR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref040">40</xref>], the truncated HDAC9 isoform, was the more abundantly expressed (24 out of 26 samples) splicing variant in LMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g009">Fig 9D</xref>). Finally, the Kaplan-Meier analysis, as performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g001">Fig 1H</xref> but restricted to HDAC9, evidences the association of high MEF2 and HDAC9 levels with reduced patients’ survival in LMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g009">Fig 9E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The involvement of MEF2 in the tumorigenic process is still enigmatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref041">41</xref>]. In this manuscript we provide evidences that could help to solve this controversial issue. We took advantage from the leiomyosarcoma model to unveil the two-faced of MEF2, but we are confident that these results can be confirmed also in other cancer types.</p>
<p>Our studies suggest that LMS can be clustered in two groups, in terms of MEF2 dysfunctions. The first group exhibited low proliferation and low levels of MEF2 proteins, possibly because of the SKP2-mediated degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref042">42</xref>]. The second group comprised tumors with high expression of MEF2 and of class IIa HDACs. Under these conditions MEF2 are converted into transcriptional repressors. The combination of high MEF2 and class IIa HDACs levels is detrimental for patients’ survival. Although the UPS-mediated degradation can remove MEF2 from promoters and enhancers, their conversion into repressors can provide a strongest silencing, which is translated in a worse prognosis. HDAC4, HDAC5 and HDAC9 or its splicing variant MITR are the class IIa HDACs more frequently overexpressed in LMS. A condition not limited to this tumor type, as testified by recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<p>These observations can be recapitulated in two LMS cell lines. In SK-LMS-1 cells MEF2 are under UPS control. MEF2 ablation reduces the expression of MEF2-target genes and enhances the transformed phenotype. By contrast in SK-UT-1 cells, where HDAC9 is highly expressed, MEF2 are required for tumorigenesis and to repress the transcription of some MEF2-target genes. This conversion stems from MEF2 assembly into multi-protein repressive complexes, which erase histone marks of open chromatin configuration, such as H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, and thus repress the transcription of some MEF2-target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1006752.g009">Fig 9F</xref>).</p>
<p>Our genes expression profile studies confirmed the complexity of the MEF2-trascriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref049">49</xref>]. Common as well as cell type and isoform specific MEF2-regulated genes exist. This multifaceted scenario could result from: i) a certain degree in DNA binding preferences of the different MEF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref050">50</xref>]; ii) the presence of specific PTMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref001">1</xref>] and iii) the ability of forming complexes with other TFs, which hijack MEF2 away from canonical targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Beside this complexity, we identified a common MEF2 signature, which can explain the opposite impact of MEF2 in the two LMS cells. Regulators of EMT, of the cell cycle and of inflammation are significantly enriched in this signature. Several genes of this signature are repressed by MEF2 in SK-UT-1 cells.</p>
<p>HDAC9 is the key factor for switching MEF2 into a repressor. However, HDAC9 is not recruited onto all promoters bound by MEF2. Hence, some MEF2-target genes are not repressed, even though SK-UT-1 cells express high levels of HDAC9. It is possible that these MEF2-targets govern some crucial activities of cancer cells.</p>
<p>The coexistence in the same cell population of TFs with both suppressive and activating activities on different loci, although surprising, was previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref052">52</xref>]. Different hypothesis have been formulated to explain this paradox but without a conclusive demonstration. We can exclude that the distance of the MEF2 binding site from the TSS could play a role, as previously hypothesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref048">48</xref>]. Since the repressive switch is cell lineage-dependent rather than gene-dependent, we could also exclude contributions of differences in the consensus of binding between promoters, as observed for p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref052">52</xref>]. A fascinating hypothesis concerns contributions of the local nuclear organization, which might generate microenvironments proficient or exploitive for HDAC9 binding to MEF2.</p>
<p>MEF2 are required for H3K27 acetylation and H3K4 methylation. These activities can be explained by their ability to interact with Ash2L, a core subunit of KMT2 methyltransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref053">53</xref>] and with the acetyl-transferase p300/CBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref054">54</xref>]. MEF2, once in complex with HDAC9, govern H3K27 deacetylation and H3K4 demethylation. Class IIa HDACs can bind the complex HDAC3/NuRD/SMRT, which delivers the deacetylase activity. Currently, we do not know whether a H3K4 demethylase is part of the same repressive complex with HDAC9. In principle, HDAC9 could act as a scaffold for a DMTase, as previously reported for HDAC4 and HDAC5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref055">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref057">57</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, in SK-UT-1 cells genes repressed by MEF2-HDAC9 conserve H3K27 acetylation levels comparable to SK-LMS-1. These genes are in equilibrium between a closed and open chromatin conformation, similarly to the poised developmental regulatory genes in stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref058">58</xref>]. This condition would make possible to revert the transcriptional output of these genes by simply inhibiting the demethylase involved.</p>
<p>Therapeutic intervention in advanced leiomyosarcomas represents a challenge. Important obstacles are the extreme genetic heterogeneity and the relatively low incidence of these malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1006752.ref059">59</xref>]. Here we have found that over 20% of leiomyosarcomas present increased expression of a class IIa HDAC member. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments indicate that the manipulation of the MEF2-HDAC axis impinges on the transformed phenotype. In conclusion, our discoveries suggest that small molecules targeting class IIa HDACs or the interaction between the deacetylase and MEF2 could afford success for the treatment of certain LMS.</p>

Two sgRNAs designed on the second coding exon of HDAC9 were co-delivered to obtain two close cleavages on the genome to simulate a DSB (sgRNA1: CTGCTATCAGAAGCTGCTTC; sgRNA2: GAACTTGACACGGCAGCACC). Five clones were selected for the presence of deletions or insertion and among them the indicated two were selected for the analysis.</p>
<p>C) Schematic representation of <italic>HDAC4</italic> genomic organization with indicated: the exons (vertical bars), the introns (junctions between the bars) and the PAM sequences utilized for the CRISPR approach.</p>
<p>D) Genomic sequences of the <italic>HDAC4</italic>-/- SK-UT-1 cells used in this study. The sequence of <italic>HDAC4</italic> genomic region targeted by the CRISPR/Cas9 is included. The PAMs and the two gRNAs are underlined. SKUT-1 HDAC4 KO clones were obtained through the delivery of wild-type spCas9 (pLENTI-CRISPRv2). Two sgRNAs designed on the second coding exon were used (sgRNA1: GCAGGATTCAGCAGCTCCAC; sgRNA2: CGTGAACCACATGCCCAGCA). One and three KO clones were obtained respectively with sgRNA1 and 2. The two representative clones indicated here were selected for the analysis.</p>
