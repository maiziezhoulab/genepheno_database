<abstract>
<p>Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <italic>CACNA1C</italic>, the α1C subunit of the voltage-gated L-type calcium channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2, rank among the most consistent and replicable genetics findings in psychiatry and have been associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. However, genetic variants of complex diseases often only confer a marginal increase in disease risk, which is additionally influenced by the environment. Here we show that embryonic deletion of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> in forebrain glutamatergic neurons promotes the manifestation of endophenotypes related to psychiatric disorders including cognitive decline, impaired synaptic plasticity, reduced sociability, hyperactivity and increased anxiety. Additional analyses revealed that depletion of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> during embryonic development also increases the susceptibility to chronic stress, which suggest that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 interacts with the environment to shape disease vulnerability. Remarkably, this was not observed when <italic>Cacna1c</italic> was deleted in glutamatergic neurons during adulthood, where the later deletion even improved cognitive flexibility, strengthened synaptic plasticity and induced stress resilience. In a parallel gene × environment design in humans, we additionally demonstrate that SNPs in <italic>CACNA1C</italic> significantly interact with adverse life events to alter the risk to develop symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Overall, our results further validate <italic>Cacna1c</italic> as a cross-disorder risk gene in mice and humans, and additionally suggest a differential role for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 during development and adulthood in shaping cognition, sociability, emotional behavior and stress susceptibility. This may prompt the consideration for pharmacological manipulation of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 in neuropsychiatric disorders with developmental and/or stress-related origins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Major psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BPD), major depressive disorder (MDD) and autism are moderately to highly heritable, and increasing evidence is suggesting a shared genetic etiology among them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> This might partially explain why many patients suffering from these illnesses display a substantial amount of overlapping symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> One of the most consistent and robust genetic findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses of GWAS are associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the α1 subunit (<italic>CACNA1C</italic>) of the voltage-gated L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (LTCC) Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 with SCZ and BPD, and to a lesser extent with MDD and autism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> In support, candidate analysis studies have clearly indicated a shared genetic risk for <italic>CACNA1C</italic> across these disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Further evidence comes from clinical studies, which have associated the primary disease-associated <italic>CACNA1C</italic> risk allele, rs1006737, with variations in human brain function and structure in patients, but also in healthy subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Hence, the available GWAS and clinical data establish CACNA1C as a possible shared susceptibility factor which influences disease vulnerability for BPD, SCZ and MDD across current diagnostic boundaries. This is of considerable interest, in view of the fact that LTCCs have a pivotal role in modulating neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity and gene expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> However, the causality and mechanisms of how genetic alterations in CACNA1C affect the risk for an entire spectrum of psychiatric disorders remain largely unknown. Importantly, the associated <italic>CACNA1C</italic> variants by themselves only confer a marginal increase in disease risk. In addition to shared genetic risk factors, the environment represents an important contributor to the risk for many psychiatric disorders. In particular, adverse life events such as severe trauma and/or chronic stress represent strong risk factors not only for MDD but also for other psychiatric disorders including BPD and SCZ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> However, no study to date has examined whether the established risk gene <italic>CACNA1C</italic> interacts with established environmental risk factors to shape disease outcome.</p>
<p>Functional LTCCs are hetero-oligomeric complexes consisting of multiple subunits: α1, β, α2, δ and/or γ. The voltage sensor, selectivity filter, ion-conduction pore and binding site for all available calcium channel blockers is encoded by the α1 subunit. The LTCC family consists of four distinct members, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1–Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4, with mainly Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 shown to have a prominent role in the brain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 accounting for ~85% of the LTCCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Pharmacological agents, such as the LTCC-targeting dihydropyridines, have frequently been applied to assess the function of LTCCs in the central nervous system (CNS). However, this approach is limited by the fact that all LTCC antagonists available to date are not completely selective for either Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 or Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3, and that most studies investigated acute rather than long-term effects. More sophisticated genetic approaches using transgenic mice have helped to address the selective functional roles of different LTCCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Constitutive deletion of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> was shown to result in embryonic lethality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> and conditional inactivation of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 in forebrain structures was repeatedly associated with impairments in cognitive function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> More recently, haploinsufficiency and forebrain-specific deletion of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> were also associated with anxiety-like behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> and sleep disturbances,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> two core endophenotypes of MDD and BPD. In addition, <italic>Cacna1c</italic> was shown to mediate survival of young hippocampal neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> and brain-specific deletion of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> impairs discrete forms of hippocampal-dependent memory and neurogenesis within the dentate gyrus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> However, the underlying neuronal circuits that modulate the effects of CACNA1C on synaptic plasticity and behavior remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>In this study we aimed to investigate how CACNA1C modulates the risk to psychiatric disorders in dependence of environmental, developmental and circuit specific factors, using both genetic mouse models and human data.</p>

<title>Behavioral testing and study design</title>
<p>Locomotion and sociability were investigated with the open field (OF) test and the three chamber apparatus respectively, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> Anxiety-related behaviour was assessed in the light/dark box test as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> Spatial memory learning and object recognition were investigated with the water cross maze (WCM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> and spatial object recognition task. The forced swim test (FST) was used to assess passive vs active stress-coping behavior (behavioral despair) and corticosterone levels in response to an acute stressor as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> For details, refer to online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Information</xref>.</p>
<p>For the basal behavioral characterization of <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> (Figure 2), <italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> (Figure 2) and <italic>Cav1.2</italic><sup><italic>CNS-CKO</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>), one batch of animals was used for each line with the following order of tests (OF, sociability, dark/light box test, FST and corticosterone assessment). A second and third batch of animals was used for the WCM test and long-term potentiation (LTP) recordings, respectively. In addition, a fourth batch of <italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice (Figure 4) was used for the CSDS paradigm with the following test order (sociability, OF, object recognition test, dark/light box, FST and subsequent corticosterone, adrenal gland and thymus weight assessment).

<title>Study design (gene × environment interaction in humans)</title>
<p>Participants in this study belonged to a larger cohort (Grady Trauma Project) investigating the role of genetic and environmental factors in predicting outcomes to stressful life events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> Phenotypes and genotypes were available for a total of 4,023 individuals, predominantly African Americans belonging to a highly traumatized, urban population of low socioeconomic status.

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using the commercially available software SPSS v16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism v5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). The sample size was chosen such that with a type 1 error of 0.05 and a type 2 error of 0.2 the effect size should be at least 1.2-fold of the pooled s.d. All results are presented as mean±s.e.m. Behavioral phenotypic differences between two genotypes were evaluated with Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test (two-tailed). If data were not normally distributed, the non-parametric Mann–Whitney test was used. Time-dependent measures were assessed with multi-factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures. For CSDS experiments, the effects of genotype and condition on all other behavioral and neuroendocrine parameters were assessed by two factorial ANOVA (two-way ANOVA). Whenever significant main or interaction effects were found by the ANOVAs, Bonferroni <italic>post hoc</italic> tests were carried out to locate simple effects. Statistical significance was defined as <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05. All data were tested for outlieres using the Grubb’ test. Homogeneity of variance was tested using Bartlett’s test. Animals were allocated to the experimental groups in a semi-randomized manner and data analysis was performed blinded to the group allocation.</p>

<title>Forebrain <italic>Cacna1c</italic> is predominately expressed in glutamatergic neurons</title>
<p><italic>Cacna1c</italic> is expressed throughout the mouse brain, including key limbic regions relevant for emotion and cognition such as the prefrontal cortex (Ctx), hippocampus (Hip) and amygdala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Double ISH against <italic>Cacna1c</italic> and markers of excitatory glutamatergic (<italic>Vglut1</italic> and <italic>Vglut2</italic>), as well as inhibitory GABAergic neurons (<italic>Gad65/Gad67</italic>), revealed a predominant expression of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> in glutamatergic <italic>Vglut1</italic>-positive neurons throughout the Ctx, Hip and basolateral amygdala. The prominent <italic>Cacna1c</italic> expression in the thalamus was largely restricted to glutamatergic <italic>Vglut2</italic>-positive neurons, although a number of <italic>Cacna1c</italic>-containing neurons within the latero-dorsal thalamus also co-expressed <italic>Vglut1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1b and d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1e,f</xref>). Minimal to no co-expression with <italic>Vglut1</italic> was detected in the caudate putamen, central nucleus of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis or granule cell layer of the olfactory bulb, confirming the abundance of GABAergic markers in these regions. Accordingly, <italic>Cacna1c</italic> expression in the olfactory bulb, CPu, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central nucleus of the amygdala was mainly restricted to <italic>Gad65/67</italic>-positive GABAergic neurons. In addition, <italic>Cacna1c</italic> was also detected in scattered <italic>Gad65/67</italic>-positive neurons of the Hip and Ctx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1c and d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1c,d</xref>).</p>

<title>Deletion of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> from forebrain glutamatergic neurons during development and adulthood induces differential effects on anxiety and opposing effects on cognition</title>
<p>In view of the results described above, we set out to genetically dissect the role of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> in glutamatergic neurons. For this, we crossed floxed <italic>Cacna1c</italic> mice to <italic>Nex-Cre</italic> mice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> in which Cre-mediated recombination is initiated during embryonic development (E11.5) in forebrain glutamatergic neurons. As observed from the ISHs and double ISHs, <italic>Cacna1c</italic> ablation in forebrain glutamatergic neurons (<italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup>) was largely restricted to <italic>Vglut1</italic>-expressing cells, including the Ctx, CA1/2/3 of the Hip, and lateral and basolateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a and b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S2</xref>). Next, we assessed behavioral endophenotypes known to be altered in animal models of MDD, BPD and SCZ, including locomotion/exploration in the OF test, anxiety in the dark/light box test, immobility in the FST, social behavior in the three-chamber test (sociability test), as well as spatial learning and memory in the WCM task. Similar to humans, deficits in cognition and social behavior are recapitulated by mouse models of numerous psychiatric disorders including SCZ, BPD and MDD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> Hyperactivity in the OF and FST are often associated with mania in mouse models of BPD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> whereas enhanced anxiety represents a core endophenotype of MDD and the depressive phase of BPD in rodents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> However, changes in locomotor activity are also commonly reported in animal models of SCZ and MDD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> Compared with their respective littermate Ctrls, <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice exhibited increased anxiety in the dark–light box test and decreased preference for the social counterpart in the sociability test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2c and d</xref>). In the FST, <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice exhibited increased active stress-coping behavior (reduced behavioral despair), evident by decreased immobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). In addition, <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice displayed a pronounced hyperlocomotion in the OF test, which was not observed during the initial 5 min where novelty-induced anxiety is most prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). The OF was performed under low light conditions (15 lux) in order to minimize anxiety effects on locomotion, which likely explains the lack of effects on inner zone time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). Hip-dependent spatial learning and memory performance was investigated in the WCM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> Compared with the regular Morris water-maze test, the simplicity of the WCM leads to short trial durations and therefore reduces the stress load compared to Morris water-maze training. In addition, using accuracy rather than speed as the main readout, allows for hippocampus-dependent strategies to be assessed from the first training day on. <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice displayed accuracy levels that barely surpassed the chance level of 50%, both during learning and relearning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>), suggesting drastically impaired cognitive performance. In view of this strong effect on cognition, we additionally assessed hippocampal LTP at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. One hour after a 100 Hz tetanus stimulation, <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> showed a significant decrease in LTP compared with Ctrl mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>).</p>
<p>Next we addressed whether the underlying neurobiological changes responsible for the behavioral alterations in <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice occur during development or adulthood. Floxed <italic>Cacna1c</italic> mice were bred to inducible <italic>Camk2α-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> with the aim of deleting <italic>Cacna1c</italic> in forebrain glutamatergic neurons (<italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup>) during adulthood (postnatal weeks 11–13). We deliberately chose the <italic>Camk2α-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> line because of the strongly overlapping expression pattern with the <italic>Nex-Cre</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a and i</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S2 and S5</xref>). Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 was inactivated upon tamoxifen administration in forebrain excitatory projection neurons, which predominantly include glutamatergic pyramidal neurons of the Ctx, Hip and basolateral amygdala.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> As expected, the mRNA deletion pattern strongly resembled that of <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice, with loss of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> expression in <italic>Vglut1</italic>-positive neurons of the lateral and basolateral amygdala, as well as the entire cerebral Ctx and Hip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2i and j</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S3 and S4</xref>). Along these lines, remaining hippocampal protein levels did not significantly differ between <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> and <italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6a,b</xref>). In addition, deletion of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> mRNA expression in <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice was also observed throughout the DG and within a few neurons of the latero-dorsal thalamus and medial parts of the thalamus, central nucleus of the amygdala and the geniculate nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S2</xref>). In the OF, <italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice displayed enhanced locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2n</xref>), although this was not as strongly pronounced as in <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice. However, immobility in the FST and sociability were not significantly altered in <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2l and m</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice displayed a marginal increase in time spent in the lit zone and number of entries in the dark/light box test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k</xref>), and even demonstrated enhanced cognitive flexibility during the relearning trial of the WCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2o</xref>). Considering that deletion of forebrain <italic>Cacna1c</italic> was reported to impair long-term memory,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> we re-exposed the animals to the WCM 30 days after relearning, but did not observe any differences between <italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> and Ctrl mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6g</xref>). In view of our results that developmental inactivation of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> from glutamatergic neurons decreases NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic plasticity and impairs spatial memory, we additionally assessed hippocampal LTP in <italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice. Intriguingly, 1 h after a 100 Hz tetanus stimulation, <italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> showed increased LTP compared with Ctrl mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2p</xref>). Importantly, we observed that CNS-specific <italic>Cacna1c</italic> deletion (<italic>Cav1.2</italic><sup><italic>CNS-CKO</italic></sup> mice), which is initiated at E8,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup> results in similar behavioral alterations compared with <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). This further supports partially opposing roles for developmental and adult <italic>Cacna1c</italic> in emotion and cognition, and argues against the possibility that differences between <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> and <italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice are due to the slight discrepancies in recombination patterns between the <italic>Nex-Cre</italic> and <italic>Camk2a-CreERT2</italic>. In addition, the observed behavioral changes were not caused by alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in neither of the mouse lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S6c,d</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Cacna1c</italic> differentially modulates susceptibility to CSDS during development and adulthood</title>
<p>Chronic stress and/or trauma represent strong risk factors for a number of psychiatric disorders, including MDD, BPD and anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup> In view of the phenotype in <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice, we wondered whether developmental deletion of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> would increase the susceptibility to CSDS. We choose to investigate heterozygous <italic>Cacna1c</italic> animals (<italic>Cav1.2</italic><sup><italic>Het</italic></sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), considering that <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice already display strong behavioral deficits under baseline conditions, which might not be further aggravated by CSDS. Importantly, no gross behavioral abnormalities were previously reported for <italic>Cav1.2</italic><sup><italic>Het</italic></sup> mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup>
<italic>Cav1.2</italic><sup><italic>Ctrl</italic></sup> and <italic>Cav1.2</italic><sup><italic>Het</italic></sup>mice were subjected to 3 weeks of CSDS. In accordance with other studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> we were able to detect robust physiological and neuroendocrine changes evoked by CSDS, independent of genotype, demonstrating the efficacy of the paradigm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S8a–d</xref>). Chronically stressed <italic>Cav1.2</italic><sup><italic>Het</italic></sup> mice displayed drastically reduced locomotion throughout the entire test duration compared to both, non-stressed <italic>Cav1.2</italic><sup><italic>Het</italic></sup> and stressed <italic>Cav1.2</italic><sup><italic>Ctrl</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). In addition, only chronically stressed <italic>Cav1.2</italic><sup><italic>Het</italic></sup> mice showed a significant reduction in the number of inner zone entries of the OF, indicating increased anxiety-related behavior even under low-light test conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Moreover, CSDS increased the latency to enter the lit compartment and decreased the time spent in the lit zone and number of lit entries to a much greater extent in <italic>Cav1.2</italic><sup><italic>Het</italic></sup> than in <italic>Cav1.2</italic><sup><italic>Ctrl</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3d–f</xref>), further supporting increased stress-induced anxiety in heterozygous <italic>Cacna1c</italic> mice. Sociability, immobility in the FST and spatial object recognition memory were not differentially affected by CSDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3g–i</xref>), suggesting a specific impact of the interaction between <italic>Cacna1c</italic> and chronic stress on anxiety.</p>
<p>In view of the partially opposing effects of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> on anxiety and cognition during development and adulthood, we wondered whether stress vulnerability would also be differentially affected upon deletion of the calcium channel in adulthood. Physiological and neuroendocrine parameters were similarly altered by CSDS in Ctrl and <italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 8e–h</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Cav1.2</italic><sup><italic>Het</italic></sup> mice, locomotion/exploration in the OF was only decreased in stressed Ctrl but not stressed <italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice, with a similar trend in the number of inner zone entries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a and b</xref>). In the dark/light box test, only Ctrl mice responded to CSDS with a significant reduction in time spent in the lit zone and number of entries, and a trend toward delayed latencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), which implies enhanced resilience to CSDS in <italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice. FST behavior, sociability and spatial object were similarly affected by CSDS in Ctrl and <italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4d–f</xref>). Considering that we observed susceptibility to CSDS in heterozygous Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 mice, we additionally assessed whether a heterozygous deletion in glutamatergic neurons during adulthood (<italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-Het</italic></sup>) would be sufficient to induce stress resilience (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). However, compared with <italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup>, <italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-Het</italic></sup> mice only exhibited partial resilience to CSDS-induced anxiety in the dark/light box test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9f</xref>). This points to a gene-dosage effect and suggests that complete absence of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> during adulthood, in forebrain glutamatergic neurons, is required to induce the extent of resilience to CSDS observed in <italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup>mice.</p>

<title><italic>CACNA1C</italic> interacts with adult trauma to predict depression symptoms in humans</title>
<p>A number of <italic>CACNA1C</italic> SNPs associated with BPD, SCZ and MDD were also shown to affect measures of anxiety, depression, psychosocial functioning and cognitive aspects in healthy Ctrls,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup> which might represent increased susceptibility factors for psychiatric disorders upon exposure to adverse environments. This is especially interesting in the context of MDD, in which disease susceptibility is strongly influenced by previous exposures to chronic and/or severe stress. Considering that most GWAS do not Ctrl for life-time adversity, we wondered whether certain <italic>CACNA1C</italic> SNPs might primarily influence the risk for MDD in combination with stressful life events. Consequently, we analyzed the effects of all <italic>CACNA1C</italic> variants and adult trauma on current depression symptoms, determined by the Beck Depression Inventory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup> in a large African American cohort of non-psychiatric clinical patients (<italic>n</italic>=4808) from the Grady trauma project.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref></sup> Importantly, symptoms of depression are not only characteristic for MDD and BPD but can also occur as part of affective dysregulation in SCZ24. After linkage disequilibrium-pruning based on <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>-values of 0.2, 32 of the 465 tested SNPs in the CACNA1C locus showed nominal significant interactions with adult trauma exposure on Beck Depression Inventory scores.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate that spatial memory, hippocampal plasticity and anxiety-related behavior are differentially affected by the loss of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> from excitatory circuits depending on whether it is deleted during embryonic development or adulthood. Increased anxiety-related behavior as well as reduced social and cognitive performance, observed in <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice, are considered core endophenotypes of MDD and/or the depressive phase of BPD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> whereas increased locomotion and activity in the FST are often associated with mania in animal models of BPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> Decreased immobility in the FST was previously reported for heterozygous mice by Dao <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> which is in line with our results and earlier work demonstrating antidepressant-like effects for LTCC blockers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref></sup> However, studies using LTCC blockers have to be interpreted with caution, as these have been reported to induce nonspecific, aversive and stress-like behavioral effects possibly due to excessive blood pressure lowering caused by inhibition of Cav1.2 in the cardiovascular system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref></sup> Importantly, hyperlocomotion, altered social behavior, and learning and memory impairments, are also analogous to negative and cognitive symptoms of SCZ, a disorder believed to have neurodevelopmental origins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> Additional evidence also suggests that two missense mutations in CACNA1C predispose to autism,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref></sup> another neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interactions and altered cognition. In accordance with the observed cognitive impairments, <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice also displayed deficits in hippocampal LTP, which is considered the cellular correlate of learning and memory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref></sup> Moreover, we show that <italic>Cacna1c</italic> strongly interacts with the environment to shape anxiety-related behavior. Heterozygous deletion of <italic>Cacna1c</italic>, which is present throughout life starting at the earliest point of development (one-cell stage), significantly increased the susceptibility to CSDS and is likely to be mediated by <italic>Cacna1c</italic> absence in forebrain glutamatergic neurons. Although <italic>CACNA1C</italic> SNPs have not been consistently associated with anxiety in humans, altered anxiety-related behavior is considered a core endophenotype of MDD and BPD in animal models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> Different to our observations, a recent study showed that chronic unpredictable stress induces similar behavioral deficits in heterozygous Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 mice and their wild-type littermates when assessed 1–2 days post stress. Surprisingly, the stress effects persisted in wild-type mice when tested 5–7 days later but not in heterozygous knockout mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref></sup> These discrepancies might be related to the different chronic stress paradigms.</p>
<p>In contrast to a developmental inactivation, deletion of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> from forebrain glutamatergic neurons during adulthood blocked the adverse effects of CSDS on anxiety, enhanced LTP and improved hippocampus-dependent cognitive flexibility during the WCM, without affecting long-term memory. Our findings in <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice are supported by previous studies, showing that deletion of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> from pan-neuronal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> or glutamatergic neurons during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> impairs synaptic plasticity and/or spatial learning, some of which might be attributed to deficits in adult neurogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> However, it should be kept in mind that our LTP results cannot be entirely correlated with cognitive performance considering that we stimulated CA3-CA1 Schaffer collaterals, which leads to the potentiation of most CA3-CA1 synapses rather than those that would selectively be recruited during a learning and memory task. Electrophysiological and pharmacological data have indicated that LTP induction is mainly initiated through NMDAR-activity but can also include NMDAR-independent and VGCC-dependent mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">70</xref></sup> Interestingly, the decline of some memory processes is attributed to the shift from NMDAR-dependent to VGCC-intracellular calcium stores-dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity, especially during aging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">73</xref></sup> Along these lines, a recent study provides evidence for an association between increased hippocampal <italic>Cacna1c</italic> expression and age-related cognitive decline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">74</xref></sup> Although we did not assess aged animals, it can be speculated that ablation of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 in adulthood partially blocks an evolving shift towards VGCC- and/or intracellular calcium store-dependent regulation of synaptic plasticity, hence facilitating NMDAR-dependent LTP. This potentially suggests that Hip-dependent spatial memory formation requires Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 during prenatal development, but not in adulthood where activation of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels is even detrimental for LTP. Notably, calcium channel antagonists were shown to ameliorate age-related deficits in hippocampus-dependent memory, possibly mediated through facilitation of NMDAR-LTP or inhibition of long-term depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">78</xref></sup> On the other hand, specific inactivation of <italic>Cacna1c</italic> in the anterior cingulate between postnatal weeks 8–10, impaired observational fear learning without altering novel object recognition memory and classical fear conditioning,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> highlighting the requirement for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 during adulthood for specific cognitive functions. The fact that we observed no significant changes in spatial object memory performance under basal or stress conditions further implies that adult-specific <italic>Cacna1c</italic> deletion in excitatory circuits does not impact all cognitive domains.</p>
<p>As observed in <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice, locomotion was also enhanced in <italic>Cav1.2-Ad</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> animals; however, social and active stress-coping behavior were only mildly affected, suggesting that these endophenotypes are partly regulated by forebrain-Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 during development and adulthood. In contrast, an earlier study demonstrated that forebrain-specific elimination of <italic>Cacna1c</italic>, using a non-inducible <italic>Camk2α-Cre</italic>, also results in increased anxiety-like behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> The discrepancy could potentially be attributed to different <italic>Cacna1c</italic> deletion time windows (p18<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">79</xref></sup> vs p91-97 in our study).</p>
<p>Although the Nex-Cre and Camk2α-CreER<sup>T2</sup> drivers primarily target glutamatergic forebrain neurons, they do slightly differ in their recombination patters (for example,the Camk2α-driven CreER<sup>T2</sup> is also expressed in parts of the thalamus, DG and central nucleus of the amygdala). However, the fact that developmental, CNS-specific <italic>Cacna1c</italic> knockout mice showed similar behavioral deficits as <italic>Cav1.2-Dev</italic><sup><italic>Glu-CKO</italic></sup> mice, further supports opposing roles for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 during development and adulthood. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out an important contribution of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2-expressing, GABAergic neurons in many of the disease-associated phenotypes. In fact, <italic>Cacna1c</italic> was reported to modulate processes related to drug addiction via GABAergic medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">81</xref></sup> and promote susceptibility to social stress when deleted from this specific brain region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">82</xref></sup> It is important to point out that we only assessed a subset of behavioral tests relevant to MDD, BPD and SCZ in our knockout mice. Future studies evaluating anhedonia, psychostimulant-induced locomotion, sleep architecture and deficits in sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition deficits), will further refine the contribution of developmental vs adult Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 in psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>Given our observations in mice, we further investigated if <italic>Cacna1c</italic> x stress interactions could also be found in human samples and checked for interaction effects of <italic>CACNA1C</italic> variants and adult trauma to predict current depressive symptoms</p>
<p>As expected, the risk to develop depressive symptoms was increased with exposure to adult trauma in our study and this effect was moderated by loci within CACNA1C tagged by rs73248708 and rs116625684. Both tag SNPs were not in linkage disequilibrium with the main haplotypes associated with SCZ with genome-wide significance, but represent independent loci. The intron 1 SNP rs116625684 shows a weak, nominal association with SCZ in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium data set (<italic>P</italic>=0.021), with an odds ratio of 0.94 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.med.unc.edu/pgc" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.med.unc.edu/pgc</ext-link>), suggesting a protective effect of the minor allele, which is also indicated by our results for the highest trauma group. The second SNP, rs73248708 is located in intron 3, which harbors the majority of <italic>CACNA1C</italic> SNPs associated with SCZ at genome-wide significance and also those linked to other disorders including BPD and MDD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> In fact, SNPs in this region were shown to lie in predicted enhancers capable of physically interacting with the <italic>CACNA1C</italic> transcriptional start site, and altering gene expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">83</xref></sup> Although rs73248708 is not in linkage disequilibrium with the top GWAS SNPs, including rs1006737, it may independently moderate the function of this enhancer region. In fact, we could show that different sets of genetic variants may be involved in baseline transcriptional regulation vs. regulation following environmental impact, such as trauma exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">84</xref></sup> Replication in independent cohorts will be necessary to further validate these loci in gene × environment interactions. Importantly, it remains to be investigated whether the here identified SNPs have implications on protein levels or are of other functional relevance. So far, both decreased and increased Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 levels have been associated with the common risk allele variant rs1006737,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">87</xref></sup> which might imply different regulatory functions across different brain regions and/or cell types. Whether the here identified SNPs, as well as previously associated <italic>CACAN1C</italic> risk alleles, can differentially affect gene expression in the brain upon perturbations such as severe stress and/or trauma will have to be assessed in the future. Considering the heterogeneity of MDD, our data raises the possibility that SNPs in CACNA1C might predict the risk for depression mainly in individuals with a history of trauma or severe stress. This could partially explain the nominal associations of CACAN1C with MDD in former genetic studies, which usually do not Ctrl for environmental factors. In addition, given our animal findings it would be interesting to examine for age × trauma interaction effects in the human sample. However, in the present cohort we did not have any information with regard to when exactly adult trauma took place and therefore cannot evaluate age effects.</p>
<p>There are some limitations of the interpretability of our findings, which should not be neglected. First, the Grady Trauma Project includes mostly African Americans. We cannot rule out that effects of <italic>CACNA1C</italic> variants are different in this specific population as compared with the European population where the effect of <italic>CACNA1C</italic> variants with regard to MDD were described first. Second, the GRADY sample itself is a highly traumatized cohort. It is possible that the described effects are only present in samples which show a high trauma burden and cannot be found in less traumatized cohorts. However, findings in this cohort can help to transit the results from mice to human data.</p>
<p>Although circuit- or cell type-specific absence of CACNA1C is not likely to occur in humans, epigenetic changes caused by environmental alterations may very well induce expression changes in specific tissues, cell types and/or entire brain circuits. In the clinical context this could imply that, individuals with genetic variants promoting reduced CACNA1C expression may either be at higher or lower risk to develop psychopathologies, depending on whether they experienced severe stress/trauma during development or adulthood. The pronounced effect of a prenatal <italic>Cacna1c</italic> depletion on emotional behavior and cognitive performance might account for its association with disorders such as SCZ and autism, which are increasingly believed to result from synaptic dysfunction during development. The fact that <italic>CACNA1C</italic> is also able to interact with the environment during adulthood, by modulating stress susceptibility, could explain its linkage to stress-related disorder such as MDD and BPD. At the same time, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 are expressed in midbrain dopaminergic neurons and several studies suggest a neuroprotective effects of LTCC blockers in Parkinson’s disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">88</xref></sup> which further emphasizes the possibility that inhibition of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 may be of therapeutic value in brain disorders that manifest at later stages in life. Concluding, we propose that the association of <italic>CACNA1C</italic> with multiple psychiatric disorders is related to its broad expression within key limbic regions and neuronal circuits relevant to emotion, motivation and cognition, and that alterations in <italic>CACNA1C</italic> gene expression during development and adulthood can result in diverging behavioral outcomes and differentially impact stress susceptibility.</p>
