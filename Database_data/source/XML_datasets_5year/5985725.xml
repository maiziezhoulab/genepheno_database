<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The human general transcription factor TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). In eukaryotic cells, TFIID is thought to nucleate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) preinitiation complex formation on all protein coding gene promoters and thus, be crucial for Pol II transcription. In a child with intellectual disability, mild microcephaly, corpus callosum agenesis and poor growth, we identified a homozygous splice-site mutation in <italic>TAF8</italic> (NM_138572.2: c.781–1G &gt; A). Our data indicate that the patient’s mutation generates a frame shift and an unstable TAF8 mutant protein with an unrelated C-terminus. The mutant TAF8 protein could not be detected in extracts from the patient’s fibroblasts, indicating a loss of TAF8 function and that the mutation is most likely causative. Moreover, our immunoprecipitation and proteomic analyses show that in patient cells only partial TAF complexes exist and that the formation of the canonical TFIID is impaired. In contrast, loss of TAF8 in mouse embryonic stem cells and blastocysts leads to cell death and to a global decrease in Pol II transcription. Astonishingly however, in human <italic>TAF8</italic> patient cells, we could not detect any cellular phenotype, significant changes in genome-wide Pol II occupancy and pre-mRNA transcription. Thus, the disorganization of the essential holo-TFIID complex did not affect global Pol II transcription in the patient’s fibroblasts. Our observations further suggest that partial TAF complexes, and/or an altered TFIID containing a mutated TAF8, could support human development and thus, the absence of holo-TFIID is less deleterious for transcription than originally predicted.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In order for a gene to be transcribed, a transcriptional preinitiation complex (PIC) needs to assemble at its promoter. The first complex to bind the promoter is the general transcription factor, TFIID, consisting of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 13 different TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B2">2</xref>). Following TFIID binding, other general transcription factors (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH) and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) are recruited to the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B3">3</xref>). Nine of the TAFs contain a histone fold domain (HFD), and form five histone fold pairs. TAF8 is an HFD-containing TAF which forms a histone fold pair with TAF10 in TFIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B5">5</xref>). Biochemical studies revealed that the TFIID complex is assembled in a step-wise manner, first forming a stable core complex consisting of TAF5, TAF6-TAF9 and TAF4-TAF12. This core is then bound by TAF2 associated with the TAF8-TAF10 heterodimer, forming the 8TAF complex. Next, TBP and the remaining TAFs join the 8TAF complex, to form holo-TFIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B7">7</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies performed in yeast show comprehensively that TFIID is recruited to almost all promoters and is required for the transcription of all Pol II transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B8">8</xref>). In agreement, individual yeast TAFs are essential for viability. Similarly, germ line knock-out of several TFIID subunits in mouse (<italic>Taf7, Taf8, Taf10</italic> and <italic>Tbp</italic>) results in early embryonic lethality around E4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B9">9–12</xref>), suggesting that these mammalian TFIID subunits are absolutely essential for blastocyst viability and early development. Furthermore, conditional deletion of <italic>Taf4</italic> or <italic>Taf10</italic>, in embryonic keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B14">14</xref>), deletion of <italic>Taf10</italic> in embryonic liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B15">15</xref>), or ablation of <italic>Taf7</italic> in CD4<sup>–</sup>CD8<sup>–</sup> thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B9">9</xref>) compromises the viability of the mutant cells, suggesting that these TFIID subunits play an essential role in transcription in these cell types.</p>
<p>Curiously, however, deletion of <italic>Taf10</italic> in postnatal liver resulted in a less dramatic phenotype compared with the lack of <italic>Taf10</italic> during embryogenesis, with mild effect on transcription of liver genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B15">15</xref>). Similarly, in adult mouse keratinocytes, deletion of <italic>Taf10</italic> had no effect on epidermal function and no apparent effect on transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B13">13</xref>). Also, mouse CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells lacking <italic>Taf7</italic> appear to be viable with no apparent effect on transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B9">9</xref>). Together these animal studies demonstrate that many cell types absolutely require the canonical TFIID complex for transcription and survival; however, certain cell types are seemingly unaffected by loss of TFIID subunits. How and why these transcription regulatory differences occur amongst different cell types of embryonic and/or adult origin is not understood.</p>
<p>Several different human TFIID subunit coding genes (<italic>TBP</italic>, MIM: 600075; <italic>TAF1</italic>, MIM: 313650; <italic>TAF2</italic>, MIM: 604912; <italic>TAF6</italic>, MIM: 602955; and <italic>TAF13</italic>, MIM: 600774) have been implicated in human diseases including many with neurological outcomes and intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B16">16–28</xref>). A polyglutamine expansion in TBP has a well-characterized gain of function effect resulting in a neurodegenerative disorder, spinocerebellar ataxia-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B28">28</xref>). In contrast, most of the other reported mutations in genes encoding TFIID subunits are recessive missense mutations in different TAFs found in patients with intellectual disability and various degree of developmental delay and microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B28">28</xref>). The outcome of these mutations on TFIID structure and function was not assessed in detail, but it can be expected that they cause, to a variable degree, a partial loss of function of the corresponding protein and potentially of TFIID.</p>
<p>In the present study, we identified a homozygous splice site mutation in <italic>TAF8</italic> in a patient presenting with intellectual disability, developmental delay and mild microcephaly. The mutation resulted in a frame shift changing the C-terminus of TAF8. The mutant TAF8 protein was undetectable by either western blot analysis or mass spectrometry in cell extracts as well as in TAF-containing complexes purified from the patient fibroblasts. We show that TFIID assembly is impaired in the patient fibroblasts, but astonishingly, there was no significant reduction of the genome-wide RNA Pol II occupancy, elongation rates and pre-mRNA synthesis.</p>

<title>Intellectually disabled child identified with a <italic>TAF8</italic>: c.781–1G &gt; A mutation</title>
<p>A girl, first seen at 15 months of age, presented with severe global developmental delay and intellectual disability. She was born to non-consanguineous 15- and 17-year-old Hispanic parents after an uncomplicated term pregnancy. Growth parameters have been at –4–5 SD for height and weight and –2 SD for head circumference. Her development has been severely delayed with smiling by 3–4 months and rolling at a year. At age 4.5 years she cannot sit or speak. She has developed progressive spasticity and equinovarus foot deformities. However, she does not have seizures and her general health is reasonably good without intercurrent hospitalizations. Her craniofacial findings include brachycephaly, a mildly short forehead, a tented mouth, mild left sided ptosis and a long philtrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Her hands and feet are unremarkable except for the progressive deformities of her feet.

<p>Extensive genetic evaluation revealed a normal chromosomal SNP microarray without excessive homozygosity, normal metabolic studies including glycosylated transferrin, lactate, acylcarnitine profile, very long chain fatty acids and urine organic and plasma amino acids. Two MRI’s have revealed mild microcephaly, reduced myelination, a small cerebellar vermis and partial absence of the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Exome sequencing revealed a homozygous splice site variant in <italic>TAF8</italic> [NC_000006.12: g.42077099G &gt; A (NM_138572.2: c.781–1G &gt; A)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), whereas no other mutation or variant in genes possibly associated with the phenotype could be identified. Both parents were found to be heterozygous for the same variant. This change was observed in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) in the heterozygous state in ten individuals, including five of Hispanic origin, out of 277264 alleles.</p>

<italic>TAF8</italic>: c.781–1G &gt; A variant generates a cryptic splice site resulting in a frame shift in the <italic>TAF8</italic> mRNA</title>
<p>As the <italic>TAF8</italic>: c.781–1G &gt; A mutation in the 3′ end of intron 7 of the <italic>TAF8</italic> gene occurred in a predicted splice acceptor site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), we analyzed the consequences of this mutation on <italic>TAF8</italic> mRNA and protein. To determine the outcome of the mutation, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses were performed on RNA extracted from control and patient fibroblasts using a combination of primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</xref>). These analyses excluded skipping of exon 8 or intron 7 retention (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1A and B</xref>). Sequencing of a cDNA fragment generated by RT-PCR using primers annealing in exons 7 and 8 revealed that a cryptic splice acceptor site, one base pair downstream of the original one, was utilized instead of the original splice acceptor site, in the patient fibroblasts. As a result, exon 8 was missing the first G nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F1">Fig. 1C and D</xref>), causing a frame shift. Identical results were observed when the samples were treated with emetine, a non-sense mediated decay inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B29">29</xref>), confirming that this cryptic acceptor site is exclusively used in the mutant fibroblasts. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out on mutant and control cDNA, using primers amplifying the junction between exon 2 and 3, which revealed that the abundance of the mutant <italic>TAF8</italic> mRNA was mildly reduced by about 30% in the patient cells. This mild reduction is likely caused by non-sense mediated decay, because treatment with emetine restored normal levels of <italic>TAF8</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F1">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>The <italic>TAF8:</italic> c.781–1G &gt; A gene encodes a highly unstable protein lacking the C-terminal nuclear localization signal</title>
<p>The amino acid sequence produced from the mutant <italic>TAF8</italic> cDNA was predicted using an <italic>in silico</italic> translation tool. Loss of the first G nucleotide in exon 8, results in a frame shift, affecting the final 50 amino acids of the ‘wild-type’ (WT) TAF8 protein, creating a different C-terminus in the mutant TAF8 protein and a premature stop codon encoded in the 8th exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In the WT TAF8 sequence, the stop codon is in the last 9th exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The region encompassing the TAF8 HFD, which is required for its pairing with TAF10, is upstream of the frame-shift and is therefore unaffected in the mutant TAF8 protein. The C-terminal region of the WT TAF8 contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B30">30</xref>), which is lost in the predicted mutant TAF8 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). WT TAF8 protein has a predicted molecular weight of 34.3<bold> </bold>kDa, but migrates around the 43<bold> </bold>kDa position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B5">5</xref>). To detect the endogenous mutant TAF8 protein, whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared from control and mutant fibroblasts using two different extraction methods (see Materials and Methods) and were subjected to western blot analysis with two different polyclonal anti-TAF8 antibodies (pAb 3477 and 3478), which were generated against the entire TAF8 protein. Unexpectedly, mutant TAF8 protein was not detected in patient fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F2">Fig. 2B and C</xref> lanes 2 and 3), irrespective of mutant <italic>TAF8</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the anti-TAF8 pAbs are unable to detect the mutant TAF8 protein because of its unique carboxyl terminus, we generated recombinant baculoviruses expressing the mutant TAF8 protein fused to an N-terminal FLAG tag. The anti-TAF8 pAb readily detected the mutant FLAG-TAF8 fusion protein when highly over-expressed in <italic>Sf9</italic> insect cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F3">Fig. 3A</xref>).

<p>These results suggest that the mutant TAF8 protein, as compared with WT, may be less stable and prone to degradation in patient cells. To verify the stability of the mutant TAF8 in a different cellular system, first insect <italic>Sf9</italic> cells were infected with baculoviruses expressing either FLAG-tagged WT, or mutant TAF8. When identical total protein amounts from both WT and mutant TAF8 expressing cells were analyzed by western blot, the mutant TAF8 protein was hardly detectable, although high levels of WT TAF8 were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 4 with 5 and 6). Importantly, however, both WT and mutant TAF8 expressing Sf9 cells contained comparable amounts of <italic>TAF8</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), suggesting that the altered final 50 C-terminal amino acids lead to instability of the mutant TAF8 protein. Secondly, to determine whether the mutant <italic>TAF8</italic> mRNA is translated into protein at a similar rate as the WT <italic>TAF8</italic> mRNA, we generated a single cassette system which co-expresses FLAG-tagged WT, or mutated TAF8 proteins, together with FLAG-green fluorescent protein (GFP), separated by the P2A ‘self-cleaving’ 22 amino acid peptide. Importantly, the P2A sequence mediates ribosome-skipping, enabling the generation of equal amounts of two separate peptide products from a single mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B32">32</xref>). When the WT FLAG-TAF8 was expressed with FLAG-GFP from the same cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F3">Fig. 3D</xref>), using a baculovirus expression system in insect cells, approximately equal amount of the two proteins were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F3">Fig. 3E</xref>, lane 3). However, in good agreement with our earlier results, when the mutated FLAG-TAF8 was expressed with FLAG-GFP from the same cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F3">Fig. 3D</xref>), the mutated FLAG-TAF8 was hardly detectable, although the FLAG-GFP, produced from the same mRNA, was readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F3">Fig. 3E</xref>, lane 4). These results unequivocally demonstrate that the mutated TAF8, containing the unrelated 50 C-terminal amino acids, is intrinsically unstable.</p>
<p>Degradation of the mutant TAF8 protein could be mediated by the proteasome. In order to test this hypothesis, patient and control fibroblasts were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 12 or 18<bold> </bold>h, and then western blot analysis was conducted. In untreated samples, the WT TAF8 protein was readily detected, although the mutant TAF8 protein was not. However, in the patient fibroblasts treated with MG132, a protein, smaller than the WT TAF8 protein was detected, likely corresponding to the mutant TAF8 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). These results suggest that degradation of the mutant TAF8 protein is likely carried out, at least partially, by the proteasome.</p>
<p>Together these results show that the <italic>TAF8: c.781–1G &gt; A</italic> mutation generates a protein with a unique C-terminus that is prone to degradation, causing an apparently complete loss of function of TAF8, further indicating that <italic>TAF8: c.781–1G &gt; A, p.Glu261Argfs*38</italic> is most likely the causative mutation in this patient.</p>

<title>Ablation of mouse TAF8 protein in embryonic stem cells results in cell death caused by transcriptional defects</title>
<p>The human patient fibroblasts lacking any detectable TAF8 protein were apparently healthy. Thus, we decided to investigate mouse cells in which TAF8 protein elimination can be induced by <italic>Taf8</italic> knock-out. Mouse blastocysts lacking <italic>Taf8</italic> die very early during development, at around embryonic day 4.0 (E4.0), because of apoptosis in the inner cell mass (ICM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B12">12</xref>). To be able to monitor the direct consequences of inducible TAF8 protein ablation, we used <italic>Taf8</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>: Rosa26-CreERT2 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), in which <italic>Taf8</italic> deletion can be induced by the addition of 4-hydroxy Tamoxifen (4-OH) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2A</xref>). Cells were seeded at a density of 8<bold> </bold>×<bold> </bold>10<sup>5</sup> cells per well and every second day, live and dead cells were counted, then 8<bold> </bold>×<bold> </bold>10<sup>5</sup> cells were reseeded. After 8 days of treatment, there was a massive reduction in the number of live cells, and an increase in dead cells, in the <italic>Taf8</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>: Rosa26-CreERT2 cultures treated with 4-OH tamoxifen, as compared with control cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F4">Fig. 4A–C</xref>). The cell death observed in the tamoxifen treated <italic>Taf8</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup>: Rosa26-CreERT2 mESCs correlated with a gradual increase in the deletion of the <italic>Taf8</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2B</xref>) and a gradual depletion of TAF8 protein, with no TAF8 protein detected after day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).

<p>Next, we wanted to determine if TAF8 depletion causes global transcriptional defects. As steady-state mRNA levels can be buffered by modulation of mRNA decay, especially in situations where Pol II transcription is globally impaired [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B34">34</xref>) and references therein], we measured newly synthesized pre-mRNA using primers that amplify an intron–exon boundary in unspliced pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA transcript abundance was normalized to the RNA Pol I transcribed 45S pre-rRNA, which is not affected by loss of <italic>Taf8</italic>. For all tested genes, the abundance of pre-mRNAs was reduced by about 2-fold upon TAF8 depletion, suggesting a global defect in Pol II transcription in the absence of TAF8. Together, these experiments show that mESCs die in the absence of mouse TAF8, similarly to the <italic>in vivo Taf8</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup> blastocyst phenotype reported by Voss et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B12">12</xref>], and our preliminary transcriptional analysis suggests that a global decrease in PIC formation correlates with cell death.</p>

<title>The lack of detectable human TAF8 protein dramatically alters the assembly of the TFIID complex in patient fibroblasts</title>
<p>As the patient fibroblasts did not present any obvious phonotype when compared with control fibroblasts, we next assessed if TFIID integrity was affected in the cells harboring the <italic>TAF8:</italic> c.781–1G &gt; A mutation. To this end, WCEs were prepared from control and TAF8 mutant fibroblasts and subjected to immunoprecipitations (IPs) using anti-TAF7, anti-TBP or anti-TAF10 antibodies to capture the TAF7-, TBP- or TAF10-containing complexes. The abundance of the TFIID subunits tested was similar in the WCEs from control and patient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F5">Fig. 5A–C</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). Likewise, the amount of bait protein captured by the corresponding antibody was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F5">Fig. 5A–C</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). However, in complexes purified using either anti-TAF7, anti-TBP or anti-TAF10 antibodies, the levels of several of the tested TFIID subunits was markedly reduced in the patient fibroblasts when compared with intact TFIID complexes purified from control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F5">Fig. 5A–C</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 4).

</fig>
<p>To detect potential very low levels of mutant TAF8 protein and additional TFIID subunits with a higher sensitivity and in a more quantitative way, anti-TAF10 immunopurified complexes were analyzed by matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry. To be able to compare the composition of complexes purified from control and <italic>Taf8</italic> mutant cells, normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) values were calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B35">35</xref>). Although all the known TFIID subunits were identified by mass spectrometry analysis of TAF10-containing complexes isolated from control fibroblasts, we did not detect any TAF8 peptides from the patient cells. We also did not detect TAF1, TAF3, TAF11, TAF13 and TBP, which are supposed to be present in a functional module of TFIID, which does not contain the TAF8/10 histone fold pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B6">6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S2</xref>). Moreover, the bait-normalized anti-TAF10 immunopurification performed on patient cells identified eight TFIID subunits (TAF2, TAF4, TAF5, TAF6, TAF7, TAF9/9b and TAF12) with significantly less peptide counts than detected in the control sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). It should be noted that the overall peptide counts were rather low, likely owing to the overall low level of TFIID subunits in fibroblasts relative to other cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S3</xref>). Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that low levels of mutant TAF8 protein are present in the TFIID complexes purified with anti-TAF10 antibodies, but the levels were below the detection limit.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results indicate that in the fibroblasts harboring the <italic>TAF8:</italic> c.781–1G &gt; A mutation, the lack of detectable mutant TAF8 results in TFIID disassembly to partial TAF-containing complexes, in spite of the fact that the abundance of TFIID subunits (with the exception of TAF8 protein) in the input extracts seem to be unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F5">Fig. 5A–C</xref>). Because of the crucial role of TFIID in transcription initiation and during early embryonic mouse development, these observations together offer a likely causative explanation for the homozygous <italic>TAF8:</italic> c.781–1G &gt; A mutation in the patient phenotype.</p>

<title>A defective TFIID complex does not cause a global reduction of the genome-wide RNA Pol II occupancy and elongation rates</title>
<p>Because TFIID was disassembled in fibroblasts harboring the <italic>TAF8:</italic> c.781–1G &gt; A mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F5">Fig. 5</xref>), we set out to verify whether the global recruitment of RNA polymerase II to active promoters may also be compromised. To test this possibility, control and patient fibroblasts were subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled to high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), using a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of Pol II (RPB1, hereafter called anti-Pol II ChIP-seq). Anticipating that subtle difference may be present between the Pol II occupancies at promoters in the control and patient fibroblasts, which may be difficult to quantify, we added a consistent trace amount of <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromatin to the human fibroblast chromatin at the beginning of the ChIP procedure. As the antibody used in this experiment recognizes the CTD of both human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> RPB1, the two distinct human chromatin preparations were normalized to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ‘spike-in.’ Surprisingly, Pol II occupancy at selected representative Pol II transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F6">Fig. 6A</xref>), and genome-wide, analyzed by either <italic>K</italic>-means clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F6">Fig. 6B</xref>) or by metagene plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F6">Fig. 6C</xref>), did not change significantly when compared with control cells. Selecting a few representative Pol II-bound promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F6">Fig. 6A</xref>), the ChIP-seq results were validated by ChIP-qPCR. This validation further confirmed the surprising observation that in patient fibroblasts the Pol II occupancy at the selected promoters was not significantly altered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4A</xref>). Thus, in spite of the complete disorganization of holo-TFIID, Pol II occupancy across all transcribed genes did not change dramatically in patient fibroblasts harboring the <italic>TAF8</italic>: c.781–1G &gt; A mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F6">Fig. 6A–C</xref>).

<p>Next, we wanted to determine if Pol II pausing at promoters and/or elongation rates in gene bodies was altered in the patient cells compared with control. To this end we measured the Pol II travelling ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the Pol II occupancy signal at the promoter [from –100 to +300 bp around the transcription start site (TSS)] relative to the Pol II signal in the gene body (from +300 to +2 kb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B37">37</xref>). Because the Pol II ChIP-seq signal in the gene body can be close to background, we clustered the genes on the basis of Pol II signal in their gene body (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4B</xref>), and calculated Pol II travelling ratio [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B37">37</xref>) and see Materials and Methods] for two gene clusters having significant gene body signal. In the first cluster, consisting of 580 genes, the Pol II promoter pausing and gene body signals as well as Pol II travelling ratios were similar between patient and control fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F6">Fig. 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4C</xref>). In cluster 2, consisting of 1102 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4B</xref>), Pol II promoter pausing was slightly decreased and the Pol II signal in the gene body was somewhat higher in patient’s fibroblasts compared with control fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). As a consequence, the Pol II travelling ratio was shifted to the left in patient fibroblasts compared with control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4D</xref>), suggesting that in cluster 2 genes, Pol II was slightly redistributed from promoters to genes bodies in the mutant fibroblasts.</p>

<title>Loss of TAF8 and holo-TFIID complex do not alter mRNA synthesis from selected genes</title>
<p>The lack of obvious changes in the overall distribution of RNA Pol II despite the undetectable mutant TAF8 protein and holo-TFIID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F5">Figs 5 and 6</xref>), suggested that transcription may not be dramatically affected in the patient fibroblasts. To verify this hypothesis, the level of pre-mRNA transcription of randomly selected genes was measured by RT-qPCR. Because steady-state levels of mRNA, determined by assessing total mRNA abundance, are modulated by mRNA decay rates [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B34">34</xref>) and references therein], we measured the abundance of newly synthesized unspliced pre-mRNA relative to the abundance of the newly synthesized RNA polymerase I transcribed 45S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F6">Fig. 6F</xref>). Consistent with the lack of significant Pol II occupancy changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F6">Fig. 6A–E</xref>), we found that the level of transcription of all the tested genes was not affected in the patient fibroblasts as compared with two control fibroblast cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F6">Fig. 6F</xref>). In addition, we tested the abundance of some Pol II transcribed histone mRNAs, snRNA and snoRNAs in patient fibroblasts compared with control fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4E</xref>) and found no significant changes. Together, these results indicate that in the fibroblasts harboring the <italic>TAF8:</italic> c.781–1G &gt; A mutation, on average, genome-wide RNA pol II occupancy, Pol II elongation rates and pre-mRNA transcription are not dramatically impaired compared with control fibroblasts.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we identified a patient with severe intellectual disability and developmental delay, who inherited a homozygous splice site mutation in <italic>TAF8</italic> (c.781–1G &gt; A), encoding a subunit of the general transcription factor TFIID. In the patient fibroblasts, TAF8 protein was undetectable by western blotting and/or mass spectrometry analyses in WCEs as well as in immunopurified TAF-containing complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F2">Figs 2B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B5">5</xref>). The much lower levels of mutant TAF8 compared with WT TAF8 protein in the different recombinant expression systems used, clearly shows that the mutant protein is intrinsically unstable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The identified mutation leads to a seemingly complete loss of TAF8 function, and subsequent disassembly of the TFIID complex. These observations are highly unexpected given the key role attributed to TFIID in transcription. Indeed, in the mouse, germline deletion of <italic>Taf8</italic> results in embryonic lethality at E4.0, because of apoptosis of the pluripotent ICM cells of the blastocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B12">12</xref>). This early lethality demonstrates that in the absence of TAF8 protein mouse blastocysts cannot undergo gastrulation, organogenesis and further embryonic development. Moreover, we also demonstrate here that the inducible deletion of <italic>Taf8</italic> in mESCs leads to cell death and globally affects Pol II transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Mouse and human TAF8 proteins are 95.5% identical, and the TFIID complex as a whole is highly conserved between mouse and human. Although suffering from severe neurological deficits, the child identified in this study is physically mostly healthy and has developed well beyond the stage that one would anticipate if this mutation resulted in complete elimination of the mutated TAF8 protein in all cell types during the early stages of development.</p>
<p>We speculate that the <italic>TAF8</italic> (c.781–1G &gt; A) mutation did not cause a complete loss of <italic>TAF8</italic> function during early embryogenesis and that residual levels of mutated TAF8 could have been sufficient to maintain blastocyst survival and embryo development. In support of this hypothesis, we observed that mESCs with low residual levels of TAF8 protein can survive and divide similarly to controls (see day 4 of 4-OH treatment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F4">Fig. 4B and D</xref>); however, when TAF8 protein is completely lost, mESCs rapidly undergo massive apoptosis. Thus, in the patient cells, low residual TAF8 protein incorporated in limiting amounts of holo-TFIID, and partial TAF-containing complexes lacking TAF8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F5">Fig. 5</xref>) are sufficient to maintain Pol II transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Alternatively, in the patient the mutant TAF8 protein might have been present in higher quantities during embryo development, and/or maybe are higher in different cell types of the patient, to which we had no access. Indeed, it has been recognized that proteins can have different stabilities in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B39">39</xref>), likely owing to the interaction with different factors in the varying cellular environments. Nonetheless, from the experiments carried out on the human mutated <italic>TAF8</italic> patient fibroblasts and by comparison with the effect of a complete loss of TAF8 function in mice, we conclude that the homozygous <italic>TAF8</italic>: c.781–1G &gt; A mutation is the disease causing mutation.

<p>Schematic representation of the TFIID composition within WT, Taf8 KO and patient cells. In WT cells holo-TFIID, containing TBP and 13 TAFs, including WT TAF8, is abundant in cells and drives faithful transcription. In <italic>Taf8</italic> knockout cells, such as the mESCs described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F4">Figure 4</xref> of this study, loss of TAF8 results in impaired TFIID and no transcription. In contrast, in the patient fibroblasts either only partial TAF assemblies form, or the tiny (undetectable) amount of mutant TAF8 protein integrates into a TFIID-like complex. Either, or both of these complexes could mediate Pol II transcription initiation in patinet fibroblasts.</p>

<p>In the patient fibroblasts described in this study, TAF8 protein is not detectable, and TFIID was disassembled. However, recruitment of RNA polymerase II to promoters was not significantly affected on a genome-wide scale. This result together with previous knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B15">15</xref>) suggests that the PIC may exhibit more diversity than commonly thought and warrants further mechanistic investigations to determine the heterogeneity of PIC/TFIID function in different cell types.</p>
<p>Patient fibroblasts were used in this study, and although they were useful for performing biochemical analyses, they fail to explain the patient’s neurological phenotype. Our analyses did not reveal a global defect in Pol II occupancy/transcription, which could have been expected considering the extent of TAF8 depletion and TFIID disassembly. However, it is likely that Pol II transcription is mildly impaired as a result of the <italic>TAF8</italic> mutation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F7">Fig. 7</xref>) leading to subtle changes in gene expression, which may explain some aspects of the patient phenotype when occurring during neurogenesis and brain development. This is supported by our analyses suggesting putative minor changes in Pol II elongation rates (see for example cluster 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy126-F6">Fig. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4</xref>) which should be confirmed by ChIP-seq using antibodies against phosphorylated serine 5 and serine 2 Pol II CTD.</p>
<p>Although many links have been made between mutations in genes encoding TFIID subunits and intellectual disabilities, the outcome of the identified mutations appears different from that of the <italic>TAF8:</italic> c.781–1G &gt; A mutation identified here. This present mutation appears to cause a nearly complete loss of TAF8 protein, whereas all other mutations identified in other <italic>TAF</italic> genes were missense mutations expected to result in only partial loss of function of the corresponding gene product. Homozygous missense mutation and compound heterozygous mutations in <italic>TAF2</italic> were identified in two independent consanguineous families presenting with autosomal recessive intellectual disability associated with microcephaly and thin corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B40">40</xref>). The impact of the <italic>TAF2</italic> mutations on TFIID function was not explored experimentally, but TAF2 is known to interact with TAF8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B7">7</xref>), which could explain the apparent similarities between the <italic>TAF2</italic> and <italic>TAF8</italic> patients. Recently, homozygous <italic>TAF13</italic> missense mutations, identified in two families with mild intellectual disability, growth retardation and microcephaly, were also suggested to affect TFIID structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B25">25</xref>). Missense mutations in <italic>TAF6</italic> were also found associated with intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B16">16</xref>) or an autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B41">41</xref>). Because TAF6 forms part of the TFIID core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B6">6</xref>), it is plausible that small alterations in its structure could impact TFIID assembly. Of note, homozygous missense mutations in <italic>TAF6</italic> were found to be associated with a Cornelia de Lange like syndrome and were reported to affect TFIID assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B42">42</xref>).</p>
<p>Hemizygous missense mutations in the X-linked <italic>TAF1</italic> gene were identified in male patients with a global developmental delay, intellectual disability, facial dysmorphic features, microcephaly and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B23">23</xref>). The authors predicted that the <italic>TAF1</italic> mutations likely disrupted the TAF1–TAF7 interaction, or the TAF1 bromodomain, likely affecting the structure and/or function of TFIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B23">23</xref>). As noted earlier, the clinical phenotypes observed in patients with mutations in several TAFs partially overlap, in particular sharing common features of variable intellectual disability and microcephaly. These similarities suggest that a common molecular mechanism, namely TFIID disruption, results in a secondary variable effect on Pol II transcription in certain, but not all cell types.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our detailed <italic>TAF8</italic> patient study, including biochemical characterization of general transcription complexes by mass spectrometry and genome-wide high throughput ChIP analyses, together with previous less mechanistic reports of patients with mutations in <italic>TAF</italic> genes, demonstrates that perturbed TFIID function is less deleterious for Pol II transcription initiation than originally predicted. Additional studies using animal model systems are needed to further delineate the exact mechanism(s) responsible for the developmental, growth and neurological abnormalities seen in individuals with <italic>TAF</italic> mutations and to understand how cells can survive without holo-TFIID.</p>

<title>Generation of conditional <italic>Taf8</italic> mutant mice and isolation of mESCs</title>
<p>A targeting construct was produced using a 17.6-kb fragment from a C57BL/6-derived BAC (RP23–182C6) containing the entire <italic>Taf8</italic> gene. A <italic>loxP</italic> site was introduced 2.5<bold> </bold>kb 5′ of exon 1 and a neomycin phosphotransferase expression cassette flanked by <italic>FRT</italic> sites also containing a single <italic>loxP</italic> site at the 3′ end was introduced between exons 8 and 9 using the recombineering method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B43">43</xref>). This construct was electroporated into C57BL/6 ESCs, and correctly targeted cell lines were confirmed by Southern blot analysis. PCR genotyping using three oligonucleotides allowed the identification of the <italic>Taf8</italic> exons 1 to 8-deleted allele (<italic>Taf8<sup>–</sup></italic>), the undeleted allele (<italic>Taf8<sup>lox</sup></italic>) and the WT allele (<italic>Taf8<sup>+</sup></italic>) simultaneously.

<p>Confluent plates of <italic>TAF8</italic> mutant and control fibroblasts were harvested and lysed in WCE buffer no.1 (described earlier), and 3<bold> </bold>mg of WCE from each genotype was used for each coimmunoprecipitation. Protein G or A magnetic Dynabeads (Invitrogen 10002D or 10004D) were incubated with 6<bold> </bold>μl of anti-TAF10 antibody (1H8), anti-TAF7 antibody (3475) or anti-GST antibody (15TF21D10) for 2<bold> </bold>h, then unbound antibody was removed with two washes in IP100 buffer (25<bold> </bold>mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 5<bold> </bold>mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 100<bold> </bold>mM KCl, 2<bold> </bold>mM DTT and 1× complete protease inhibitors).

<title>ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR</title>
<p>For each ChIP experiment, a minimum of 20<bold> </bold>×<bold> </bold>15<bold> </bold>cm<sup>2</sup> plates were used per genotype. Approximately 2<bold> </bold>×<bold> </bold>10<sup>6</sup> fibroblast cells were seeded onto each 15<bold> </bold>cm<sup>2</sup> plate, then the following day the fibroblasts were fixed in 1% PFA for 10<bold> </bold>min at room temperature, then the PFA was quenched with glycine at a final concentration of 125<bold> </bold>mM for 5<bold> </bold>min at room temperature.

Primer sequences are detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</xref>. The clustering of the genes according their Pol II density in the –2 to +2 kb regions relative to the TSS was carried out by the seqMINER software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B61">61</xref>). Pol II traveling ratio was calculated as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy126-B37">37</xref>), except that the TSS tag density values in –100 to +300 bp regions for each gene in clusters 1 and 2 were divided by the corresponding gene body tag density values in +300 to 2 kb regions.</p>

<title>Newly synthesized mRNA analysis</title>
<p>Cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted followed by DNase I treatment, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Macherey-Nagel). cDNA was generated with Super Script II (Thermo Fischer Scientific) using random hexamer primers, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To measure genomic DNA contamination in the cDNA preparations, cDNA synthesis reactions were conducted without reverse transcriptase enzyme (–RT). The CP values generated from RT-qPCR with the –RT samples were always &gt;35 cycles, indicating that genomic DNA contamination contribution was negligible. RT-qPCR primers were designed to amplify intron-exon boundaries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</xref>).</p>
