<abstract>
<p>Dinotefuran (DIN) belongs to the neonicotinoids (NNs), a class of globally applied pesticides originally developed to exhibit selective toxicity in insects. However, several reports have
suggested that NNs also exert neurotoxic effects in mammals. We previously demonstrated neurobehavioral effects of DIN on mice under non-stressful conditions. For further toxicity
assessments in the present study, we investigated the effects of DIN on mice exposed to stressful conditions. After subacutely administering a no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) dose of DIN
and/or chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) to mice, we conducted three behavioral tests (<italic>i.e.,</italic> open field test [OFT], tail suspension test [TST] and forced swimming
test [FST]). In addition, serotonin (5-HT) and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) of the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN) and median raphe nuclei (MRN) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) of the ventral
tegmental area and substantia nigra (SN) were evaluated immunohistochemically. A NOEL dose of DIN or CUMS alone increased of the total distance in OFT, decreased or increased the immobility
time in TST or FST, respectively, and increased the positive intensity of 5-HT and TPH2 in the DRN/MRN, and TH in the SN. These changes were suppressed under the conditions of combined
exposure to DIN and CUMS, though the blood corticosterone level was increased depending on the blood DIN values and the presence of CUMS. The present study suggests the multifaceted toxicity
of the neurotoxin DIN.</p>

<body>
<p>Dinotefuran (DIN) belongs to the neonicotinoid (NN) family, a class of neuroactive pesticides chemically similar to nicotine. DIN was launched in 2002 as a third-generation NN, following the
first-generation NNs imidacloprid (IMI), acetamiprid (ACE), nitenpyram (NTP) and thiacloprid (THI) and the second-generation NNs thiamethoxam (TMX) and clothianidin (CTD). The high water
solubility of DIN facilitates its absorption into crops and accounts for its relatively rapid insecticidal effect compared to that of other NNs. Moreover, DIN has a broad insecticidal spectrum
and selective agonistic action for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) of insects, which contributes to efficient pest control and a high degree of crop safety. For these reasons, DIN
is the most widely used NN in Japan. On the other hand, NNs have been reported to have adverse effects on the nervous systems and behaviors of mammals in spite of the mentioned above. The
metabolic fate of NNs in mice has been reported, demonstrating that NNs were delivered to the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Kimura-Kuroda <italic>et al.</italic> revealed
that ACE, IMI and nicotine exerted similar excitatory effects on mammalian nAChRs by using primary cultures of cerebellar neurons from neonatal rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>].
Hirano <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that CTD induces anxiety-related behavior with human-audible vocalization in male mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Moreover, clinical cases of depressive disorder caused by IMI ingestion have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Several reports have suggested the neurotoxicity of the first and second-generation NNs, whereas there are only a few reports of third-generation NN neurotoxicity in mammals. In our previous
study, we examined the effects on mammalian behavior and neuroactivity of subacute exposure to an orally administered, no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) dose of DIN. Locomotor activity,
anxiety-like behavior and behavioral despair are evaluated using a behavioral test such as the open field test (OFT), tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST). Such behaviors in
animals are closely related to the levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) in the brain; for example, according to the monoamine
hypothesis, depletion of these neurotransmitters can induce depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. The biosynthesis of 5-HT and DA are rate-limited by tryptophan hydroxylase 2
(TPH2) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), respectively. DIN increased locomotor activity during the OFT and did not increase the likelihood of behavioral despair during the TST and FST. In mice
under a condition without forced stress, DIN enhanced the intensity of TH positivity in the substantia nigra (SN) but did not decrease the number of 5-HT-positive cells in the dorsal raphe
nuclei (DRN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>]. These results suggested that DIN induces an excited state by perturbing the monoamine system,
unlike the first- and second-generation NNs.</p>
<p>Humans are exposed to various types of daily stress—including social and economic challenges; physical stressors such as noise, heat and cold; and chemical stressors such as drugs and
environmental toxins—all of which can cause neurodevelopmental disorders with chronic exposure. It is thus necessary to conduct toxicity assessments that include daily life stressors among the
experimental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Long-term exposure to various stressors is associated with behavioral changes in experimental animals. The chronic
unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model has been established as a depression model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. Here, we examined the effects of the combined exposure to DIN and
CUMS using three behavioral tests (<italic>i.e.,</italic> OFT, TST and FST), immunohistochemical evaluations of 5-HT, TPH2 and TH, and analyses of the levels of DIN and corticosterone in blood
samples.</p>

<title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<sec>
<title>Experimental animals</title>
<p>Male C57BL/6NCrSlc mice (3 weeks old) were purchased from Japan SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan). All mice were maintained in 40.5 × 20.5 × 18.5 cm individually ventilated cages (Sealsafe Plus Mouse;
Tecniplast, Buguggiate, Italy) under controlled temperature (23 ± 2°C) and humidity (50 ± 10%) conditions and on a 12-hr light/dark cycle in the Kobe University Life-Science Laboratory.
Before DIN administration and CUMS exposure, a period of 1 week was provided to acclimate the mice to the breeding environment with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to a pellet diet (DC-8;
Clea Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and filtered water. This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (permission number: 26-05-07) and was carried out according to the
Kobe University Animal Experimental Regulations.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>DIN administration and CUMS exposure</title>
<p>Water-soluble Arubarin<sup>®</sup> containing 20% DIN (Mitsui Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) was administered to mice via their drinking water for 4 weeks from the time they reached 4 weeks of
age. With reference to the NOEL dose of 550 mg/kg/day in ICR mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>], we divided the mice into six groups (n=6 mice in each group) as follows: DIN-0
(vehicle as control), DIN-500 (500 mg/kg/day) and DIN-2500 (2,500 mg/kg/day) in the presence or absence of CUMS exposure. In the CUMS groups, mice were exposed to 2 of the following 6
stressors each day: 24-hr food deprivation, 24-hr wet bedding, 1-hr restraint stress, lights on overnight, 1-hr cage tilting (45 degrees) and 30-min horizontal cage shaking (80 rpm). Twice a
week, we measured the body weight of each mouse.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Extraction and analysis of DIN in blood samples</title>
<p>A 100-<italic>µl</italic> aliquot from a whole blood sample was fortified with 100 <italic>µl</italic> of a deuterium-labeled DIN standard (dinotefuran-d3, 100 ppb). Three
m<italic>l</italic> of 1% formic acid in acetonitrile was added to the sample for protein precipitation. The sample was vortexed for 3 min and then centrifuged at 10,000G for 10 min. The
supernatant was collected and supplemented with 3-m<italic>l</italic> methanol for the second extraction. The mixture was then vortexed for 3 min and centrifuged at 10,000G for 10 min, and
the methanol extract (supernatant) was collected. The two extracts (supernatants) were combined and subjected to the solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure. Specifically, the extracts were
passed through a serially connected phospholipid remover (InertSep<sup>TM</sup>, 100 mg/3 m<italic>l</italic>; GL Science, Tokyo, Japan) and a primary-secondary amine (PSA) cartridge
(InertSep<sup>TM</sup>, 500 mg/6 m<italic>l</italic>; GL Science) which had been preconditioned with 5 m<italic>l</italic> of acetonitrile. The analytes were subsequently eluted from the
cartridges using 5 m<italic>l</italic> of acetone. The eluates were concentrated to dryness using a centrifugal concentrator (CVE-200D with UT-2000; EYELA, Tokyo, Japan) and reconstituted
with 100-<italic>µl</italic> cotinine-d3 solution (100 ppb). Finally, the extracts were transferred into vials for the LC-MS/MS analysis.</p>
<p>The LC-ESI/MS/MS instrument (Shimadzu 20 A series with LCMS8040; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was equipped with a Cadenza column CD-C18 (150 × 3 mm) (Imtakt, Kyoto, Japan) for sample analyses.
The HPLC solvents A and B consisted of 0.1% formic acid and 10-mM acetic acid in water, and 0.1% formic acid and 10-mM acetic acid in methanol, respectively, with an initial solvent B
concentration of 20%, and were applied with the following gradient: t=0 to 2 min, keep 20% solvent B; t=2 to 11 min, gradient from 20% to 95% solvent B; t=11 to 13 min, keep 95% solvent B.
The column oven temperature and flow rate were 45°C and 0.5 m<italic>l</italic>/min, respectively. Multiple reaction monitoring for mass spectrometry was programmed as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl_001">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) used for mass spectrometry</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Target neonicotinoids</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">MRM</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Polarity for ESI</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Dinotefuran</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">203.0&gt;129.1</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">+</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Dinotefuran-d3</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">206.0&gt;132.3</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">+</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>ESI: electrospray ionization.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>, and the recovery of dinotefuran-d3 standard was confirmed to be &gt;70%. Analytical reproducibility was confirmed with a relative standard deviation of &lt;10% for all
detected compounds. The analytes were quantitated using external standard methods, and calibration curves were generated for each analyte at five calibration points (0.05, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375
and 0.5 mg/<italic>l</italic>). Linearity of the calibration curves was found above R<sup>2</sup>=0.998.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Measurement of corticosterone in plasma</title>
<p>Plasma corticosterone levels were determined using commercially available ELISA kits (501320; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) according to the procedure recommended by the
manufacturer. The antibody in the kit specifically reacts with corticosterone and has less than 1% cross-reactivity with other adrenal hormones (<italic>e.g</italic>., aldosterone and
cortisone). The absorbance was read at 405 nm using a microplate reader (Model 680; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The levels of corticosterone were determined by comparing samples to the
standard curve generated with the kit.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Open field test (OFT)</title>
<p>OFT was conducted during the light phase 33 days after the beginning of DIN administration and CUMS exposure. The mouse was placed on the corner of the open field (60 × 60 × 40 cm) (Tom
Products, Tokyo, Japan) with LED illumination. Animals with higher levels of locomotor activity show longer total distance of locomotion, and the more anxious animals showed a shorter
duration spent in the center square. All of the mouse’s activities were recorded by a video camera for the subsequent 10 min. Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD,
USA) was used to analyze the total distance traveled and the time spent in the center square (30 × 30 cm), which are considered to represent locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior,
respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Tail suspension test (TST)</title>
<p>TST was performed 34 days after the beginning of DIN administration and CUMS exposure; the protocol was a modified version of that described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. Inside of a white box, each mouse was suspended 60 cm above the surface of a table by a piece of plastic tape attached to the tail about 1 cm from the tip; the other end of
the piece of tape was pierced and attached to a hook at the top of the box. The presence of immobility behaviors during TST is considered to reflect behavioral despair. The mouse was
considered “immobile” once it had become completely motionless. After a 2-min acclimatization period, the time from onset of immobility was recorded from a side-view video camera for 4 min.
The percentage of time spent immobile during this 4-min period was calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Forced swimming test (FST)</title>
<p>FST was performed 35 days after the beginning of DIN administration and CUMS exposure; the protocol was a modified version of that described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. The mouse was placed in an acrylic cylinder (40 cm in height, 20 cm in diameter; Tom Products) containing 20-cm-deep water kept at 23–25°C. The presence of immobility
behaviors during FST is considered to reflect behavioral despair. The mouse was considered “immobile” when it remained floating in the water, except for movements needed to keep its head
above the water to breathe. After a 2-min acclimatization period, the time spent immobile was recorded from a side-view video camera for 4 min. The percentage of time spent immobile during
this 4-min period was calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Tissue preparation and immunohistochemical analysis</title>
<p>Mice were euthanized 36 days after the beginning of DIN administration and CUMS exposure, and brains were excised, weighed and embedded in paraffin in the same manner as previously reported
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. Serial sections of each brain were then cut at 10-<italic>µ</italic>m thickness on a sliding microtome (SM2000R; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar,
Germany) and mounted on slide glasses (521611; Muto Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) precoated with 2% 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan) after being washed
with 1% Tween-20. All sections were stored at −30°C until use in the following steps. To detect 5-HT and TPH2 in the DRN and median raphe nuclei (MRN), and TH in the SN and ventral tegmental
area (VTA), we performed immunohistochemistry according to the protocol described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. The combinations of blocking reagents and antibodies
used for the detection of each protein by immunohistochemistry are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl_002">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Combination of blocking reagents and antibodies used for immunohistochemistry</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Detection</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Blocking reagent</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Primary antibody</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Secondary antibody</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">5-HT</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">Blocking One Histo</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal antibody against 5-HT</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">EnVision+ System-HRP Labeled Polymer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">(Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">(20080, 1:80,000)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">Anti-Rabbit</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">(ImmunoStar, Hudson, NJ, USA)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">(Dako, Glostrup, Denmark)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1" valign="top"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">TPH2</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">Blocking One Histo</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal antibody against TPH2</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">EnVision+ System- HRP Labeled Polymer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">(Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">(PA1-778, 1:4,000)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">Anti-Rabbit</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">(Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">(Dako, Glostrup, Denmark)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1" valign="top"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">TH</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">Blocking reagent A and B</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">Mouse monoclonal antibody against TH</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">Histofine MAX-PO (M)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">(Nichirei Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">(MAB318; 1:500)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">(Histofine Simple Stain system)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"></td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">(Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">(Nichirei Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>5-HT: serotonin, TPH2: tryptphan hydroxylase 2, TH: tyrosine hydroxylase.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>.

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Levels of exposure concentrations to DIN in the human body have risen steadily over the past 20 years in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. Quite recently, reports from
scientific organizations such as the World Health Organization/the United Nations Environment Programme and the American Academy of Pediatrics have suggested a causal relationship between
pesticide exposure and developmental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. Moreover, humans are chronically exposed to social,
physical and non-pesticidal chemical stressors. These exposures to stress are thought to be related to psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder
and anxiety disorder. It is possible that humans suffer the consequences of developmental disorders after unknowingly having been exposed to DIN in concert with other stressors in daily
life.</p>
<p>The present study employed non-invasive administration methods to examine the combined effects of subacute exposure to NOEL doses of DIN and CUMS on behaviors and monoaminergic systems in
developing male mice. The results in this study are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_007">Fig. 7.</xref><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig_007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 7.</label><caption><p>The summary of the results of (A) behavioral tests and (B) immunohistochemical analyses.

<p>The detection of DIN in the blood confirms that only the DIN-administrated group was exposed to DIN in a dose-dependent manner. Also, the level of DIN in blood was higher in the DIN-2500+CUMS
group than in the DIN-2500 group. A previous study reported that stress reduced circulating nicotine levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>], but in the present study, DIN—which is
chemically similar to nicotine—was increased in the animals exposed to CUMS. Further research is needed to determine what caused the difference in the effects of stress on circulating levels
of nicotine and DIN. Moreover, the levels of corticosterone increased with DIN in dose dependent manner and/or CUMS. This result suggests that DIN chronically acted in mice as a chemical
stressor.</p>
<p>The locomotor activity was significantly increased and the mean anxiety behavior was decreased by CUMS. The increase of locomotor activity and the decrease of anxiety behavior were suppressed
in both the DIN-500+CUMS and DIN-2500+CUMS groups. The mean locomotor activity of all groups exposed to CUMS was higher than that of the corresponding groups lacking CUMS exposure. These
results are supported by previous studies in which chronic mild stress induced hyperactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>] and early life stress induced attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder like behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>] in a rodent model.</p>
<p>The mean percentage of immobility was decreased in the TST and increased in the FST by CUMS. The decrease in TST was suppressed in the DIN-500+CUMS group, but not in the DIN-2500+CUMS group.
The increase in FST was suppressed in both the DIN-500+CUMS and DIN-2500+CUMS groups. A previous study reported that nicotine administration suppressed depression-like behaviors in the FST
induced by chronic unpredictable stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Since DIN and nicotine share similar mechanisms of action, similar results may have been observed in the
present study. Although both the TST and FST are used in studies examining the effects of antidepressants, the effects of DIN on the percentage of immobility time of mice differed between the
two tests. The cause for this discrepancy might be differences between the neuronal mechanisms involved in the TST and FST. For instance, sensitivity to the antidepressant effects of 5-HT
uptake inhibitors is greater in the TST than in the FST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Monoamine metabolism changes are known to follow the FST, but not the TST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. Several 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> agonists generally decrease the duration of immobility in the FST, whereas they increase the duration of immobility in the TST
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The positive intensities of 5-HT and TPH2 immunostaining were increased in both the DIN-500 and DIN-2500 groups, as compared with those in the DIN-0 group. The excitability of 5-HT neurons in
the DRN is known to be increased by presynaptic α4β2 nAChR on glutamatergic neuronal endings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>], and nAChR partial agonists have been shown to augment
the antidepressant effects of 5-HT medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. DIN might act on presynaptic α4β2 nAChR on glutamatergic neuronal endings, which induces the
increase of the excitability of 5-HT neurons. Moreover, the positive intensities of 5-HT and TPH2 immunostaining in the DRN and MRN were higher in the DIN-0+CUMS group than the DIN-0 group.
These results are supported by the previous report which chronic stress increased 5-HT in the rat brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. The increases of the positive intensities of
5-HT and TPH2 immunostaining in the DIN-500, DIN-2500 and DIN-0+CUMS groups were suppressed in the DIN-500+CUMS and DIN-2500+CUMS groups.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that there were two possible causes for these results: the reduction of nAChR on presynaptic glutamatergic neurons and negative feedback of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
neurons to the 5-HT neurons. Chronic immobilization stress is known to reduce the expression of nAChRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Also, CHRNA7 coding the α7 subunit of nAChRs
contains a stress hormone response element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. The activation of 5-HT neurons by DIN might be decreased following the change of the response of nAChR
by CUMS. The 5-HT nerve activity in the DRN is suppressed by many intervening GABA neurons from various parts of the brain, such as the medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and
hypothalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. The exposure to both DIN and CUMS strongly activated the 5-HT neurons, which may have caused
negative feedback in 5-HT neurons by activating the GABA neurons.</p>
<p>The positive intensities of 5-HT and TPH2 immunostaining in the DIN-2500+CUMS group were higher than those in the DIN-500+CUMS group. This finding can be attributed to the desensitization of
nAChRs, which generally accounts for a loss of response after prolonged or repeated application of stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Exposure to nicotine for a long period
of time also causes desensitization of nAChRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Here, reduced effects of DIN were observed, which in turn would be expected to cause weaker negative
feedback to the 5-HT neurons in the DRN in the DIN-2500+CUMS group than those in the DIN-500+CUMS group.</p>
<p>The positive intensity of TH immunostaining was decreased in the VTA in the DIN-500 and DIN-2500 groups and increased in the SN in the DIN-500 and DIN-2500 groups, as compared with those in
the DIN-0 group. The following facts were reported that nicotine increases the expression of the TH gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>] and CTD directly injected into the brain
evokes a striatal DA surge via nAChRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. DIN might activate DA neurons in the SN like nicotine or CTD. The positive intensities of TH immunostaining
were higher in the SN and were lower in the VTA in the DIN-0+CUMS group than the DIN-0 group. These results are supported by those of previous reports; chronic stress induced loss of
dopaminergic neurons in the VTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>] and chronic corticosterone enhancement aggravated SN neurodegeneration in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The activity of midbrain DA neurons is thought to be strongly regulated by 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. The high positive intensity of TH
immunostaining was seen in the SN but not in the VTA in the group with high positive intensity of 5-HT immunostaining in the DRN. These results may be explained by the fact that DRN
stimulation differentially modulates DA neurons in the SN and VTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Moreover, nicotine exposure can increase sensitivity to stress and promote
long-lasting activity in DA neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>].</p>
<p>DIN and CUMS may have canceled the effects of each exposure by combining different mechanisms of action: Tanida <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that mixed exposure to environmental
toxins with different mechanisms of action (bisphenol A, di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<italic>p</italic>-dioxin) counteracts the effects of single exposure on
mouse midbrain DA nuclei. They hypothesized that the results were caused by thyroid hormones and/or aryl hydrocarbon receptor-related mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>].</p>
<p>The present study showed that DIN changed the corticosterone levels, the behaviors and neurotransmitter levels of mice, even at the NOEL dose. On the other hand, some reports of NNs show the
different results from the present study. TMX has been shown to significantly inhibit locomotor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>], CTD was shown to significantly increase
anxiety-like behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>] and the levels of 5-HT, GABA and DA have been shown to be significantly reduced by IMI administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. The effects on locomotor activities, the anxiety-like behaviors and the neurotransmitters of mice were observed to vary according to the type of NNs.</p>
<p>To summarize the above, the changes in behavior and monoaminergic neuronal activity observed with a NOEL dose of DIN or CUMS were suppressed by combined exposure to DIN and CUMS. On the other
hand, the blood corticosterone level was increased depending on the DIN dose level. The present study suggests that DIN exhibits multifaceted toxicity, disrupting both neurotransmission and
stress hormone secretion.</p>
