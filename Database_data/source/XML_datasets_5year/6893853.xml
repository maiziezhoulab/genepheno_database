<p id="P3">The mechanisms that extend lifespan in humans are poorly understood. Here
we show that extended longevity in humans is associated with a distinct
transcriptome signature in the cerebral cortex characterized by downregulation
of genes related to neural excitation and synaptic function. In the model system
<italic>C. elegans</italic>, neural excitation increases with age and
inhibition of excitation globally, or in glutamatergic or cholinergic neurons,
increases longevity. Furthermore, longevity is dynamically regulated by the
excitatory-inhibitory balance of neural circuits. The REST transcription factor
is upregulated in humans with extended longevity and represses
excitation-related genes. Notably, REST-deficient mice exhibit increased
cortical activity and neuronal excitability during aging. Similarly,
loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> REST orthologs
<italic>spr</italic>-3 and <italic>spr-4</italic> elevate neural excitation
and reduce the lifespan of long-lived <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants. In
wild-type worms, <italic>spr-4</italic> overexpression suppresses excitation and
extends lifespan. REST, SPR-3/4 and reduced excitation activate the
longevity-associated transcription factors FOXO1 and DAF-16 in mammals and
worms, respectively. These findings reveal a conserved mechanism of aging
mediated by neural circuit activity and regulated by REST.</p>

<p id="P4">Studies in invertebrate and mammalian models suggest that the nervous system
plays a role in the regulation of aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In the nematode <italic>C.
elegans</italic>, ablation of specific sensory or neurosecretory neurons alters
lifespan <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, and lifespan extension from reduced
insulin/IGF-like signaling can be reversed by restoring function specifically in
neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, whether the
activity state of the nervous system impacts the aging process is unresolved. Here, we
describe a conserved mechanism of aging mediated by global neural activity and regulated
by REST.</p>
<sec id="S1">
<title>Neural excitation and longevity</title>
<p id="P5">Previous studies of the aging human brain have shown dynamic gene expression
changes that distinguish young adults from the aging population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, the recent expansion of human aging
cohorts has increased the statistical power for partitioning the aging population
into subgroups based on transcriptome profiling. To gain insight into gene
expression changes in the brain associated with extended human longevity, we
analyzed RNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and microarray data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> from the frontal cortex of aged individuals
with intact cognitive function in three different cohorts. Age-associated genes were
compared between all individuals and Pearson correlation coefficients were derived.
Hierarchical clustering suggested that the aging population partitioned into three
groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">c</xref>). The most significant changes associated with
the extended longevity groups (≥85 versus ≤80 years of age) were
downregulation of neural excitation/synaptic function genes and upregulation of
immune function genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data
Fig. 1d</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Tables 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">6</xref>). This did not change after
adjusting for the presence of amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles in the
ROSMAP cohort (data not shown). Meta-analysis of gene ontology (GO) enrichment in
each cohort indicated that terms related to excitatory, but not inhibitory synaptic
transmission were enriched in the downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). These results suggest that extended human
longevity may be associated with reduced excitatory neurotransmission.</p>
<p id="P6">To explore the neural regulation of longevity, we utilized <italic>C.
elegans</italic>, a well-established model system of aging. Neural excitation in
<italic>C. elegans</italic> was monitored by GCaMP calcium imaging in the
glutamatergic ASH neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. In
wild-type worms, rapid, transient pulses of GCaMP fluorescence indicative of
neuronal excitation were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). Calcium influx in ASH neurons increased
significantly during normal aging from adult day 1-2 to day 12-16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). To determine the effect of decreasing calcium
influx on lifespan, worms were treated with nemadipine, an inhibitor of L-type
calcium channels that reduces neural excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.
1f</xref>). Continuous treatment with nemadipine beginning at adult day 1
significantly extended lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>).
Moreover, incubation of worms with ivermectin, an agonist of invertebrate
glutamate-gated chloride channels, suppressed neural excitation and resulted in a
dose-dependent extension of mean lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.
1h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">i</xref>). Nemadipine and ivermectin
also extended lifespan when administered at day 8 when feeding activity has largely
abated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>), suggesting that
the drugs do not act through caloric restriction. Furthermore, worm motility was
preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Videos
4</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">6</xref>).
These results suggest that global inhibition of neural excitation extends lifespan
in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>
<p id="P7">To explore the neural systems that mediate lifespan, we expressed a
transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> histamine-gated chloride channel (HisCl1) in
different neuronal populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.
Addition of histamine, which is not endogenously produced by worms, activates HisCl1
and inhibits neural excitation. First, we expressed HisCl1 under the control of a
pan-neuronal promoter. Continuous incubation with histamine beginning on adult day 1
or day 8 significantly extended mean lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">i</xref>). There was no effect of histamine on the
lifespan of wild-type worms that did not express HisCl1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 22</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">We next expressed the HisCl1 channel in glutamatergic and cholinergic
neurons, the major excitatory neuronal populations in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.
Repression of excitation in either population robustly extended lifespan whether
initiated at adult day 1 or day 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig.
3c</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">i</xref>). Expression of HisCl1 in GABAergic neurons using an
<italic>unc-47</italic> driver extended lifespan when initiated at day 1, but
reduced lifespan when initiated at day 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended
Data Fig. 3g</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">i</xref>). GCaMP
imaging showed that addition of histamine to <italic>unc-47</italic>: HisCl1 worms
at day 1 resulted in a marked and persistent suppression of excitation in ASH
neurons, which was not observed after addition at day 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3j</xref>). Thus, blockade of GABAergic
neurotransmission early in adult life may result in compensatory downregulation of
excitation in other neuronal populations. Taken together, these results suggest that
continuous or late-life repression of neural excitation in multiple different
neuronal cell populations extends lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>
<p id="P9">To explore the effect of hyperexcitation on lifespan, we suppressed GABAergic
neurotransmission by using RNAi, which would be predicted to be less extensive than
histamine-HisCL1-mediated blockade. When worms were treated with RNAi against the
GABA vesicular transporter <italic>unc-47</italic>, there was a robust increase in
the excitation of ASH neurons and a significant reduction in lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">b</xref>). Thus, the effects of neurotransmission on lifespan are
bidirectional; lifespan is extended by reducing excitation and shortened by
increasing excitation.</p>
<p id="P10">Neural activity can regulate neuropeptide secretion. To address the role of
neuropeptide signaling in lifespan regulation, we evaluated worms with loss-of
function of the <italic>egl-3</italic> proprotein convertase from an
<italic>egl-3</italic> mutation or <italic>egl</italic>-3 RNAi. The
<italic>egl-3</italic> mutants exhibited significant lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). Lifespan extension was
also observed in worms treated with <italic>egl-3</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>), consistent with previous
results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. A similar
extension of lifespan was observed in a glutamatergic loss-of-function
<italic>eat-4</italic> mutant and the synaptic transmission mutant
<italic>unc-13</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig.
4c</xref>). These results suggest that both synaptic neurotransmission and
peptidergic signaling contribute to lifespan regulation.</p>

<sec id="S2">
<title>REST and the modulation of neural excitation in the aging brain</title>
<p id="P11">We have previously demonstrated that the transcriptional repressor REST is
induced in the aging brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.
Genes that were downregulated in the brain in individuals with extended longevity
were enriched for the canonical REST RE1 motif in all three aging cohorts (ROSMAP:
P=5e-12, CommonMind Consortium: P=8e-4, Gibbs: P=1e-2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Tables 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">5</xref>). Moreover, unbiased analysis by
ChIP-seq showed that REST was the most strongly implicated transcription factor in
multiple ENCODE datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Tables 8</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">11</xref>). Furthermore, the downregulated
gene set was highly enriched for neuronal REST target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 12</xref>). Expression of
these downregulated genes, as well as an index of synaptic gene expression, were
inversely related to REST mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.
2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">b</xref>). Furthermore, nuclear REST levels were significantly elevated in
prefrontal cortical neurons in centenarians relative to individuals who were 70-80
years of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Although REST mRNA
expression is upregulated in the brain during aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, increased REST mRNA expression did not
distinguish the extended longevity versus normal aging groups based on
RNA-sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary
Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">3</xref>).
However, for a given level of REST mRNA expression, there is greater gene
downregulation in the extended longevity group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">d</xref>). These
results suggest that REST repressor function is upregulated in the brain in
individuals with extended longevity, resulting in downregulation of genes that
mediate excitation and synaptic function.</p>
<p id="P12">To assess the role of REST as a modulator of neural activity in the aging
mammalian brain, we examined the uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) by PET-CT in the
brains of 18 month old Nestin-Cre:REST<sup>lx/lx</sup> (REST cKO) mice and
littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig.
5e</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. REST cKO
mice showed significantly elevated cortical <sup>18</sup>FDG uptake, indicative of
increased neural activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">e</xref>). Previous studies suggest that REST can
modulate excitability in mouse models of epilepsy induced by kindling or
kainate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. To assess excitability during aging, we
performed electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of REST cKO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 13</xref>). Intermittent
epileptiform discharges were significantly more frequent in 22-month-old REST cKO
mice than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Furthermore,
challenge with the GABA antagonist pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) significantly increased
seizure duration in REST cKO mice relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>), with a trend to increased mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5f</xref>). These results suggest
that REST globally represses neural activity and prevents hyperexcitation in the
aging brain.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Regulation of longevity and neural excitation by <italic>C. elegans</italic> REST
orthologs</title>
<p id="P13">The <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene <italic>spr</italic>-4 is a structural
and functional ortholog of mammalian REST that protects against toxic stressors,
such as reactive oxygen species and amyloid β-protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. To determine if <italic>spr-4</italic>
modulates lifespan, we induced endogenous <italic>spr-4</italic> expression by
utilizing the RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 as a programmable transcription
factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. A
nuclease-deficient variant of Cas9 (dCas9) was fused to the transcriptional
activator VP16 (dCas9::VP64) and stably introduced into <italic>C. elegans</italic>
together with four small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the <italic>spr-4</italic>
promoter. This resulted in a modest elevation of <italic>spr-4</italic> mRNA and
protein expression, and a significant increase in mean lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">d</xref>). Expression of dCas9::VP64 and <italic>spr-4</italic>
sgRNAs in worms with the loss-of-function allele
<italic>spr-4</italic>(<italic>tm465</italic>) did not affect lifespan,
suggesting specificity for <italic>spr-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6e</xref>). Moreover, <italic>spr-4</italic> overexpression
robustly reduced excitation in ASH neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended
Data Fig. 6f</xref>). Thus, <italic>spr</italic>-4 both represses neural
excitation and extends lifespan.</p>
<p id="P14">The forkhead transcription factor DAF-16 is the central downstream target of
the <italic>daf-2</italic>/insulin IGF-like signaling pathway that regulates
lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. RNAi-mediated knockdown of DAF-16 prevented
lifespan extension by <italic>spr-4</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). Furthermore, lifespan extension by
the neural excitation inhibitors nemadipine and ivermectin was also dependent on
<italic>daf-16</italic>, and ivermectin elevates both total and nuclear levels
of DAF-16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">d</xref>). Thus, <italic>daf-16</italic> mediates
lifespan extension by <italic>spr</italic>-4 and neural suppression.</p>
<p id="P15">To further explore the effects of REST orthologs on the
<italic>daf-2</italic>/<italic>daf-16</italic> signaling pathway, we performed
<italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi in wild-type, <italic>spr-3</italic> and
<italic>spr-4</italic> loss-of-function mutants, and an
<italic>spr-4</italic>;<italic>spr-3</italic> double mutant. As previously
shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>,
<italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi extends lifespan by ~50% in wild-type worms.
Mutations of <italic>spr-3</italic>, <italic>spr-4</italic>, or both, significantly
reduced lifespan extension by <italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>). Mutations in
<italic>spr-3</italic> and <italic>spr-4</italic> also reduced the lifespan
extension associated with the loss-of-function
<italic>daf-2</italic>(<italic>e1370</italic>) allele; the greatest reduction
occurred in the <italic>spr-4;spr-3;daf-2</italic> triple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The <italic>spr-3</italic> and
<italic>spr-4</italic> mutants did not affect lifespan in a wild-type background
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8b</xref>), in contrast to a
previous report that suggested a lifespan effect of <italic>spr-3</italic>
mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. These results
suggest that <italic>spr-3</italic> and <italic>spr-4</italic> contribute to the
regulation of lifespan by the insulin/IGF-like signaling pathway in worms.</p>
<p id="P16">We next asked whether the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs
<italic>spr-3</italic> and <italic>spr-4</italic> function in neurons to
regulate lifespan. To address this question, we utilized a <italic>C.
elegans</italic> line in which RNAi was abolished by deletion of the

neurons by a <italic>sid-1</italic> transgene driven by a neuron-specific
promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. These alleles
were crossed into the <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> mutant background, and
RNAi-mediated knockdown of both <italic>spr-3</italic> and <italic>spr-4</italic>
was performed. Neuronal knockdown of SPR-3 and SPR-4 significantly reduced lifespan
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8c</xref>). Thus, neuronal expression of
<italic>spr-3</italic> and <italic>spr-4</italic> contributes to lifespan
extension in the <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant.</p>
<p id="P17">To gain further insight into the effects of <italic>spr-3</italic> and
<italic>spr-4</italic> on <italic>daf-2</italic> function and lifespan, we
performed RNA-seq on wild-type worms and worms with mutations in
<italic>spr-4;spr-3, daf-2</italic>, and <italic>spr-4;3;daf</italic>-2 (triple
mutants) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 14</xref>). The
comparison of triple mutant <italic>spr-4;3;daf-2</italic> worms with single mutant
<italic>daf-2</italic> worms was notable for highly significant transcriptome
changes in GO terms related to neural excitation, signaling and synaptic function
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 15</xref>). Furthermore,
gene expression changes in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants and
<italic>spr-4;3</italic> mutants were overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8e</xref>), and genes downregulated in
<italic>daf-2</italic> mutants but upregulated in the
<italic>spr-4;3;daf-2</italic> triple mutants were enriched for GO terms related
to neural excitation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 16</xref>). These results suggest that repression of
neuronal genes is a conserved regulatory feature of REST and its worm orthologs.</p>
<p id="P18">A central question is whether SPR-3 and SPR-4 affect lifespan by suppressing
neural excitation. GCaMP calcium imaging showed that neural excitation was strongly
suppressed in <italic>daf</italic>-2 mutants both in young adult worms and during
aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8f</xref>). The
<italic>spr-4;3</italic> mutations partially restored neural excitation in

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">3</xref>), but did not increase
excitation in wild-type worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig.
8g</xref>). Suppression of excitation in <italic>daf</italic>-2 mutants was not
mediated by neuronal DAF-16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig.

the lifespan shortening effect of <italic>spr-4;3</italic> mutations in
<italic>daf-2</italic> mutant worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.
4c</xref>). Thus, SPR-3 and SPR-4 contribute to the extreme longevity of
<italic>daf-2</italic> mutant worms by repressing neural excitation.</p>
<p id="P19">To identify the neural systems affected by SPR-4 and SPR-3,
neurotransmitters and neuropeptides were targeted by RNAi in
<italic>spr-4;3;daf-2</italic> triple mutants and d<italic>af-2</italic> single

against signaling through glutamatergic (<italic>eat-4</italic>), cholinergic
(<italic>cha-1/unc-17</italic>) and monoaminergic (<italic>cat-2</italic>)
neurons, and by RNAi to axonal kinesin (<italic>unc-104</italic>) and the proprotein
convertase (<italic>egl-3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>,
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended data Fig. 8i</xref>). These results

<p id="P20">Loss-of-function of <italic>daf-2</italic> extends lifespan through

<sec id="S4">
<title>REST, FOXO1 and Neural Excitation</title>
<p id="P21">We next asked if the association between REST, neural excitation and human
longevity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">c</xref>) might be mediated by a mammalian forkhead transcription
factor orthologous to <italic>C. elegans</italic> DAF-16. REST has been shown to
regulate the expression of FOXO1 in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In the human brain, REST mRNA expression
was positively correlated with FOXO1 expression, but did not correlate with the
expression of other FOXO family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.
5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10a</xref>).
Furthermore, REST and FOXO1 co-localized in neurons of the aging human prefrontal
cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10b</xref>), and nuclear
levels of REST and FOXO1 were strongly positively correlated in all age groups
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P22">To determine whether REST regulates FOXO1 expression in the brain, we
examined REST cKO and littermate control mice. FOXO1 localized predominantly to
cortical neurons, and showed an age-related increase in 18 month old relative to 9
month old control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Age-dependent
induction of nuclear FOXO1 was abolished in REST cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Thus, regulation of forkhead transcription
factors is a conserved feature of REST and its <italic>C. elegans</italic>
orthologs.</p>
<p id="P23">To explore the role of neural excitation in FOXO1 regulation, primary mouse
cortical neuronal cultures were treated with kynurenic acid, a broad spectrum
glutamate receptor antagonist, or with either APV or NBQX, NMDA and AMPA/kainate
receptor antagonists, respectively. Kynurenic acid and NBQX significantly increased
nuclear and total FOXO1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig.
10c</xref>). Thus, FOXO1 is regulated by glutamatergic signaling in mammalian
cortical neurons, paralleling the effect of neural excitation on DAF-16 in
worms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P24">Here we show that extended longevity and cognitive preservation in humans is
associated with coordinate downregulation of genes that mediate excitatory
neurotransmission. In the model system <italic>C.elegans</italic>, an increase in
the activity of excitatory neurons is a normal concomitant of aging. Global
inhibition of neural excitation, or inhibition of specific excitatory neuronal
populations, particularly glutamatergic or cholinergic neurons, resulted in robust
lifespan extension. These findings are consistent with previous studies which showed
that the anticonvulsants ethosuximide and valproic acid can extend lifespan in
<italic>C. elegans</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Moreover, we found that lifespan was
dynamically regulated by the excitatory-inhibitory balance of neural circuits. Thus,
an imbalance between neural excitation and inhibition might degrade neural function
and contribute to the aging process.</p>
<p id="P25">Our findings suggest that REST and the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs
SPR-3/4 regulate aging by reducing neural activity as transcriptional repressors of
synaptic genes. Aging conditional REST-deficient mice exhibit increased cortical
neural activity and hyperexcitability. This is consistent with previous studies in
neuronal cell culture which suggest that REST maintains neural network homeostasis
by buffering changes in neural excitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P26">It is intriguing that REST and neural activity converge with insulin/IGF
signaling to regulate the activity of forkhead transcription factors that play
pivotal roles in lifespan regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. The activation
of <italic>daf-16</italic> by REST orthologs in worms and FOXO1 by REST in humans
might be a mechanism for integration of neural activity with metabolism. We suggest
that activating REST and reducing excitatory neural activity may be an approach to
slowing aging in humans.</p>

Alzheimer’s Disease Center, which are longitudinal, clinical-pathologic
studies of aging, cognitive decline and AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Study

employed in the present study, including a summary score of all 17 tests used as
a measure of global cognition, and separate measures of episodic, semantic, and
working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability. The follow-up rate

Braak (measure of number and distribution of neurofibrillary tangles), CERAD

<title>Immunofluorescence analysis of human brain.</title>
<p id="P28">Immunofluorescence analysis using paraffin-embedded brain sections was
performed in the prefrontal cortex (Broadmann areas 9, 10 and 47).
Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were first deparaffinized in xylene, then
rehydrated with decreasing concentrations of ethanol and placed in water.
Sections then underwent antigen retrieval using the Diva decloaker (BioCare,
USA). They were then washed and blocked with 2% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS
for 1 hr at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in 2% BSA, 0.1%
Triton in PBS. Following overnight incubations, sections were washed three times
with PBS. Secondary antibodies, diluted in 2% BSA, 0.1% Triton in PBS were
either biotin-coupled (1:200, Vector Labs, USA) or coupled to Alexa fluorophores
(1:300, Invitrogen). Sections were incubated with 1% Sudan Black in 80% ethanol,
for 10 minutes, to suppress lipofuscin autofluorescence. Following washes in
PBS, sections were mounted and imaged using confocal microscopy. The following
antibodies have been used for immunolabeling studies: (i) a rabbit polyclonal
IgG recognizing a region between residues 1050 and the C-terminus (residue 1097)
of REST (Bethyl laboratories, IHC-00141); (ii) a goat polyclonal IgG recognizing
the C-terminal region of FOXO1a (LSBio B415, discontinued, replaced with LSBio
1322). To quantify immunofluorescence, images that were randomly acquired in
selected brain regions were analyzed in the Metamorph® image analysis
system. Antigen-expressing areas within each neuron (such as the nucleus) were
selected using the average signal intensity measured. Values were corrected by
subtracting the average slide background intensity (measured outside of cells).
The investigator was blinded to sample origin or diagnosis.</p>
<p id="P29">To assess the relationship between the levels of nuclear REST protein
and FOXO1, we performed confocal immunofluorescence with triple-labeling for
REST, MAP2 and FOXO1. Multiple 40x pictures were acquired (at various locations)
within the prefrontal cortex displaying pyramidal neurons using an Olympus
Fluoview Confocal Microscope. For cases displaying a majority of pyramidal
neurons with very high (or very low) nuclear REST levels, fields were also
included that displayed lower (or higher, respectively) REST levels, to test for
potential correlations between REST and FOXO1. Antigen-expressing areas within
neuronal nuclei were selected using the Metamorph® image analysis system
and the average signal intensity was measured. Values were corrected by
subtracting the average slide background intensity (measured outside of cells).

<title>Conditional REST-knockout mice.</title>
<p id="P30">Animal housing and experimental procedures were approved by the

carrying floxed alleles of REST flanking exon 2 were described
previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. These mice were crossed to
Nestin-Cre transgenic mice (Jackson laboratory; strain No. 003771) to achieve
REST conditional inactivation in the nervous system. The Nes-Cre transgene is in
the C57BL/6J background, and the RESTlx/lx alleles were in a hybrid C57BL/6J and
129Sv/Ev background. The resulting Nestin-Cre:RESTlx/lx conditional knockout
mice (hybrid C57BL/6J and 129Sv/Ev background), referred to as REST cKO, were
born at expected Mendelian ratios, were viable and fertile, and did not display
any visible alterations. The control group included RESTlx/lx and Nes-Cre mice.
Mouse genotyping by PCR was performed using the following primers to amplify a
region in the REST gene flanking exon 2: re08
(5′-CATGCGAGTACTGCCATACCCAAC-3′), re09
(5′-GTGATGGGGCAGTCTTCTGGAGG-3′), and re11
(5′-GGCACACCTTTAATCCTAGCTTC-3′); this allowed the identification
of WT (220 bp), floxed (264 bp) or recombined (375 bp) REST
alleles. The experimental groups included both male and female mice. The REST
cKO and REST+/+ control groups were composed of littermate mice (same genetic
background). Mice were identified by eartag numbers, and were randomly selected
for PET/CT and EEG experiments, as well as histological processing (perfusion,

assess FOXO1 nuclear expression in cortical neurons, coronal brain sections from
WT and REST conditional KO mice (aged 9 or 18 months) were immunolabeled with
FOXO1 and MAP2 antibodies. Cortical neurons (MAP2-positive) were identified and
FOXO1 mean fluorescence intensity in each nucleus was measured using the
Metamorph software. Between 50-100 neuronal nuclei were assessed for FOXO1
expression, and the mean FOXO1 nuclear expression was derived for each animal.

the center of the field-of-view. The data were acquired in 3D mode at the energy
window of 250–700 keV, which yields 4% count sensitivity. For each

(PBST, to prevent sticking), and the worms were stained with DAPI for 10 minutes
at room temperature. The DAPI was removed with a final wash in PBST, and the

within 2 weeks of mounting, and all slides compared with each other were imaged
on the same day, in the same imaging session. Worms were imaged via a 40x
objective with a 2x digital zoom. For every worm, Z-stack image series were
taken at 2 μm step sizes (roughly 13-15 images per series). To quantify
nuclear GFP levels, these Z-stacks were opened in ImageJ (NIH) and flattened
using a maximum intensity Z-stack projection. For pharyngeal nuclei, 3 regions
of interest (ROI) were selected based on DAPI staining of nuclei, on either side
of the pharynx and behind it, encompassing the bulk of the nuclei in that area.
These were then used as the ROIs within which to measure GFP fluorescence, using
the ImageJ intensity measuring tool. Average scores from the ROIs were computed

tracked neurons were manually reviewed and neurons that were poorly tracked
were excluded from analysis. To normalize the fluorescence intensity per
worm we used dF/F0 which was calculated as (F(t)-F0)/F0 where F(t) is the
fluorescence intensity at time t and F0 represents an estimate of the
baseline fluorescence which was calculated as the 0.2 quantile fluorescence
per worm. dF/F0 max intensity was the maximum dF/F0 over the entire
recording (240 frames). For analysis of nemadipine treated worms and for
worms expressing the HisCL channel (and their controls), ROIs were
hand-drawn because the tracking program failed due to either low signal
intensity (nemadipine treated worms) or the inability to distinguish a
confounding GFP signal (HISCL::GFP worms). Some worms were used in multiple

neuropsychiatric illness with neuropsychiatric illness as the reference

publication: sex (factor, 2 levels), RIN (continuous), RIN^2 (continuous),
PMI (continuous), clustered batch (factor, 9 levels), and Institute (factor,
3 levels). The final normalized and adjusted gene expression values were
derived from adding the regression residuals to the estimated effect of the
group level to preserve the effect of the group on expression. These
normalized and adjusted gene expression values were used to perform
gene-gene regression analysis, gene-gene group regression analysis, and

<p id="P92">Normalized and adjusted gene expression values were derived as described
in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S50">section “Gene expression
normalization and covariate adjustment”</xref> with the following
changes. First, the group variable was a factor with levels cogdx1, cogdx2,
cogdx3, cogdx4, cogdx5, and cogdx6 (ROSMAP); control, Schizophrena, Bipolar,
Affective (CommonMind Consortium); or not included (Gibbs). Next, genes were
deemed expressed if ≥10 individuals in the cognitively normal group
(ROSMAP, cogdx1; CommonMind Consortium, control with age&gt;=60) had
≥ 1 counts per million (CPM). Genes not satisfying these criteria were
removed keeping the original library sizes. For the Gibbs cohort, probes were
deemed expressed if ≥10 individuals with age&gt;=55 had Detection
P-value&lt;0.01 and no samples had NA values. Probes not satisfying these
criteria were removed. These were expressed genes used for analysis. This
filtering retained: ROSMAP, 18734 expressed genes; CommonMind Consortium, 19615
expressed genes; Gibbs, 13411 expressed probes. For RNA-seq data, counts were
then normalized using the TMM method in edgeR, and log(CPM) values were
calculated for expression. Finally, age was included as a continuous covariate,
and the effects of group and age were added back to the residuals. Then
cognitively normal aged individuals were selected in each cohort (ROSMAP,
cogdx1; CommonMind Consortium, control with age≥60; Gibbs, age
≥55). To determine age-associated genes, the expression of each expressed
gene was correlated with the age of death of the individual using spearman
correlation. Genes with spearman rank correlation FDR&lt;0.1 (ROSMAP, n=1025
genes) or FDR&lt;0.05 (CommonMind Consortium, n=6828 genes; Gibbs, n=203
probes) were age-associated genes. Permuting sample ages before calculating the
spearman correlations gave no genes passing the FDR threshold. Genes were then
normalized to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 across individuals, and genes
with normalized expression &gt;=3 or &lt;=−3 were set to 3 or
−3, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient between individuals
was then calculated using only age-associated genes.</p>
<p id="P93">Agglomerative hierarchical clustering using the Euclidean distance
metric and average linkage criterion was performed on the matrix of pair-wise
Pearson correlations to cluster individuals. The resulting tree was cut into 3
groups, and the distribution of the age of death of individuals of each group
was analyzed. Using the ROSMAP cohort, for the cluster with the smallest median
age, with c1 individuals, we calculated the number of individuals, nyoc, with
age of death in [70, youb], of nyo total, and for the cluster with the largest
median age, of c2 individuals, we calculated the number of individuals, nooc,
with age of death in [oolb, Inf), of noo total, as the age boundaries youb and
oolb varied. For each set of age cutoffs we assigned a score as (nyoc/nyo*c1 +
nooc/noo*c2)/(c1+c2). To ensure adequate sample sizes for differential
expression and because individuals with older ages appeared more heterogeneous
in the cluster heat map we only considered age cutoffs with at least 25
individuals in the youngold group and at least 75 individuals in oldestold
group. Based on the top scoring age cutoffs in the ROSMAP cohort, we selected
youb=80 and oolb=85. Thus, the age cutoffs for defining the youngold, middleold,
and oldestold groups used for differential expression in the ROSMAP, CommonMind
Consortium, and Gibbs cohorts were selected to be ≤80, &gt;80 and
&lt;85, and ≥85, respectively.</p>

<p id="P96">A t-test was used for parametric comparisons between two groups with

parametric comparisons between more than two groups and used aov(). The
Mann–Whitney U test was used for nonparametric comparisons between two
groups without knowledge of their distribution and used wilcox.test() with
