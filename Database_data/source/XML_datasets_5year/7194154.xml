<abstract>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease is regarded as a synaptopathy with a long presymptomatic phase. Soluble, oligomeric amyloid-β (Aβ) is thought to play a causative role in this disease, which eventually leads to cognitive decline. However, most animal studies have employed mice expressing high levels of the Aβ precursor protein (APP) transgene to drive pathology. Here, to understand how the principal neurons in different brain regions cope with moderate, chronically present levels of Aβ, we employed transgenic mice expressing equal levels of mouse and human APP carrying a combination of three familial AD (FAD)-linked mutations (Swedish, Dutch, and London), that develop plaques only in old age. We analyzed dendritic spine parameters in hippocampal and cortical brain regions after targeted expression of EGFP to allow high-resolution imaging, followed by algorithm-based evaluation of mice of both sexes from adolescence to old age. We report that Aβ species gradually accumulated throughout the life of APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice, but not the oligomeric forms, and that the amount of membrane-associated oligomers decreased at the onset of plaque formation. We observed an age-dependent loss of thin spines under most conditions as an indicator of a loss of synaptic plasticity in older mice. We further found that hippocampal pyramidal neurons respond to increased Aβ levels by lowering spine density and shifting spine morphology, which reached significance in the CA1 subfield. In contrast, the spine density in cortical pyramidal neurons of APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice was unchanged. We also observed an increase in the protein levels of PSD-95 and Arc in the hippocampus and cortex, respectively. Our data demonstrated that increased concentrations of Aβ have diverse effects on dendritic spines in the brain and suggest that hippocampal and cortical neurons have different adaptive and compensatory capacity during their lifetime. Our data also indicated that spine morphology differs between sexes in a region-specific manner.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. The key histopathological features of AD are the formation of plaques consisting of extracellular deposits of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of a hyperphosphorylated form of the microtubule-associated protein tau.</p>
<p>According to the amyloid hypothesis, Aβ deposits are thought to play a causative role in AD (Hardy and Selkoe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2002</xref>), suggesting that Aβ accumulation initiates a cascade of events that result in synaptic changes, tau pathology, and neuron loss that eventually leads to cognitive decline (Bakota and Brandt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2016</xref>). Although the amyloid hypothesis was initially based on the fact that insoluble Aβ aggregates could be observed in the brains of AD patients, it has changed to reflect the growing evidence that soluble, oligomeric forms of Aβ may represent the major neurotoxic species (Lacor et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2007</xref>; Shankar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">2008</xref>; Tu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">2014</xref>). Missense mutations in the genes coding for amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) or APP processing enzymes such as presenilin (PSEN) in familial forms of AD (FAD) have been found to result in increased amounts of Aβ. This has led to the generation of several mouse models transgenic for human <italic>APP</italic> or other disease-relevant genes harboring FAD-related mutations (Games et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">1995</xref>; Moechars et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">1999</xref>; Richardson and Burns, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">2002</xref>; Jankowsky and Zheng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2017</xref>). Recently, spontaneous cases of AD have also been identified where patients contained more DNA and increased <italic>APP</italic> copy number (Bushman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2015</xref>), likely due to somatic gene recombination (Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2018</xref>). This confirmed an important role in the long-term increase in Aβ production in the development of the disease. AD is considered a disease of synaptic failure (Selkoe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">2002</xref>; Arendt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2009</xref>), which occurs substantially earlier than intense neuronal degeneration and plaque formation. The existence of a long presymptomatic/preclinical phase of AD indicates that the chronic exposure to low or moderate amounts of soluble Aβ might induce subtle changes in synaptic connectivity long before the emergence of cognitive impairment. It is also conceivable that AD could be treated before cognitive deficits and massive neurodegeneration occur to delay the onset of clinical symptoms. Consequently, it has recently become apparent that models of aging are needed to investigate age-related neurodegeneration (Johnson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2015</xref>). Moreover, several studies have proposed the use of knock-in mice or mice with low overexpression of the transgene to better mimic the long-term progression of the disease (Saito et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">2016</xref>). In such a context, transgenic mice that express moderate concentrations of soluble Aβ in a sustained manner and develop plaques only late in life could be instrumental for analyzing presymptomatic and chronic Aβ effects during aging. Mice transgenic for human APP695 with the combination of Swedish (KM595/596NL), Dutch (E618Q), and London (V642I) mutations under the control of the platelet-derived growth factor beta (<italic>PDGFB</italic>) promoter (APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice) produce moderate levels of Aβ and develop plaques only in old age (Blanchard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2003</xref>). These mice have proven to also be useful for the generation of <italic>ex vivo</italic> models since they already express Aβ40 and Aβ42 at early postnatal stages (Tackenberg and Brandt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">2009</xref>; Golovyashkina et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2015</xref>; Penazzi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">2016</xref>). It has been shown that male APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice have a reduced olfactory habituation and a higher level of anxiety compared to control mice, but have no significant deficits in hippocampus-related spatial memory at 17–18 months when plaque formation starts to emerge (Penazzi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2017</xref>). A deficit of olfactory function or anxiety-like behavior has been associated with amyloidosis-related pathologies and can be an informative biomarker for diagnosing the earliest stage of neuropathologies such as AD (Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2004</xref>; Alvarado-Martínez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The loss of synapses and dendritic spines, which represent the major excitatory input, is one of the common defects found in human AD brains (for a review see Tackenberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">2009</xref>). Spine loss in specific brain regions appears to be an early event during disease development as individuals with mild AD already have fewer synapses (55%) in the <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> of the CA1 subfield (Scheff et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">2007</xref>). A recent detailed 3D ultrastructural analysis performed on the transentorhinal cortex of AD patients showed that a reduction in the percentage of synapses affects the subset of asymmetric synapse types targeting spine heads (Dominguez-Álvaro et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2019</xref>). Results from human studies also indicate that spines become deformed during AD compared with those in normal aged brains (Baloyannis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2007</xref>). This could be functionally relevant because spines with larger heads (mushroom spines) are thought to have stronger synapses (Matsuzaki et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2001</xref>) and provide higher compartmentalization (Brandt and Paululat, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2013</xref>). Aβ induces acute alterations in dendritic spines, as demonstrated in hippocampal cell and tissue culture experiments (Lacor et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2007</xref>; Shankar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">2008</xref>; Ortiz-Sanz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">2020</xref>), and spine loss is also seen in the brains of APP or PSEN transgenic mice (Smith et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">2009</xref>; Merino-Serrais et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2011</xref>; Zago et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">2012</xref>; Liang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2019</xref>). Interestingly, several studies have also shown that short exposure to picomolar concentrations of Aβ positively modulates synaptic plasticity, while prolonged exposure or high (nanomolar) levels of Aβ impair synaptic transmission and induce neuronal loss (Puzzo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">2008</xref>; Koppensteiner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2016</xref>). Therefore, the concentration, type, and duration of Aβ exposure, and likely also the type of receiving neuron, may determine the effect of Aβ on synaptic connectivity.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the directionality or magnitude of the alterations may differ in various brain regions, depending on the adaptive/compensatory capacity of the respective region. However, to date, relatively few studies have examined early changes in synaptic connectivity before plaque formation, and no study has evaluated the effect of long-term, chronically present soluble Aβ species on changes in spine density and morphology. Furthermore, there are no reliable studies that would provide comparative knowledge of timeline trajectories regarding spine alteration in different brain regions during the long presymptomatic phase characterized by increasing Aβ levels. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, the evolution of dendritic spine parameters in the presence of elevated Aβ levels has not been studied in parallel in both sexes in AD mouse models.</p>
<p>Our motivation was to fill this knowledge gap by analyzing the brain of mice exposed to gradually increasing amounts of soluble Aβ species. We employed a mouse model (APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice) that produces moderate levels of Aβ peptides throughout life and develops plaques only at an advanced age. To obtain a global understanding of how principal neurons in different brain regions cope with the chronic presence of Aβ from adolescence to old age, we analyzed two hippocampal and two cortical brain regions by algorithm-based evaluation of high-resolution cLSM image stacks. The structures could be analyzed due to the expression of EGFP in subsets of neurons (Feng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2000</xref>). Moreover, owing to the emerging awareness of gender bias in AD development (May, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2016</xref>), we applied our spine parameter analysis to animals of both sexes.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Heterozygous APP<sub>SDL</sub> transgenic mice expressing human APP<sub>695</sub> with three FAD-related mutations (Swedish [KM595/596NL], Dutch [E618Q], and London [V642I]) were used (Aventis Pharma; Strasbourg, France). The transgene in these mice is under the control of the <italic>PDGFB</italic> promoter (Blanchard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2003</xref>). Age-matched C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories and Harlan Winkelmann) were employed as control. Genotyping of APP<sub>SDL</sub> transgenic mice was performed from mouse tail DNA by PCR using the following primers: APP-forward, 5′-GTAGCAGAGGAGGAAGAAGTG-3′ and APP-reverse, 5′-CATGACCTGGGACATTCTC-3′. For analysis of synaptic connectivity and morphology, APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice were crossed with homozygous EGFP-expressing mice (Thy1-GFP line M; obtained with the permission of Josh Sanes, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA). In these mice, EGFP expression is governed by a neuron-specific <italic>Thy1</italic> promoter element (Feng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2000</xref>). Littermates expressing EGFP and non-transgenic for human <italic>APP</italic> served as control. All animals were maintained and euthanized according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines and German animal care regulations.</p>

<sec id="s2-2">
<title>Antibodies</title>
<p>The following antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-Aβ antibodies (mouse 4G8; Covance, Munich, Germany), monoclonal anti-neuronal nuclei antibody NeuN (mouse; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA), monoclonal anti-actin antibody (mouse; Calbiochem; Darmstadt, Germany), monoclonal anti-APP antibody (22C11; Millipore GmbH Schwalbach/Ts., Germany), monoclonal anti-synaptophysin antibody (mouse; Millipore), PSD-95 (7E3-1B8; mouse; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), monoclonal anti-Arc antibody (C-7; mouse; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and GAPDH (#AB2302; chicken; Millipore). The following anti-Tau antibodies were used: monoclonal phosphorylation independent Tau-5 (mouse; Labvision, Westinghouse, CA, USA), monoclonal AT8 (mouse; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), polyclonal pS199 (rabbit; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and monoclonal PHF1 (mouse; a generous gift from Peter Davies, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA). As secondary antibodies, cyanine 3 (Cy3)-coupled anti-mouse (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA, USA) were employed.</p>

<title>Analyses of Aβ Levels</title>
<p>Animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation. The brains were quickly removed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Sequential extraction was performed essentially as previously described (Shankar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">2009</xref>). Briefly, frozen right hemibrains without cerebellum were homogenized in 1.1 ml of ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing a cocktail of protease and phosphates inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 10 mg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM sodium fluoride, and 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate) with 30 strokes using a mechanical Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 175,000× <italic>g</italic> and 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant (designated as TBS extract) was aliquoted and stored at −80°C. To solubilize the membrane-bound Aβ, the TBS-insoluble pellet was homogenized in 1.1 ml of TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 plus inhibitors (TBS-TX) with 30 strokes using a Dounce homogenizer, centrifuged at 175,000× <italic>g</italic> and 4°C for 30 min and the resultant supernatant (designated as TBS-TX extract) was aliquoted and stored at −80°C. TBS and TBS-TX extracts were subjected to an ELISA test using commercially available kits (EZHS40, EZHS42; Millipore GmbH Schwalbach/Ts., Germany; oligomeric Aβ ELISA Kit; Biosensis, Thebarton, Australia). The ELISA for the oligomeric Aβ utilizes the MOAB-2 antibody developed by LaDu and coworkers (Youmans et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">2012</xref>). The authors showed that the MOAB-2 antibody specifically detects Aβ and not the precursor molecule APP. In ELISAs, the oligomeric form of the Aβ peptide (o-Aβ) can be assayed independently of the other forms of the molecule when the MOAB-2 monoclonal antibody is used. Cortices and hippocampi were isolated separately from another set of mice and processed as described above in 5× weight/volume extraction solutions. The samples were tested with ELISA Kit KHB3544 (Thermo Scientific, Schwerte, Germany).</p>

<sec id="s2-4">
<title>Fixation and Staining</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with saline followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Brains were removed, postfixed overnight at 4°C in 4% PFA/PBS, and stored in PBS at 4°C.</p>
<p>For thioflavin S staining, coronal vibratome sections (50 μm) were mounted on positively charged slides (SuperFrost Plus, Menzel). The sections were stained with 1% thioflavin S for 8 min and then differentiated in two changes of 85% ethanol for 3 min each and two changes of 95% ethanol for 3 min each followed by three washes with ddH<sub>2</sub>O. The sections were mounted with Confocal-Matrix<sup>®</sup> (Micro-Tech-Lab, Graz, Austria) and a coverslip was applied.</p>
<p>For immunohistochemical staining, free-floating coronal sections (50 μm) were used. The slices were treated with 70% formic acid for 30 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. Then, the slices were permeabilized with 0.4% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min and washed with 1% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS. The slices were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. After washing with PBS, the slices were incubated with a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody and DAPI for 3 h at RT, washed in PBS, and mounted in Confocal-Matrix<sup>®</sup> under a coverslip.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-5">
<title>Microscopy</title>
<p>High-resolution microscopy images were obtained on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital camera (Vosskühler COOL-1300), Lucia G or NIS Elements AR software, and a C1 confocal laser scanning unit with Helium/Neon (He/Ne; 543 nm) and Argon (488 nm) laser, governed by EZ-C1 or NIS-Elements AR software. The objectives (Nikon) used were a dry 4 × (NA, 0.13), dry 10 × (NA, 0.3), dry 20 × (NA, 0.5), dry 40 × (NA, 0.75), 40× oil-immersion (NA, 1.0), and 60× oil-immersion (NA, 1.4). For imaging of whole neurons, a Zeiss 510 META confocal laser scanning microscope was employed using an Argon laser (488) and 40× oil-immersion (NA, 1.3) objective.</p>

<title>Algorithm-Based Spine Morphology Analysis</title>
<p>Secondary and tertiary segments (≥25 μm) of the apical (middle-third) dendritic subregions of pyramidal cells from hippocampal CA1 and CA3 (Bregma level from −1.58 to −2.03 mm) and two cortical areas, the parietal association cortex (ACTX; Bregma level from −1.46 to −2.06 mm) and the primary somatosensory cortex (SCTX; Bregma level from −1.34 to −2.06 mm) were imaged with a voxel size of 0.05 × 0.05 × 0.20 μm in x-y-z directions. Image stacks were processed using 3D blind deconvolution (Autodeblur Software) to improve signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution. Analysis of spine density, length, and shape was performed by algorithm-based, semi-automated evaluation of spine morphology using 3DMA-Neuron software as previously detailed (Sündermann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">2012</xref>). Spine morphology was classified into three groups: “stubby,” “mushroom” and “thin” based on the ratio of head to neck diameter and the ratio of spine length to neck diameter as described in Koh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2002</xref>). The software developers based their criteria on a thorough EM study by Harris et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">1992</xref>). Data are represented using nonlinear curve fitting with allometric 1 function: y = a*x<sup>b</sup> (y = dependent variable; x = independent variable; a = coefficient; b = power).</p>
<p>For the 3D reconstruction of hippocampal neurons, pyramidal cells were imaged in 6–10 individual but overlapping stacks with a voxel size of 0.30 × 0.30 × 0.44 μm in x-y-z directions. Image stacks were converted into 8-bit grayscale .tif files using ImageJ software and then stitched to generate a single stack using VIAS software (Computational Neurobiology and Imaging Center, Mt.

Three-dimensional reconstruction of whole neurons was performed using Neuromantic software (University of Reading, Reading, UK), which allows analysis of neuronal morphology after semi-automated tracing of dendritic processes, as previously described (Golovyashkina et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2014</xref>).

<title>APP<sub>SDL</sub> Mice Accumulate Aβ40 and Aβ42 During Their Lifetime</title>
<p>To analyze the chronic effects of Aβ during aging, we used transgenic mice that produce moderate levels of Aβ and develop plaques only at old age (Blanchard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2003</xref>). APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice express a human <italic>APP</italic> splice variant with a combination of three FAD-linked mutations (Swedish, Dutch, and London). Transgene expression is governed by the <italic>PDGFB</italic> promoter that confers neuron-specific expression (Sasahara et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">1991</xref>) from as early as embryonic day 15 (E15; Hutchins and Jefferson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">1992</xref>). Embryonic cortical cultures from these mice produce equimolar amounts of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the picomolar range (Leschik et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2007</xref>). Mice were maintained on a C57BL/6J background and compared with nontransgenic littermates (designated as B6). We first confirmed brain parenchymal plaque formation on coronal sections stained by thioflavin S and further validated by 4G8 antibody staining. The Aβ deposits appeared sparsely first at 18 months, as previously described (Blanchard et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2003</xref>). The hippocampal DG was the most affected region; however, with the increasing age of the mice, plaques also appeared in the CA1 and CA3 regions and spread partially within the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we analyzed the level to which APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice expressed the human APP695 transgene. We observed a doubling of the total APP amount by semi-quantitative western blotting using a monoclonal antibody that detects both endogenous mouse and transgenic human APP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>); there was an about equal expression of mouse and human APP. The expression of APP did not change throughout the life of the mice (data not shown). To determine the potential accumulation of Aβ species during aging, we quantified Aβ levels by ELISA. Because interaction with membranes may modulate amyloid aggregation and cytotoxicity (Evangelisti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2016</xref>), we performed a sequential extraction of soluble and membrane-bound Aβ40 and Aβ42 before quantitation. We observed that the amount of aqueous soluble and membrane-bound (detergent-soluble) Aβ40 and Aβ42 gradually increased with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, left). To test for the presence of oligomeric forms of Aβ and determine whether they accumulate in the same gradual manner, we employed an additional ELISA that is highly specific for the oligomeric form of the Aβ peptide. We observed that the levels of oligomeric Aβ were slightly higher in the membrane-bound fraction, consistent with the role of membrane components in promoting Aβ oligomerization (Wakabayashi and Matsuzaki, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, right). The portion of oligomeric Aβ did not show an obvious age-dependent increase. Indeed, the amount of oligomeric membrane-bound fraction of Aβ even exhibited a significant drop at the time of plaque formation. Please note that Aβ peptides, the main components of senile plaques, predominantly form regular fibrils within the plaques, which are highly insoluble (Chen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">2017</xref>). Thus, they are not in the extracted fractions (both soluble and membrane-bound) that were used for the ELISAs.</p>
<p>These data indicate that APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice accumulate predominantly monomeric Aβ during their lifetime, while the portion of the potentially most cytotoxic species (i.e., o-Aβ) remained constant.</p>

<title>APP<sub>SDL</sub> Mice Do Not Show Evidence of Neuron Loss or Increased Tau Phosphorylation</title>
<p>AD is characterized by a neurodegenerative triad of synaptic changes, dendritic simplification, and neuron loss (Wu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">2010</xref>; Bakota and Brandt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2016</xref>), where the death of neurons is thought to occur last during disease and in a tau-dependent manner. To analyze whether the chronic presence of Aβ causes loss of neurons in the neocortex, we used a machine-learning approach for unbiased analysis and determined the density of neuronal cell bodies in aged APP<sub>SDL</sub> and age-matched B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). As neurons in different cortical areas may differ concerning their susceptibility to age-related changes, four spatially and functionally distinct regions were subjected to analysis. To avoid bias due to tissue shrinkage, we also measured the thickness of the tissue of the same cortical regions. We did not observe a significant difference between the two genotypes, either in cell density or in the thickness of the cortex, indicating that APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice do not exhibit neuron loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also tested for neuron loss in the DG since plaque formation in these mice affects this hippocampal subfield earliest. We determined the thickness of the granule cell layer of the supra- and infrapyramidal blade as an indicator of neuronal degeneration. This area also did not show reduced thickness in APP transgenic mice. In both genotypes, the thickness of the layer was approximately 60 μm, which agrees with published results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>; Amaral et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2007</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To determine whether the mice develop early signs of tau pathology, we undertook a semi-quantitative western blot approach to identify a potential increase in tau phosphorylation at sites previously been shown to have increased levels of tau phosphorylation in AD patients (Buée et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2000</xref>). We observed that tau phosphorylation decreased at S199 and the AT8 epitope in old APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice compared with age-matched, nontransgenic littermates, indicating that the chronic presence of Aβ alone does not induce increased phosphorylation of endogenous mouse tau at AD-relevant sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). While it is generally believed that high concentrations of Aβ induce hyperphosphorylation of tau during disease (Hanger et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2007</xref>), we have previously shown in a cell culture system that nanomolar concentrations of secreted Aβ can induce a decrease in tau phosphorylation at selected sites (Golovyashkina et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2015</xref>). In support, it was also shown that Aβ can activate phosphatases <italic>via</italic> NMDA glutamate receptors (Shankar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">2007</xref>), which can act on certain tau phosphoepitopes (Wei et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">2002</xref>; Rahman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Hippocampal Pyramidal Neurons Respond to Elevated Aβ by Decreasing Spine Density, Whereas Cortical Neurons Are More Resilient</title>
<p>Dendritic spines are considered to be the major loci of excitatory synaptic plasticity and function. They can respond to developmental challenges, novel experiences, and noxious stimuli. Higher than physiological Aβ levels pose great demands on dendritic spines (Terry et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">1991</xref>; Shankar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">2008</xref>). Therefore, it is important to determine how chronic Aβ levels affect pyramidal cells within different brain regions during a lifetime and if the gradually increased amounts of Aβ exert a progressive burden on dendritic spines. To evaluate spine changes in age- and brain region-dependent manner, we employed algorithm-based image analyses of fluorescent neurons from 3D image stacks. To visualize neurons of interest, we crossed APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice with those of the GFP M line (Feng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2000</xref>) in which EGFP labels a small population of neurons in various brain regions, including the hippocampus and cortex. In these mice, EGFP expression is governed by the <italic>Thy1</italic> promoter, which drives expression during early postnatal life (Morris, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">1985</xref>) and sufficiently labels some neurons already in 5-week-old mice. EGFP expression did not affect plaque formation as double-transgenic EGFP/APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice showed a similar temporal and regional distribution of Aβ plaques as that previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle, right).</p>
<p>For the analysis, we chose four age groups to cover a broad spectrum of developmental stages representing adolescence (5 weeks of age), young adult (3 months of age), middle-age (15 months of age; shortly before plaque formation), and old (24 months of age; presenting with Aβ plaques). We sampled from two hippocampal (CA1 and CA3) and two cortical (parietal association cortex: ACTX, and primary sensory cortex; SCTX) brain areas to obtain information about developmental and coping strategies of different brain regions and subregions. Finally, we extended our analysis to both sexes to determine whether either sex has a potentially higher susceptibility to Aβ-mediated synaptic changes. It has been reported that there is pronounced instability in pre- and postsynaptic structures within the vicinity of amyloid plaques (Liebscher et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2014</xref>), which can markedly influence spine parameters. However, in our mouse model, only moderate amounts of plaques are present, and only in the old mice. Consequently, our analysis excluded possible changes in the spine parameters in the vicinity of plaques.</p>
<p>We first quantified dendritic spine densities under different conditions because they could serve as indicators of the extent of alterations in synaptic connectivity in different brain regions (Segal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">2005</xref>; Harms and Dunaevsky, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). To determine changes occurring over time, we analyzed our data using a generalized linear model (GZLM). As an extension to a traditional general linear model like a multivariate ANOVA, it allows for other than a normal distribution of the dependent variable (Choi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2018</xref>) and does not assume a linear relationship between the response variable and the model parameter, i.e., in this case the spine parameters and the age of mice (Faraway, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2010</xref>). The results were plotted as fitted spine density trajectories (Schumann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). In the hippocampus, GZLM analysis revealed a significant genotype effect at most conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, top), where spine density trajectories representing data form CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice ran below the trajectories of the respective data from control mice. This confirmed the negative effect, i.e., the spine loss initiated by Aβ on hippocampal principal neurons. In the CA1 subfield, the genotype effect was observed in both male and female mice, indicating that the hippocampus in both sexes is sensitive to elevated Aβ levels. Spine density trajectories also revealed a decrease during the lifetime of the mice, resulting in a significant age effect. The interaction between genotype and age could only be observed for the CA1 pyramidal neurons of female mice, implying that age and spine reduction by Aβ are generally not interdependent in the hippocampus.</p>

</fig>
<p>Interestingly, the results were different for cortical regions. In most cases, the spine density trajectory depicting data from APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice ran higher than the trajectory for the respective data from control mice; however, the difference did not result in a significant genotype effect in the two regions analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, bottom).</p>
<p>Taken together, the data indicate that, although increased amounts of Aβ present a challenge for the dendritic spines throughout aging, under our conditions no extensive alterations occurred at the spine level. Moreover, hippocampal principal neurons responded to elevated Aβ levels in the brain with a loss of spines, whereas cortical neurons were less responsive, perhaps even showing an inverse reaction. Our data provide evidence that these changes are present in both sexes. Furthermore, they do not progress with age. The different effects of Aβ on the spine density trajectories in the hippocampus and the cortex may suggest a potential compensatory adaptation of pyramidal cells in the cortex.</p>

<title>Elevated Amounts of Aβ Induce Region-Specific Changes in Spine Morphology, Including a Shift From Mushroom Spines to Stubby Spines in the CA1 Subfield</title>
<p>Individual spines also develop morphological adaptations during maturation and exhibit changes during learning or noxious insult (Berry and Nedivi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2017</xref>). Thus, the question arises as to whether elevated Aβ levels influence spine morphology in the brain areas analyzed.</p>
<p>To approach this question, we classified spines into three morphological categories, namely, “mushroom,” “stubby,” and “thin” (Harris et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">1992</xref>), which are thought to represent functionally distinct entities. The analysis was performed by an algorithm-based method using cLSM image stacks as previously described (Sündermann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Region-specific differences developed with respect to the mushroom and stubby spine types. In the hippocampus, we observed a genotype effect with both mushroom and stubby spines in the CA1 subfield of both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). In this subfield, the respective trajectories depicting spine fractions exhibited a shift between the ratios of the two spine classes. Specifically, mice with elevated amounts of Aβ showed an increase in the stubby fraction of spines compared with the mushroom fraction. A significant increase in the fraction of stubby spines was also observed for male mice in the CA3 subfield, while female mice did not exhibit a significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). A decreased fraction of mushroom spine was observed in the ACTX of male mice, as evidenced by the genotype effect after a GZLM analysis. In contrast, the SCTX was completely unresponsive to the presence of increased levels of Aβ in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figures S5, S6</xref>).</p>

<p>A surprising observation was the change in the association cortex of female mice, where the proportion of mushroom spines started low in adolescent APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice, as also observed in the other brain areas. However, during aging, this spine type fraction showed an upward trajectory, overtaking the proportion of the mushroom spine fraction in control animals at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).</p>
<p>In most brain regions analyzed, and for both genotypes and sexes, the trajectories of the fraction of thin spines showed a decrease with age. This decline during the lifetime of the mice is significant as the GZLM analysis showed a significant age effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These results confirmed that there is an age-related loss of synaptic plasticity in older mice as previously described (Xu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">2018</xref>). However, we did not observe a significant genotype effect for the thin spines, further corroborating that the decrease in thin spines throughout the lifetime of mice is due to age-related, rather than Aβ-related, alterations in cell function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, the data indicate that Aβ induces a clear shift in spine morphing from mushroom to stubby in the hippocampal CA1 region, whereas the SCTX was completely unresponsive. These data suggest that elevated levels of Aβ direct spine morphology towards lower compartmentalization in the affected brain areas. Furthermore, some of these morphological changes differ between sexes in a region-specific manner.</p>

<title>Transgenic APP Expression Does Not Differ Between the Hippocampus and Cortex</title>
<p>To address if the diverse effects on dendritic spines are due to different expression levels of the transgene between the cortex and hippocampus of APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice, we performed APP-targeted western blot analysis separately on both brain regions. We again observed a one-fold higher expression of the transgene, which was similar in both brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). As APP processing or Aβ clearance can differ within the brain, we also determined the level of Aβ42, which is considered to be the main synaptotoxic species (Walsh and Selkoe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">2007</xref>). We did not see a significant difference either in the soluble or in the membrane-bound form of Aβ42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that the differential spine alterations in the analyzed brain regions were not due to differences in the levels of APP or Aβ42.</p>

CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons were imaged in high-resolution tile z-stacks and reconstructed in 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). The morphological parameters total path length and the number of branching points were determined. We did not observe a statistically significant difference between neurons from APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice and those from control animals; however, there was a general trend towards dendritic simplification in old APP<sub>SDL</sub>-expressing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). To gather detailed information about potential region-specific morphological changes induced by Aβ, we employed Sholl analysis to measure dendritic field density and structure (Sholl, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">1953</xref>). Compared with age-matched controls, we observed a reduced number of dendritic intersections in basal trees of the neurons, which reached significance at a distance of 60 μm from the cell body in CA1 neurons from old APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). These data indicated that chronic Aβ levels induce dendritic simplification at old age in a regionally restricted manner and that dendritic simplification occurs before the loss of neurons.</p>

<title>PSD-95 and Arc Respond to Chronic Aβ Production in Old APP<sub>SDL</sub> Mice</title>
<p>Synaptophysin (major synaptic vesicle protein p38) is an established general marker for the quantification of synapses and synaptic integrity (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2010</xref>). To determine whether the differential effect of Aβ on spine density in hippocampal and cortical neurons is also reflected in changes in synaptophysin levels, we measured the relative levels of synaptophysin in both brain regions by semi-quantitative western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>). We did not observe any significant changes in the level of synaptophysin between the genotypes in either brain region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>, left). To test for potential changes in the postsynapse, we measured the relative amounts of PSD-95, a pivotal postsynaptic scaffolding protein in excitatory neurons (Kaizuka and Takumi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2018</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that the levels of PSD-95 in APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice were increased when compared with those of B6 controls, and this increase reached significance in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>, middle top). As a more functional molecular readout, we also determined the level of the activity-regulated cytoskeletal protein Arc, which is crucial for every form of neuronal plasticity and can affect synaptic strength (Guzowski et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2000</xref>; Messaoudi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2007</xref>; Peebles et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">2010</xref>). The Arc protein levels showed a pronounced increase in the cortex of APP<sub>SDL</sub> transgenic mice compared with those of control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>, right), but the level of increase was lower in the hippocampus. As Arc has a key role in the consolidation of explicit and implicit forms of memory (Bramham et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2010</xref>), our data suggest that Arc levels may be region-specifically increased to strengthen memory consolidation and maintenance in the cortex.</p>

<p>Combined, these data indicate that the differential effect of Aβ on spine density in the hippocampus and cortex is not reflected on a molecular level by a change in the level of synaptophysin, a marker for presynaptic structure. Changes in the concentrations of PSD-95 and Arc may point to the existence of a compensatory effect in respective brain regions under our experimental conditions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Aβ deposits are thought to play a causative role in AD (Hardy and Selkoe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2002</xref>). Disagreement with the classical amyloid hypothesis was driven by several studies reporting that a proportion of individuals at risk of AD show intact cognition regardless of extensive accumulation of the Aβ peptide in their brain (Bennett et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>; Arendt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2009</xref>; Villemagne et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">2013</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of the distribution of the histopathological lesions in AD patients has shown that tau inclusions show a higher correlation with cognitive impairment than amyloid plaques (Nelson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2012</xref>). This raises the question as to the nature of the difference that makes a population resilient towards cognitive decline, despite the accumulation of Aβ, and how different brain regions adjust to the chronic presence of increasing amounts of Aβ during the long prodromal phase of the disease. As an example, Boros et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2017</xref>) analyzed the brains of control subjects with AD pathology and AD brains with dementia, and concluded that dendritic spines may provide cognitive resilience against AD. In light of this, we decided to analyze the effect of moderate concentrations of lifelong, chronic Aβ exposure, potential changes in oligomeric Aβ levels, and region-specific differences in spine parameters in a mouse model of amyloidosis.</p>
<p>Neurons and spines undergo structural adaptations throughout physiological aging that likely contribute to changes in their electrophysiological properties and cognition (Dickstein et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2013</xref>). However, AD already presents characteristics of a synaptopathology early during the disease process (Selkoe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">2002</xref>; Opazo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2018</xref>), and synapse deficiencies may accelerate cognitive decline. In contrast, the magnitude of synaptic deficiencies appears not to be correlated with increasing Aβ levels, as otherwise the disease would be expected to turn symptomatic much earlier. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the extent to which established molecular and structural substrates of memory consolidation, i.e., the dendritic spines, develop alterations during the long prodromal stage of AD. For this, we used transgenic mice overexpressing low levels of the <italic>APP</italic> gene as a diagnostic tool for studying synaptic health. We reasoned that these mice might show a less pronounced, but more realistic view, of the alterations and adaptive potential of synaptic plasticity in different brain regions long before the development of symptomatic AD. We selected this model owing to the increasing concern about potential artifacts connected to high overexpression of the APP protein in many mouse models (Saito et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">2016</xref>). We hypothesized that the directionality or magnitude of the alterations may differ in various brain regions, depending on the adaptive/compensatory capacity of the respective region.</p>
<p>Our findings were as follows: (1) Aβ species show a gradual accumulation throughout the life of transgenic APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice, which is not paralleled by an increase in the levels of the oligomeric form. (2) Hippocampal pyramidal neurons respond to increased Aβ concentrations by lowering spine density and undergoing a shift in spine morphology from mushroom towards stubby spines; both changes occur mainly in the CA1 subfield regardless of the sex. (3) In contrast, the spine density trajectories of cortical pyramidal neurons differ in that they do not show a difference in spine density in response to increased Aβ exposure. (4) Reduced spine compartmentalization also occurred in cortical neurons analyzed, specifically in the ACTX of male mice. (5) Increased concentrations of PSD-95 and Arc in the hippocampus and cortex, respectively, point towards a compensatory mechanism initiated during the prodromal stage of amyloidosis.</p>
<p>Soluble oligomeric Aβ has been shown to induce the loss of dendritic spines in culture (Lacor et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2007</xref>; Shankar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">2008</xref>; Tackenberg and Brandt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">2009</xref>) and a reduction in spine density in APP transgenic mice (Koffie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2009</xref>; Jung and Herms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2012</xref>). Spine loss could be reversed either by restoring the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway (Smith et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">2009</xref>) or by antibody-mediated neutralization of soluble Aβ (Shankar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">2007</xref>; Zago et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">2012</xref>), suggesting that local modulation of spine number could be a physiological and reversible action mediated by Aβ and may not necessarily be neurotoxic in itself. Indeed, picomolar levels of Aβ were shown to enhance synaptic plasticity (Puzzo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">2008</xref>), supporting the physiological role of Aβ. Our data show that gradually increasing Aβ levels do not lead to steadily intensified defects in postsynaptic structures. Under certain conditions, we even observed that the greatest differences occurred between the genotypes at a very young age, e.g., the spine density in the female hippocampus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Potential changes in plasticity may result in some brain regions becoming more resilient to the Aβ present, or even initiate various mechanisms to compensate for impaired signaling in other brain regions. Accordingly, Elman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2014</xref>), using PET imaging, showed that one possibility for a compensatory mechanism, potentially reflecting brain plasticity in response to Aβ deposition, is an increased activity associated with more detailed memories that occur in some brain regions. However, Aβ-dependent neuronal hyperactivity is believed to contribute to circuit dysfunction at the early stages of AD (Zott et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">2019</xref>). We have previously shown that APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice present hippocampal hyperactivity at 17–18 months of age (Penazzi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2017</xref>). Our current data indicate that neurons can effectively adapt through a long period of advancing age, even to a several-fold increase in Aβ concentrations, if the oligomeric proportion does not substantially change.</p>
<p>The unequivocal observation of this study is that the hippocampal CA1 subfield is the most affected brain region in APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice of both sexes. Nevertheless, male APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice aged 17–18 months do not have spatial memory deficits when plaques occur (Penazzi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2017</xref>), probably due to sufficient brain plasticity. This supports the observation that behavioral symptoms appear at the late stages of neurodegenerative diseases, although morphological changes can be detected much earlier. Although an expected decrease in spine density was observed in the hippocampus, the cortical regions showed no or even a tendency for an opposite effect. As the latter observation does not reflect the general expectations, such data are rarely published. However, increased spine density has also been recognized through <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of the layer 5 cortical neurons in the most often examined mice with amyloid pathology, the Tg2567 mice, at 12 months of age, a time when these mice are already developing plaques (Jung and Herms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2012</xref>). This may be due to a different regulation of the expression of synapse regulating proteins in the hippocampus compared to the cortex. Mice encoding mutant APP and mutant PSEN1 (APdE9) have been shown to increase BDNF protein levels significantly during aging in cortical regions, but not in the hippocampus, compared to wild-type mice (Rantamäki et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">2013</xref>).</p>
<p>We also showed that there were changes in synaptic connectivity by quantitative western blots for PSD-95 and the activity-regulated protein Arc at significant levels in a region-specific manner, whereas the level of the presynaptic protein, synaptophysin, showed no significant change. Accumulating evidence supports the functional importance of the early-expression <italic>ARC</italic> gene in regulating memory consolidation. Interestingly, AD patients express anomalous levels of the Arc protein (Rudinskiy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">2012</xref>). However, it is not clear what the effects are on the neurophysiology of AD-associated amyloidopathy. Arc interacts specifically with several effector proteins in different neuronal compartments such as dendritic spines and nuclear domains, and may bidirectionally regulate synaptic strength by distinct molecular mechanisms. This suggests that Arc may act as a master organizer of long-term synaptic plasticity, critical for information storage and cognition (Nikolaienko et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2018</xref>). In mice with high Aβ accumulation such as Tg2576 mice (Almeida et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2005</xref>), as well as in the postmortem brain (Proctor et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">2010</xref>), the levels of PSD-95 were reported to be decreased and the degree of reduction correlated with the severity of dementia. However, Aβ pathology develops slowly in our mouse model and the presymptomatic phase is long. Therefore, increased PSD-95 levels, especially in the hippocampus where the spine alterations are more enhanced, could be indicative of potential compensatory mechanisms before the onset of severe symptoms.</p>
<p>Hippocampal and cortical neurons may differ in their sensitivity and adaptive response to increasing Aβ levels; moreover, cortical neurons might compensate for the loss of synaptic contacts in the hippocampus (or other brain regions that were not analyzed), thereby increasing memory consolidation and maintenance. Compared with those of AD patients with dementia, the levels of synaptic proteins such as synaptophysin and synaptopodin were also shown to be preserved in the brains of female subjects who presented with AD pathology but were resilient to cognitive decline (Arnold et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2013</xref>).</p>
<p>We showed that, in contrast to the distinct alterations in spine density within different brain regions, higher Aβ levels generally promote a lowering of the level of spine compartmentalization by inducing a decreased proportion of mushroom or increased proportion of stubby spine phenotype in the hippocampus and at specific conditions within the cortex. Using mathematical modeling, a recent study showed that shortening and widening of the necks should alter the electrical compartmentalization of the spines, leading to reduced postsynaptic potentials in spine heads, but not the soma, in APP×PS1-KI mice (Androuin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2018</xref>). According to these observations, local EPSPs are likely to be lower at conditions where the stubby spine fraction in APP<sub>SDL</sub> mice is increased compared to controls, which can affect the degree of potentiation of the postsynaptic cell. It would be interesting to address this experimentally in future studies. Taken together, our study highlights parallels and differences in spine plasticity mechanisms in cortical and hippocampal regions.</p>
<p>Females have a disproportionate occurrence of AD compared with males; however, the reason for this is not clear (Vina and Lloret, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">2010</xref>). It is conceivable that changes in dendritic spines render females more susceptible to cognitive decline. Previous studies, performed mainly in rats, showed that gonadal hormones modulate dendritic spine densities (Chen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2009</xref>). However, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the brain region affected or the stage of the estrus cycle that affects spine density (Shors et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">2001</xref>; Peterson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">2015</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, no study to date has analyzed dendritic spine plasticity in both sexes throughout the life of mice. Our data do not support that certain brain regions or spine parameters in female mice are more markedly affected by increased Aβ levels than in male mice. Interestingly, in most cases where a genotype effect is observed in female mice, the largest differences in the trajectories of the two genotypes are found during adolescence and not in the aged brain. This suggests that the higher susceptibility of females to AD development is likely to be connected to other aspects of the disease rather than the sensitivity of dendritic spines to Aβ exposure.</p>
<p>The pathophysiology of AD is thought to develop over many years before the emergence of cognitive impairment and diagnosis of the disease. Recent disappointing clinical trial results raise the possibility that therapies may have a limited effect after neuronal degeneration has begun. This suggests that AD would be optimally treated in the presymptomatic stages of the disease. The possibility of analyzing changes in synaptic connectivity in a sensitive and temporospatially defined manner could provide a useful tool to guide the identification of potentially protective conditions or conditions that delay the onset of the disease. Our data provide evidence that, despite gradually increasing amounts of Aβ, some brain regions such as the primary somatosensory cortex, are more resilient to dendritic spine alterations than the hippocampus. The increased understanding of the mechanisms that drive this resilience could be of therapeutic relevance.</p>
