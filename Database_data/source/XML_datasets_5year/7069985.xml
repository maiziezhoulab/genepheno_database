<p id="Par1">Interrogating DNA methylation within schizophrenia risk loci holds promise to identify mechanisms by which genes influence the disease. Based on the hypothesis that allele specific methylation (ASM) of a single CpG, or perhaps CpH, might mediate or mark the effects of genetic variants on disease risk and phenotypes, we explored haplotype specific methylation levels of individual cytosines within a genomic region harbouring the <italic>BAG5</italic>, <italic>APOPT1</italic> and <italic>KLC1</italic> genes in peripheral blood of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Three DNA fragments located in promoter, intronic and intergenic areas were studied by single-molecule real-time bisulfite sequencing enabling the analysis of long reads of DNA with base-pair resolution and the determination of haplotypes directly from sequencing data. Among 1,012 cytosines studied, we did not find any site where methylation correlated with the disease or cognitive deficits after correction for multiple testing. At the same time, we determined the methylation profile associated with the schizophrenia risk haplotype within the <italic>KLC1</italic> fourth intron and confirmed ASM for cytosines located in the vicinity of rs67899457. These genetically associated DNA methylation variations may be related to the pathophysiological mechanism differentiating the risk and non-risk haplotypes and merit further investigation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Schizophrenia is a common, highly heritable disorder characterized by positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) have identified more than 100 genomic regions that are significantly associated with schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The GWAS results aggregated into polygenic scores explain a significant, albeit insufficient for clinical practice, proportion of the heritability of the disorder and correlate with a wide range of other phenotypes predictive of schizophrenia onset and outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, to unravel the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and to find markers for targeted therapy, it is necessary to understand the role of individual risk loci regarding both gene expression and clinical phenotypes.</p>
<p id="Par3">Because most schizophrenia risk variants are non-coding, interrogating epigenetic and other regulatory processes within the risk loci holds promise for identifying mechanisms by which each locus influences the development of the disease. To date, many investigators have relied on array-based whole-methylome studies (MWAS). The MWASs have found changes in DNA methylation in the blood and brain of schizophrenia patients (reviewed in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>), and current research focuses on the degree of colocalization between the index PGC GWAS loci and differentially methylated sites to find potential causal variants and target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Such studies, along with advantages, have some limitations to delineate the biological significance of individual loci.</p>
<p id="Par4">First, there is evidence that changes in methylation of a single CpG can affect transcription and serve as a more accurate predictor of gene expression or a behavioural phenotype than an average promoter/gene body methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Though microarrays used in schizophrenia MWASs (mainly Illumina 450 k) provide comprehensive coverage of genes and CpG islands, they have not been specifically targeted to schizophrenia. For this reason, the microarrays are limited in the number of cytosines they can assess within the disease-associated loci. In addition, a sizeable proportion of the CpG sites tested is not relevant to the disease, which reduces the likelihood of detecting relevant sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Second, MWASs have provided very limited information on cytosine methylation in the non-CpG context (CpH). Meanwhile, CpH methylation presents at significant levels in human pluripotent stem cells, oocytes and neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, the idea that CpH methylation is more frequent than originally thought and may have a functional role in many somatic cell types is gaining acceptance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Third, haplotype-dependent allele-specific methylation (ASM) is proposed to mediate or mark the effects of genetic variants on gene expression and disease susceptibility, with genetic variants exerting an influence on DNA methylation <italic>in cis</italic>. Methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) are enriched in the schizophrenia risk loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and may explain 25% of the genetic variation of the disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In addition, mQTL are often colocalized with expression QTL (eQTL), which is in line with the hypothesis that ASM may be a cause or a result of allele specific transcription factor binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Of particular interest is methylation associated with polymorphisms that create or abolish CpG sites (CpG-SNP) because CpG-SNPs account for the existence of most mQTL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, methylation at CpG-SNPs is poorly captured by conventional MWASs.</p>
<p id="Par5">The foregoing suggests that interrogating haplotype-dependent allele-specific methylation at single-base resolution might help find markers of schizophrenia and provide insight into biological relevance of the statistically identified risk loci. Sequencing-based approaches that capture relatively short DNA fragments have been recently applied to explore the role of allele-specific methylation in schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Further progress in understanding the interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors in disease risk is expected to be achieved by a direct assessment of DNA modification in long reads enabling more robust genetic and epigenetic haplotypic assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">The emerging long-read technologies, such as the third-generation single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, can sufficiently impact this area of research and overcome limitations inherent for array-based and short-read sequencing methods, as these technologies allow long-range characterization of methylation patterns and generation of phase information over long contiguous segments. Specifically, an innovative method combining bisulfite conversion with SMRT sequencing (SMRT-BS) has been proposed for targeted CpG methylation analyses. The method makes it possible to measure methylation of each cytosine within long amplicons (up to ~1.5–2.0 kb) and to determine haplotypes directly from sequencing data with high accuracy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par7">The present study took advantage of SMRT-BS to examine haplotype dependent methylation states of CpGs and CpHs in one of the top schizophrenia risk loci (chr14:103,996,234–104,184,834, hg19/GRCh37)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> in peripheral blood of patients and controls. This is one of the index loci whose role in the disease pathophysiology is completely unclear, as the genes annotated to it (<italic>APOPT1, BAG5, KLC1, TRMT61A, XRCC3, CKB, PPP1R13B, LC1, AL0498, ZFYVE</italic>2<italic>1</italic>) are not conventional candidates for schizophrenia and are not relevant to major hypotheses of the aetiology and treatment of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Given that within each risk locus there may be multiple genetic variants impacting the disease risk to varying degrees, with some acting via a DNA methylation variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, exploring methylation within this locus could provide epigenetic markers of schizophrenia and related phenotypes and shed light on mechanisms by which the locus is involved along the causal pathway to the disease. In particular, since this genomic region is associated with cognition in a large GWAS of intelligence (chr14:103,822,687–104,174,123)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, it is a promising target to search for epigenetic markers of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia patients.</p>
<p id="Par8">Previous studies of schizophrenia cases revealed differential methylation of several cytosines located within this locus, primarily in the <italic>KLC1</italic> body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Here, we continued characterization of local methylation patterns with the aim to provide detailed information on the relationships between genetic variants and methylation status of single cytosines and to search for markers of schizophrenia and cognitive deficits. We studied three ~1.0 kb DNA fragments with different genetic features, namely with promoter, intron and intergenic locations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>, see also Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> for the fragments’ boundaries and numbers of cytosines). The fragments were selected from the region surrounding the PGC GWAS tag SNPs, rs12887734 (PGC2 GWAS) and rs71417868 (PGC2-CLOZUK), based on criteria described in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Specifically, we focused on CpG-SNP rich DNA segments. The annotation of polymorphisms with MAF &gt; 20%, located within the selected fragments, is given in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the genome region. The scheme depicts three target fragments shaded in blue, simplified structures of genes in grey (light grey designates gene parts locating outside the target fragments, without differentiating exons and introns), polymorphisms directly determined from the bisulfite data (dark diamonds), and other important polymorphisms (uncoloured diamonds).</p></caption><graphic id="d29e386" xlink:href="41598_2020_61671_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par9">The region surrounding the tag SNPs harbours the <italic>BAG5</italic>, <italic>APOPT1</italic> (also known as <italic>COA8</italic>) and <italic>KLC1</italic> genes. BAG5 and APOPT1 have anti- and proapoptotic functions, respectively. BAG5, in addition, is involved in neurodevelopment and is considered in the context of the hypothesis of impaired angiogenesis in schizophrenia aetiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. <italic>KLC1</italic> encodes one of the light chain isoforms of kinesin-1, a microtubule-based motor protein playing the important role in position and transportation of different biomolecules within a cell. Kinesin-1 is the most abundant of the motor family in the brain and is involved in neuronal differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par10">The first target fragment, hereinafter called Fr_BAG5_APOPT1, is a common promoter of <italic>BAG5, APOPT1</italic> and one of the <italic>KLC1</italic> isoforms, embedded in a CpG island. A local polymorphism, rs28362583, is in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the schizophrenia index SNP rs12887734 (<italic>D</italic>′ = 0.99, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.92, European populations)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> and with rs7148456 (<italic>D</italic>′ = 0.99, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.98) affecting alternative splicing of <italic>APOPT1</italic> in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. The second DNA fragment (Fr_APOPT1_KLC1), located within one of the <italic>KLC1</italic> introns, is an enhancer regulating transcription from the above-described promoter (GeneHancer ID: GH14J103593)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. It contains rs67899457, which is an mQTL in the blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and an eQTL for several genes in blood and brain tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Given this, rs28362583- and rs67899457-driven ASM is a candidate mechanism by which this locus is associated with schizophrenia. The third fragment (Fr_BAG5) situates downstream of <italic>BAG5</italic> in an intergenic area. Recent large-scale GWASs have identified local SNPs as index variants for several psychiatric and cognitive phenotypes, such as autism (rs10149470)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, major depression (rs10149470)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, intelligence (rs10141157; rs10149470)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, and educational attainment (rs10129426)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. We therefore expected that ASM within this fragment might be related to cognitive alterations in psychiatric conditions and would correlate with cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.</p>
<p id="Par11">Based on the hypothesis that ASM of a single CpG, or perhaps CpH, might mediate or mark the effects of genetic variants on disease risk and phenotypes, we determined haplotype specific methylation levels of each cytosine (CpG and CpH), residing within these three fragments, in the peripheral blood of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls and analysed their relationship to the disease and cognitive functioning.</p>

<p id="Par12">The patient and control groups were similar in age and sex composition but differed in education (χ2 = 5.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and cognitive scores (patients’ mean ± s.d., 38.66 ± 6.53 Т-scores; controls, 49.63 ± 5.04 Т-scores; <italic>t</italic> = 11.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; see Methods and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref> for a detailed description of the composite cognitive score). We included in the analysis only heterozygotes with at least 5× coverage per strand (see Methods). For this reason, the proportion of heterozygotes in the sample was reduced and the distribution of genotypes in many cases deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. For the same reason, the fragments slightly differed in the number of people whose data were included in the analysis. However, for each fragment, cases and controls did not differ in age, gender, mean coverage, and frequencies of genotypes and haplotypes, and patients demonstrated significantly decreased cognitive scores compared to controls (the sample’s characteristics can be found in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>).</p>

<p id="Par13">Data of 49 patients and 50 controls were analysed. We determined methylation levels of 425 cytosines, including 145 CpGs, with the mean coverage of ~17. The whole region was practically unmethylated in accordance with its genomic features (promoter, CGI), with no influence of age and gender on methylation being detected. For both CpGs and CpHs, mean methylation levels (M) were less than 7% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Allele specific methylation at CpG (top panel) and CpH (bottom panel) sites within Fr_BAG5_APOPT1 in schizophrenia patients (red line) and controls (green line).

<p id="Par14">We next discarded unmethylated cytosines (mean M ≤ 1%) and analysed the other 84 cytosines, including 49 CpGs. The fragment contains eight common polymorphisms. To choose haplotypes for analysis for this and the other fragments, we considered polymorphisms with MAF &gt; 20%, took into account LD in European populations and the possibility to evaluate genotypes from bisulfite-converted DNA. As a result, within the Fr_BAG5_APOPT1 fragment we analysed the effect of haplotypes determined by two polymorphic sites − rs28362583 and rs2274268, which yield three common haplotypes in European populations. Rs28362583 is an indel mutation, the insertion of CCG creating an additional CpG. SNP rs2274268 is a missense C &gt; G mutation in <italic>KLC1</italic>.

No ASM was detected within the fragment. There was only one site, the CpG59_29024 (the cytosine’s name shows its serial number and the last five digits of the chromosome coordinate), where the difference between patients and controls was nominally significant in both the logistic regression adjusted for age, gender and haplotype and the matched pairs analyses controlling for haplotype and coverage. The cytosine was more frequently methylated in patients with the risk haplotype IC compared to controls with the same haplotype. However, the difference did not survive correction for multiple testing (false discovery rate, FDR &lt; 0.05). Haplotypes and methylation did not predict cognitive scores in linear regression models adjusted for age, gender and diagnosis (nominally significant <italic>p</italic>-values can be found in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>).</p>

All CpGs were methylated, with 12 CpGs were intermediately methylated (20% &lt; mean M &lt; 80%) and 12 CpGs were hypermethylated (mean M &gt; 80%).

<p id="Par17">Against this background, a short DNA segment with methylated CpHs stood out (chr14:104,060,285–104,060,422). This segment spanned 138 bp and included 33 CpHs, five СpGs and seven common polymorphisms, six of which being CpG-SNPs. Its average CpH methylation level was M = 8.5 ± 6.8% (vs. mean M = 0.4 ± 0.3% for the remaining CpHs within Fr_APOPT1_KLC1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). To quantify the specificity of this segment further, we compared it with the rest of the Fr_APOPT1_KLC1 fragment (815 bp, 202 CpHs, 19 CpGs, 4 common polymorphisms) on the proportions of cytosines, CpGs and SNPs and examined correlations between cytosines within this segment using an exploratory factor analysis. The segment did not differ from the rest of the fragment in the percentage of cytosines or CpGs, but the percentage of SNPs here was significantly higher (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p id="Par18">Results of the factor analysis are provided in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref> and Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S6a–d</xref>. They suggest the presence of a CpG factor and three neighbouring СpH groups comprising cytosines located upstream of rs55798212. At the same time, the CpHs downstream of rs55798212 did not show clear patterns of relations. The factors consisting of CpH sites only moderately correlated with the CpG factor (<italic>r</italic> = −0.01–0.16) and with each other (<italic>r</italic> = −0.08–0.27), suggesting that several different mechanisms influencing methylation might operate within this short segment. Interestingly, the CpH factor with the largest methylation values (chr14:104,060,297–104,060,346) situated at the boundary of a DNase I hypersensitivity site (DHS) designating the end of an active chromatin segment (the UCSC Genome Browser<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>).

To explore ASM, we used seven polymorphisms (rs67899457* rs55798212* rs376515669* rs151151346* rs147690804* rs12147174* rs143940337) creating three common haplotypes. Average methylation values by group and haplotype and nominally significant <italic>p</italic>-values for each of these cytosines are given in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>. We observed robust allelic variation in DNA methylation, similar across groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>), and then conducted an exploratory network analysis of all cytosines with ASM for illustrative purposes. The results indicated that genetically driven methylation at CpG sites mostly co-located with the genetic variants affecting it. In particular, in the case of the schizophrenia risk haplotype TIGACAI, the methylation levels of five CpGs around the mQTL rs67899457 (~200 bp) were intercorrelated and increased compared to the other haplotypes, showing a regional “facilitated” genetic effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>; while the methylation at each of the consecutively and densely situated CpGs overlapping CpG-SNPs was completely accounted by the absence (rs55798212, rs151151346 and rs12147174) or presence (rs376515669) of the CpG sequence, demonstrating “obligatory” genetic effects. About CpHs, only those situated between these consecutive CpG-SNPs showed ASM, lower methylation taking place in the case of the risk haplotype that destroyed three local CpG sites. In accord with the exploratory factor analysis described above, the network analysis of the sites with ASM revealed several groups of strongly connected consecutive CpGs and no clustering of CpHs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>, the associated information can be found in Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S8a–d</xref>). This suggests that ASM at these CpH sites might be a mechanistic, non-specific consequence of CpG methylation in the CpG-SNP rich region.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Methylation levels of cytosines showing haplotype specific methylation in the entire sample after FDR correction.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Cytosine context</th><th>Coordinates on chr14</th><th>ADAGAGD n = 51 Mean ± s.d.</th><th>TIGACAI n = 39 Mean ± s.d.</th><th>ADAGAGI n = 41 Mean ± s.d.</th><th>Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, <italic>p</italic></th><th>Mann-Whitney, TIGACAI vs. the others, <italic>p</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CpG</td><td>104,060,054</td><td>0.53 ± 0.22</td><td>0.87 ± 0.17</td><td>0.58 ± 0.20</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>CpG</td><td>104,060,087</td><td>0.34 ± 0.18</td><td>0.65 ± 0.24</td><td>0.36 ± 0.21</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>CpG</td><td>104,060,156</td><td>0.37 ± 0.21</td><td>0.70 ± 0.20</td><td>0.41 ± 0.19</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>CpG</td><td>104,060,164</td><td>0.42 ± 0.21</td><td>0.74 ± 0.19</td><td>0.46 ± 0.22</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>CpG</td><td>104,060,226</td><td>0.54 ± 0.24</td><td>0.86 ± 0.16</td><td>0.55 ± 0.21</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>CpG-SNP</td><td>104,060,367</td><td>0.88 ± 0.17</td><td>0.01 ± 0.02</td><td>0.84 ± 0.15</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>CpH</td><td>104,060,373</td><td>0.03 ± 0.07</td><td>0.01 ± 0.03</td><td>0.06 ± 0.11</td><td>0.009</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CpH/CpG-SNP</td><td>104,060,378</td><td>0.04 ± 0.07</td><td>0.98 ± 0.07</td><td>0.12 ± 0.14</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>CpH</td><td>104,060,380</td><td>0.06 ± 0.12</td><td>0.00 ± 0.00</td><td>0.03 ± 0.06</td><td>0.001</td><td>0 0.008</td></tr><tr><td>CpH</td><td>104,060,381</td><td>0.08 ± 0.13</td><td>0.00 ± 0.00</td><td>0.04 ± 0.07</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>CpG-SNP</td><td>104,060,384</td><td>0.89 ± 0.18</td><td>0.00 ± 0.02</td><td>0.89 ± 0.13</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>CpH-SNP</td><td>104,060,386</td><td>0.04 ± 0.06</td><td>0.01 ± 0.06</td><td>0.03 ± 0.08</td><td>0.002</td><td>0 0.013</td></tr><tr><td>CpH</td><td>104,060,389</td><td>0.05 ± 0.09</td><td>0.02 ± 0.08</td><td>0.06 ± 0.11</td><td>0.015</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CpH</td><td>104,060,390</td><td>0.05 ± 0.09</td><td>0.01 ± 0.05</td><td>0.05 ± 0.08</td><td>0.010</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CpG-SNP</td><td>104,060,391</td><td>0.91 ± 0.14</td><td>0.04 ± 0.08</td><td>0.92 ± 0.12</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>CpG-SNP</td><td>104,060,421</td><td>0.06 ± 0.15</td><td>0.97 ± 0.07</td><td>0.85 ± 0.17</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>CpG</td><td>104,060,427</td><td>0.92 ± 0.13</td><td>0.99 ± 0.05</td><td>0.93 ± 0.11</td><td>0.001</td><td>0 0.009</td></tr><tr><td>CpG</td><td>104,060,464</td><td>0.95 ± 0.09</td><td>0.99 ± 0.04</td><td>0.94 ± 0.11</td><td>0.007</td><td>0 0.011</td></tr><tr><td>CpG</td><td>104,060,678</td><td>0.65 ± 0.20</td><td>0.84 ± 0.15</td><td>0.76 ± 0.20</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>CpG</td><td>104,060,845</td><td>0.87 ± 0.13</td><td>0.94 ± 0.10</td><td>0.87 ± 0.15</td><td>0.005</td><td>0 0.002</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Network of cytosines showing haplotype dependent methylation within Fr_APOPT1_KLC1.

<p id="Par21">Given the potential functional role of the methylation at the CpGs near rs67899457, we used an independent sample of 37 individuals and methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM) to validate the local “facilitated” effect of the risk haplotype.

In European populations, they form two haplotypes, DAGAG and ICAGA, with ICAGA being part of the above-described schizophrenia risk haplotype TIGACAI. Next, we employed MS-HRM to determine the methylation status for the region chr14:104060091–104060205, containing two CpGs that showed the “facilitated” effect − CpG3_60156 and CpG4_60164.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par26">In this work, we evaluated the level of methylation of each cytosine, in both the CpG and non-CpG context, within three fragments of one of the top schizophrenia risk loci on chromosome 14 overlapping with an intelligence GWAS locus. Each fragment was chosen based on its potential regulatory role in the expression of nearby genes, primarily <italic>BAG5</italic>, <italic>APOPT1</italic> and <italic>KLC1</italic>, and the enrichment for CpG-SNPs. The latter is important due to the CpG-SNP frequent roles as mQTL and eQTL and also because methylation at CpG-SNP sites is highly correlated in the blood and brain, which partially removes the limitations of using blood as a surrogate for brain in research of psychiatric diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We applied the bisulfite conversion-based method (SMRT-BS) to assess cytosine methylation in peripheral blood of controls and patients and obtained average values of methylation, which were in good agreement with those reported for CpGs in neutrophils and monocytes in the publicly available WGBS datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Using PacBio’s long reads enabled us to directly access allelic information, which in turn allowed for testing differences in methylation between patients and controls considering their haplotypes.</p>
<p id="Par27">Previously, the array based MWASs of blood and brain tissues have detected differential methylation of several CpGs within this locus in schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The identified differentially methylated positions are outside the fragments investigated in the present study. For instance, hypomethylation of cg13247935 (chr14:104,116,713) located in <italic>KLC1</italic> has been found in the brain of patients, with a difference in methylation between cases and controls of 2.47%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. At the same time, none of seven CpGs tested by the MWASs in the common promoter of <italic>KLC1, BAG5</italic> and <italic>APOPT1</italic> has demonstrated differential methylation. In addition, Hannon <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> have not found evidence of a common causal genetic variant for schizophrenia and methylation of these seven CpGs in peripheral blood. Our results extend the MWAS data to the entire promoter, showing very low level of methylation of all CpG and CpH sites regardless of the presence of the schizophrenia risk haplotype. The pattern of methylation that we have observed in the second fragment, located in the intergenic area downstream of <italic>BAG5</italic>, is also very consistent across groups and genotypes, with hypermethylated CpGs and hypomethylated CpHs. Genetic effects on methylation have been found only at two CpG-SNP sites, where the risk allele associates with the absence of the CpG sequence. Of note, this region is now identified as an enhancer regulating the <italic>CKB</italic> gene expression (GeneHancer ID: GH14J103549)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par28">In contrast, the fragment in the <italic>KLC1</italic> fourth intron, within the enhancer regulating the common promoter of <italic>BAG5</italic>, <italic>APOPT1</italic> and <italic>KLC1</italic>, has shown robust ASM of many CpGs and some CpHs. In that, the schizophrenia risk haplotype has differed from the other two haplotypes by the increased methylation of several CpGs, including those surrounding the mQTL rs67899457, and by the lack of methylation at several consecutive cytosines residing at CpG-SNPs and CpHs. While the lack of methylation seems simply to reflect DNA sequence characteristics, especially given no known functional significance of this segment, the methylation around rs67899457 is of interest due to its location in DHS. Moreover, rs67899457 is an eQTL in blood and brain tissues (information about eQTL was retrieved from the NESDA NTR Conditional eQTL Catalog<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> and GTEx(v8)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> and summarized in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Interestingly, its T-variant, which is part of the schizophrenia risk haplotype, is associated with a higher expression of several genes in the blood and a lower expression of <italic>APOPT1</italic> in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par29">Within this enhancer fragment in <italic>KLC1</italic>, we observed ASM but no difference between patients and controls in methylation. These results can be considered under two different scenarios of the methylation role in the disease risk. First, they do not support the hypothesis of the genetically independent role of the local methylation in schizophrenia, as patients and controls with the same haplotypes have shown similar levels of methylation. Second, the results do provide evidence for ASM in this fragment. The presence of ASM suggests that in a sufficiently large sample there might be a difference in methylation between cases and controls owing to the accumulation of the schizophrenia risk haplotypes in patients. And this would be in accordance with the proposed role of ASM as a marker or a mediator of the genetic effects on disease susceptibility. Given this, further investigation of the role of methylation at CpG sites surrounding rs67899457 in schizophrenia is warranted.</p>
<p id="Par30">There are some limitations to note. Given tissue and cell-type specificity of methylation, two methodological concerns regarding the use of blood in methylation studies of mental traits are widely debated in the literature. These are the use of blood as a surrogate for brain and the complex cellular composition of the blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. As mentioned earlier, testing methylation under genetic control (mQTL), which is a focus of our study, improves the interpretability of findings but does not remove the limitations completely. Further, about the credibility of the results, we used the SMRT-BS method, which is highly reproducible and concordant with other quantitative CpG methylation methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In addition, we validated the haplotype-dependent ASM near rs67899457 using MS-HRM and an independent sample. Moreover, our data on methylation within each fragment are in agreement with those obtained previously using large samples and other approaches to assessing DNA methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Even so, replication of both the positive and negative results using independent samples and another sequencing method enabling the analysis of long amplicons is desirable. Our sample size, albeit common for studies based on next-generation sequencing, could have been too small to capture some relevant effects. Of note, however, the desirable sample size is unknown because there is no information as to what a biologically significant difference in methylation levels is. Then, when considering the results, one should keep in mind that CpH methylation is strand-specific, showing greater asymmetry in introns and highly transcribed genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Finally, the schizophrenia risk locus selected for the study spans ~200 kb. Constrained by the high cost of the methodology used, we analysed only three fragments, about 1 kb each, and their choice was to some extent arbitrary. Other fragments with marks of active chromatin deserve attention in future studies.</p>
<p id="Par31">In summary, sequencing-based profiling of haplotype dependent DNA methylation in three regions within the genomic locus ranked 13th in the schizophrenia PGC2 GWAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> has revealed neither CpG nor CpH sites with altered methylation in schizophrenia. Likewise, no effects of local haplotypes and methylation on cognitive deficits have been found. At the same time, we have shown that the schizophrenia risk haplotype within the fourth intron of <italic>KLC1</italic> associates with specific methylation profile irrespective of the diagnosis and confirmed ASM for cytosines located in the vicinity of rs67899457. These genetically associated DNA methylation variations may be related to the pathophysiological mechanism differentiating the risk and non-risk haplotypes and merit further investigation.</p>

Participants were selected from a database of the Mental Health Research Center (MHRC) in Moscow, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. In brief, cases were recruited from inpatient units of local psychiatric clinics. Healthy controls were recruited by word of mouth without any participation fee, mainly from employees of research institutes, hospitals and students. Candidates were included if they were Caucasian, aged 18–45 years, completed at least a secondary school (11 years), and had no history of brain injury, psychoactive medication or other medical conditions that may affect cognitive functions.</p>
<p id="Par33">The sample consisted of 77 patients with schizophrenia (mean age, s.d., 26.87 ± 6.72 years, 49% women) and 70 healthy subjects without a family history of psychosis (mean age, s.d., 27.14 ± 6.92 years, 51% women). Sixty-seven patients suffered from schizophrenia (F20 according to the International Classification of Diseases, the 10th revision), the others were diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders F21 (n = 2), F23 (n = 3) and F25 (n = 5). All patients received complex antipsychotic medication regimes. The mean disease duration was 5.76 ± 6.01 years.

The entire procedure of the DNA methylation analysis is described in detail in Kondratyev <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. DNA was extracted with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, USA) and bisulfite converted with the EpiGentek Methylamp DNA Modification Kit (EpiGentek, USA) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The primers for each fragment were designed with the primer3 software. Their sequences are shown in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>.

The modified method employs the suppressive hybridization (“panhandle”) PCR approach to enhance the specificity of the reaction and “Y-adapter” ligation strategy for barcoding. PCR was performed using 20 ng of the converted DNA, 5 nmol of each primer,1 μmol of 5′-phosphorylated primer pU1 5′-P-GCAGTCGAACATGTAGCTGACTCAGGTCAC, 200 nmol of dNTP, 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, and 2.5 units of HotTaq-polymerase (Sileks, Russia) in a total volume of 12.5 μL. PCR included the following steps: (1) initial denaturation, 94 °С, 10 min; (2) specific PCR, 5 cycles: 94 °С, 20 s; 55 °С, 1 min; 64 °С, 4 min; (3) “panhandle” PCR, 37 cycles: 94 °С, 20 s; 64 °С, 2 min; (4) 64 °С, 10 min. To create unique barcodes, we employed 96 unique combinations of eight sequences of the type 5′-phosphate – CGAGTAGTGT - TC- unique five-letter barcode-CAAGGCACACAGGGGATAGG and 12 sequences of the type 5′-CATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTC - unique five-letter barcode -CTACACTACTCG-T. The CCS library preparation (ligation of “SMRTBell” adapters with SMRTbell Template Prep Kit, PacBio, USA) and sequencing were carried out by the University of Washington PacBio Sequencing Services with PacBio RSII (P6/C4 chemistry) and followed by post-sequencing data preparation and quality control. Adapter trimming and barcode demultiplexing were performed with the cutadapt programme. Only reads with a quality score of no less than Q30 were utilised in subsequent analysis. No errors in barcode sequences were allowed during demultiplexing. The bismark and bowtie2 software was applied for the alignment of the filtered reads to the reference human genome (hg19) and to determine the rate of methylation of individual CpGs/CpHs per haplotype. Filtration of under-converted DNA (threshold of unconverted CpH &lt;5%) and deduplication were performed with the perl script. The quality control resulted in 2192 reads for Fr_BAG5_APOPT1, 2245 reads for Fr_APOPT1_KLC1, and 2397 reads for Fr_BAG5.</p>
<p id="Par37">For each subject, the methylation levels (M) of individual cytosines were calculated as the ratio of reads with unconverted cytosine to the total amount of reads for a given cytosine. Haplotypes were determined directly from sequencing data. Only samples with the minimum 5× read depth per haplotype were analysed.</p>

<title>MS-HRM validation of the haplotype effect in Fr_APOPT1_KLC1</title>
<p id="Par38">An independent sample comprising 22 schizophrenia patients and 15 controls were derived from the MHRC database using the above-described criteria. DNA was extracted from whole blood.</p>
<p id="Par39">Primers for genotyping by HRM were designed to capture the region chr14:104060342–104060475 containing SNPs rs55798212, rs376515669, rs151151346, rs147690804 and rs12147174, which form two haplotypes in European populations: DAGAG and ICAGA. The sequences of the primers were as follows: “DAGAG1_for” CAGGCTGGTCTCAAACTCCT and “DAGAG1_rev” GTGCAGCTTCCGGTACATTA. The polymerase reaction was set in 20 ul with 25 ng DNA, 200 nM primers, 20× EvaGreen dye (Biotium, USA), 200 uM dNTP and 0.5 units of the HotStart Taq polymerase in 10x Taq Turbo buffer (Evrogen, Russia). The PCR programme included (1) preheating at 95 °C for 3 minutes; (2) 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 seconds; 62 °C for 10 seconds; 72 °C for 20 seconds. Melting curves were collected by slowly (0.025 °C/s) increasing the reaction temperature from 60 °C to 95 °C. The PCR was performed in the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 7 instrument. The positive controls for the HRM genotyping were obtained through imputation (IMPUTE2) with 1000 genome reference panel (EUR) in the laboratory-owned chip-genotyped sample. Of note, while the DAGAG1_for primer has multiple annealing sites across the genome, the PCR product of the pair of primers used is specific to the region of interest under the described reaction conditions.</p>
<p id="Par40">For MS-HRM, primers were designed to the region chr14:104060091–104060205 of bisulfite-converted DNA (Methylamp kit, EpiGentek, USA). The sequences of the primers were as follows: “876_115_for” GGGTTATTTTAGGTTAGTGAAAATAGGA and “876_115_rev” CAAAAATCATACCACTACACTCCAAC. The region includes two CpGs: CpG3_60156 and CpG4_60164 (see Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>). The PCR were set in duplicates. Unmethylated and completely methylated standards from EpiTect PCR Control Set (Qiagen, USA) were used. The polymerase reaction was set in 20 ul with 10 ng of bisulfite-converted DNA, 200 nM primers, 20x EvaGreen dye (Biotium, USA), 200 uM dNTP and 0.25 units of the EpiMark Hot Start polymerase (NEB, USA). The reaction programme included preheating at 95 °C for 3 minutes; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 seconds, 61 °C for 20 seconds, 65 °C for 40 seconds; HRM programme: 60 °C–95 °C, 0.025 °C/sec. The PCR was performed in the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 7 instrument. The raw melting data were analysed with the built-in QuantStudio Realtime Software v1.1. The difference data were used to assess ASM.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec12">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p id="Par41">We analysed each fragment as follows. First, we searched for ASM in the entire group and then separately in patients and controls using the Kruskal-Wallis tests. The Mann-Whitney U test was applied for post-hoc comparisons of haplotypes and to test sex differences in methylation. Spearman correlations between age and methylation were also examined. Next, to determine the association of methylation with case-control status, logistic regression was used, with a separate model adjusted for sex, age and haplotype was built for each methylated cytosine (1% &lt; M &lt; 99%). Since the coverage varied, which might affect the detection of a small difference between groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, we additionally compared subsamples of patients and controls using the Wilcoxon matched pairs test. For this analysis, each patient was associated with a control of the same haplotype and about the same coverage. Of note, data on smoking were not available for all subjects. For this reason, the effects of smoking at every site had been preliminary evaluated to assess whether it could represent a confounder. No significant effects were found, and we therefore did not consider smoking in subsequent analysis.</p>
<p id="Par42">The effects of haplotypes and methylation on the cognitive index were evaluated by general linear models with the inclusion of age, gender and diagnosis as covariates. The influence of haplotypes was tested in two ways. First, a genotype factor included all combinations of haplotypes in the sample. Next, the genotype factor was defined as the number of alleles with a “risk haplotype”. For each fragment, the latter comprised variants correlating with the schizophrenia risk allele T at rs12887734 (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). A separate model was built for every cytosine, with methylation values being averaged over two alleles in heterozygotes.</p>
<p id="Par43">Additional analyses were performed as follows. The exploratory factor analysis included the parallel analysis to evaluate the number of factors to retain and the oblique (Promax) rotation. The network analysis used EBICglasso estimator, with applying the nonparanormal transformation to make all data normally distributed.</p>
<p id="Par44">For each type of analyses, two-tailed tests were used, and the associations were considered significant if they passed a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.05. Most analyses were carried out with JASP 0.11.1.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>.</p>
