<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Truncating <italic>CHD8</italic> mutations are amongst the highest confidence risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) identified to date. Here, we report that <italic>Chd8</italic> heterozygous mice display increased brain size, motor delay, hypertelorism, pronounced hypoactivity, and anomalous responses to social stimuli. Whereas gene expression in the neocortex is only mildly affected at midgestation, over 600 genes are differentially expressed in the early postnatal neocortex. Genes involved in cell adhesion and axon guidance are particularly prominent amongst the downregulated transcripts. Resting-state functional MRI identified increased synchronized activity in cortico-hippocampal and auditory-parietal networks in <italic>Chd8</italic> heterozygous mutant mice, implicating altered connectivity as a potential mechanism underlying the behavioral phenotypes. Together, these data suggest that altered brain growth and diminished expression of important neurodevelopmental genes that regulate long-range brain wiring are followed by distinctive anomalies in functional brain connectivity in <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/</italic>−</sup> mice. Human imaging studies have reported altered functional connectivity in ASD patients, with long-range under-connectivity seemingly more frequent. Our data suggest that <italic>CHD8</italic> haploinsufficiency represents a specific subtype of ASD where neuropsychiatric symptoms are underpinned by long-range over-connectivity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is diagnosed on the basis of socio-communicative deficits and repetitive, perseverative behaviors with restricted interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C1">APA 2013</xref>). ASD is frequently associated with comorbidities like hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli, seizures, and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C62">Tavassoli et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C17">Croen et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C31">Jeste and Tuchman 2015</xref>). The phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of ASD has hampered the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that may underlie specific behavioral symptoms. However, the recent identification of de novo, likely gene disrupting (LGD) mutations that show highly significant associations with autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C45">Neale et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C61">Talkowski et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C50">O’Roak et al. 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C30">Iossifov et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C48">O’Roak et al. 2014</xref>) provides an opportunity to phenotype and molecularly characterize genetically defined ASD subtypes.</p>
<p>Exome sequencing studies of several thousand simplex families detected de novo, LGD mutations in the <italic>CHD8</italic> (Chromodomain Helicase DNA binding factor 8) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C45">Neale et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C61">Talkowski et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C50">O’Roak et al. 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C30">Iossifov et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C48">O’Roak et al. 2014</xref>). Patients with <italic>CHD8</italic> mutations are characterized by a high incidence of autism, macrocephaly, facial dysmorphisms, motor delay and hypotonia, intellectual disability, and gastrointestinal problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C5">Bernier et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C44">Merner et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C59">Stolerman et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C58">Stessman et al. 2017</xref>). <italic>CHD8</italic> encodes an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein of the chromodomain helicase DNA binding family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C66">Yuan et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C63">Thompson et al. 2008</xref>). The recruitment of CHD8 to gene promoters in mouse and human neural progenitors is strongly associated with transcriptional activation, while <italic>CHD8</italic> knock-down in these cells results in the reduced expression of many ASD-associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C60">Sugathan et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C16">Cotney et al. 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Three groups recently described <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/</italic></sup><sup>−</sup> mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C33">Katayama et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C27">Gompers et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C52">Platt et al. 2017</xref>). Megalencephaly, subtle but wide-spread transcriptional changes and behavioral anomalies were found in all these <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/</italic>−</sup> mouse lines. Individual studies reported attenuated expression of neural genes and derepression of REST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C33">Katayama et al. 2016</xref>), alterations in striatal neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C52">Platt et al. 2017</xref>) and a developmental RNA splicing phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C27">Gompers et al. 2017</xref>). Understanding the contribution of each of these mechanisms to the ASD phenotype remains a major challenge.</p>
<p>Altered brain connectivity, characterized by local over-connectivity and long-range under-connectivity, has been hypothesized to underpin some of the neuropsychiatric phenotypes observed in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C4">Belmonte et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C32">Just et al. 2004</xref>). Resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) studies in ASD patients have provided evidence for reduced long-range synchronization in spontaneous brain activity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C51">Picci et al. 2016</xref>). Increased long-range connectivity has also been reported in a subset of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C18">Di Martino et al. 2014</xref>), consistent with the phenotypic heterogeneity of ASD. Thus, the exact nature of aberrant functional connectivity in ASD may depend on the specific underlying aetiology.</p>
<p>Similar rsfMRI studies in ASD mouse models may help bridge the gap between ASD models and the human condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C40">Liska and Gozzi 2016</xref>). As one example, homozygous <italic>Cntnap2</italic> mouse mutants exhibit hypoconnectivity of the default mode network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C38">Liska et al. 2017</xref>), a phenotype often observed in idiopathic ASD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C13">Cherkassky et al. 2006</xref>) and recapitulating analogous clinical observations in humans with <italic>CNTNAP2</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C53">Scott-Van Zeeland et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study we generated a novel <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/</italic></sup><sup>−</sup> mouse model. We report behavioral anomalies, macrocephaly and functional over-connectivity in cortico-hippocampal networks in these mice that are prefigured by dysregulation of the cortical transcriptome in the early postnatal period.</p>

<title>
<italic>Chd8</italic> Gene Targeting</title>
<p>A 14.84 kb genomic DNA fragment was subcloned from C57BL/6 BAC clone (RP23: 318M20) into pSP72 (Promega). This fragment encompassed a 9.45 kb 5′ long homology arm (LA) and a 4.4 kb 3′ short homology arm (SA). The targeting construct was generated by inserting a loxP/FRT-PGK-gb2-Neo cassette 214 bp 3′ of exon 3 (inGenious Targeting Laboratory [iTL], Ronkonkoma, NY, USA). An additional single loxP site containing a BclI restriction site for Southern blot screening was inserted 5′ of exon 3. The final targeting construct of 18.8 kb was linearized by NotI digestion and electroporated into C57BL/6 ES cells. G418-resistent clones were selected, screened by PCR and Southern blot for successful homologous recombination. Five clones with successful recombination were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) and 2 clones (124 and 254) were injected into Balb/c blastocysts (iTL). Resulting chimaeras were bred with Flpe deleter mice on a C57BL/6J background to excise the neo cassette and produce <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>flox/+</italic></sup> mice were then crossed with <italic>β-actinCre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C36">Lewandoski and Martin 1997</xref>) to generate a <italic>Chd8</italic> null allele (<italic>Chd8</italic><sup>−</sup>). <italic>β-actinCre;Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice were crossed with C57BL/6J mice to remove the Cre transgene and establish a <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> line.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bhy058s4">
<title>Mice</title>
<p>Experimental mice were produced by <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> × C57BL/6J crosses, taking care to equalize paternal or maternal inheritance of the <italic>Chd8</italic> null allele, especially for behavioral experiments. For genotyping, genomic DNA was extracted using Proteinase K digestion or the HotSHOT method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C64">Truett et al. 2000</xref>). Genotyping reactions were then performed for the presence of <italic>Chd8</italic> wildtype and null alleles using the following primer pair: FW: CCC ACA TCA AGT GGC TGT AA, Rev: GGT AGG GAA GCA GTG TCC AG.</p>
<p>This reaction produces a PCR product of 395 bp for the null allele and 1.1 kb for the wildtype allele.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bhy058s5">
<title>Western Blot</title>
<p>Telencephalic vesicles were dissected from E12.5 embryos and total cell protein prepared by lysing in 8 M urea, 1% CHAPS, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.9) containing protease inhibitors (PMSF, Pepstatin A, Leupeptin, Aprotinin; Roche) and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Samples were loaded (10 μg total protein per lane) onto a Mini-PROTEAN precast gel (Bio-Rad) and resolved using gel electrophoresis. Protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) which was then blocked in 5% nonfat milk powder (Bio-Rad) and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) in TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST), followed by incubation with anti-CHD8 primary antibody (rabbit anti-Chd8 N-terminal, Bethyl Laboratories (cat#: A301-224 A), 1:5000) in 3% nonfat milk powder and 1% BSA in TBST overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the membrane was incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Millipore), HRP detected with Clarity ECL reagent (Bio-Rad) and the membrane imaged using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc system. The same membrane was subsequently incubated with anti-GAPDH primary antibody (rabbit anti-GAPDH, Abcam (cat#: ab9485), 1:40 000) overnight at 4 °C and probed with HRP-conjugate and imaged as before. Relative protein quantity was calculated using Bio-Rad ImageLab software.</p>

<sec id="bhy058s6">
<title>X-ray Computed Tomography</title>
<p>Fixed heads from adult (26–27 days old) <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> and <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice (<italic>n</italic> = 7 of each from 2 different litters) were scanned using a GE Locus SP microCT scanner. The specimens were immobilized using cotton gauze and scanned to produce 28 μm voxel size volumes, using a X-ray tube voltage of 80kVp and a tube current of 80μA. An aluminum filter (0.05 mm) was used to adjust the energy distribution of the X-ray source. Reconstructions of computer tomography scans, images and measurements were done in MicroView 2.5.0 software (Parallax Innovations, ON, Canada). Each 3D landmark point was recorded, twice for each sample, using the 3D point recording built-in tool within the same software, with the operator blind to the genotypes. The distances between the landmarks were normalized for each sample to the average of the wild-type littermates. Graphics of the plotted data and statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.0 h for Mac OS X (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA USA, <uri xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</uri>). Unpaired Student <italic>t</italic>-tests were applied to analyze the variation between the 2 groups, for every distance between 2 specific 3D landmark points. 3D coordinate locations of a total of 22 biological relevant cranial landmarks were chosen based on a landmark list for adult mouse skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C28">Hill et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bhy058s7">
<title>Behavioral Assessments</title>
<p>Mice for behavioral testing were housed, marked for identification and behaviors assessed essentially as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C65">Whittaker et al. (2017a)</xref>. Different batches of mice were used for (1) recording pup USVs and spontaneous motor behaviors, and (2) adult behaviors (9–12 weeks of age at the start of testing; 19–22 weeks of age at the end of testing). For adult behaviors, tests were carried out in the following order: rotarod, grip strength, open field, self-grooming, marble burying, adult social investigation, 3 chamber social approach, light/dark test, olfactory habituation/dishabituation and Morris water maze.</p>
<sec id="bhy058s8">
<title>General Activity Measurements</title>
<p>General activity was measured using a running wheel paradigm. Mice were housed individually under a 12 h:12 h light-dark cycle (lights on at 8 am; lights off at 8 pm) in a light-, air-, temperature-controlled ventilated cabinet (Arrowmight, Hereford, UK). Running-wheel cages were equipped with an infrared sensor (Bilaney consultant Ltd, Sevenoaks, UK) connected to a computer. Data were collected in 1-min bins using Clocklab software (Actimetrics, Inc, Wilmette, IL, USA). Mice were continuously monitored undisturbed from the day they were placed in the running wheel cages and their general activity during the light versus dark phase were compared over the first 7 days.</p>

<title>Resting-State fMRI</title>
<p>rsfMRI experiments were performed on 15–18 weeks old mice (<italic>n</italic> = 23 <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup>; <italic>n</italic> = 19 <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/</italic>−</sup>). Animals were prepared for imaging as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C24">Ferrari et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C54">Sforazzini et al. 2016</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (5% induction), intubated and artificially ventilated (2% maintenance). Blood pressure was monitored continuously by cannulating the left femoral artery, also allowing for terminal arterial blood sampling. Administration of isoflurane was ceased after surgery and substituted with halothane (0.75%). Functional data acquisition commenced 45 min after isoflurane cessation. To rule out possible genotype-dependent differences in anesthesia sensitivity we continuously recorded 2 independent readouts previously shown to be linearly correlated with anesthesia depth: arterial blood pressure and amplitude of cortical BOLD signal fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C57">Steffey et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C41">Liu et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C67">Zhan et al. 2014</xref>). Arterial blood pressure (<italic>P</italic> = 0.79; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>A) and the amplitude of BOLD signal fluctuations of motor cortex (<italic>P</italic> = 0.56; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>B) did not significantly differ between <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/</italic></sup><sup>−</sup> mice and littermate controls, eliminating a confounding contribution of anesthesia. In vivo images were obtained using a 7.0 T MRI scanner (Bruker Biospin, Milan), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C38">Liska et al. 2017</xref>). Signal transmission and reception were achieved using a 72 mm birdcage transmit coil and a 4-channel solenoid coil. For each session, high-resolution anatomical images were acquired using a fast spin echo sequence based on the following parameters: repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) 5500/60 ms, matrix 192 × 192, field of view 2 × 2 cm<sup>3</sup>, 24 coronal slices, and slice thickness 0.5 mm. Cocentred BOLD rsfMRI time series were acquired using an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following parameters: TR/TE 1200/15 ms, flip angle 30°, matrix 100 × 100, field of views 2 × 2 cm<sup>2</sup>, 24 coronal slices, slice thickness 0.5 mm, 500 volumes, and 10 min total acquisition time.

<title>Functional Connectivity Analyses</title>
<p>To allow for T<sub>1</sub> equilibration effects, the first 20 volumes of rsfMRI data were removed. The time series were then despiked, corrected for motion and spatially normalized to an in-house mouse brain template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C55">Sforazzini et al. 2014</xref>). Normalized data had a spatial resolution of 0.1042 × 0.1042 × 0.5 mm<sup>3</sup> (192 × 192 × 24 matrix). Mean ventricular signal (averaged rsfMRI time course within a reference ventricular mask) and head motion traces were regressed out of each time series. No genotype-dependent differences were observed in ventricular volume, as measured by the dimensions of individual ventricular masks. All rsfMRI time series were then spatially smoothed (full width at half maximum of 0.6 mm) and band-pass filtered using a frequency window of 0.01–0.1 Hz.</p>
<p>To identify brain regions displaying genotype-dependent differences in functional connectivity in an unbiased manner, we calculated global rsfMRI connectivity maps for all subjects, as described previously in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C39">Liska et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C38">2017</xref>). A previously described seed-based approach was then used to examine between-group differences in the intensity and scope of long-range rsfMRI correlation networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C54">Sforazzini et al. 2016</xref>).</p>

Paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. Quality of the raw sequencing data was checked using FastQC version 0.11.2 (Andrews 2010; available at: <uri xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc</uri>) and trimming of adaptor sequences was performed using Trim Galore! version 0.4.1 (Krueger 2012; available at: <uri xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/</uri>).

Differential expression testing was performed using DESeq2 version 1.10.1, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C42">Love et al. 2014</xref>). Gene ontology analysis and functional classification was performed using DAVID with all detected DEGs below a 0.05 FDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C29">Huang et al. 2009</xref>).

<title>Gene Expression Enrichment Analysis</title>
<p>In total, 4345 gene expression images corresponding to 4082 unique genes were downloaded from the Allen Institute’s Mouse Brain Atlas coronal expression dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C35">Lein et al. 2007</xref>). The coronal expression dataset is limited by the fact that it only partially covers the genome and was defined in a biased manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C46">Ng et al. 2009</xref>). However, it offers higher data quality and resolution especially in lateral cortical areas including auditory cortex, compared with the sagittal dataset. This dataset, obtained via in situ hybridization, consisted of 3D spatial expression images aligned to a single reference model and summarized over the whole mouse brain at a 200 μm isotropic resolution. Specifically, the gene expression energies, defined by the Allen Institute as the sum of expressing pixel intensities divided by the sum of all pixels in a subdivision, were obtained. Expression data were obtained from adult (P56) male C57Bl/6.</p>
<p>Mean gene expression energies were extracted under a set of Allen Institute-defined segmentations, resulting in vectors of expression values for each gene that describe their spatial expression patterns. To account for differences in probe affinities that subsequently affect the total expression levels reported in the images, expression values for each gene were further normalized by dividing by the total expression (summed over regions) for that gene.</p>
<p>Next, we extracted rsfMRI time series data under the aforementioned set of segmentations. This was achieved by aligning, via ANTS (Avants et al. 2009; available at: <uri xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/10380/3113">http://hdl.handle.net/10 380/3113</uri>), the Allen Institute’s average 2-photon microscopy template over which the parcellations were defined to a high-resolution (56 μm) T2-weighted MR template of the mouse brain, resulting in an atlas defined on MRI data. This atlas was then combined with the MAGeT procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C11">Chakravarty et al. 2013</xref>) implemented in the PydPiper framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C26">Friedel et al. 2014</xref>) to generate segmentations for each of the T2-weighted images acquired during the course of the rsfMRI experiments.</p>
<p>We focused on the pair of regions that showed strongest over-connectivity under these parcellations and determined candidate genes by choosing those that had the highest normalized expression in both regions, compared with all other genes. Candidates that were in the top 20% of genes for both regions were passed through an enrichment analysis via the GOrilla tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C22">Eden et al. 2009</xref>; <uri xlink:href="http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il/">http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il/</uri>). Another set of candidates were obtained by ranking each gene by the sum of their normalized expression values in both regions (equivalent to the L1 distance); this set also favors genes with high expression in one of the 2 regions, along with both regions. For enrichment analyses of ranked lists of genes, GOrilla automatically thresholds the list independently for each GO term so that the optimal enrichment is found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C22">Eden et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>To establish specificity of the enriched gene ontology terms, we performed equivalent analyses between 10 randomly chosen regional pairs (DG–FRP, LA–MB, OLF–IG, BLA–P-sat, MY-sat–DG, PAL–GU, P-sat–LZ, PAA–VERM, AON–HEM, MY-mot–MB). The number of returned GO terms was generally low and did not show an enrichment for neuronal development terms.</p>

<p>In the 3-chamber sociability test, adult <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/</italic></sup><sup>−</sup> mice spent significantly more time in the chamber with the novel age- and sex-matched conspecific mouse than in the other chambers, indicative of normal sociability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>D</italic>). Interestingly, rather than displaying sociability deficits, mutant mice spent slightly, but significantly more time in the chamber containing the mouse, compared with controls (*<italic>P</italic> = 0.029; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>D</italic>). <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice also spent more time investigating conspecific mice in a reciprocal social interaction test (*<italic>P</italic> = 0.015; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>E</italic>). A quantitative olfactory habituation/dishabituation test revealed an increased interest in an odour with social significance (urine) in <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice compared with controls (*<italic>P</italic> = 0.03, ***<italic>P</italic> = 0.0002; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>F</italic>). No difference in the time spent investigating a nonsocial (banana) odour was observed, implying an increased interest specifically in social cues and an otherwise normal capacity for odour discrimination (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>F</italic>).</p>
<p>Examination of these animals in the open field arena revealed a marked hypoactivity in <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/</italic></sup><sup>−</sup> mice (***<italic>P</italic> = 10<sup>−9</sup>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>G</italic>,<italic>H</italic>). The hypoactive phenotype was also observed in mutant mice in their homecage environment by measuring activity on a running wheel over a 1-week period (*<italic>P</italic> = 0.019; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>I</italic>). The open field test did not show any evidence of anxiety in these mice, that is, an increased reluctance to enter the inner, most exposed area of an open field arena (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>J</italic>). This was confirmed in the light/dark box test that showed no difference between wildtype and mutant mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>K</italic>). Forelimb grip strength was slightly but significantly reduced in mutant mice (*<italic>P</italic> = 0.045 [males] *<italic>P</italic> = 0.042 [females]; Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>L</italic>) but <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/</italic></sup><sup>−</sup> mice showed normal motor abilities on the revolving rotarod, indicating that a reduced capacity to perform motor tasks was unlikely to be the cause of the hypoactive phenotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>M</italic>). No evidence of repetitive behaviors was observed by assessing marble burying and self-grooming behaviors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>N</italic>,<italic>O</italic>). In fact, mutants showed slightly delayed marble burying behavior, most likely due to their general hypoactivity (*<italic>P</italic> = 0.04, ***<italic>P</italic> = 0.0004; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>N</italic>).</p>
<p>Spatial learning abilities and cognitive flexibility were assessed in the hippocampus-dependent Morris water maze test. <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice performed normally in the learning part of this test (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>P</italic>). In a reversal paradigm, these mice were also indistinguishable from wildtype littermates, implying normal cognitive, spatial learning abilities and flexibility (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>P</italic>). Finally, no differences in the number of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of pups separated from the nest were recorded, indicating no obvious communication deficits (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>Q</italic>).</p>
<p>As male mice from this adult behavioral cohort were used for structural MRI analyses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F1">1</xref><italic>G</italic>,<italic>H</italic>) we were able to correlate their brain volume with specific behaviors. We observed significant inverse correlations between activity in the open field and hippocampal volume (*<italic>P</italic> = 0.012; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S3A</xref>), as well as cortical volume (*<italic>P</italic> = 0.036; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S3B</xref>). Overall brain volume and hypoactivity showed a weaker correlation (<italic>P</italic> = 0.092; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S3C</xref>) hinting at a degree of specificity for cortical and hippocampal regions.</p>
<p>In summary, <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice displayed no socio-communicative deficits, but rather exhibited a heightened interest in social cues. No evidence for perseverative and repetitive behaviors were observed. <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> pups showed evidence for hyperactivity and delayed motor development while adult <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/</italic></sup><sup>−</sup> mice exhibited a hypoactive phenotype, which was significantly correlated with overgrowth in cortical and hippocampal regions.</p>

<italic>Chd8</italic> Haploinsufficiency Causes General Growth Delay but Postnatal Brain Overgrowth</title>
<p>To determine whether the brain overgrowth phenotype was already present at early postnatal stages when developmental delay was evident, we measured body and brain weights from birth. <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> pups showed significant growth retardation from postnatal day 4 onwards and into early adulthood (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F3">3</xref><italic>A</italic>).

A group-wise comparison confirmed the significant increase in normalized brain weight in <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice compared with wildtype littermates (20.4% increase, ***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F3">3</xref><italic>C</italic>). At P7, normalized brain weights were already significantly larger in <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/</italic></sup><sup>−</sup> pups compared with wildtype littermate controls (9.3%, ***<italic>P</italic> = 0.0009) with more subtle differences between the groups observed at P0 (6.7%, *<italic>P</italic> = 0.01).</p>

<p>Together, these analyses suggested that subtle, but cumulative differences in brain growth over time may be responsible for small increases in brain size. Indeed, we did not detect any significant differences in cortical ventricular zone (VZ) proliferation as measured by phosphohistone H3 immunostaining at E12.5, E16.5, or P0 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F3">3</xref><italic>E</italic>,<italic>F</italic>).

Almost all (53/56 = 95%) of these ASD-associated genes were downregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). We also overlapped our gene set with high confidence (SFARI categories 1 and 2) ASD candidates (<italic>P</italic> = 3.26 × 10<sup>−4</sup> [OR = 4.61]; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F4">4</xref><italic>D</italic>).

<p>Amongst the upregulated gene set, the most significant KEGG pathways, molecular functions and biological processes were related to protein transport, the ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation, whereas the downregulated gene set included categories related to cell adhesion, axonal guidance and calcium signaling pathways (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F4">4</xref><italic>E</italic>, <italic>F</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S2A, Supplementary Tables S5–10</xref>).

The observation that Suz12 targets are over-represented in the downregulated gene set offers a potential mechanistic explanation for the downregulation of some of these genes.

<italic>Chd8<sup>+/−</sup></italic> Mice Exhibit Over-Connectivity in Cortical and Hippocampal Networks</title>
<p>The significant enrichment of cell adhesion and axonal guidance genes in the downregulated gene set at P5 led us to hypothesize that long-range connectivity might be altered in <italic>Chd8</italic> heterozygous neocortices. To test this hypothesis, we performed rsfMRI to probe functional brain connectivity in mature brain networks. Synchronous fluctuations in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signals in different brain regions are used as an indication of them being functionally connected. A regionally unbiased analysis for long-range connectivity changes revealed hotspots for increased connectivity in <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/</italic>−</sup> mice compared with wildtype littermate controls, which included the entorhinal, retrosplenial, auditory cortical and posterior hippocampal areas (<italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 FEW cluster-corrected, with cluster-defining threshold <italic>t</italic><sub>24</sub> &gt; 2.06, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; orange areas in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F5">5</xref><italic>A</italic>). This analysis suggested that hyperconnected areas were predominantly located on the left side of the brain. A reanalysis of these results without the use of cluster correction revealed the presence of foci with increased connectivity also on the right side, mirroring the effects observed on the left (dark red areas in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F5">5</xref><italic>A</italic>). Interhemispheric mapping of rsfMRI connectivity strength in previously characterized rsfMRI network systems of the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C55">Sforazzini et al. 2014</xref>), revealed increased cortical connectivity in auditory regions (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, uncorrected), although the effect did not survive FDR correction (<italic>q</italic> = 0.05) for multiple comparison across the rsfMRI networks probed. We next used a seed-based approach to specifically probe regions with altered connectivity to these hotspots to reveal the brain networks affected. Most strikingly, this revealed a reciprocal increase in connectivity between ventral hippocampus and auditory cortical regions in <italic>Chd8</italic> mutant mice (<italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 FEW cluster-corrected, with cluster-defining threshold <italic>t</italic><sub>24</sub> &gt; 2.06, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F5">5</xref><italic>B</italic>,<italic>C</italic>). Seed placement in the auditory cortex revealed increased connectivity of this region with both cingulate and entorhinal cortices (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F5">5</xref><italic>B</italic>), whereas a hippocampal seed uncovered strengthened long-range connectivity with somatosensory and visual cortices (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F5">5</xref><italic>C</italic>).</p>

<p>Previous studies suggested that neurodevelopmental genes show correlated expression patterns in brain areas that are connected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C25">French and Pavlidis 2011</xref>). To test if the same applies to our model we harnessed gene expression data contained within the Allen brain atlas to identify genes that are highly expressed in hippocampal and auditory areas. Using expression data from the Allen brain atlas, we determined genes with high relative expression in both the hippocampal CA2 region and auditory areas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S4A, B; Supplementary Table S11</xref>; see Methods for details). Enriched genes preferentially clustered into GO term categories relating to synaptic development and function, axonal structure and neuron projections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S11</xref>). To determine if any of these highly expressed genes are likely contributing to a developing process linked to the functional connectivity phenotype, we compared them with the DEG set from our P5 RNAseq experiment. This analysis revealed several axon guidance and cell adhesion genes that are preferentially expressed in CA2 and auditory areas at adult stages and whose expression is dysregulated at P5 (e.g., <italic>Cdh2, Cdh11, Cdk5r1, Epha4, Fat3, Nrcam, Robo1</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S11</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, two independent experimental approaches at different time points identified specific axon guidance and cell adhesion genes, further strengthening our hypothesis that dysregulation of these genes may be important for the functional connectivity phenotype and provides a solid platform for future detailed analyses.</p>
<p>We conclude that early postnatal gene expression changes prefigure abnormal functional connectivity in <italic>Chd8</italic> heterozygous mice. Our findings suggest that abnormalities in specific cortical–hippocampal circuits involved in sensory processing may underlie some of the unique anomalous behaviors observed in <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice, and by extension, the neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with <italic>CHD8</italic> mutations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we identify a crucial developmental role for <italic>Chd8</italic> in regulating axon guidance gene expression in the early postnatal period and, for the first time, associate <italic>Chd8</italic> haploinsufficiency with functional over-connectivity of specific brain areas. A recent rsfMRI study involving over 150 male probands with an ASD diagnosis and nearly 200 typically developing individuals described over-connectivity between sensory cortices and subcortical structures as a central feature in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C10">Cerliani et al. 2015</xref>). It will be very important to determine whether these specific functional connectivity abnormalities are present in patients with <italic>CHD8</italic> mutations.</p>
<p>While we cannot at this stage establish a direct causal relationship between transcriptional, connectivity and behavioral phenotypes, our data suggest that functionally altered connectivity of sensory cortical areas in <italic>Chd8</italic> mutant mice underpins behavioral phenotypes. In concordance with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C33">Katayama et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C27">Gompers et al. 2017</xref>), our data suggest that moderate expression changes of many genes, rather than severe disruption of few genes, cooperate to give rise to phenotypic changes in <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/</italic></sup><sup>−</sup> mice. A total of 21 axon guidance genes are downregulated in the early postnatal period in our <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). Therefore, experimental validation of a causal link will be challenging as multiple axon guidance pathways may contribute to the functional connectivity and behavioral phenotypes.</p>

<italic>Chd8<sup>+/−</sup></italic> Mice as a Model for Human <italic>CHD8</italic> Haploinsufficiency Syndrome</title>
<p>
<italic>CHD8</italic> is one of the highest confidence ASD-associated genes to emerge from recent exome sequencing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C45">Neale et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C61">Talkowski et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C49">O’Roak et al. 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C5">Bernier et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C30">Iossifov et al. 2014</xref>). We therefore expected <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice to present with robust, autism-associated behaviors. <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice displayed delayed motor development and distinctive behavioral anomalies that featured a heightened interest in social cues, but surprisingly did not include repetitive and perseverative behaviors or communication deficits.</p>
<p>In agreement with other published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C33">Katayama et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C27">Gompers et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C52">Platt et al. 2017</xref>) we did not observe repetitive behaviors in <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice. While Katayama et al. reported increased persistence following directional reversal in the T-maze forced alteration test, suggestive of perseverative behaviors, we did not find such evidence in the Morris water maze test. This may be due to the higher complexity of decision making in the Morris water maze compared with the binary choice required by the T-maze. In addition, <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice consistently did not show any evidence for perseverative behaviors in the marble burying test (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>N</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C27">Gompers et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C52">Platt et al. 2017</xref>), suggesting that any perseverative behaviors in <italic>Chd8</italic> mutants may be subtle or task-specific. <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice show an apparent heightened interest in social cues, indicating that altering the <italic>Chd8</italic> gene dosage during development can impact socially motivated behaviors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>E</italic>). An increased duration of contacts in the social investigation test was also seen in two other published behavioral analyses of <italic>Chd8</italic> heterozygous mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C33">Katayama et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C52">Platt et al. 2017</xref>). Katayama et al. additionally described a reduced duration of active social contacts in <italic>Chd8</italic> mutants, although all test groups showed evidence for high levels of anxiety, a known behavioral confound. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C33">Katayama et al. (2016)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C52">Platt et al. (2017)</xref> further reported normal sociability but minor deficits in social novelty in the 3-chamber social approach task in <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice.</p>
<p>Despite not observing typical ASD-like behaviors, we did detect a delay in early motor development in <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhy058F2">2</xref><italic>A</italic>,<italic>B</italic>). There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that delayed motor milestones in toddlers predate and predict the emergence and severity of language deficits in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C3">Bedford et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C14">Chinello et al. 2016</xref>). Of note, the only available longitudinal case reports in the literature also describe early motor delay in both patients with <italic>CHD8</italic> haploinsufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C44">Merner et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C59">Stolerman et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>A key characteristic of autism is restricted behaviors or interests, which often manifest as hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory stimuli, for example, excessive smelling or touching of objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C15">Constantino and Charman 2016</xref>). One may speculate that the excessive smelling of social cues and the increased duration of social contacts observed in our <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice may be indicative of behavioral abnormalities in these domains.</p>

<title>Dysregulation of the Cortical Transcriptome in <italic>Chd8</italic> Heterozygous Mice</title>
<p>Gene expression analysis showed little evidence for transcriptional dysregulation at midembryonic stages, but revealed disruption of key developmental processes involved in establishing brain connectivity in the early postnatal neocortex. These data are in agreement with a recent study where Gompers and colleagues only found a handful of genes differentially expressed in bulk forebrain at E12.5 and E14.5, while detecting subtle, more widespread changes perinatally (E17.5: 89 DEGs, P0: 35 DEGs; FDR &lt; 0.05) and more pronounced dysregulation at adult stages (295 DEGs; FDR &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C27">Gompers et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Many of the transcripts that were dysregulated in the early postnatal period are themselves ASD-associated genes and were predominantly downregulated. Our gene expression studies therefore provided strong evidence that a variety of genes, pathways and developmental processes implicated in ASD might be dysregulated by <italic>Chd8</italic> haploinsufficiency.</p>
<p>An expanding number of ASD risk genes have roles in axon guidance, synapse development and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C7">Bourgeron 2015</xref>). We detected significant enrichment of genes in these functional categories in our downregulated gene set, including the major Slit protein receptors <italic>Robo1</italic> and <italic>Robo2</italic>, <italic>EhpA4</italic> and <italic>5</italic>, and cell adhesion molecules such as <italic>L1CAM</italic> and <italic>Cdh2, 5, 8</italic>, and <italic>11</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Tables S3 and S6</xref>). Similarly, Gompers et al. found enrichment for axon growth and guidance factors amongst downregulated genes in their M3 module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C27">Gompers et al. 2017</xref>). Moreover, Sugathan et al. showed enrichment for genes associated with the GO terms “cell adhesion,” “axon guidance,” and “neuron differentiation” amongst downregulated genes in <italic>CHD8</italic>- deficient human iPSC-derived neural progenitors. This suggests that these important developmental gene sets are regulated by CHD8 in both mouse and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C60">Sugathan et al. 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, our data identify early postnatal development as a key stage at which transcriptional changes caused by <italic>Chd8</italic> heterozygosity may precipitate ASD-related phenotypes. They further indicate that <italic>Chd8</italic> heterozygosity defines a transcriptional program characterized by diminished expression of key neurodevelopmental regulators that are predicted to affect cellular functions essential for the appropriate wiring of the brain.</p>

<title>Increased Functional Connectivity in Sensory Networks</title>
<p>Significantly, functional connectivity was altered in the adult brain of <italic>Chd8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice. Our rsfMRI analysis found evidence for over-connectivity between sensory regions in the neocortex and limbic cortical regions. Most notably, the auditory cortex showed a global increase in functional connectivity that involved connections to other cortical areas and reciprocal strengthening of connectivity to the ventral hippocampus. It seems likely that altered connectivity is the consequence of some of the disrupted brain wiring pathways uncovered by our RNA-seq experiments. Encouragingly, the expression of several axon guidance and cell adhesion genes, which are dysregulated at P5, is enriched in hippocampus and auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S11</xref>); nevertheless, this hypothesis will require further in-depth scrutiny. More importantly, it will be critical to investigate whether these connectivity changes are pertinent to any of the behavioral anomalies in <italic>Chd8</italic> heterozygous mice or the ASD phenotype in patients with <italic>CHD8</italic> haploinsufficiency. The over-connectivity in networks involving the auditory cortex and the hippocampus is intriguing. Auditory processing deficits in ASD are well documented and range from a lack of lateralization to a general delay in network maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C8">Bruneau et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C23">Edgar et al. 2015</xref>), although the functional behavioral consequences of these deficits are not clear. Furthermore, over-responsivity to sensory stimuli is frequently observed in ASD patients, can affect all sensory modalities and appears to be positively correlated with the severity of autistic traits (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C62">Tavassoli et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C56">Sinclair et al. 2017</xref>). Although a definitive causal relationship is difficult to establish, it has been hypothesized that sensory over-responsivity may trigger compensatory and avoidance behaviors that promote the emergence of core behavioral autism traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C43">Marco et al. 2011</xref>). In support, tactile hypersensitivity during critical developmental periods has been shown to underlie anxiety and social deficits in a number of genetic ASD mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhy058C47">Orefice et al. 2016</xref>). Whether this would be equally the case for other sensory modalities and a general mechanistic feature in the behavioral aetiology of ASD remains an open question.</p>
