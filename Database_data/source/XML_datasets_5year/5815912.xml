<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="P1">Diabetes is a debilitating health care problem affecting 422 million people around the world. Diabetic patients suffer from multi-systemic complications that can cause mortality and morbidity. Recent advancements in high throughput next generation RNA-sequencing and computational algorithms led to the discovery of aberrant post-transcriptional gene regulatory programs in diabetes. However, very little is known about how these regulatory programs are mis-regulated in diabetes. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are important regulators of post-transcriptional RNA networks, which are also dysregulated in diabetes. Human genetic studies provide new evidence that polymorphisms and mutations in RBPs are linked to diabetes. Therefore, we will discuss the emerging roles of RBPs in abnormal post-transcriptional gene expression in diabetes. Questions that will be addressed are: Which post-transcriptional mechanisms are disrupted in diabetes? Which RBPs are responsible for such changes under diabetic conditions? How are RBPs altered in diabetes? How does dysregulation of RBPs contribute to diabetes? Can we target RBPs using RNA-based methods to restore gene expression profiles in diabetic patients? Studying the evolving roles of RBPs in diabetes is critical not only for a comprehensive understanding of diabetes pathogenesis, but also to design RNA-based therapeutic approaches for diabetic complications.</p>
