<abstract>
<p id="P1">Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate narrative (i.e., storytelling) difficulties which can significantly impact their ability to form and maintain social relationships. However, existing research has not comprehensively documented these impairments in more open-ended, emotionally evocative situations common to daily interactions. Computational linguistic measures offer a promising complement to traditional hand-coding methods of narrative analysis, and in this study were applied together with hand coding of narratives elicited with emotionally salient scenes from the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT). Nineteen individuals with ASD and 14 typically developing (TD) controls were asked to tell stories about six images from the TAT. Both structural and qualitative aspects of narrative were assessed using a hand-coding system and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), an automated computational measure of semantic similarity. Individuals with ASD demonstrated significant difficulties with the use of complex syntax to integrate their narratives and problems explaining characters’ intentions. These and other key narrative skills were strongly related to narrative competence scores derived from LSA, which also distinguished the ASD group from controls. Together, results underscore key narrative impairments in ASD and support the promise of LSA as a valuable tool for the quantitative assessment of complex language abilities.</p>
