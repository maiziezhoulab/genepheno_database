<p id="P1">Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), HDAC1 and HDAC2 often associate together in protein complexes with transcriptional factors such as methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Given their high degree of sequence identity, we examined the functional redundancy of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in mature brain. We demonstrate that postnatal forebrain-specific deletion of both <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic> in mice impacts neuronal survival and results in an excessive grooming phenotype caused by dysregulation of the obsessive-compulsive disorder-implicated gene SAP90/PSD-95-associated protein 3 (<italic>SAPAP3</italic>) in striatum. Moreover, HDAC1- and HDAC2-dependent regulation of SAPAP3 expression requires <italic>Mecp2</italic>, the gene involved in the pathophysiology of Rett syndrome. We show that postnatal forebrain-specific deletion of <italic>Mecp2</italic> causes excessive grooming, which is rescued by restoring striatal <italic>Sapap3</italic> expression. Our results provide novel insight into the upstream regulation of <italic>SAPAP3</italic>, and establish the essential role of striatal HDAC1, HDAC2, and MeCP2 for suppression of repetitive behaviors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a class of enzymes that remove acetyl groups from histone tails and promote chromatin remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The role of individual HDACs in the brain is an active area of investigation with recent data suggesting that the Class I HDAC, HDAC2, is a negative regulator of learning and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. HDAC2 shares 85% sequence identity with another Class I family member, HDAC1, however loss of HDAC1 in the brain does not impact learning and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The target genes of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in brain are unclear and distinguishing their functional roles is complicated by the fact that HDAC1 and HDAC2 can also associate to form a complex with other proteins, such as Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) to regulate gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">MeCP2 is a transcription factor known to play important roles in mediating complex behavior and synaptic function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Loss of function mutations in <italic>MECP2</italic> lead to the neurological disorder Rett syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> (RTT), and genomic duplications spanning <italic>MECP2</italic> also result in neurological abnormalities with autistic features and behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. RTT patients display a range of phenotypes including repetitive behaviors such as stereotypical hand movements, similar to phenotypes observed in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that mice lacking MeCP2 recapitulate several of the behavioral aspects of RTT, including social and motor deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">In the present study we were interested in examining whether postnatal deletion of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 results in the phenotypes observed in mice with a brain specific deletion of HDAC2. Rather surprisingly, we identified a functional redundancy between HDAC1 and HDAC2 in neuronal survival that impacted the lifespan of the <italic>HDAC1/HDAC2</italic> double knockout mice. We also observed exacerbated grooming behavior that was due to dysregulation of SAPAP3 in the striatum, with a similar phenotype to conditional <italic>Mecp2</italic> knockout mice. We were able to rescue the grooming phenotype in conditional <italic>Mecp2</italic> knockout mice by expression of SAPAP3 in the striatum suggesting that <italic>SAPAP3</italic> is a putative target gene of MeCP2 in association with HDAC1 and HDAC2. Collectively, our data reveal unexpected negative effects of HDAC inhibition in postnatal brain as well as uncover the role of HDAC1, HDAC2, and MeCP2 in regulation of <italic>SAPAP3</italic>, a gene linked to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</p>

<title>Postnatal loss of <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic> results in behavioral abnormalities and premature death</title>
<p id="P5">To examine the role of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in mature brain, we generated mice with forebrain specific deletions of both genes during postnatal development. Homozygous <italic>HDAC1<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>/HDAC2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> were crossed to calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II <italic>(CaMKII)-Cre93</italic> mice to generate the conditional deletion of <italic>Hdac1</italic> and <italic>Hdac2</italic> (referred to as cDKO) in forebrain regions during postnatal development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. To determine whether potential phenotypes were due to the loss of both <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic> and not the result of the deletion of either individual HDAC, conditional <italic>HDAC1</italic> knockout (<italic>HDAC1</italic> cKO) mice as well as conditional <italic>HDAC2</italic> knockout (<italic>HDAC2</italic> cKO) mice were generated using <italic>CaMKII-Cre93</italic>. The cDKO mice were born at normal Mendelian ratios and appeared indistinguishable from littermate controls (CTLs) at birth. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis of the cDKO mice at 8 weeks of age confirmed the deletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in forebrain regions including frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum with no change in expression in cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 a–d</xref>), consistent with the original characterization of the <italic>CaMKII-Cre93</italic> line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Individual <italic>HDAC1</italic> cKO or <italic>HDAC2</italic> cKO mice showed a similar pattern of deletion of the gene of interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The cDKO mice were indistinguishable in body weight from littermate CTLs for the first few weeks of life, however, at 6 weeks of age the cDKO mice began to lose weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) and all cDKO mice died at ~9 weeks of age. Mice with a single copy of either allele did not show alterations in weight nor early postnatal lethality (data not shown). The <italic>HDAC1</italic> cKO or <italic>HDAC2</italic> cKO mice were also indistinguishable from littermate CTLs in weight and had a normal lifespan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Collectively, these data are consistent with loss of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 in postnatal forebrain regions impacting the viability of the mice.</p>
<p id="P6">Necroscopic analysis of cDKO mice did not reveal peripheral abnormalities (data not shown). However, there was a significant reduction in overall brain size and weight in 8 week old cDKO mice compared to age matched CTLs, which appeared to be due to a decrease in the size of the cortical areas, consistent with the regional deletion of <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). The <italic>CaMKII-Cre93</italic> line expresses Cre recombinase at postnatal days 10–14, therefore we examined the brain mass of cDKO mice at a time point coinciding with early expression of Cre recombinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, postnatal day 16, and found no difference compared to CTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), demonstrating that the reduction in brain size occurred after the deletion of <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic>. We also observed no differences in brain weight in 8 week old <italic>HDAC1</italic> cKO or <italic>HDAC2</italic> cKO mice, further supporting that deletion of both <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic> led to the reduction in brain mass (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c,d</xref>). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining revealed aberrant cellular patterns and layering in cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>
<bold>and enlarged</bold>) and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>
<bold>and enlarged</bold>) of cDKO mice compared to CTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d,h</xref>, <bold>and enlarged</bold>). Rather surprisingly, there were no cell morphology abnormalities observed in the striatum of cDKOs compared to CTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f,g</xref>) although HDAC1 and HDAC2 expression was significantly reduced in this brain region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a–d</xref>), as <italic>CaMKII–Cre93</italic> is known to express Cre recombinase in medium spiny neurons of the striatum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. There were also no detectable differences in the cerebellar structure between cDKO and CTL mice, consistent with the forebrain specific deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j,k</xref>). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) revealed increased apoptosis in the cortex and hippocampus, but not in the striatum or cerebellum of cDKOs compared to CTLs consistent with the regional morphological changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), demonstrating a functional redundancy of HDAC1 and HDAC2 on cell survival in cortex and hippocampus.</p>
<p id="P7">We examined whether 6 week old cDKO mice, at the time of onset for weight loss, had alterations in locomotor activity or anxiety related behavior. The cDKO mice were significantly hypoactive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>
<bold>and inset</bold>) and spent less time in the center of the arena and more time in the periphery in the open field test, suggestive of an increase in anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>). We also assessed these behaviors in a separate cohort of 3 week old mice, a time point ~1 week after the expression of Cre recombinase, and found that cDKO mice were significantly hypoactive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>
<bold>and inset</bold>) with heightened anxiety-related behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>), showing that loss of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 rapidly contributed to this phenotype.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title><italic>HDAC1/HDAC2</italic> cDKO mice develop a facial lesion and display excessive grooming similar to OCD-like behaviors</title>
<p id="P8">We observed that every cDKO mouse developed a severe lesion on the face and neck regions at ~7 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The fur lesion could not be attributed to fighting with cage mates as the lesion still appeared in each cDKO mice that was singly housed after weaning (3 weeks of age prior to the appearance of the fur lesion; data not shown), and not in any CTL or <italic>HDAC1/2</italic> double heterozygous cage mates, suggesting the lesions were not the result of allogrooming. We also did not observe facial or neck lesions on any of the <italic>HDAC1</italic> cKO or <italic>HDAC2</italic> cKO mice, demonstrating that the lesion was the result of loss of both <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic>. The lesion did not appear to be due to any form of dermatitis, therefore we investigated whether the fur lesion was due to excessive grooming in cDKO mice. We monitored the behavior of 3 and 6 week old cDKO mice for a 30 minute time period (between 8 am – 12 pm) and scored the total amount of time the mouse spent self-grooming. As most studies only score the initial 10 minute period, we assessed this time interval and found the cDKO mice spent approximately twice the amount of time grooming as CTL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). The phenotype was consistent at the 20 minute, as well as the 30 minute time interval, revealing a significant more than two-fold increase in grooming of cDKO mice compared to CTLs. In contrast, <italic>HDAC1</italic> cKO or <italic>HDAC2</italic> cKO mice show normal grooming behavior compared to their respective littermate CTLs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>), demonstrating that the fur lesion as well as the excessive grooming phenotype is due to concurrent loss of <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic>.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Chronic administration of fluoxetine attenuates excessive grooming</title>
<p id="P9">Increased grooming in mice has been suggested to model aspects of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), with previous data establishing that the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine, can alleviate excessive grooming in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> similar to the attenuation of symptoms in individuals with OCD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. We treated 3 week old cDKO and littermate CTLs with fluoxetine (intraperitoneal injections, 10 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>/day) and examined whether the excessive grooming behavior in cDKO mice was responsive to the drug treatment. We found that one week of fluoxetine treatment did not attenuate the increased grooming behavior of the cDKO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). However, three weeks of fluoxetine administration significantly reduced the amount of time spent grooming comparable to a level seen in CTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), recapitulating clinical data that SSRIs take several weeks to reach efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title><italic>HDAC1/HDAC2</italic> cDKO mice have altered <italic>Sapap3</italic> expression</title>
<p id="P10">The gene encoding post-synaptic scaffolding protein SAP90/PSD-95-associated protein 3 (SAPAP3) is linked to obsessive-compulsive and grooming disorders in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Mice lacking <italic>Sapap3</italic> display an excessive grooming phenotype resulting in a facial lesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, similar to the cDKO mice. We therefore assessed whether <italic>Sapap3</italic> expression was altered by the loss of <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic>. Quantitative-RT (qRT) PCR analysis revealed a significant decrease in <italic>Sapap3</italic> expression in frontal cortex and striatum, with no alterations in hippocampus and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), in cDKO mice. This result is in agreement with previous work showing that the grooming phenotype of the <italic>Sapap3</italic> knockout mice is mediated through the corticostriatal pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. <italic>Sapap3</italic> expression was not altered in <italic>HDAC1</italic> cKO or <italic>HDAC2</italic> cKO mice consistent with the premise that loss of both <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic> was necessary to dysregulate its expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4d,e</xref>). We also examined the expression of <italic>Slitrk5</italic>, another gene that has been linked to excessive grooming behavior in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, and found no change in expression in the striatum or cortex, showing specificity for the altered <italic>Sapap3</italic> expression in the cDKO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4f</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S7">
<title>Striatal specific deletion of <italic>HDAC1/HDAC2</italic> recapitulates excessive grooming seen in cDKO mice</title>
<p id="P11">We next examined whether deletion of <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic> selectively in the striatum is sufficient to disrupt <italic>Sapap3</italic> expression and elicit the excessive grooming behavior. We used stereotaxic methods to bilaterally inject into the dorsal striatum of adult <italic>Hdac1<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>/Hdac2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic> mice an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector expressing Green Fluorescent Protein tagged to Cre recombinase (GFP-Cre) or GFP alone as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Mice were behaviorally tested three weeks after surgery, a time point sufficient for Cre mediated recombination with AAV-GFP-Cre<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> then sacrificed to confirm viral placements using laser microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), with off-target injected animals eliminated from further analysis. qRT-PCR showed an approximate 50% reduction in <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic> expression in dorsal striatum of AAV-GFP-Cre compared to AAV-GFP injected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). The striatum specific deletion of <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic> did not result in any obvious structural alterations or cell death within the striatum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 5d</xref>), and did not impact lifespan, weight, locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, or motor coordination compared to AAV-GFP injected mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a–c</xref>). However, deletion of <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic> selectively in the striatum resulted in a significant increase in the time spent grooming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>) with a significant decrease in <italic>Sapap3</italic> expression in the striatum compared to AAV-GFP injected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>) similar to data from the cDKO mice.</p>

<title>Postnatal conditional deletion of <italic>Mecp2</italic> recapitulates OCD-like phenotype of cDKO mice</title>
<p id="P12">Our data so far demonstrate that loss of both <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic> in the striatum down-regulates <italic>Sapap3</italic> expression and results in an excessive grooming phenotype. HDAC1 and HDAC2 do not bind DNA directly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> but rather participate in protein complexes to impact gene transcription. Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is a transcription factor that has been shown to interact with HDAC1 and HDAC2 in a co-repressor complex and regulate gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. We confirmed that this interaction also occurs in the striatum by crossing <italic>Mecp2<sup>2loxP/+</sup></italic> mice with <italic>CaMKII-Cre93</italic> mice to generate conditional <italic>Mecp2</italic> knockout mice (<italic>Mecp2</italic> cKO), and performing immunoprecipitation (IP) with an antibody against HDAC2 on striatal samples from CTL and <italic>Mecp2</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). The function of MeCP2 in the central nervous system is complex, as it has been shown to activate and repress transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. To investigate whether MeCP2 binds the <italic>Sapap3</italic> promoter, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) from the striatum of MeCP2 cKO mice and CTLs using an antibody to MeCP2. QPCR analysis of the ChIP DNA revealed specific MeCP2 binding to the <italic>Sapap3</italic> promoter region (as indicated by the H3K4me3 promoter mark) ~600 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (P600), adjacent to a CpG island (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 a,b</xref>). HDACs are not known to bind DNA directly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, suggesting that MeCP2 is mediating the effects of HDAC1 and HDAC2 on SAPAP3 function. Consistent with our results, previous work has shown that mice with loss of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in inhibitory forebrain neurons display an excessive grooming phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In our experiments, the <italic>CaMKII-Cre93</italic> line used to generate the <italic>Mecp2</italic> cKO mice expresses Cre recombinase in excitatory neurons in broad forebrain regions as well as inhibitory medium spiny neurons in the striatum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. We found that <italic>Mecp2</italic> cKO mice also show a significant increase in time spent grooming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>) with a significant decrease in <italic>Sapap3</italic> expression in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>) compared to littermate CTLs.</p>

<p id="P13">To establish a direct link between MeCP2 and SAPAP3 in mediating the grooming phenotype, we generated adeno-associated DJ serotype viruses expressing either GFP only (control) or an HA-tagged SAPAP3 (AAV-SAPAP3), and stereotaxically injected them bilaterally into the dorsal striatum of adult <italic>Mecp2</italic> cKO and CTL mice to test whether this would rescue the grooming phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). We confirmed the localized expression of SAPAP3 to the dorsal striatum by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). We also corroborated the rescue of <italic>Sapap3</italic> expression in the striatum of <italic>Mecp2</italic> cKO mice injected with the AAV-SAPAP3 virus by qRT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). We found that AAV-mediated expression of SAPAP3 in the striatum of the <italic>Mecp2</italic> cKO mice rescued the excessive grooming behavior to a level comparable to CTL mice injected with GFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>), indicating that this deficit was the result of decreased expression of <italic>Sapap3</italic>. The AAV expression of <italic>Sapap3</italic> in the dorsal striatum did not alter locomotor activity, and in contrast to the reversal of the grooming phenotype, the previously reported impaired performance of the <italic>Mecp2</italic> cKO mice on the rotarod<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> was still present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 7a,b</xref>), suggesting this deficit is mediated through a different mechanism.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P14">Our results reveal that postnatal deletion of both <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic> in the brain results in several adverse effects, including neuronal apoptosis in cortical and hippocampal regions as well as early postnatal lethality, demonstrating functionally redundant roles in neuronal survival past embryogenesis. Given the recent efforts in the development of HDAC2 inhibitors for the treatment of neurodegeneration and cognitive enhancement, our results suggest caution with compounds targeting both HDAC1 and HDAC2, and emphasize the importance of subtype specific inhibitors. We also observed that the concurrent loss of <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic> results in an increase in striatum-dependent repetitive behaviors and dysregulation of <italic>Sapap3</italic> expression, a gene linked to obsessive-compulsive and grooming disorders in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We were able to demonstrate that the selective deletion of <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic> in the dorsal striatum results in altered <italic>Sapap3</italic> expression as well as increased repetitive grooming similar to that observed in cDKO mice. <italic>Mecp2</italic>, the gene that causes Rett syndrome and various neurodevelopmental abnormalities, has been shown to interact with HDAC1 and HDAC2 in a protein complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. We find that MeCP2 binds to the <italic>Sapap3</italic> promoter and that deletion of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in broad forebrain regions of the mouse, similar to the loss of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in inhibitory neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, results in increased repetitive behaviors as well as decreased <italic>Sapap3</italic> expression in the dorsal striatum. We then show that the grooming phenotype in the <italic>Mecp2</italic> cKO mice can be rescued by reintroducing <italic>Sapap3</italic> expression in the dorsal striatum. Our results showing that MeCP2 binds to the <italic>Sapap3</italic> promoter, that loss of <italic>Mecp2</italic> attenuates <italic>Sapap3</italic> expression, and that restoring <italic>Sapap3</italic> in the striatum rescues the grooming phenotype, suggests that the repetitive behaviors observed in Rett syndrome may be due to dysregulation of <italic>SAPAP3</italic> in the striatum. Collectively, these data suggest that HDAC1 and HDAC2 in concert with MeCP2 within the striatum regulate repetitive behaviors through transcription dependent processes, and provide novel insight into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying repetitive behaviors.</p>

Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assays and 20 μg of the protein was loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, then blocked with 5% non-fat milk prior to overnight incubation with primary antibodies. Dilutions of primary antibodies were 1:2000 for both HDAC1 (Abcam, ab19845)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> and HDAC2 antibodies (Abcam, ab32117)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, 1:1000 for MeCP2 antibody (Thermofisher, PA1-888)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, and 1:50,000 for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 2118S)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.

<title>Vector construction and AAV preparation</title>
<p id="P22">A lentiviral vector containing the initial eGFP-SAPAP3 construct was received from the lab of Dr. Guoping Feng. Two AAV vectors were constructed from this plasmid. The eGFP and SAPAP3 were PCR amplified independently and cloned using standard methods into an expression cassette containing the human Synapsin promoter and Growth Hormone polyadenylation signal surrounded by AAV-2 inverted tandem repeats. A Human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag was attached to the N-terminus of SAPAP3 during PCR amplification prior to cloning. Primers used were: GFP.EcoRV.R, 5′-ATA TGA TAT CTC ACT TGT ACA GCT CGT CCA TGC CG-3′; GFPSAPAP3.SpeI.F, 5′-ATA TAC TAG TAC CAA TGG TGA GCA AGG GCG AGG AGC-3′; SpeI.HA-SAPAP3F, 5′-ATA TAC TAG TAC CAA TGT ACC CAT ACG ATG TTC CAG ATT ACG CTG GCG GCT CCG GAG GAA GGG GTT ACC ATG G-3′; SAPAP3.EcoRV.R, 5′-ATA TGA TAT CTC ACA GCC TGG TCT GGG CCT CG-3′. pAAV-GFP or pAAV-HA-SAPAP3 were cotransfected with pAAV-DJ and pHelper into HEK-293 cells. 72 hours after transfection, cells were harvested, lysed by freeze-thaw, and incubated with Benzonase (Sigma) at 37 °C.

Ambulatory activity was measured by counting the number of consecutive beam breaks in 5-minute increments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S26">
<title>Open field</title>
<p id="P32">Mice were placed in the periphery of a novel open field environment (44 cm × 44 cm, walls 30 cm high) in a dimly lit room and allowed to explore for 10 min. The animals were monitored from above by a video camera connected to a computer running video tracking software (Ethovision 3.0, Noldus, Leesburg, Virginia) to determine the total time spent in the periphery (5 cm from the walls), center (14 cm × 14 cm), and complete center (34 cm × 34cm). The amount of locomotor activity was also determined and in all experiments was consistent with locomotor activity data using standard mouse home cages. The open field arenas were cleaned between mice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S27">
<title>Rotarod</title>
<p id="P33">Each mouse was placed on the rotarod (IITC Life Science), which accelerated from 0 to 45 rpm over the course of 60 seconds. Each session ended when the mouse fell off the rod and the total time spent on the rotarod before falling was measured. The mouse was returned to its original cage for 1 hour. The test was repeated for a total of 8 trials over the course of 2 days (4 trials per day).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S28">
<title>Grooming</title>
<p id="P34">Grooming behavior was assessed as previously described with modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Mice were placed individually into a fresh mouse cage and allowed to move freely for 30 minutes. Test sessions were recorded under red light by a video camera directly in front of the mice located inside the testing room. An observer blind to group and genotype analyzed the video tape and scored self-grooming of any part of the body including the face, head, ears, and full-body grooming. The total amount of time spent grooming (duration) was measured at 10 minute intervals. Continuous grooming for greater than one second was recorded as a grooming bout, and sessions separated by two or more seconds constituted a new bout (modified from Welch et al.).</p>

<sec id="S29">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p id="P35">Data are plotted either dot plots with error bars representing mean ± s.e.m, or box-and-whisker plots with interquartile ranges represented as the following: whiskers (error bars) are min and max of data and box is 25th, median, and 75th percentile as calculated in Prism GraphPad software. Statistical differences were calculated in Prism GraphPad software using unpaired, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test when comparing two groups, or one-way or two-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons when appropriate for comparing three or more groups. Tukey, Bonferroni, or Holm-Sidak <italic>post hoc</italic> tests were used following one-way or two-way ANOVA as appropriate. Statistical significance was defined as *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. For all experiments requiring statistical analysis, the statistical test used, exact <italic>P</italic> values, sample size (<italic>n</italic>), <italic>t</italic> values, ANOVA <italic>F</italic> values, and degrees of freedom for each experiment is indicated in the figure legend. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, however sample sizes were estimated based on similar experiments reported in previous publications from our lab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Data distribution was assumed to be normal with similar variance between groups, however this was not formally tested. The Grubbs test was used when appropriate to identify and remove significant outliers.</p>

<p>Characterization of conditional <italic>HDAC1</italic> and <italic>HDAC2</italic> double knockout (cDKO) mice. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry confirmed a selective loss of HDAC1 (<bold>a</bold>) and HDAC2 (<bold>b</bold>) in forebrain regions (frontal cortex (FC), striatum (STR), and hippocampus (HC)) but not in cerebellum (CBL) of cDKO mice. Images were captured using an Olympus BX51 epifluorescence microscope and Olympus DP70 software. Scale bar represents 100 μm.
