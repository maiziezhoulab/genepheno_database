<title>Background</title>
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as regulators of a number of developmental and tumorigenic processes. However, the functions of most lncRNAs in glioma remain unknown and the mechanisms governing the proliferation of tumor cells remain poorly defined.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays were performed to investigate the roles of lncRNAs in the pathophysiology of gliomas. lncRNA arrays were used to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs. Subcutaneous tumor formation and a brain orthotopic tumor model in nude mice were used to investigate the functions of lncRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic>. The <italic>in vitro</italic> functions of lncRNAs were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, colony formation, and western blot analyses. RNA fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and immunoprecipitation were used to explore the underlying mechanisms.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Here, we describe the newly discovered noncoding RNA RP11-732M18.3, which is highly overexpressed in glioma cells and interacts with 14-3-3β/α to promote glioma growth, acting as an oncogene. Overexpression of lncRNA RP11-732 M18.3 was associated with the proliferation of glioma cells and tumor growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Remarkably, lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 promoted cell proliferation and G1/S cell cycle transition. lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 is predominately localized in the cytoplasm. Mechanistically, the interaction of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 with 14-3-3β/α increases the degradation of the p21 protein. lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 promoted the recruitment of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 E1 to 14-3-3β/α and the binding of 14-3-3β/α with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 E1 (UBE2E1) promoted the degradation of p21.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Interpretation</title>
<p>Overall these data demonstrated that lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 regulates glioma growth through a newly described lncRNA-protein interaction mechanism. The inhibition of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 could provide a novel therapeutic target for glioma treatment.</p>

<title>Evidence before this study</title>
<p id="p0010">It has been shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) accumulates at the transcriptional site and performs its function through cis or trans-regulatory elements, or outputs to the cytoplasm and regulates the activity of interacting proteins. In addition, lncRNAs play an important role in glioma development.</p>
<sec id="s0010">
<title>Added value of this study</title>
<p id="p0015">This research article highlights a new lncRNA modulates the degradation of key cell cycle protein p21. We showed that lncRNA RP11-732 M18.3 is highly overexpressed in glioma tissues. lncRNA RP11-732 M18.3 promotes tumor cell proliferation both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. We identified a new degradation mechanism of p21, involved with lncRNA RP11-732M18.3, 14-3-3β/α, and p21. We showed that lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 promotes the recruitment of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 E1 (UBE2E1) to 14-3-3β/α, which promotes the degradation activity of UBE2E1 on p21. This study deepens the understanding of the mechanism of lncRNAs in glioma and provides a therapeutic target for glioma.</p>

<sec id="s0015">
<title>Implications of all the available evidence</title>
<p id="p0020">Cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease that alters cellular information flow to modify cellular homeostasis and promote growth. Recently, the evidence is emerging of important roles of long noncoding RNAs in the pathogenesis of cancer development. However, few have been identified that regulate glioma proliferation and development. In addition, the mechanism of lncRNAs in glioma is not fully understood. The regulation of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 in tumorigenesis and the mechanism by which lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 promotes glioma cell proliferation will elucidate the future development of lncRNA-based glioma cancer therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="p0025">Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcribed RNAs &gt;200 nucleotides in length, although &gt;90% are not translated into appreciable peptide products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0005">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0010">2</xref>]. Noncoding genes, which outnumber protein-coding genes, are exquisitely regulated, but restricted to specific cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0015">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0020">4</xref>]. lncRNAs are unique and are expressed in a spatiotemporal and tissue-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0025">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0030">6</xref>].</p>
<p id="p0030">Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive type of primary brain tumor, thus there is great urgency for the development of useful therapeutic targets of these lesions. Although many lncRNAs have been annotated, few have been functionally characterized in gliomas. Of these, lncRNA CASC2 acts as a suppressor of glioma cell growth by negative regulation of miR-21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0035">7</xref>], while lncRNA CRNDE promotes glioma cell growth and invasion through mTOR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0040">8</xref>]. However, the biological roles and molecular functions of the overwhelming majority of lncRNAs in gliomas remain unexplored or elusive.</p>
<p id="p0035">lncRNAs have been shown to accumulate at sites of transcription and execute their functions <italic>via</italic> cis- or trans-regulatory elements, or are exported to the cytoplasm and modulate the activity and abundance of interacting proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0045">9</xref>]. It is now widely understood that the subcellular fate of lncRNAs may provide new insights into the specialized functions of these molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0050">10</xref>]. The lncRNAs in the nucleus have been shown to regulate gene transcription by organizing subnuclear structures or mediating chromosomal interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0055">11</xref>]. The lncRNAs in the cytoplasm are known to modulate the activity of interacting proteins or act as miRNA sponges by competitively interacting with miRNAs to reduce availability to target mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0060">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0065">13</xref>]. The 14-3-3 proteins are a highly conserved family with a subunit mass of approximately 30 kDa that play key roles in various cellular processes, such as signal transduction, cell cycle control, apoptosis, stress responses, and malignant transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0070">14</xref>]. The14-3-3 proteins alter the activities, modifications, and intracellular localization of target proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0075">15</xref>]. Therefore, it is of great interest to uncover new functions of the 14-3-3β/α protein mediated by lncRNA in certain biological processes.</p>
<p id="p0040">The mechanisms of cell division are routinely subjected to endogenous and exogenous stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0080">16</xref>]. For example, the cell cycle checkpoint mechanisms are often defective in cancer cells, which very likely contributes to tumorigenesis and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0085">17</xref>]. The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor 1A, also known as p21, is a factor that inhibits cell cycle arrest in response to a variety of stimuli. Targeting cell cycle checkpoints, such as p21, may substantially improve cancer therapies. Although there have been immense efforts in the development of drugs targeting key players in the G1/S and G2/M transition checkpoints, efficient and effective treatment modalities are still needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0090">18</xref>]. Therefore, it is of great interest to uncover new therapeutic agents targeting tumorigenesis.</p>
<p id="p0045">Here, we report the identification of a previously uncharacterized lncRNA, RP11-732M18.3, which is a transcript of about 424 nucleotides that interacts with 14-3-3β/α (also named YWHAB, belonging to the 14-3-3 family, members of which mediate signal transduction by binding to cell components) and promotes the proliferation of glioma cells. In brief, we found that: 1) the expression of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 was increased in human glioma tissues; 2) lncRNA RP11-732 M18.3 promotes tumor cell proliferation both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>; 3) lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 promotes cell cycle G1/S transition through the p21/CDK2/CCNE1 pathway; 4) lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 interacts with 14-3-3β/α and increases the degradation of p21; 5) lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 promotes the recruitment of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 E1 (UBE2E1) to 14-3-3β/α, which promotes the degradation activity of UBE2E1 on p21.</p>

<title>LncRNA RP11-732 M18.3 is highly expressed in glioma tissues</title>
<p id="p0110">To identify glioma cancer-relevant lncRNAs, the expression profiles of lncRNAs in tumor samples as compared to paired peritumoral samples with determined using the lncRNA Array (v. 2.0) (ArrayStar, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA), as described in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0100">20</xref>]. According to the array analysis results, overexpressed lncRNAs were selected according to the fold change and <italic>p</italic>-value and validated in small group samples (data not show). Among these aberrantly expressed lncRNAs, lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 was over-expressed in glioma (2.53-fold change, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and consistently over-expressed in small group glioma tissues (data not show). Thus, lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 was chosen for further research. Because lncRNAs may encode conserved peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0115">23</xref>], we examined the coding potential of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 using ORF Finder and PhyloCSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0095">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0120">24</xref>]. Both analyses confirmed the non-coding potential of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3, which received a low codon substitution frequency (CSF) value similar to that of other well-characterized lncRNAs (Fig. S1a–d). To further study lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 expression in human glioma tissues, we examined a panel of paired tumor and normal tissue specimens that were collected from patients with glioma (<italic>n</italic> = 60) and normal brain tissues (<italic>n</italic> = 30). lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 transcripts were expressed at higher levels in the tumor tissues, as compared to the normal tissues, after normalizing to U6 transcript expression by qRT-PCR analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figs. 1</xref>a, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test). The expression levels of lncRNA RP11-732 M18.3 in glioma cell lines were higher than the normal cells (Figs. S1e, Student's t-test). To further confirm this expression pattern, the expression patterns of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 were analyzed in six paired tumor and normal primary tissue specimens by RNA FISH. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>b and c, the lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 transcript was over-expressed in the glioma specimens and the sub-cellular location of this lncRNA in tumors was predominately the cytoplasm. Next, the relationship between lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 expression levels and the clinicopathological characteristics of 58 tumor tissue samples was examined. Correlation regression analysis showed that the overexpression of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 was significantly correlated with the proliferation marker Ki67 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0005">Table 1</xref>) (two specimens without MGMT promoter methylation were excluded).

<title>Knockdown of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 inhibits glioma growth in vivo</title>
<p id="p0115">Next, we focused on the correlation between lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 and proliferation. The glioma cell lines U87MG and U251 were infected with a lentivirus coding for the enhanced green fluorescent protein and a short hairpin RNA molecule targeting lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 (Fig. S2a, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test). The two stable knockout cell lines with the lowest lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 expression levels were subcutaneously injected into the axilla of nude mice. After 4 weeks, the fluorescence signal intensities in the knockout group were significantly decreased as compared with the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>a). To further confirm the effects of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 on tumorigenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, a mouse xenograft assay was conducted by injecting the same two knockout cell lines into the axilla of nude mice and tumor formation was assessed after 4 weeks. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>b, decreased expression of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 weakened tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>, as compared with the controls. The same results were observed with the U251 cell line group, indicating that the position of cell injected did not affect tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>c, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test). The tumor weight of the knockout group was less than that of the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>d, Student's t-test). The expression levels of RP11-732M18.3 in allograft tumors was lower than in controls (Fig. S1f, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test). In these xenograft tissues, lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 knockdown effectively reduced Ki67 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>e and f, Student's t-test). In addition, a nude mouse model of orthotopic tumors showed that lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 knockdown decreased tumor volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>g).

<p id="p0150">Next, the mechanism by which lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 regulates p21 expression was addressed. Recent studies have revealed that the identification of the subcellular locations of lncRNAs can potentially provide new insights into the functions of lncRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0050">10</xref>]. RNA FISH demonstrated that the lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 transcript is predominately localized in the cytoplasm, as the strongest signal was localized in the cytoplasm in U87MG cell lines and about half in the cytoplasm of U251 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Figs. 5</xref>d, S5a, and S5b), where it can interfere with the post-translational modifications of proteins, leading to abnormal signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0155">31</xref>].

Biological process analysis revealed that cell growth and/or maintenance were among the most enriched processes (Fig. S5d).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="p0160">Nearly 95% of the human genome does not encode proteins and it is clear that abnormalities in the “non-coding” genome drive important cancer phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0175">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0180">36</xref>]. Recently, more and more evidence has confirmed the functional roles of lncRNAs in glioma formation. For example, knockdown of the lncRNA XIST exerted tumor-suppressive effects in human glioblastoma stem cells <italic>via</italic> up-regulation of miR-152 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0185">37</xref>]. Furthermore, lncRNA TUG1 enhanced tumor-induced angiogenesis in human glioblastomas through the inhibition of microRNA-299 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0190">38</xref>]. The findings of this study showed that the newly identified noncoding RNA RP11-732M18.3, which is highly expressed in glioma cells, interacts with 14-3-3β/α and promotes glioma cell proliferation and subsequent tumor growth. These higher lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 levels were associated with the proliferation of glioma cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results demonstrate that lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 promoted G1/S transition <italic>via</italic> regulation of p21, which resulted in the proliferation of glioma cells. The lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 transcript was found to be associated with 14-3-3β/α to promote p21 degradation in a process that may be mediated by UBE2E1. Thus, our results indicate that lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 plays a critical role in cell proliferation, which may increase the understanding of the roles of lncRNAs in oncogenesis and potentials as targets for glioma therapy.</p>
<p id="p0165">The mammalian cell cycle is a highly organized and regulated to ensure appropriate gene transcription and cell division. Cancer is characterized by aberrant cell cycle activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0090">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0195">39</xref>]. The p21 protein, which was the first p53 transcriptional target to be identified, usually acts as a tumor suppressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0200">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0205">41</xref>]. The stability of p21 is tightly and differentially regulated by ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation during various stages of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0210">42</xref>]. In the present work, we identified a novel degradation pathway for p21, which involved the newly discovered lncRNA RP11-732M18.3. lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 primary locates in the plasma in glioma cell lines. The interaction of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 with 14-3-3β/α increases the degradation of p21. Knockdown of 14-3-3β/α decreased the expression of p21, while silencing of UBE2E1 had the opposite effect, indicating that both 14-3-3β/α and UBE2E1 are involved in the degradation of p21. However, the role of 14-3-3β/α in the regulation of p21 degradation must be further verified. Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation resulting from the aberrant activity of various cell cycle proteins. This work provides a new regulatory pathway for p21 in glioma. p21 is an important therapeutic target for cancer therapies and iron may be a good therapeutic agent for p21 in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0215">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0220">44</xref>]. The determination of whether lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 is involved in the regulation of iron (Fe) on p21 warrants further research.</p>
<p id="p0170">There are still several questions posed in this article that have not been addressed. In the present study, overexpression of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 promoted the recruitment of UBE2E1 to 14-3-3β/α and the subsequent degradation of p21. The 0–150 nucleotides of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 were essential for the association between lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 and 14-3-3β/α. However, further experiments are needed to confirm the protein-specific binding site of 14-3-3β/α. Interesting, the expression level of p21 was decreased in cells only treated with siRNA of 14-3-3β/α. We Hypothesis that 14-3-3β/α may act as a frame for p21 degradation or involved in other pathways. Liquid phase condensation or biomolecular condensates are involved in a variety of processes including DNA damage response, RNA metabolism, signal transduction, and other cell biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0225">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0230">46</xref>]. Therefore, it is of great interest to uncover whether liquid phase condensation involved in the protective role of 14-3-3β/α for p21. However, it needed further research to confirm. To elucidate the mechanisms of how lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 influences the binding between UBE2E2 and 14-3-3β/α will require improvements in methodologies and the RNA-protein interaction theory. E1s and E3s play important roles in the regulation of protein degradation, thus it would be interesting to investigate whether E1s or E3s is involved in the regulation of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 and p21 degradation and to explore the function of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 in the nuclei of U251 or A172 cells.</p>
<p id="p0175">In summary, our data point to a newly discovered lncRNA, RP11-732M18.3, as a key modulator of tumor progression, which interacts with 14-3-3β/α in the regulation of p21 protein degradation. This work highlights a new lncRNA involved in p21 protein degradation. However, the mechanism underlying the up-regulation of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 in glioma cells remains unknown. Nonetheless, the regulation of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 in tumorigenesis and the illustration of the mechanism of lncRNA RP11-732M18.3 to promote the proliferation of glioma cells will shed light on the future development of lncRNA-based glioma cancer therapies.</p>
