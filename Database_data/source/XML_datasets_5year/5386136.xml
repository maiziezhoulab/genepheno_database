<abstract>
<p id="P1">SHANK3, a synaptic scaffold protein and actin regulator, is widely
expressed outside of the central nervous system with predominantly unknown
function. Solving the structure of the SHANK3 N-terminal region revealed that
the SPN-domain is an unexpected Ras-association domain with high affinity for
GTP-bound Ras and Rap G-proteins. The role of Rap1 in integrin activation is
well established but the mechanisms to antagonize it remain largely unknown.
Here, we show that SHANK1 and SHANK3 act as integrin activation inhibitors by
sequestering active Rap1 and R-Ras via the SPN-domain and thus limiting their
bioavailability at the plasma membrane. Consistently, <italic>SHANK3</italic>
silencing triggers increased plasma membrane Rap1 activity, cell spreading,
migration and invasion. Autism-related mutations within the SHANK3 SPN-domain
(R12C and L68P) disrupt G-protein interaction and fail to counteract integrin
activation along the Rap1/RIAM/talin axis in cancer cells and neurons.
Altogether, we establish SHANKs as critical regulators of G-protein signalling
and integrin-dependent processes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that couple the
extracellular matrix (ECM) to the actin cytoskeleton and undergo conformational
switching from a low-affinity “inactive” to a high-affinity
“active” state. In the active conformation integrins enhance cell
signalling and inappropriate integrin activation is linked to several pathologies
including inflammation and cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>. Hence,
understanding integrin activity regulation is of major clinical relevance. Integrins
are also crucial regulators of important processes in the brain such as neuronal
cell migration, axonal outgrowth and synaptic plasticity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> but the role of integrin activity regulation in these
processes remains to be fully investigated.</p>
<p id="P3">Talin recruitment to the β-integrin tail triggers integrin activation
and is regulated through the activity of the Rap1 GTPase and its effector
Rap1-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>. Integrin activity can
be counterbalanced by integrin inactivating proteins such as SHARPIN, ICAP-1 and
filamin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, all of which interact with
integrins and directly or indirectly interfere with talin-mediated integrin
activation. However, potential mechanisms to block integrin activation at the level
of Rap G-proteins remain unidentified.</p>
<p id="P4">SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains (SHANK) 1-3 are a family of scaffold
proteins found in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses and are
indispensable for normal brain function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>. In addition, SHANK proteins are expressed in
peripheral organs with largely unknown functions. Genetic alterations in
<italic>SHANK3</italic> are responsible for a spectrum of neuropsychiatric
disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, intellectual
disability and manic-like behaviour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> and chromosomal
deletions of the region containing <italic>SHANK3</italic> cause Phelan-McDermid
syndrome (22q13 deletion syndrome) which manifests as neurological symptoms and
affects many peripheral organs including the dermis, congruent with the wide
tissue-distribution of SHANK3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>. Recently, autism-like symptoms of
<italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient mice were reversed by targeting actin
regulators or Akt signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> and adult restoration of
<italic>Shank3</italic> in mice improved many of the autistic-like symptoms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>. Thus, SHANK3 seems to actively contribute
to signalling and the regulation of the cell cytoskeleton during and post
development.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="S3">
<title>SHANK1 and SHANK3 inhibit integrin activation</title>
<p id="P5">We previously performed a druggable genome-wide RNAi screen in 13
different human cell lines and analysed integrin activity using monoclonal
anti-β1 integrin antibodies (9EG7 and 12G10) that specifically recognize
the active receptor conformation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>.
Re-evaluation of these data revealed increased integrin activation (detected
with either one or both of the antibodies) following <italic>SHANK1</italic> or
<italic>SHANK3</italic> silencing in nine and in five out of the 13 cell
lines tested, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).
Although both SHANK1 and SHANK3 are major PSD scaffolding proteins in excitatory
synapses, they are also widely expressed outside of the nervous system with
currently unknown functions (publicly available GTEx portal data; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">To validate a role for SHANK1 and SHANK3 in inhibiting integrin
activation we employed a dual colour flow cytometric assay to measure
cell-surface active integrins (based on the binding of a recombinant integrin
ligand fragment, fibronectin [FN] repeats 7-10) relative to total cell-surface
integrins in CHO cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>. Expression of rat Shank3-mRFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) or rat Shank1-GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>)
significantly reduced integrin activity, compared to mRFP or GFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>)
without altering total β1-integrin surface levels. Moreover, the
magnitude of Shank-mediated integrin inhibition was comparable to the effect of
overexpressing SHARPIN-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), a
known β1-integrin inhibitor in several cell types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>. To confirm these findings we analysed
integrin activity in the human HEK293 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines with opposing
patterns of <italic>SHANK3</italic> and <italic>SHANK1</italic> expression
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,
1c</xref>). Silencing of <italic>SHANK3</italic> in
<italic>SHANK3</italic>–expressing HEK293 cells or
<italic>SHANK1</italic> in <italic>SHANK1</italic>-expressing MDA-MB-231
cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.
1d</xref>) triggered a significant increase in cell-surface active integrin
levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e,f</xref>)
without affecting total cell-surface receptor expression.
<italic>SHANK3</italic>, or <italic>SHANK1</italic>, silencing was nearly as
efficient in activating β1-integrins as Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>)
which binds to the integrin ectodomain and activates β1-integrin
heterodimers via an outside-in mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>. Importantly, reintroduction of rat Shank3-mRFP or rat Shank1-GFP
reversed the increased integrin activity in <italic>SHANK3-</italic> or
<italic>SHANK1</italic>-silenced cells and reduced integrin activity levels
in control-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.
1f</xref>). Thus, the ability of <italic>SHANK3</italic>- and
<italic>SHANK1</italic>-targeted siRNAs to increase β1-integrin
activity was specifically due to the loss of each SHANK isoform rather than
off-target effects.</p>
<p id="P7">To explore whether murine Shank3 regulates integrin activity as well, we
isolated mouse mammary epithelial cells (MMECs), known to express Shank3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1g</xref>), and mouse mammary fibroblasts
(MMFs) lacking Shank3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1g</xref>), from WT
<italic>Shank3αβ<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and
<italic>Shank3αβ<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant mice
(specifically lacking the long α (containing SPN, Ank and SH3 domains)
and β (containing Ank and SH3 domains) isoforms of SHANK3)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> We observed markedly higher active integrin levels in MMECs, but
not MMFs, isolated from <italic>Shank3αβ<sup>-/-</sup></italic>
compared to WT mice (<italic>Shank3αβ<sup>+/+</sup></italic>)
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1h,i</xref>).
Taken together, these data indicate that SHANK1 and SHANK3 function as
inhibitors of β1-integrin activation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>SHANK1 and SHANK3 localize to membrane ruffles with inactive
integrins</title>
<p id="P8">Next we investigated the subcellular localization of SHANKs in cells. In
the absence of suitable reagents to detect endogenous SHANKs with
immunofluorescence we expressed Shank3-mRFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.
1g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary
figure 1j,k</xref>) or Shank1-GFP in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1j</xref>).
Both SHANK proteins localized to the periphery of the cell in actin-rich
membrane ruffles positive for the membrane marker CAAX-GFP and the inactive
integrin receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1j</xref>) as
well as to the nucleus (the possible nuclear function of SHANKs was not
investigated here further). Conversely, no co-localisation was observed between
SHANKs and ECM-bound active integrins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1k</xref>). Membrane recruitment of SHANK3 was
validated further with biochemical membrane fractionation, demonstrating SHANK3
in both the cytoplasmic and plasma membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>), and with live-cell imaging showing dynamic
localization of Shank3-mRFP to folding membrane areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary video 1</xref>). Thus, SHANK1 and SHANK3 appear to
predominantly localize to unattached membrane ruffles together with inactive
integrin and actin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>SHANK1 and SHANK3 inhibit cell adhesion and spreading</title>
<p id="P9">Consistent with increased integrin activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), <italic>SHANK3</italic> silencing in HEK293 cells
or <italic>SHANK1</italic> silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells promoted cell adhesion
to a fibronectin-collagen matrix over time as measured with the xCELLigence
apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>).
In addition, <italic>SHANK3</italic>-silenced HEK293 cells generated
significantly more, yet smaller, adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.
2b-2e</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>SHANK3</italic> silencing also
appeared to affect cell spreading. Downregulation of either SHANK isoform was
sufficient to trigger a significant increase in cell area on the
fibronectin-collagen-coated surface at 20 and 60 min post plating compared to
control-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2b,c</xref>).
Enhanced cell spreading was even more evident in cells plated on spatially
restricted micropattern lines where <italic>SHANK3</italic> silencing resulted
in significantly longer cell lengths compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h,i</xref>). Thus, SHANK1 and SHANK3
negatively regulate integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading in cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>SHANK-mediated integrin inhibition is SHARPIN independent</title>
<p id="P10">We next sought to explore how SHANKs regulate integrin activity. SHARPIN
binds to the ARR domain of SHANKs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>. To determine whether SHANK-mediated
integrin inactivation is SHARPIN dependent, we expressed SHARPIN- or Shank1-GFP
in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) generated from WT or SHARPIN-null
(<italic>cpdm</italic>) animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> and
measured surface levels of active (FN 7-10 binding), relative to total,
β1-integrin. As expected, expression of both SHARPIN-GFP and Shank1-GFP
reduced β1-integrin activation in WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>).
Interestingly, Shank1-GFP expression decreased β1-integrin activation in
<italic>cpdm</italic> MEFs to approximately the same extent as in WT MEFs
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig.
2d</xref>) suggesting that SHARPIN is dispensable for SHANK-mediated
integrin inactivation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>Autism-linked mutations in <italic>SHANK3</italic> impair its integrin
inhibitory function</title>
<p id="P11">The N-terminal SPN domain of SHANK1 and SHANK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) is highly conserved<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> and missense mutations in the SPN domain of
<italic>SHANK3</italic> (R12C and L68P) have been detected in patients with
autism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, highlighting the importance of the SPN domain for the
proper function of SHANK3. In line with this notion, we found that expression of
SHANK mutants (Shank3R12C or Shank3L68P) harbouring the identified ASD
mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> in
<italic>SHANK3-</italic>silenced cells failed to rescue the increase in
integrin activation triggered by loss of <italic>SHANK3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In contrast, re-expression of
Shank3 WT in the same cells completely restored integrin activity back to
control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Furthermore,
overexpression of the SPN-domain alone (SPN WT) was sufficient to significantly
inhibit integrin activity in CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.
3c</xref>). The L68P mutation significantly, and the R12C mutation
partially, impaired SPN-domain mediated integrin inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). An intact SPN domain was also
critical for the ability of SHANK3 to regulate cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>) and cell spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Unlike SHANK3 WT, SHANK3L68P failed
to rescue <italic>SHANK3</italic>-silencing-induced effects on these processes.
Thus, an intact SPN domain is a prerequisite for SHANK-dependent inhibition of
integrin activity and the L68P mutation is more disruptive to SPN-domain
activity than the R12C mutation.</p>
<p id="P12">Given the apparent functional importance of the ASD-associated SHANK3
mutations in integrin activity regulation, we investigated the effects of SHANK3
WT and L68P mutant in neurons. Overexpression of SHANK3 WT, but not the L68P
mutant, in <italic>Shank3αβ<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cortical
neurons plated on laminin, inhibited β1-integrin activity in neuronal
growth cones, structures regulated by integrins and integrin down-stream
signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f,g</xref>). In
addition, expression of the SPN WT, but not the SPNL68P, inhibited integrin
activity in growth cones of differentiating neuroblastoma cells on laminin
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig.
3a,b</xref>). Thus, SHANK3 inhibits β1-integrins also in neuronal
cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S8">
<title>Three-dimensional structure of the SHANK SPN-ARR region</title>
<p id="P13">To gain further insight into the role of the SHANK SPN domain in
regulating integrin activity we determined the structure of the SPN-ARR region
(the SPN domain is likely to form a compact unit with the adjacent ARR domain
through intramolecular interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) by
crystalizing the N-terminal fragment of SHANK3 (residues 1-348) and solving the
structure by molecular replacement using two repeats from the core ankyrin
domain of the crystal structure of human ankyrin-R (PDB: 1N11) as a template.
The resulting structure, containing only 1 chain in the asymmetric unit and
comprising residues 2-347 of SHANK3, was refined to 2.2Å; no electron
density was detected for residues 1 and 348. Data collection and refinement
statistics are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p id="P14">The structure of the SPN-ARR fragment demonstrated two distinct domains
separated by a 19-residue linker with a well-defined conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). The C-terminal ARR domain (residues
113-337) consists of seven canonical helix-turn-helix-β-hairpin/loop
ankyrin repeats arranged in a curved solenoid structure. The loop region of each
repeat forms a β-hairpin extending at 90°-angle from the helices
towards the centre of the solenoid, typical for ARR domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>. The β-hairpins of the repeats
form a continuous flat surface that covers one end of the solenoid structure.
The SPN domain (residues 8-93) positioned on top of the ARR β-hairpin

The SPN domain makes charged and polar contacts with the outer surface of the

<title>Structure of SHANK3 SPN-ARR reveals a previously uncharacterized
Ras/Rap-association (RA) domain</title>
<p id="P16">The similarity between the SHANK SPN and talin F0 structures, and the
reported interaction between talin F0 and Rap1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, prompted us to
investigate whether SHANK SPN is an RA domain interacting with Ras and Rap
GTPases. Sequence alignment of SHANK1 and SHANK3 SPN domains with the
well-characterized RA domains of RalGDS, Raf and Byr revealed the presence of
consensus Ras/Rap-recognizing positive charges (residues R12 and K22) in the
β1 and β2 strands of both SHANK1 and SHANK3 isoforms and a
distinctive distribution of hydrophobic residues in the same region that are
typically associated with RA domains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Furthermore, the Ras/Rap
recognition side-chains of the SPN and RalGDS RA domains are well aligned in
space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The only deviation from
the consensus is the substitution of a positive charge, corresponding to
position 52 in RalGDS, with an alanine in SHANK1 and SHANK3. However, other
exposed positive charges (R38 or R25) in the vicinity of R12 and K22 may
compensate for the missing charge in the α1-helix of the SHANK proteins
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>). These data strongly
suggest that SHANK SPN belongs to the RA family of Ubl domains.</p>
<p id="P17">The SHANK SPN domain is a functional RA domain as it
coimmunoprecipitated with WT and constitutively active (G12V mutant) forms of
H-Ras but not with the dominant negative H-Ras S17N variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Thus, SHANK3 preferentially binds
to the GTP-bound, active H-Ras. Additionally we found that the SHANK3 SPN domain
interacts with several Ras and Rap proteins in their constitutively active and
WT forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). However, in line with
the notion that RA domains are promiscuous in terms of binding to several
different Ras family members, but not Rho G-proteins, SHANK3 SPN did not
interact with Rac1-GTP or Cdc42-GTP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S10">
<title>Autism-associated mutations in SHANK3 SPN impair Ras and Rap binding</title>
<p id="P18">Next we predicted the potential effects of ASD-related mutations by
superimposing the SHANK3 SPN structure on the RalGDS RA domain in complex with
Ras (PDB ID 1LFD). The model demonstrated that most of the key ion-pair and
polar interactions at the interface are preserved in SHANK3. In this model the
position of the SHANK3 SPN R12 side-chain is optimal for forming an ion-pair
with E37 of Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Thus, the R12C
mutation identified in ASD is expected to significantly reduce Ras binding. The
second ASD mutation in the SPN domain, L68P, affects one of the key residues of
the hydrophobic core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>) and is
expected to disrupt the SPN fold, potentially causing loss of Ras interaction.
As predicted from these structural analyses, the R12C and L68P ASD mutations
within the SPN domain disrupted SHANK3 SPN domain interaction with active (G12V
mutant) Ras as well as Rap1 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.
4g,h</xref>), even though SPN R12C retained partial binding to Rap1b in
pull-downs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g,h</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">Accordingly, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements with
purified recombinant proteins indicated a very strong interaction between SHANK3
SPN-ARR and Rap1b-GTP (Kd = 0.2 ± 0.05 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>). In comparison the Kd for SPNR12C binding to Rap1b
was 2.2 ± 0.26 µM, indicating a 10-fold reduction in affinity
towards Rap1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j</xref>), in line with the
immunoprecipitation and modelling data. The interaction between WT SPN with
H-Ras-GTP was weaker (Kd = 3.3 ± 0.14 µM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>)
and further reduced in the presence of the R12C mutation, and no interaction was
observed with H-Ras-GDP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 4c-e</xref>). The interaction between SHANK1 SPN and
H-Ras-GTP, although weaker (Kd = 5.9 ± 0.73 µM), was within the
range of affinities determined for RA domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig.
4f</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>. The enthalpy of SHANK3
SPN interaction with Rap1-GTP was significantly lower than that observed with
H-Ras-GTP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig.
4g</xref>), suggesting stronger ion-pair interactions or formation of
additional hydrogen bonds at the interface between the SHANK SPN domain and
Rap1-GTP. We could not ascertain the effect of the ASD-related L68P mutation in
ITC experiments as we were unable to produce soluble mutant protein. However,
this insolubility may point towards a role for L68 in the folding of the SPN
domain. Taken together these data indicate that the SPN domain of SHANK
interacts with Ras and Rap in a manner similar to other RA domain-containing
proteins and that the primary effect of ASD mutations is a loss of interaction
with small G-proteins.</p>

signalling. To explore whether β1-integrin inhibition by SHANK3 is Rap1-
and R-Ras-dependent we performed the flow cytometric-based integrin activity
assays in HEK293 cells. Expression of a constitutively active Rap1a (Rap1Q63E)
or constitutively active R-Ras (R-RasG38V) enhanced integrin activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>).
Co-expression of Shank3-mRFP inhibited the ability of both Rap1Q63E and

levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>).
The ability of Mn<sup>2+</sup> to induce integrin outside-in activation is
dependent on active Rap1 availability in cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>. Accordingly, we find that Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced integrin
activity is significantly impaired in Shank3-mRFP overexpressing CHO cells
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig.

spreading and flattening<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>. Consistent
with the ability of SHANK3 to attenuate Rap1-dependent integrin activation,
co-expression of SHANK3 with Rap1 fully reversed the cell spreading phenotype
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b and 5c</xref>). Notably, the
Rap-binding defective Shank3L68P and Shank3R12C mutants failed to counteract
Rap1Q63E- or R-RasG38V-mediated integrin activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). In hippocampal neurons integrin
ligands stimulate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref> and SHANK3

formation of new filopodia. We found that overexpression of Shank3 WT-GFP, but
not the L68P mutant, inhibits filopodia number in MAP2-positive rat hippocampal
neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d and 5e</xref>). Furthermore, WT
SPN-GFP overexpression reduced filopodia number in neurites of differentiating
neuroblastoma cells in comparison to GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f,

and branching, was not significantly affected by SHANK3 WT or L68P

Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of Rap1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref> reverted integrin

<italic>SHANK3</italic>-silenced cells back to control levels, suggesting that
SHANK3 regulates integrin activity and cell spreading in a Rap1-dependent
manner. These data suggest that SHANK3 antagonizes Rap1a- and R-Ras-induced
integrin activation and signalling.</p>
<p id="P21">Rap1-GTP targeting to the plasma membrane is essential for RIAM

<italic>SHANK3</italic> silencing in cells markedly increased Rap1 levels in
the plasma membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>) and
triggered a marked enrichment of active Rap1 (Raichu-Rap1 fluorescence resonance

cell periphery close to the plasma membrane compared to a more uniform

Rap1-GTP levels in cells were not significantly altered upon
<italic>SHANK3</italic> silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Thus, SHANK expression appears to
regulate the bioavailability of active Rap1 particularly on the plasma

whether SHANKs directly affect Rap1/RIAM/talin complex formation remains to be

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P24">Regulation of integrin activity is of central importance to human
health<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>. The critical role of Rap1 in the
final steps of integrin activation is well-established<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>; active Rap1 recruits RIAM and talin to the plasma membrane to
facilitate integrin activation. However, mechanisms to fine-tune this activation or
to antagonize it are not fully understood. Here we describe that scaffold proteins
SHANK1 and SHANK3 act as negative regulators of integrin activity in several cell
types and consequently interfere with cell adhesion, spreading, migration and
invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8h</xref>), and with filopodia
formation in neurites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ASD-linked SHANK3 mutants
are functionally deficient in binding to active Ras family members Rap1 and R-Ras
and in mediating integrin inhibition.</p>
<p id="P25">The crystal structure of the SHANK3 N-terminal SPN-ARR region confirmed the
intramolecular interaction between both domains detected previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>. More importantly, it allowed us to
elucidate the molecular mechanism by which SHANKs regulate integrin activity: (1)
the SPN is an RA domain most similar to the N-terminal F0 motif of talin; (2) the
SHANK SPN domain binds active, GTP-bound forms of H-Ras, Rap1 and other Ras
subfamily members with high affinity; (3) ASD-related mutations in residues R12 and
L68 in the SHANK3 SPN domain impair binding to Ras proteins and the ability to
antagonize β1-integrin activity in cells. Thus, the primary mechanism of
SHANK-dependent integrin antagonism most likely stems from the ability to interfere
with Rap1 or R-Ras effector binding through direct competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8h</xref>). It is important to note that, unlike the specific
integrins expressed on leukocytes or platelets, Rap1 is not absolutely essential for
β1-integrin activation and a significant pool of β1-integrin remains
active in adherent cells even once Rap1 is inhibited<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>. Thus, several pathways, in
addition to the Rap1-RIAM-talin axis, are likely to be involved in the
spatio-temporal fine-tuning of β1-integrin activity in adherent cells at any
given time.</p>
<p id="P26">ECM ligands and specific adhesion receptors such as integrins are also
important in the central nervous system, in dendritic spines and synapses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>. Autism-like deficits of Shank3-deficient
mice can be rescued by targeting the actin regulators Rac and cofilin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, by re-expressing <italic>Shank3</italic> in
adult mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> or by inhibiting Akt
signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>. Given the ability of
integrins to regulate all of these proteins, our identification of a potential role
for SHANK proteins in regulating integrin activity in neuronal growth cones is most
likely relevant to the neurodevelopmental disorder of these mice.</p>
<p id="P27">Our observation that SHANKs antagonize integrin activation, by limiting
active Rap1 bioavailability on the plasma membrane, provides a significant advance
to our understanding of integrin activity regulation. However, SHANK3-mediated
control of Ras and Rap may contribute to integrin-independent pathways as well.
SHANK3 is a major scaffold proteins within the PSD of dendritic spines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>. Ras activation promotes spine growth, while
Rap1 induces spine shrinkage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>. Thus,
sequestration of the activated forms of G-proteins may contribute to maintaining the
balance between Ras and Rap1 activities given that the R12C mutation compromises the
effect of SHANK3 overexpression on spine size and synaptic transmission<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>.
Furthermore, the ability of SHANK1 and SHANK3 to sequester active Ras- and

Ras-driven human carcinomas.</p>

strain CK600K. Cultures were grown at 37°C to OD<sub>595</sub> of 0.8 and
then induced with 200 μM IPTG at 18°C overnight. Protein was
purified by ion exchange, followed by gel filtration, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>. Active GTP form of Ras and Rap1b was
produced by nucleotide exchange as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref> using non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GMPPCP. GDP form was
generated by overnight incubation of GTPase in the presence of 50 fold molar
excess of GTP in the presence of EDTA to remove magnesium, followed by the
buffer exchange using PD10 column (GE healthcare). Completeness of the exchange
was validated by NMR spectroscopy.</p>

<p id="P60">Sparse matrix crystal screening of SHANK3 (1-348) was performed using an
innovadyne nanodrop screen maker at protein concentration of 6 mg/ml with a 200
nl drop size (1:1 ratio) using sitting drop vapour diffusion. Crystals typically
appeared in over 20 conditions overnight, and thus optimization was not
necessary. High resolution data was collected on crystals grown in 0.1 M HEPES
pH 7.5, 0.4 M K/Na tartrate and were vitrified using 30% ethylene glycol, 10%
isopropanol. An 180° wedge of data was collected at Diamond Light Source
(I04-1) with a non-overlapping 0.5° oscillation width. Owing to
systematic absences the data was indexed (Pointless) and integrated (MOSFLM) in
p4<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2 and then scaled (SCALA). Molecular replacement
was performed using PHASER examining all enantiomorphs, implementing a fragment
from an ankyrin repeat module with side chains removed from PDB:1N11. Upon
isotropic refinement using PHENIX.refine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref> electron density for the full ankyrin repeat was visible and
modelled using COOT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>. This revealed the
presence of the SPN domain in the weighted difference map that was subsequently
modelled at 1σ. The fully refined electron density map also revealed a
significant amount of ethylene glycol and isopropyl alcohol from the
cryo-protectant bound to the structure. These bound molecules were assigned and
accounted for in the final refinement. Data reduction and refinement statistics
are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supplementary

<p id="P63">Statistical testing was determined using the Student’s t-test
(unpaired two-tailed, unequal variance) or ANOVA (followed by Dunnett’s
test for multiple comparisons, where appropriate). All experiments were repeated
at least three times unless otherwise indicated. N numbers are indicated in the
figure legends. P-value of 0.05 was considered as a borderline for statistical
significance (P &gt; 0.05). P-values are indicated in the figures. The
experiments were not randomized. No statistical method was used to determine
sample size. Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and
outcome assessment except for FACS assays.</p>
