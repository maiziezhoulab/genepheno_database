<p id="P2">Mutation of <italic>SMARCA4</italic> (<italic>BRG1</italic>), the ATPase
of BAF (mSWI/SNF) and PBAF complexes, contributes to a range of malignancies and
neurologic disorders. Unfortunately, the effects of SMARCA4 missense mutations
have remained uncertain. Here we show that SMARCA4 cancer missense mutations
target conserved ATPase surfaces and disrupt the mechanochemical cycle of
remodeling. We find that heterozygous expression of mutants alters the open
chromatin landscape at thousands of sites across the genome. Loss of DNA
accessibility does not directly overlap with Polycomb accumulation, but is
enriched in “A compartments” at active enhancers, which lose
H3K27ac but not H3K4me1. Affected positions include hundreds of sites identified
as superenhancers in many tissues. Dominant-negative mutation induced
pro-oncogenic expression changes, including increased expression of
<italic>Myc</italic> and its target genes. Together, our data suggest that
disruption of enhancer accessibility represents a key source of altered function
in <italic>SMARCA4</italic>-mutated disorders in a wide variety of tissues.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">Epigenetic deregulation is widely regarded as a hallmark of cancer and
certain neurologic disorders. Among the most frequently mutated chromatin regulatory
complexes are polymorphic BAF (mSWI/SNF) and PBAF complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. These ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers are mutated in
~20% of cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, with mutations in specific subunits
contributing to specific cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.
For cancers such as malignant rhabdoid tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and synovial
sarcoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, tissue-specific
alterations of individual BAF subunits arise in ~100% of cases, and
repair of these defects in cell-culture models leads to loss of both transformation
and proliferation. Moreover, animal models and epigenomic studies of human patients
have provided extensive evidence that these complexes are major tumor
suppressors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> whose
mutations contribute to transformation in many cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">In malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs) and synovial sarcoma (SS), the ability of
BAF complexes to oppose Polycomb repression proximal to transcription start sites
(TSSs) is central to their role in these malignancies. In MRTs, biallelic loss of
<italic>SMARCB1</italic> induces abnormal subunit composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and impairs opposition to Polycomb silencing at the
tumor-suppressor gene <italic>p16</italic> (<italic>INK4A</italic>, refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>). Silencing of <italic>p16</italic> in turn impairs
cell-cycle control, thereby inducing rapid transformation and proliferation without
genomic instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In SS, the protein product of the
<italic>SS18-SSX</italic> gene fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> incorporates into BAF complexes, leading to reduction of
the Polycomb-associated silencing mark H3K27me3 near the TSSs of oncogenic genes
such as <italic>EGR1</italic> (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>) and <italic>SOX2</italic> (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>). For both MRTs and SS, changes of Polycomb
occupancy at TSSs across the genome coincide with transformation, and in both cases,
these changes are reversible by exogenous expression or repair of the underlying BAF
defect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">Recent studies in BAF-deficient cancer models have revealed alterations at
enhancers distal to TSSs, which contain transcription factor binding sites. In MRT
cells, loss of <italic>SMARCB1</italic> induces characteristic changes of the
permissive mark H3K27ac at tissue-restricted enhancers, but largely preserves the
function of superenhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.
Moreover, in animal models of colon cancer, loss of the BAF subunit Arid1a leads to
impaired enhancer function, with deregulation of APC–beta-catenin signaling
pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Similar
results have been observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs),
topoisomerase inhibition leads to impairment of BAF’s ability to generate
accessible sites over the genome, indicating these factors work in tandem to
generate accessibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Thus,
emerging evidence suggests that altered function at enhancers arises upon loss of
BAF activity, in addition to Polycomb deregulation.</p>
<p id="P6"><italic>SMARCA4 (BRG1)</italic>, a central ATPase of BAF complexes, is the
most frequently mutated Snf2-like gene in human cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, and has been identified as a major tumor suppressor
in pan-cancer studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Unlike the tissue-restricted
alterations of <italic>SMARCB1</italic> and <italic>SS18</italic>, loss-of-function
mutations of <italic>SMARCA4</italic> are enriched in diverse cancer types,
contributing to a range of cancers including those of the lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, ovaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>,
skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, thoracic sarcomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, and lymphomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.
<italic>SMARCA4</italic> inactivation is especially common in small cell
carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Dual
biallelic inactivation of <italic>SMARCA4</italic> and the related ATPase
<italic>SMARCA2</italic> are highly specific to SCCOHT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, indicating that complete loss of BAF and PBAF
ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity is an essential feature of this
malignancy.</p>
<p id="P7">In contrast to the precise, reproducible genetic changes observed in SCCOHT,
the impacts of diverse heterozygous <italic>SMARCA4</italic> mutations distributed
across many cancer types have remained uncertain and controversial. Recently, we
showed that deletion and heterozygous cancer mutations of the SMARCA4 ATPase induce
genome-wide accumulation of Polycomb Repressive Complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) at
bivalent TSSs across the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.
However, it has remained uncertain how these mutations impair SMARCA4’s
fundamental mechanisms to promote malignancy. Here we show that these mutations
induce divergent effects on SMARCA4 dynamics in living cells, but the impairment of
normal function through distinct mechanisms results in convergent changes of the DNA
accessibility landscape at enhancers and superenhancers used in many cell types.</p>

<title>Heterozygous mutation of <italic>SMARCA4</italic> is a common feature of many
cancers</title>
<p id="P8">To assess the frequency of heterozygous <italic>SMARCA4</italic> missense
mutations in cancer, we performed a pan-cancer analysis of annotated human tumor
sequencing studies, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) whole-exome
studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and
MSK-IMPACT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> targeted
sequencing studies where <italic>SMARCA4</italic> mutations and deletions were
observed. We eliminated samples with only silent mutations and no other changes,
and furthermore restricted our analysis to samples where copy number analysis
had also been performed, leaving 927 human tumor samples. Analysis of the
overall genetic state of <italic>SMARCA4</italic> in these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>) shows that most samples
(56.5%, 524/927) contain a single allele affected by missense mutations
without other aberrations. In contrast, other major tumor suppressors, such as
<italic>ARID1A</italic> (20.9%, 370/1773, p&lt;2.2e-16) and
<italic>RB1</italic> (14.5%, 155/1066, p&lt;2.2e-16), have
significantly lower fractions of samples with only single missense mutations
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">To assess whether samples with missense mutations had comparable levels
of expression as non-mutated samples, we analyzed RNA-seq data from TCGA
studies. We found that samples with single missense mutations had comparable
levels of <italic>SMARCA4</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>), consistent with heterozygous mutation. Our analysis
shows that heterozygous mutation is the most common mode of disruption to many
different cancers where <italic>SMARCA4</italic> is mutated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Cancer mutations of <italic>SMARCA4</italic> induce distinct dynamic defects
of remodeling in living cells</title>
<p id="P10">Frequent cancer mutations within the SMARCA4 ATPase domain have provided
a rich source of alleles to probe the mechanisms of these proteins. To gain
insight into their mechanisms, we generated a homology model of SMARCA4 bound to
a nucleosome based on the high degree of sequence homology with structures of
related Snf2 homologues from diverse organisms, including <italic>Saccharomyces
cerevisiae</italic> Snf2 (PDB accession code 5X0X)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, <italic>Thermothelomyces thermophila</italic>
Snf2 (PDB 5HZR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, and
<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Chd1 (PDB 3MWY)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Full details of the
construction of this homology model are provided in the Methods section, and
three-dimensional coordinates of mouse and human SMARCA4 homology models are
provided in PDB format as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">supplemental data</xref>. Our model revealed that frequently mutated
positions of SMARCA4 lie in functionally important surfaces, such as the DNA
groove between the N- and C-terminal ATPase domains, and the ATP cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">We analyzed the positions of all cancer missense mutations on
cBioPortal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>; we found
that most (56%, N=575) <italic>SMARCA4</italic> mutations affected the
bipartite ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). By
calculating the solvent-accessible surface area for each position, we found that
frequently mutated positions in cancer are distributed in structurally diverse
locations of the domain. Some mutation hotspots, such as T910, are expected to
affect residues that are buried or have little exposed surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). As disruption of folding or
thermodynamic stability would be expected to impair function in a non-specific
manner, we turned our focus to residues that were frequently mutated at
important surfaces, specifically, the ATP cleft and DNA groove (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">We hypothesized that mutations of these positions might induce distinct
dynamic defects, since they occur at surfaces with unique molecular functions.
We therefore generated a targeted library of mutations at these sites, including
p.G782S, p.G784E, p.K785R, p.T786I, p.T786N, p.P811R, p.L815P, p.Y860H, p.E861K,
p.D881G, p.E882D, p.E882K, and p.H884N (numbered according to the human protein
product; UniProt, P51532). We expressed these as C-terminal GFP fusions, and
performed a screen of these for dynamic defects using fluorescence recovery
after photobleaching (FRAP) following lentiviral transduction in 293T cells
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d–f</xref>). Compared to
wild-type SMARCA4-GFP, we found that mutants located at the ATP cleft
consistently resulted in slower FRAP recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>). In contrast, mutants located at the DNA groove
consistently resulted in fast recovery times compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>). These data are consistent with a
model whereby DNA-groove mutants disrupt engagement of immobile chromatin, but
ATP-cleft mutants disrupt ATP-dependent release from immobile chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2g</xref>). This model is supported by
previous observations that the ATPase activity of SMARCA4 and orthologs is
DNA-stimulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, as ATP hydrolysis requires
prior interaction with nucleic acid substrate.</p>
<p id="P13">To validate the observed dynamics from this screen, we generated a
transgenic mouse expressing SMARCA4 fused to the fluorescent protein Dendra2
(ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>), comparable to GFP
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Figure S2</xref>). This
fusion did not affect protein function, and homozygous SMARCA4-Dendra2 mice have
been bred and deposited at Jackson Laboratories for cryopreservation (stock
#27901). In mESCs, SMARCA4-Dendra2 displays a high degree of stability
(with stability half-life comparable to the cell doubling time), and shows FRAP
dynamic properties identical to SMARCA4-GFP expressed via lentiviral
transduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure
S3</xref>), confirming the validity of our approach. Interestingly, we find that
the delayed FRAP recovery of ATPase mutants arises during interphase but not
mitosis, where BAF is largely excluded from condensed mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">S4</xref>) consistent with
previous observations that SMARCA4 is phosphorylated during mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Our results reveal a
convergence between tumor sequencing studies, molecular structure, and live-cell
dynamics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Cancer mutants induce convergent effects on the chromatin landscape</title>
<p id="P14">Because ATP-cleft and DNA-groove mutants induced opposing dynamic
effects, we anticipated that they might give rise to distinct effects on the
chromatin landscape, even in a heterozygous setting frequently observed in
cancer. To probe the functional impacts of commonly mutated positions, we used
mESCs as a convenient model to investigate the conserved effects following
<italic>SMARCA4</italic> disruption. These cells are advantageous for
fundamental studies due to the clonal nature of their growth, lack of genetic
heterogeneity, negligible mutation load, and the availability of genetic tools
such as conditional knockouts. ES cells also do not express the alternate BAF
ATPase SMARCA2 (BRM), permitting us to exclude confounding effects from this
homologous gene. Using a conditional <italic>SMARCA4</italic> knockout mESC
line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, we rescued
<italic>SMARCA4</italic> deletion with lentiviral expression of wild-type
SMARCA4-GFP fusion and either wild-type or mutant SMARCA4 tagged with V5
(SMARCA4-V5). Resulting cells had expression levels of <italic>SMARCA4</italic>
equivalent to those of endogenous protein, as previously described (Figure S4 in
ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>). As a control, we
compared results from these cells to those from similarly prepared cells
expressing wild-type SMARCA4-V5 instead of a mutant. This strategy allowed us to
observe the effects of mutation in a setting that mimics heterozygous mutation
present in human cancers.</p>
<p id="P15">We performed ATAC-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> to identify locations where <italic>SMARCA4</italic>
mutants altered genomic DNA accessibility. To our surprise, we discovered that
heterozygous mutants gave rise to highly-correlated changes across the genome
compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure
3a–c</xref>). Accessibility losses associated with mutants were
generally stronger and more frequent than sites that gained accessibility. We
assigned sites into one of three categories: decreased, unchanged, and
increased, using the definitions found in the Methods section. We analyzed the
genomic annotations of sites that decreased accessibility and discovered that
relative to unchanged sites, these were highly enriched at non-coding regions,
particularly introns and intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">We furthermore analyzed a dataset of 111 public ChIP-seq studies in
wild-type mESCs, which permitted us to investigate the association of factors
with gains or losses of accessibility in our current study. Lasso multivariate
regression for all our mutant ATAC-seq datasets revealed a robust and consistent
association with several factors related to enhancers in mESCs, including Lsd1,
Smc1, H3K27ac, Oct4, and Brd4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure
3e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P17">Because these changes were highly correlated across all mutants, we
conclude that these mutants surprisingly have convergent effects on the DNA
accessibility landscape. We therefore focused the remainder of our analysis on
G784E, which is located at the ATP-binding cleft in the Walker A motif and makes
direct contact with ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). We
find that ATAC accessibility sites were enriched in wild-type cells with ChIP
density of Smarcc1, a core subunit of BAF complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f–h</xref>). Furthermore, sites with decreased
accessibility following expression of G784E SMARCA4 (n=8,805) were highly
enriched with H3K4me1 in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure
3f</xref>), a mark frequently found at enhancers. Sites that increased
accessibility (n=2,887) typically had low levels of Lsd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3h</xref>), an H3K4 demethylase involved in enhancer
decommissioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.
These results suggest that the gains of accessibility following expression of

<title>Polycomb accumulation does not reduce local accessibility</title>
<p id="P18">Polycomb repression is thought to be mediated by altering DNA
accessibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. We
investigated the relationship between changes of accessibility and Polycomb
accumulation that occurs over the genome. We examined direct overlap between
changes of Polycomb occupancy (reflected by ChIP-seq of Ring1b, a core catalytic
subunit of PRC1), and DNA accessibility (reflected by ATAC-seq), in two
settings: <italic>SMARCA4</italic> conditional biallelic deletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, and heterozygous ATPase mutation (G784E). Although
both conditional knockout and heterozygous mutation result in strong and
characteristic accumulation of PRC1 and PRC2 at bivalent TSSs over the
genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, we observed
no direct relationship between increases of Polycomb and altered accessibility
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a–d</xref>). This observation
did not arise due to non-overlap of peaks, as ATAC-seq and Ring1b ChIP peaks had
high enrichment at both TSSs and enhancers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Figure S5</xref>), and changes
at individual sites were highly reproducible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Figure S6</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">We confirmed this result by performing ATAC-seq following dual
conditional knockout of <italic>Ring1a</italic> and <italic>Ring1b</italic>
(ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>), both catalytic
subunits of PRC1, and found that global accessibility at TSSs showed few
changes. Instead, altered accessibility at enhancers was far more apparent
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref>, p&lt;2.2e-16).
Therefore, the increased occupancy of PRC1 we previously described at TSSs
following <italic>SMARCA4</italic> inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> does not directly coincide with altered
accessibility. We conclude that DNA accessibility changes are distinct from
accumulation of Polycomb complexes at bivalent TSSs. Our results challenge
longstanding in vitro models of the repressive mechanisms associated with
Polycomb factors.</p>

<title>Epigenomic alterations to enhancer identity</title>
<p id="P20">We next sought to compare the effects of heterozygous SMARCA4 mutation
on accessibility at enhancers and TSSs. Accessibility was broadly unaffected at
TSSs, but was reduced at annotated mESC enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure
5a–b</xref>, additional examples in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S7</xref>).
Accessibility at TSSs and enhancers was also broadly mirrored by altered ChIP
read density of RNAP2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure
S8</xref>), suggesting that altered accessibility has functional importance
for regulation of transcription.</p>
<p id="P21">To identify other chromatin features accompanying accessibility changes,
we focused on three marks and factors: H3K4me1, RNAP2, and H3K27ac. We performed
ChIP-seq for these factors in both WT/WT and WT/G784E mESCs to measure their
changes at sites with altered accessibility. Despite significant correlation
(R=0.334, p&lt;2.22e-16), the effect size of altered H3K4me1 was low
(m=0.104), showing that sites with decreased accessibility generally maintained
high levels of H3K4me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>). RNAP2
also showed significant correlation (R=0.230, p&lt;2.2e-16), with a modest
effect size (m=0.114). However, RNAP2 ChIP revealed that a small number of
decreased sites also showed losses of RNAP2, suggesting that RNAP2 loading may
only be affected when certain combinations of other changes occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>). On the other hand, H3K27ac showed
robust effects (R=0.358, p&lt;2.2e-16) with a prominent effect size
(m=0.370), indicating a stronger relationship between H3K27ac and DNA
accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5e</xref>). Hence, these
sites transition from being “active” enhancers (with high
H3K27ac and high accessibility) to “poised” enhancers (with
maintained H3K4me1, but reduced H3K27ac and reduced accessibility).</p>
<p id="P22">Consistently, sites that lost accessibility (N=2,692) had the highest
levels of H3K27ac in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure
5f</xref>). In contrast, the sites that showed increased accessibility
(N=1,040) generally had lower levels of both H3K4me1 and H3K27ac in wild-type
cells. Since most of these did not take on new elevated levels of H3K4me1 in
mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>), we speculate that
these sites may have taken on other unknown regulatory roles in mutant
cells.</p>
<p id="P23">By exploring average accessibility changes over transcription factor
sequence motifs, ATAC-seq permitted us to identify a set of transcription
factors whose cognate sequences show reduced accessibility. One of these was the
combination motif for Oct4-Sox2-Tcf-Nanog, which undergoes a ~2-fold
reduction of nucleosome-free ATAC-seq reads over the motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5g</xref>). By scanning for reproducible changes, we
obtained a list of 18 transcription factor motifs, with recurrent losses of
accessibility following expression of G784E SMARCA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5h</xref>). Our results show that mutant SMARCA4 induces
alteration of the enhancer landscape affecting a diverse set of factors, rather
than targeting a small subset of transcription factors. These changes in the
enhancer network arise without expression of SMARCA2 (BRM, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">Figure S9</xref>), allowing us
to attribute our observations to SMARCA4 mutants.</p>

whether heterozygous <italic>SMARCA4</italic> mutations would have similar
effects. By classifying sites into genomic annotations for mESC transcription
start sites (TSS), overall enhancers (Enh), or superenhancers (SE), we find that
superenhancers show distributions of accessibility changes comparable with
overall enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5i</xref>), both of
which are significantly tilted towards losses compared to TSSs
(p&lt;2.2e-16). Therefore, superenhancers are significantly impacted by

<p id="P25">Chromatin regulatory interactions in embryonic stem cells anticipate

that many sites we observed with reduced accessibility may correspond to sites
with regulatory roles in differentiated cells. To assess whether affected sites
correspond to important regulatory sites in multiple cell types, we examined
overlap with an ensemble of annotated superenhancers across a variety of
differentiated tissues, including those from lung, intestines, hematological,
and neuronal lineages. By comparing to sites in the dbSUPER database of
superenhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, we
found 940 sites (34.9% of decreased sites overall) are significantly
enriched for direct overlap with previously annotated superenhancer sites from
at least one tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5j–k</xref>,
p&lt;2.2e-16). Plotting the distribution of associated tissue types for
each superenhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5l</xref>) reveals that
that most of these sites (51.5%, 484/940) are superenhancers in more
than a single tissue type. Therefore, heterozygous mutations of
<italic>SMARCA4</italic> induce accessibility losses at sites identified to
have essential roles in maintaining cell identity across multiple tissue types.
Our findings furthermore show that BAF-dependent accessibility anticipates
lineage specification in several lineages.</p>

<title>Effects on genomic accessibility are dominant negative</title>
<p id="P26">We next sought to investigate whether the observed changes reflected
<italic>SMARCA4</italic> haploinsufficiency, or were instead a
dominant-negative effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. To
measure the impact of loss from a single allele, we derived a line of mESCs for
conditional deletion of only one allele of <italic>SMARCA4</italic>. This
actin::CreER <italic>SMARCA4</italic>(+/fl) line expresses Cre recombinase fused
to the estrogen receptor (CreER), and encodes a single floxed allele of
<italic>SMARCA4</italic>, with the remaining allele wild-type. This
permitted us to conditionally delete a single allele in the presence of
4-hydroxytamoxifen (Tam), and compare against mock treatment with ethanol
(EtOH). Western blotting showed reduction of half of SMARCA4 protein levels
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a–b</xref>) after
tamoxifen-induced deletion. However, we did not observe reproducible changes in
chromatin accessibility using ATAC-seq following loss of the single allele, and
only a single site met the criteria for a decreased site out of 41,267 ATAC-seq
sites across the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref>).
Notably, we did not detect changes at enhancers or TSSs as we observed for the
ATPase mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d–e</xref>).
Importantly, our results leave open the possibility of changes at sites of lower
accessibility or in other cell types, or of other haploinsufficient roles (e.g.,
in DNA repair).</p>
<p id="P27">In contrast to loss of a single allele, G784E SMARCA4 resulted in
accessibility losses that were correlated in position over the body of the
chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6f</xref>). Analysis of Hi-C
data (see Methods section) permitted us to partition each chromosome into large
multi-megabase-scale compartments termed “A” and
“B” compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. We found
that the more transcriptionally active A compartments tended to have more acute
accessibility losses than the more repressed B compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6f</xref>). Focal accessibility changes
within A compartments were significantly tilted towards losses compared to B
compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6g–h</xref>,
p&lt;2.2e-16). Thus, enhancers in A compartments are differentially
sensitive to the expression of ATPase mutant SMARCA4. However, these same sites
are unaffected by loss of expression from a single allele of
<italic>SMARCA4</italic>. Therefore, the strong effects following
heterozygous SMARCA4 ATPase mutation reflect genetic dominance rather than
haploinsufficiency.</p>

<title>Pro-oncogenic changes of gene expression include Polycomb and non-Polycomb

<p id="P28">To discover the effects of the altered enhancer landscape on
transcription, we compared wild-type to heterozygous G784E SMARCA4 cells using
RNA-seq. Despite the thousands of sites of altered accessibility described
above, we found a modest set of changes to the transcriptional profiles of
cells, with a small number of genes showing increased (n=49) or decreased
(n=191) expression, using the criteria in the Methods section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7a</xref>). Genes with changes included
previously annotated Polycomb targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> (n=86), which were significantly enriched among all
altered genes (odds ratio=1.74, p=7.7e-5). We also observed altered expression
of genes that are not Polycomb targets (n=154; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P29">Interestingly, despite reduced accessibility of their target sites, we
do not observe loss of expression of the core pluripotency network, including

Expression of these factors is maintained or even enhanced in heterozygous

that cell identity may be maintained through compensating mechanisms, despite a
dramatic reshuffling of the enhancer and superenhancer landscape. In ES cells,
these compensating mechanisms include upregulation of <italic>Myc</italic>, a
hallmark of cancer that may be considered a pro-oncogenic response.
Interestingly, biallelic deletion of <italic>SMARCA4</italic> in the same cells

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P30">Here we analyzed human tumor sequencing data to identify the major role
played by heterozygous mutation of <italic>SMARCA4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We have analyzed the available mutation frequencies
obtained through tumor sequencing studies in the context of structural models of
SMARCA4 we derived from recent discoveries in structural biology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. By doing so, we discovered that frequently mutated
positions of SMARCA4 lie on biologically significant surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). This clustering is consistent with earlier
observations that mutations of key bioactive surfaces are significantly enriched
across several cancer types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.
These mutations induce characteristic dynamic defects, consistent with a model where
binding of SMARCA4 to DNA/nucleosomes promotes immobilization, and release from this
immobile state is catalyzed by ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure
2g</xref>).</p>
<p id="P31">Despite divergent dynamic effects, mutations in either the ATP cleft or DNA
groove give rise to similar changes across the chromatin landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The convergence of these defects
indicates that cancer positively selects for functional inactivation rather than
disruption of individual surfaces <italic>per se</italic>. Our results show that
frequently occurring disease mutations inactivate SMARCA4 by diverse modes, for
example, by impairing ATP hydrolysis, by disrupting DNA binding, and likely through
other mechanisms. Our ATAC-seq results confirm that the effects of these mutations
converge on the open chromatin landscape; we find consistent changes to DNA
accessibility at thousands of sites over the genome, including at a large number of
superenhancers from diverse cell types, regardless of how SMARCA4 is disrupted. In
contrast to biallelic loss of other BAF subunits, which largely arise in
lineage-restricted settings, heterozygous mutations of <italic>SMARCA4</italic>
contribute to malignancies from diverse tissue types. We propose that this broad
pattern largely reflects disruption of the enhancer accessibility landscape,
including superenhancer sites used by many tissue types.</p>
<p id="P32">We find that a set of active enhancers in wild-type mESCs is particularly
predisposed to lose accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).
These changes lead to losses of accessibility at an array of transcription factor
motifs, and concomitant losses of H3K27ac modification, while in most cases
preserving H3K4me1 levels. Hence, enhancer identity (as defined by H3K4me1 marking)
is largely preserved, but active enhancers with high H3K27ac are particularly
sensitive to <italic>SMARCA4</italic> ATPase mutation. These effects are
particularly pronounced in active A compartments, but do not arise upon loss of a
single allele of <italic>SMARCA4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure
5</xref>), indicating dominant-negative effects for the missense mutants. Hence,
we find that chromosomal organization heavily influences the dominant-negative
effects of <italic>SMARCA4</italic> disease mutants. Our data strongly argue that in
addition to its direct effects on PRC1 at bivalent genes (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>), <italic>SMARCA4</italic>
dynamically acts to generate accessibility in transcriptionally active compartments
of the genome, notably at existing superenhancers and latent/primordial
superenhancers.</p>
<p id="P33">Despite the thousands of changes in the open chromatin landscape, these
alterations induce a relatively small number of significant transcriptional changes
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7a</xref>). Altered genes include both
Polycomb-target genes and non-Polycomb-targets, indicating that regulation of the
open chromatin landscape at enhancers constitutes a separate layer of regulation in
addition to the mechanisms previously described for PRC1 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>). Of particular interest is the
up-regulation of the proto-oncogene <italic>Myc</italic> as well as its downstream
targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Myc enhances the stability
of the pluripotency factors at their cognate sites on chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, and relieves transcriptional
pausing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is appealing to speculate that
heterozygous expression of mutant <italic>SMARCA4</italic> in mESCs leads to loss of
transcription factor accessibility or paused polymerases, and increased expression
of <italic>Myc</italic> may compensate by stabilizing the interaction of
transcription factors at their target sites or by relieving polymerase pausing
following <italic>SMARCA4</italic> mutation.</p>
<p id="P34">Altogether, our findings show that heterozygous <italic>SMARCA4</italic>
mutations induce loss of H3K27ac and accessibility at enhancers and superenhancers.
Because ATP-cleft and DNA-groove mutants both induce these effects, we propose that
SMARCA4’s dominant-negative role at enhancers arises via sequestration of
binding partners at unproductive transient binding sites, or in the nucleoplasm
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7e</xref>). Our results reveal that unlike
biallelic loss of <italic>SMARCB1</italic> or <italic>SMARCA4</italic>, heterozygous
<italic>SMARCA4</italic> missense mutations bias the epigenetic landscape by
altering the accessibility of superenhancers used in a variety of different tissues.
These changes permit exploration of other sites in phenotypic space, which may
promote pro-oncogenic changes of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7f</xref>). Given our findings, additional studies in human models of
cancer and neurologic disorders are warranted to fully test and examine the
mechanisms we describe here. Taken together, the distinct effects of
dominant-negative mutations suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting the large
number of missense <italic>SMARCA4</italic> mutations in cancer and neurologic
disorders may require distinct approaches from those targeting biallelic
inactivation.</p>

<p id="P44">For differential analysis, all peaks from control and treatment datasets
within ±1 kb were merged, and peaks below a threshold of 10 RPM in at
least one dataset were discarded to remove low-quality peak calls. Background
density of ATAC-seq signal was obtained by calculating the mean read density in
the 100-bp window 8-kb away from each peak. This background density was
subtracted from the overall read density within each peak in each dataset. For
each dataset, the total number of background-adjusted reads overlapping each of
the resulting peaks was compared for differential peak calling. Differential
peak calls were made using DESeq2 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>), using the summed number of background-adjusted reads
at the top 5% of highest read-density sites as size factors. DESeq2
accounts for individual site variances across all replicates to make
differential peak calls. Log2 fold changes were calculated by the default use of

<title>ChIP-seq library preparation</title>
<p id="P45">ChIP libraries were independently prepared from separately cultured
samples in duplicate, according to previously described protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. Briefly, we fixed 10–30 million cells
in suspension for 15 min in 1% formaldehyde. Excess formaldehyde was
quenched by the addition of glycine to 100 mM. Fixed cells were washed,
pelleted, and flash-frozen. Pellets were thawed, resuspended in NP Rinse 1
buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 10%
glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% Triton X-100) and incubated for 10
min on ice to isolate nuclei. Nuclei were washed once with NP Rinse 2 buffer (10
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EGTA, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl) and
then twice with shearing buffer (0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Pellets were resuspended in 900 µl of shearing buffer
with protease inhibitors and sonicated in a Covaris E220 sonicator for
10–12 min to generate DNA fragments between approximately 200 and 1,000
bp in length. Chromatin was then immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C
with antibodies bound to Protein G Dynabeads. (Life Technologies) in ChIP buffer
(50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Triton
X-100, 0.1% DOC, 0.1% SDS). The chromatin-bead slurry was washed
with a magnetic rack four times with ChIP buffer, once with DOC buffer (10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% DOC, 1 mM EDTA,
pH 8.0), and once with TE buffer. Chromatin was eluted with Q7 elution solution
(0.1 M NaHCO3, 1% SDS). After RNase A (Life Technologies) and proteinase
K (New England BioLabs) digestion and de-crosslinking at 65 °C
overnight, DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with
ethanol. Size selection was performed by extracting 200–400 bp DNA
fragments on a 2% agarose E-gel (Invitrogen) before PCR amplification,
then extracted using MinElute cleanup kits (Qiagen). PCR amplification was
performed using ≤ 14 cycles, and the resulting DNA quantified by Qubit
fluorometric quantitation. Sequencing was performed using single-end reads on
the Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer. Antibodies used in these studies include
rabbit anti-H3K4me1 (Abcam, Cat# ab8895, Lot number: GR251663-1), rabbit
anti-H3K27ac (Abcam, Cat# ab4729, Lot number: GR104852-1), and mouse

<title>Processing of ChIP-seq data</title>
<p id="P46">Analysis of high-throughput sequencing data was not performed blindly,
but the following techniques were applied uniformly to all datasets. Single-end
ChIP seq reads were processed by mapping to the mm9 reference mouse genome using
Bowtie 2.1.0 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>),
rejecting reads that contain more than a single mismatch. Duplicate reads were
discarded, leaving only unique reads. For all analyses, peak calling was
performed by MACS 2.1.1 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>) by comparing to input samples for each cell type.</p>
<p id="P47">All peaks from control and treatment datasets within ±1 kb were
merged, and peaks below a threshold of 30 RPM (in at least one dataset) were
discarded to remove low-quality peak calls. For each dataset, the total number
of reads overlapping each of the resulting peaks was compared for differential
peak calling. Differential peak calls were made using DESeq2 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>), using the summed number of
reads at all sites above the 95th-percentile as size factors to avoid the
influence of background ChIP-seq reads. DESeq2 accounts for individual site
variances across all replicates to make differential peak calls. Log2 fold
changes were calculated by the default use of maximum <italic>a
posteriori</italic> estimation using a zero-mean normal prior
(Tikhonov-Ridge regularization). FDR-corrected P-values were calculated using
the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Differential calls were made by requiring fold
changes of &gt;1.5-fold in either direction and FDR-corrected p &lt;
0.10. RPM values in genome tracks are the mean values across both replicates
from each condition. Calculation of mean genome track densities was performed
using bwtool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup> and browser
tracks were prepared using Gviz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. For presentation in heat maps, ChIP-seq data were ordered

Following first-strand synthesis and cDNA amplification, cDNA was sheared with
Diagenode sonication (25-s pulse, followed by 30-s recovery at 4 °C for

<title>Homology modeling</title>
<p id="P56">Models of the three-dimensional structures of murine and human SMARCA4
(aa 754–1335) were created in the YASARA v16.7.22.L.64 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>) homology modeling module. The
target sequence was PSI-BLASTed against UniRef90 to build a position-specific
scoring matrix from related sequences. This profile was used to search the PDB
for potential modeling templates. The identified templates were ranked based on
the alignment score, the structural quality according to WHAT_CHECK (ref.
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>) obtained from the
PDBFinder2 database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>. The
template search resulted in identification of possible templates out of which 2
templates (PDB IDs 5HZR and 5X0X) were further used for homology modeling
purposes.</p>
<p id="P57">Multiple sequence alignments anchored on structural alignments were
created by aligning the target sequence against UniRef90 and YASARA's
PSSP database using SSALN scoring matrices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. This approach provided 10 different homology modeling
templates. An indexed version of the PDB was used to determine the optimal loop
anchor points and collect possible loop conformations for the unassigned parts
of the sequence in each template. The side-chain rotamers of these sequences
were optimized in implicit solvent so that water molecules did not block the
search. The side-chain rotamers of the whole molecule were then fine-tuned
considering electrostatic and knowledge-based packing interactions as well as
solvation effects. To relieve steric clashes and to fix disordered geometry, the
models were subjected to a high-resolution energy minimization with a shell of
explicit solvent molecules, using the knowledge-based YASARA force field. The
stereochemical properties of each model were evaluated based on the per-residue
quality Z-score. To increase the accuracy, YASARA combined the highest scoring
parts of the 10 models to obtain a hybrid model (overall Z-score ~
−0.81).</p>
<p id="P58">The structure of SMARCA4 in the hybrid model resembles the structure of
the Swi2/Snf2 core from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (PDB ID 5X0X)
and represents the conformation in a nucleosome/DNA-bound state. The interface
region of SMARCA4 and ATP was defined based on the crystal structure of
ATPγS in complex with Chd1 (PDB ID 3MWY), a Snf2-like ATPase with a high
degree of homology to mammalian SMARCA4. The model of full complex was subjected
to side-chain rotamer optimization and refined in an explicit solvent
knowledge-based YASARA force field. Three-dimensional coordinates of mouse and

Briefly, publicly available Hi-C data from mESCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup> was downsampled to 200-kb resolution, and
expected contact frequency between contact pairs (<italic>i,j</italic>) was

contact pair (<italic>i,j</italic>) was calculated by normalizing pair read
counts to expected pair read counts calculated as described above. The matrix of
observed-over-expected ratios constituted an apparent two-state
“checkerboard” matrix, which was clarified further by
calculating the pairwise correlation matrix of the pairwise
observed-over-expected matrix. The top principal component of the correlation
matrix permitted straightforward assignment into A and B compartments based on
