<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">The proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs), and their closely related derivatives, neural progenitors (NPs), in both the developing and adult nervous systems, are tightly controlled by both extrinsic and intrinsic signals. Extrinsic signals, derived from the stem cell niche or embryonic organising centres, need to be recognised, relayed internally, coordinated and interpreted to ultimately produce a precise cellular response. Cell polarity, adhesion, cycle length and migration all influence the response to extrinsic signals. Concerning the cell cycle, the G0 and G1 phases are particularly involved in dictating the fate of a NP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Specifically, it is the length of the G1 phase that regulates progenitor differentiation. Cells that linger in these phases have increased longevity and retain the capacity to self-renew<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Multiple extrinsic signals influence NP cell cycle progression and the intracellular mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway responds to many of these growth factors by coordinating an appropriate RNA and protein synthesis response and, as such, is a major regulator of G0/G1 cell cycle progression. mTOR is an ubiquitous protein kinase found in two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. The mTORC1 complex, which consists of mTOR, regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (RAPTOR) and mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8 (MLST8), responds to growth factor stimulation and links this, along with nutrient availability, to cell growth and division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In particular, mTORC1 response to growth factor stimulation is required for cell cycle progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">mTOR is a critical regulator of NSC/NP function <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> balancing self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation and maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Dysregulation of mTOR signalling gives rise to neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway, due to loss of function mutations in the <italic>TSC1</italic> and <italic>TSC2</italic> genes, upstream inhibitors of mTOR, gives rise to Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). TSC is characterized by benign malformations comprised of aberrantly proliferating non-malignant cells of the tissue of origin. In the brain, these lesions are ectopic neurogenic compartments with enhanced proliferation of NPs and their subsequent premature differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Conversely loss of mTORC1 function results in decreased NP proliferation. Deletion of RAPTOR, an essential protein of the mTORC1 complex, from NPs of the dorsal telencephalon leads to decreased proliferation but not loss of self-renewal capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Similarly, these cardinal features are seen in <italic>ex</italic>-<italic>vivo</italic> cultures of murine NSC/NPs grown as free-floating aggregates, called neurospheres, lacking mTORC1 function: inhibition of mTORC1 signalling in neurospheres, by addition of rapamycin, also decreased proliferation of NPs without affecting the self-renewing capacity of the NSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Therefore, mTOR signalling needs to be tightly balanced to maintain homeostasis in NPs.</p>
<p id="Par4">Another protein well placed to integrate extrinsic signals with the intrinsic responses of NPs, is the ubiquitin-specific protease 9 located on the X-chromosome (USP9X). USP9X is a deubiquitylating enzyme highly expressed in adult and embryonic NPs <italic>in vivo</italic>, and <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Altering <italic>Usp9x</italic> expression levels affects NP function. Moderately increased <italic>Usp9x</italic> expression in mouse embryonic stem cell-derived NPs <italic>in vitro</italic> promotes their self-renewal leading to a large increase in the number of NPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Conversely, Nestin-<italic>cre</italic> mediated deletion of <italic>Usp9x</italic> from all NPs of the mouse central nervous system disrupted their organisation in the ventricular and sub-ventricular zones and results in peri-natal lethality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Deletion of <italic>Usp9x</italic> from the dorsal telencephalon only, is compatible with post-natal survival, but results in a dramatic 75% reduction in adult hippocampal size, suggesting NP proliferation is reduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Mutations in human <italic>USP9X</italic> are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders including X-linked intellectual disability and autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In addition, mutations in Doublecortin that specifically disrupt its ability to interaction with USP9X, result in lissencephaly and severe epilepsy, further highlighting the importance of USP9X function for normal brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">Recently, Usp9x has been implicated in mTOR signalling in C2C12 mouse muscle myoblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Knockdown of <italic>Usp9x</italic> in these cells increased mTORC1 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Epitope pull-down assays showed that Usp9x associated with mTOR, as well as RAPTOR and RICTOR, signature proteins of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 signalling complexes, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However altered expression of USP9X did not affect the level of mTOR protein in HEK293 cells. Here, we show that USP9X is a potent regulator of the mTORC1 signalling in NP/NSCs. Decreasing USP9X levels resulted in a rapid arrest of cultured NPs in G0/G1 of the cell cycle. Further we show that USP9X binds RAPTOR in the developing brain and maintains RAPTOR levels in cultured NPs suggesting RAPTOR is a critical USP9X substrate.</p>

<title>USP9X depletion results in reduced neural progenitor number</title>
<p id="Par6">To directly test the role, if any, of USP9X in NPs we altered its levels in the immortalized human NP cell line, ReNcell VM. To deplete USP9X in these cells, lentiviral vectors with doxycycline-inducible expression of shRNAs directed against <italic>USP9X</italic> were generated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The lentiviral vector also expressed <italic>EGFP</italic>, which was used to identify and FACS purify, successfully transduced pools of cells, for subsequent experiments. Two independent shRNAs (2193 and 4774, indicating the position of the first base pair of the shRNA in the <italic>USP9X</italic> open reading frame) efficiently depleted USP9X and these cell lines were chosen for future experiments. Induction of a scrambled shRNA, as well as the addition of doxycycline, had no effect on USP9X protein levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A</xref>). Partial loss of USP9X was evident 24 hours after doxycycline addition in 2193 and 4774 cells, and reached maximal levels by 72 hours (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A</xref>). To examine the effect of USP9X depletion on ReNcell VM and determine the time of maximum effect, cells were analyzed using the xCELLigence system, which measures electrical impedance, and so is proportional to cell number, in real time. Analysis of two biological replicates revealed that the cell index of ReNcell VM cells expressing <italic>USP9X</italic> shRNAs plateaued approximately 20 hours after doxycycline addition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1B</xref>). In 2193 and 4774 cells the decrease in cell index reached statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05; analysis was obtained by plotting t-values of the two way ANOVA analysis versus time) at 34 hours and 28 hours, respectively. At 24 hours USP9X protein levels were not yet fully depleted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A</xref>). These data indicate that ReNcell VM NPs are particularly sensitive to reduced USP9X levels.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>USP9X depletion reduces ReNcells VM proliferation.

After 72 hours, the cell index was approximately 50% of untreated 2193 cells.

<title>USP9X depletion decreases the proliferation of ReNcell VM cells but does not result in morphological changes, apoptosis or differentiation</title>
<p id="Par7">The xCELLigence cell index, which measures electrical impedance, does not distinguish between effects on cell proliferation, morphology or cell death. Therefore we examined the effect of <italic>USP9X</italic> knock-down on these functions. No changes in ReNcell VM morphology were observed but a clear reduction in the cellular density of USP9X depleted ReNcell VM could be distinguished at 72 hours after doxycycline treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1A</xref>). In addition, lower MTT levels were detected in USP9X depleted ReNcell VM after 48 and 72 hours doxycycline treatment consistent with decreased cell numbers (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1B</xref>). Analysis of both Annexin V (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>) and cleaved caspase 3 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3A</xref>) indicated there was no increase in apoptosis, after 12 and 72 hours doxycyline treatment, respectively. Immunoblot analysis failed to detect any change in the level of the astrocytic marker GFAP or neuronal marker βIII-tubulin, indicating that loss of USP9X did not induce the differentiation of ReNcell VM cells to post-mitotic cell fates (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3B</xref>). Finally, to directly determine the effect on USP9X knockdown on cell proliferation an EdU pulse assay was performed to label cells undergoing DNA synthesis during S-phase. Significantly fewer EdU positive cells were detected in 2193 and 4774 cells treated with doxycycline for 72 hours compared to those expressing the scrambled shRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1C,D</xref>). These data demonstrate that loss of USP9X decreases the proliferation of ReNcell VM cells but does not alter their morphology, cell death or differentiation.</p>

<sec id="Sec5">
<title>USP9X depletion results in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest</title>
<p id="Par8">To investigate if USP9X depletion affected ReNcell VM cell cycle, flow cytometric profiling of cellular DNA content was conducted. Knock-down of USP9X resulted in an increase in cells at the G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle 72 hours after doxycycline treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2A,B</xref>). Over three biological replicates the average increase in cells in G0/G1 following USP9X depletion was 12.6% ± 6.3 (p = 0.0134) for “2913” and 22.91% ± 8.9 (p = 0.0065) for “4774” cells. There was no statistically significant alteration in wildtype or scrambled shRNA cells exposed to doxycycline (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2B</xref>). Removal of doxycycline from the culture medium resulted in restored levels of USP9X and ReNcell VM proliferation (data not shown). These data indicated that USP9X is required for progression of ReNcell VM cells through G0/G1 and/or progression into S-phase. To investigate the molecular mechanism contributing to the accumulation of cells in G0/G1 phase we examined, by immunoblot, the levels of various proteins facilitating the G1/S phase transition. A decrease in the phosphorylated form of retinoblastoma protein (pp-Rb<sup>S780</sup>) was detected in USP9X depleted cells, but only after 72 hours of doxycycline treatment. No consistent changes in other proteins including Cyclin D1 or E2F1 were observed at any stage of the time course (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>). As the xCELLigence cell index of USP9X depleted ReNcell VM cells plateaued at 24 hours this suggested that decreases in pp-Rb<sup>S780</sup> were unlikely to be the mechanism initiating the G0/G1 arrest.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Loss of USP9X results in ReNcell VM cell accumulation in the G0/G1 phase of cell cycle.

<title>USP9X depletion in ReNcell VM cells reduces mTORC1 signalling</title>
<p id="Par9">It has recently been reported that USP9X interacts with the mTOR signalling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, a major regulator of progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. mTOR exists in two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, and the activity of each pathway is measured by the phosphorylation of their substrates, S6 and Akt, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In the absence of growth factor stimulation, cells arrest in G0. However, re-addition of growth factors promptly activates mTOR signalling. Therefore we examined the activation of mTOR in ReNcell VM cells, by the re-addition of EGF and FGF, in the presence and absence of USP9X. ReNcell VM cells were exposed to doxycycline for 72 hours for maximal knock-down of USP9X, and a further 24 hours in the absence of EGF and FGF to cause G0 arrest. Upon the reintroduction of EGF and FGF there was a rapid increase in pS6 levels, dependent on the presence of USP9X (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3A,E</xref>). A failure to induce pS6, in the absence of USP9X, was observed in each of six biological replicates. There were no obvious or consistent alterations in pAKT, total S6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3A</xref>) or total AKT (data not shown) protein levels across the biological replicates. To determine if the decreased mTORC1 signalling occurred with similar kinetics to the observed cell index plateauing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1B</xref>) upon USP9X depletion, we examined pS6 protein levels following 24 hours doxycycline treatment. A similar decrease in pS6 levels in the absence of USP9X was detected at this earlier time point (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3B</xref>) suggesting this may account for the plateauing cell index detected in the xCelligence assay.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>mTORC1 activity and RAPTOR levels in ReNcell VM cells are dependent on USP9X. (<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of growth factor induction of mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways in absence of USP9X. USP9X was depleted from 2193 and 4774 cells by 72 hours exposure to doxycycline before growth factors (EGF/FGF) were removed from ReNcell VM medium 24 hours prior to protein collection (0 minutes) and then 5 and 15 minutes after re-addition of EGF/FGF. Both pS6 and pAkt levels increased upon exposure to EGF/FGF (compare 0 to 5 and 15 min) indicating both mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathway activation, respectively. However, the extent of induction for pS6 was markedly reduced in the absence of USP9X (compare plus and minus Dox at 5 and 15 mins in 2193 and 4774). Total S6 and Total AKT were not affected by USP9X depletion. Representative of three biological repeats.

<title>USP9X binds and regulates RAPTOR levels</title>
<p id="Par11">RAPTOR is the major scaffolding protein of the mTORC1 complex and also binds p70S6K<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The level of RAPTOR protein is reportedly regulated by ubiquitylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> raising the possibility that USP9X maintains mTORC1 signalling by opposing RAPTOR degradation in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. If so, the levels of substrate, RAPTOR, should correlate with those of the deubiquitylating enzyme, USP9X. We’ve shown that loss of USP9X correlated with decreased levels of RAPTOR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3D,F</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>). To further investigate the relationship between these proteins, we determined if endogenous Usp9x and Raptor proteins interacted by performing immunoprecipitation on lysate from the frontal cortex of embryonic mouse brains, which are enriched for NPs. A clear interaction between endogenous Usp9x and Raptor proteins was detected, as was a weaker interaction with p70S6K in E14.5 tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4A</xref>). Interestingly, no interaction between Usp9x and mTOR was detected under these conditions. In addition, immunoprecipitation using anti-RAPTOR antibodies enriched for Usp9x (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4B</xref>). Therefore USP9X and RAPTOR interact <italic>in vivo</italic>. Next, USP9X was transiently over-expressed in HEK293 cells (due to low transfection efficiency of ReNcell VM cells). Increased levels of USP9X resulted in increased RAPTOR but did not alter the level of other mTORC1 pathway components including mTOR or total S6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4C</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>). Over-expression of three USP9X mutations, which are associated with human intellectual disability but do not affect their deubiquitylating activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, also increased RAPTOR levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4C</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par12">The above loss- and gain-of-function approaches, in human ReNcell VM cells and HEK293T cells, respectively, identified a direct correlation between USP9X and RAPTOR protein levels but they do not indicate if USP9X’s deubiquitylating activity is required. Recently a small compound, WP1130, has been identified which inhibits USP9X DUB activity, but does not affect USP9X protein level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In addition, WP1130 rapidly inhibits USP9X within hours, compared with days for RNA knock-down approaches and thereby circumvents possible induction of compensatory DUB expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The addition of WP1130 to proliferating ReNcell VM cells under normal culture conditions, in the presence of EGF and FGF, resulted in a rapid (2 hours) decrease in RAPTOR protein levels but had no effect on pp70S6K (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4D</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>). As reported by others, WP1130 did not affect the level of USP9X protein, but did deplete another USP9X substrate, MCL1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> after 4 hours. Therefore, inhibition of USP9X’s deubiquitylating activity leads to a rapid decrease in RAPTOR protein in ReNcell VM cells.</p>

<title>USP9X opposes proteasomal degradation of RAPTOR</title>
<p id="Par13">The above data are consistent with USP9X opposing the degradation of RAPTOR in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. To directly examine this, we measured RAPTOR levels in ReNcell VM cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor, epoxomicin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Epoxomicin treatment for 4 hours increased RAPTOR levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4E</xref> lane 2) suggesting it is subject to proteasomal degradation in ReNcell VM cells. As shown previously, inhibition of USP9X deubiquitylating activity by WP1130 resulted in depleted RAPTOR levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4E</xref> lane 4). The combination of epoxomicin and WP1130 resulted in intermediate levels of Raptor protein compared with epoxomicin or WP1130 alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4E</xref>, compare lane 6 with 2 and 4). These data are consistent with USP9X’s deubiquityling activity opposing degradation of RAPTOR by the proteasome. However, as WP1130 activity inhibits deubiquitylating enzymes other than USP9X<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> proteasomal inhibition experiments were repeated in the 2193 and 4774 ReNcell VM lines to validate a specific role for USP9X in the inhibition of RAPTOR degradation. As for WP1130, doxycycline knockdown of USP9X produced similar results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4F</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S8</xref>). Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis indicated that loss of USP9X did not affect Raptor mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S9</xref>) consistent with post-translational regulation.</p>

<title>USP9X null neurospheres have reduced neural progenitor proliferation but not stem cell self-renewal</title>

When mTORC1 signalling is inhibited in NSC/NPs cultured <italic>ex</italic>-<italic>vivo</italic> as neurospheres, the reduced NP proliferation manifested as a reduction of neurosphere size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

Upon single cell dissociation and re-culture at very low density, to exclude cell aggregation, only cells with stem cell-like properties reform neurospheres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. These spherogenic neural stem cells typically represent only ~1–5% of the cells derived from neurospheres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In contrast NPs have very limited capacity to reform spheres over multiple passages. We applied the well-established serial passage sphere-forming assay to identify the effect, if any, of Usp9x loss on the long-term self-renewal of the spehrogenic NSC population. In this assay, a set number of single NPs are plated at very low density following each passage (1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/ml) and the number of spheres that form in those cultures then counted. Over several passages, <italic>Usp9x</italic>
<sup>−/Y</sup> cultures consistently contained significantly more neurosphere forming cells (2. 6% compared to 1.7%; p &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5B</xref>). Next we asked if the loss of Usp9x had any effect on the multipotency of the NSC/NPs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5C,D</xref>). As each sphere is derived from a single cell, the cell types a sphere can produce reflects the multipotency of the original sphere-forming cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Spheres were plated at very low density and allowed to differentiate before identifying the three basic neural lineages that are produced from embryonic NSCs, namely, neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5C</xref>). We scored individual spheres for the presence of all three, two or one lineages as tri-, bi and mono-potent respectively. The majority of spheres (70–73%) were tri-potent, and there were no significant differences between <italic>Usp9x</italic>
<sup>+/Y</sup> and <italic>Usp9x</italic>
<sup>−/Y</sup> cultures, suggesting loss of Usp9x had no effect on the multipotency of the sphere-forming stem cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5D</xref>). Given the increase in the number of spheres in <italic>Usp9x</italic>
<sup>−/Y</sup> cultures, we asked if this resulted into an increase in the absolute number of cells that were produced during culture, however, both <italic>Usp9x</italic>
<sup>+/Y</sup> and <italic>Usp9x</italic>
<sup>−/Y</sup> cultures produced equivalent cell numbers across several passages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5E</xref>). This finding had two implication; firstly that the increased percentage of sphere forming cells in <italic>Usp9x</italic>
<sup>−/Y</sup> cultures translated into increases in the absolute number of sphere forming cells in the cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5F</xref>); and secondly, that individual neurospheres in <italic>Usp9x</italic>
<sup>−/Y</sup> cultures must contain fewer cells. Indeed, on average, neurospheres in <italic>Usp9x</italic>
<sup>−/Y</sup> cultures displayed modest but significant reductions in the number of cells per sphere (30% reduction; ~95 compared to ~66 cells/sphere), which was also reflected in reductions in the average sphere diameter (24% reduction; ~79 compared to ~60 μm/sphere) at the time of passaging (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5A,G,H</xref>). Therefore, while loss of Usp9x promoted the self-renewal and expansion of the sphere-forming population, the bulk growth of the sphere after formation was compromised. To investigate if this loss of bulk growth could be attributed to altered differentiation behaviour, we used immunofluorescence to reveal the expression of cell-type specific marker proteins to identifying cell types present in the spheres. As it is technically difficult to resolve in the 3D environment of a neurosphere, we dissociated the neurosphere cultures into single cells and plated them onto coverslips. Following attachment overnight and 24 hours growth, cells were fixed and stained for marker proteins of NPs (Sox2), neurons (βIII-tubulin) and astrocytes (GFAP) and nuclei counterstained with DAPI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5I</xref>). Using this labelling regime, greater than 99% of all cells were labelled (data not shown). At this time, there was already a 51% reduction in total cell numbers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5J</xref>). This reduction was solely due to a loss of Sox2-positive NPs (67% decrease) with the numbers of astrocytes and neurons being equivalent. To directly test if the absence of <italic>Usp9x</italic> affected NP proliferation, neurospheres were exposed to a 6 hour EdU pulse followed by cell counts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5K,L</xref>) or flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S9</xref>). As was observed for ReNcell VM cells, significantly fewer Sox2-positive NPs were proliferating (EdU-positive) in the Usp9x-deleted neurospheres.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Loss of <italic>Usp9x</italic> promotes stem-cell self-renewal and loss of bulk NP proliferation.

<p id="Par15">In aggregate these data strongly suggest the absence of Usp9x in neurospheres promotes the self-renewal of a rare population of sphere-forming cells that displays the properties consistent with that of NSCs, whilst simultaneously inhibiting the proliferative capacity of the bulk transiently amplifying NP population.

<p id="Par17">
<italic>USP9X</italic> is highly expressed in, and regulates the function of, NPs both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Previously, increased expression of <italic>Usp9x</italic> was shown to regulate NP self-renewal by promoting apical-basal cell polarity and altering the architecture of NP cultures derived from mouse embryonic stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Here we show USP9X is also required to maintain proliferation of the human NP line ReNcell VM, in a cell autonomous manner, and this is probably mediated via facilitating mTORC1 pathway signalling.</p>
<p id="Par18">Inducible knock-down of USP9X demonstrated that ReNcell VM cells are exceptionally sensitive to USP9X depletion. Within 24 hours of initiating USP9X knock-down, proliferation of the ReNcell VM cells halted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>) despite the presence of mitogenic quantities of EGF and FGF. Considering that USP9X protein levels were not completely depleted at this time (in some experiments USP9X was only 50% depleted) and, that ReNcell VM have a cell cycle time of approximately 30 hours, this indicates that even partial depletion of USP9X results in a rapid and comprehensive arrest of proliferation. Although apoptosis can quickly alter cell numbers, and the anti-apoptopic protein MCL1 is a USP9X substrate in some cellular contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, no alterations in Annexin V or cleaved caspase 3 levels were detected, indicating no increase in apoptosis (Supplementary Figs <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). Nor did USP9X depletion promote the differentiation of ReNcells VM to post-mitotic neuronal or glial lineages (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). Instead the NPs accumulated in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). This rapid response was not due to alterations in G1/S check-point proteins, although a delayed decrease in pRb levels was observed.</p>
<p id="Par19">The mTOR pathway regulates progression through the G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and Usp9x influences mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathway activity in the C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Here we show that USP9X is required for mTORC1, but not mTORC2, activity in ReNcell VM human NPs. The depletion of USP9X levels, loss of mTORC1 signalling, as indicated by failure to induce p-S6, and ReNcell VM cell-cycle arrest, all occurred with very similar kinetics strongly suggesting these NPs rely on USP9X-dependent mTORC1 activity for proliferation.</p>
<p id="Par20">Post-translational modification of mTOR proteins, including by ubiquitylation, allow the mTOR pathway to respond rapidly to changing extra-cellular signals. Both p-mTOR and RAPTOR are targeted for proteasomal degradation by poly-ubiquitylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Here we present several lines of evidence identifying the canonical mTORC1 scaffold protein, RAPTOR, as a probable USP9X substrate in NP/NSCs. Firstly, we show that endogenous USP9X and RAPTOR proteins co-immunoprecipitate from mouse embryonic brain tissue enriched for NPs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6A,B</xref>). USP9X did not interact with mTOR under the same conditions. The much weaker interaction detected between USP9X and pp70S6K (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6A</xref>) may be direct or indirect via RAPTOR, which binds pp70S6K to recruit it to the mTORC1 complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The absence of any alteration in pp70S6K levels following the inhibition of USP9X activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4B</xref>), suggests USP9X does not directly regulate phospho-p70S6K.</p>
<p id="Par21">Second, inducible USP9X-specific shRNA-mediated knock-down (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3C,E</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>), and transient over-expression of full length USP9X (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4A</xref>) resulted in a concomitant decrease and increase in RAPTOR protein, respectively. Use of the chemical WP1130, which rapidly inhibits USP9X’s deubiquitlyating activity but does not deplete USP9X protein levels, confirmed a clear and rapid loss of RAPTOR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4C</xref>). The near complete depletion of RAPTOR protein within 2 hours strongly suggests that USP9X regulation occurs at the post-translational level. This is supported by the observation that the loss of MCL1, a bona fide USP9X substrate, occurred only after 4 hours in the same experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4C</xref>). However, as WP1130 inhibition is not restricted to USP9X, we cannot rule out the possibility that other DUBs, in addition to USP9X, might also regulate RAPTOR stability. To address this we analysed ReNcell VM cells with inducible USP9X-specific shRNA-mediated knockdown and these produced similar results to WP1130 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4D</xref>) suggesting USP9X plays a significant, if not exclusive, role in maintaining RAPTOR levels in NPs.</p>
<p id="Par22">An obvious hypothesis is that USP9X’s deubiquitylating activity opposes RAPTOR’s degradation at the proteasome. Data presented (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4C,D</xref>) confirmed that inhibition of the proteasome increased RAPTOR protein levels in ReNcell VM cells as observed in HEK293T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and that inhibiting the proteasome, in the absence of USP9X activity partially rescued RAPTOR levels. USP9X is the first deubiquitylating enzyme shown to stabilize, components of the mTOR pathway namely, RAPTOR. Although another deubiquitylating enzyme, UCH-L1 has been shown to impact upon mTORC1 signalling it does so indirectly by affecting assembly of the mTORC1 complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Unlike USP9X, UCH-L1 has no effect on the protein levels of mTOR complex components including RAPTOR.</p>
<p id="Par23">USP9X’s regulation of mTOR signalling appears to be cell context specific. Recently it was shown in C2C12 muscle myoblasts that epitope-tagged USP9X weakly associated with mTOR and both RAPTOR and RICTOR in HEK293T cells and its depletion in C2C12 myoblasts accelerated their differentiation to myotubes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In contrast to our results in NPs, Usp9x depletion from C2C12 cells led to increased mTORC1 activity, in response to growth factor stimulation. Interestingly, while Usp9x depletion in C2C12 cells altered the downstream mTORC1 and mTORC2 effectors, pS6 and pAKT, respectively, no alteration in the levels of the upstream proteins mTOR or RAPTOR, were detected. Therefore in C2C12 myoblasts, the regulation of mTOR signalling by Usp9x may be indirect. Cell context specific roles of USP9X have also been observed in other systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Although Usp9x has been identified as a potential regulator of stem cell function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, decreasing Usp9x levels does not overtly diminish the proliferation of other progenitor/stem cells including, embryonic stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, T-cell progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> or pancreatic progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In contrast, the data presented here indicates that both cultured human NPs and, those in mouse neurospheres, are particularly sensitive to USP9X levels.</p>
<p id="Par24">mTOR signalling is a major regulator of NP function in both development and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Our data establish that USP9X facilitates mTORC1 signalling in NPs in both cultured human NPs, neurospheres and the developing mouse brain. Our data also reveals the phenotype of Usp9x null neurospheres is very similar to that reported for rapamycin treated and Raptor depleted neurospheres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and is therefore consistent with Usp9x stabilisation of mTORC1 signalling in mouse NPs as well. Loss of either Usp9x or Raptor resulted in smaller neurospheres but did not affect their capacity for serial passage indicating they affected proliferation of NPs without inhibiting the self-renewal capacity of the sphere-initiating NSC. Likewise rapamycin treatment of neurosphere cultures resulted in reduced NP proliferation (and reduced neurosphere size) without affecting the stem cell state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and rapamycin delivery to the adult sub-ventricular zone neurogenic niche specifically depleted the transiently amplifying NPs but not the stem cell population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. These data are consistent with retention of transiently amplifying NPs in the G0 stage of the cell cycle, a phenomenon reported for adult neural stem cells exposed to rapamycin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. However, we did not detect a significant decrease in Raptor protein in Usp9x-null neurospheres, nor embryonic brain as assessed by immunoblot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6C,D,F,G</xref>) like that observed in the human ReNcell VM neural progenitors. This may be due to the presence of a compensatory mechanism in the increasingly complex cellular composition of embryonic neural development over time or, the non-synchronised nature of cycling NPs or the presence of mitogens, as initial experiments on asynchronously growing ReNcell VM cells in the presence of mitogens also failed to detect significantly altered pS6 levels in, at least by immunoblot (data not shown). It is also possible that USP9X interacts with different mTORC1 components in human and mouse neural progenitors.</p>
<p id="Par25">Finally, we observed that the loss of <italic>Usp9x</italic> resulted in more neurosphere-initiating stem cells at each passage, despite fewer proliferating NPs. This suggests that mTORC1 is not the only pathway regulated by USP9X in NPs, as inhibition of RAPTOR function in neurospheres did not produce a similar increase in sphere-forming cells. In addition, in embryonic stem cell-derived NPs <italic>in–vitro</italic>, a moderate increase in Usp9x levels promotes NP self-renewal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Indeed USP9X regulates components of multiple pathways important to NP fate including the Notch, Wnt and TGF-β pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and the final outcome is very much dependent on the type of NP. Consistent with a context-specific role for USP9X in the regulation of NP self-renewal we recently reported that loss of Usp9x has a differential effect on quiescent versus proliferating NSCs in the postnatal mouse hippocampal subgranular zone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. It is possible that Usp9x promotes the proliferation of intermediate progenitor cells at the expense of NSC self-renewal in the postnatal hippocampus. The differential dependence of NPs and sphere-forming NSCs on Usp9x may reflect a similar molecular mechanism. As Usp9x regulates brain development in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and is associated with several human neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> the precise role of Usp9x in NPs and stem cells warrants further investigation.</p>

All neurosphere-based assays were conducted in at least biological triplicate, with each replicate representing a neurosphere culture derived from individual Usp9x<sup>+/Y</sup> or Usp9x<sup>−/Y</sup> embryos. Averages of the replicates results are reported. Sphere forming assays were initiated by dissociating neurospheres and isolating single cells by passing dissociated cells through a 0.75 µm cell filter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Single cells were replated at very low density (1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/mL) and cultured for 6 days. The number of spheres was calculated, and subsequently dissociated again to generate single cells for sphere forming assays. Number of cells per sphere was derived using total cell counts and total sphere number counts at each passage. At least 100 spheres were imaged per replicate and analysed using ImageJ to determine average sphere diameters. For the identification of cell types, dissociated single cells from neurospheres were plated onto poly-l-lysine (Sigma, St Louis, MO) coated coverslips (Menzel-glasser, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 1 × 10<sup>4</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> in the presence of EGF and cultured for 24 hours at which point cells were fixed for immunofluorescent staining. The number of neuronal + astrocytes + progenitor cells was counted. Oligodendrocyte differentiation was negligible (&lt;1%) and not included. At least 200 cells were counted per replicate (total n: <italic>Usp9x</italic>
<sup>+/Y</sup> = 1299; <italic>Usp9x</italic>

Following 6 days culture, whole neurospheres were plated onto poly-l-lysine coated coverslips at low density (30 spheres/35 mm well) and cultured for a further 6 days. Neurosphere outgrowths were fixed and immunofluorescently stained for the presence of terminally differentiated cells namely neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Neurosphere outgrowths were scored as Uni-, bi and tri-potent based on the presence of 1, 2 or all three cell types in the outgrowths, respectively.
