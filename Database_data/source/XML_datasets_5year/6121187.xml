<title>Abstract</title>
<p>SEC23B is a component of coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles that transport secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. Loss-of-function <italic>SEC23B</italic> mutations cause a rare form of anemia, resulting from decreased SEC23B levels. We recently identified germline heterozygous <italic>SEC23B</italic> variants as potentially cancer-predisposing. Mutant SEC23B associated with ER stress-mediated tumorigenesis, without decreased SEC23B expression. However, our understanding of the processes behind these observations remain limited. Here, we show mutant SEC23B exists within nucleoli, in addition to classical distribution at the ER/Golgi. This occurs independent of other COPII proteins and does not compromise secretory function. Mutant cells have increased ribosomal protein and translation-related gene expression, and enhanced translational capacity, in the presence of ER stress. We show that mutant SEC23B binds to UBF transcription factor, with increased UBF transcription factor binding at the ribosomal DNA promoter. Our data indicate SEC23B has potential non-canonical COPII-independent function, particularly within the ribosome biogenesis pathway, and that may contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer-predisposition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>High-throughput and agnostic gene mutation screening, such as whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing, has been predicted to accelerate the discovery of previously unidentified genotype-phenotype associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B1">1</xref>). Relatedly, hereditary cancer syndromes serve as powerful models to uncover cancer-relevant genes. We utilized a combined exome sequencing cum family studies approach and identified <italic>SEC23B</italic> (MIM 610512) as a candidate cancer predisposition gene, specifically in the context of germline heterozygous variants in Cowden syndrome-associated and apparently sporadic thyroid cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B2">2</xref>). Cowden syndrome (CS [MIM 158350]) is an underdiagnosed difficult-to-recognize autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple hamartomas and an increased lifetime risk of cancer, with epithelial thyroid carcinoma being a major clinical component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B3">3</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>SEC23B</italic> encodes Sec23 homolog B, a component of coat protein complex II (COPII). COPII vesicles function in the anterograde transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B5">5</xref>). Interestingly, germline loss-of-function homozygous or compound heterozygous <italic>SEC23B</italic> mutations cause an unrelated rare disorder, Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia Type II (CDA II [MIM 224100]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B7">7</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies show that SEC23B-deficient mice do not have CDAII but have secretory organ degeneration due to ER stress-associated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>In a cancer context, vesicular trafficking and ER stress are considered major contributors to carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B10">10</xref>). Functional characterization of the CS-related <italic>SEC23B</italic> p.Val594Gly variant in a non-malignant thyroid cell line, revealed that this mutation results in increased cell invasive potential, and ER stress-mediated cell colony formation, survival and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B2">2</xref>). We have also previously reported that germline heterozygous <italic>SEC23B</italic> variants exist in up to 4% of individuals with apparently sporadic thyroid cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B2">2</xref>). These deleterious <italic>SEC23B</italic> variants are associated with a significantly elevated age-adjusted standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of thyroid cancer compared to the US general population (SIR 242.6; 95% CI 150.4â371.8; <italic>P</italic>â=â10<sup>â11</sup>).</p>
<p>While our previous study provided genetic and functional evidence that SEC23B is associated with a cancer phenotype, the underlying process(s) remain unknown. Since the cancer-promoting heterozygous p.Val594Gly variant we studied did not affect SEC23B protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B2">2</xref>) as is observed in CDA II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B11">11</xref>), we predicted that we are dealing with âchange-of-functionâ effects. In this context, the identification of the underlying processes leading to neoplastic transformation could point towards SEC23B-associated signaling pathways that are at play in thyroid cancer, or more generically in the process of carcinogenesis. Therefore, we sought to address the hypothesis that mutant SEC23B has potential non-canonical roles that could contribute to cancer-predisposition.</p>

<title>Mutant SEC23B can exist in the nucleolus independent of COPII</title>
<p>To functionally characterize the <italic>SEC23B</italic> p.Val594Gly identified in a CS family with predominant thyroid cancer, we utilized a non-malignant thyroid cell line model. By expressing EGFP-tagged wildtype or p.Val594Gly SEC23B (Nthy-<italic>SEC23B</italic>-WT or Nthy-<italic>SEC23B</italic>-V594G, respectively) in the parental thyroid follicule epithelial cell line Nthy-ori 3â1, we recapitulated the heterozygous state observed in the germline hereditary cancer context. As a control, we also expressed EGFP alone in the same parental cell line to generate Nthy-EGFP cells. The Nthy-<italic>SEC23B</italic>-WT cells showed normal ER-Golgi speckled expression pattern, whereas the Nthy-EGFP cells showed typical diffuse and non-specific global expression of GFP. Notably, we observed that subpopulations of Nthy-<italic>SEC23B</italic>-V594G mutant cells showed aberrant aggregation of SEC23B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B2">2</xref>) and mislocalization within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F1">Fig.Â 1</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining of nucleolar markers representing the granular component (GC), dense fibrillar component (DFC) and fibrillar center (FC) confirmed localization of mutant SEC23B within all regions of cell nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F2">Fig.Â 2</xref>).

<p>SEC23B is traditionally known to be exclusively localized to the ER-Golgi as a component of the coat protein complex II (COPII)-coated vesicles for ER to Golgi protein transport. We show that mutant SEC23B nucleolar presence is independent of SEC24, the COPII inner coat binding partner of SEC23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B12">12</xref>), and SEC31, the COPII outer coat binding partner of SEC23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B13">13</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F3">Fig.Â 3A and</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</xref>). We next evaluated global secretory function in Nthy-EGFP, Nthy-<italic>SEC23B</italic>-WT and Nthy-<italic>SEC23B</italic>-V594G cells. However, we did not observe notable differences suggestive of gross secretory defects among these cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F3">Fig.Â 3B and</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</xref>). These data suggest that mutant SEC23B can exist in the nucleolus independent of COPII and without compromising global secretory function, supporting possible COPII-independent roles.

<title>Global transcriptomic analysis reveals ER stress adaptation phenotype in Nthy-<italic>SEC23B</italic>-V594G thyroid cells</title>
<p>Our data thus far revealed that mutant SEC23B can localize to the nucleolus independent of COPII. The nucleolus is considered as a cellular stress sensor and a central hub for orchestrating the stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B15">15</xref>). We have previously reported that treatment of Nthy-<italic>SEC23B</italic>-WT and Nthy-<italic>SEC23B</italic>-V594G cells with the ER stress-inducing agents Thapsigargin and Tunicamycin resulted in increased colony formation and growth of mutant cells relative to wildtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B2">2</xref>). Since ER stress and downstream unfolded protein response (UPR) activation are at the crossroad of multiple hallmarks of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B10">10</xref>), we utilized RNA sequencing as an unbiased exploratory approach to determine signaling pathways that could explain the observed cellular phenotypes.</p>
<p>Analysis was done on total RNA isolated from Nthy-<italic>SEC23B</italic>-WT and Nthy-<italic>SEC23B</italic>-V594G cells, with and without Tunicamycin, after treatment for 30 h and 7 days. These timepoints represent an early response to ER stress (<italic>t</italic>â=â30 h), and a later timepoint (<italic>t</italic>â=â7 days) when genotype-specific pro-tumorigenic phenotypes are readily evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F4">Fig.Â 4A</xref>). At both timepoints, we compared the treatment response within each genotype to identify differentially expressed genes (FDR-corrected <italic>Pâ</italic>&lt;<italic>â</italic>0.05). With Tunicamycin treatment, the phenotypic differences were reflected in the direction of expression of differentially expressed genes in a time-dependent manner. At <italic>t</italic>â=â30 h following treatment, both wildtype and mutant cells show a similar trend and number of differentially expressed genes (66 vs. 70 total, 27 vs. 25 underexpressed, respectively). At day 7, we observed an increase in the number of differentially expressed genes compared to the <italic>t</italic>â=â30 h timepoint, and an inverse treatment response (231 vs. 44 underexpressed, 15 vs. 314 overexpressed, respectively) between wildtype and mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F4">Fig.Â 4B</xref>).

<p>To determine biological pathways that could be impacted by the differentially expressed genes, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). We specifically looked for shared pathways impacted by Tunicamycin treatment across the two genotypes at each timepoint. At <italic>t</italic>â=â30 h, top pathways include upregulated unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway, as appropriate, indicating both wildtype and mutant cells are responding to the ER stress stimulus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S2</xref>). At day 7, top pathways include EIF2 signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction/oxidative phosphorylation, with completely inverse direction of response between wildtype and mutant cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Table S3</xref>). We also observed an overexpression of genes involved in the mTOR pathway, reflecting the increased growth phenotype in mutant cells. Interestingly, although not statistically significant, while wildtype cells show a persistent upregulation of the unfolded protein response, mutant cells show underexpression of genes within this pathway. Thus, our data here corroborate the ER stress adaptation phenotype in <italic>SEC23B-</italic>mutant cells.</p>

<title>Altered EIF2 signaling pathway and translational capacity in Nthy-<italic>SEC23B</italic>-V594G thyroid cells</title>
<p>Given our initial observations that SEC23B-V594G can localize to the nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F1">FigsÂ 1 and 2</xref>), we were intrigued by the observation that the top impacted pathway at day 7 is the EIF2 signaling pathway. This pathway includes a set of genes encoding ribosomal proteins and eukaryotic translation initiation and elongation factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F4">Fig.Â 4C</xref>). Indeed, the earliest hallmark of cancer cells was described as an increase in the size and number of nucleoli, the cellsâ ribosome biogenesis factories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B16">16</xref>). To functionally interrogate whether the observed gene expression changes in the EIF2 signaling pathway could be translated into observable cellular phenotypic differences, we first investigated nucleolar number and mass. We observed an increased mean number of nucleoli per cell in Nthy-<italic>SEC23B</italic>-V594G mutant cells, with a significant number of cells showing 10 or more nucleoli relative to Nthy-<italic>SEC23B</italic>-WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F4">Fig.Â 4D</xref>). We also confirmed an overall increase in nucleolar mass in mutant relative to wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F4">Fig.Â 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>To ultimately determine whether such changes in nucleoli and the EIF2 signaling pathway are contributing to differences in ribosome number and/or translation status, we performed ribosome profiling. This method provides a snapshot of ribosome subunit distribution (40S, 60S and 80S monosomes, and polysome-bound 80S), with a decreased polysome/80S ratio indicating impaired translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B17">17</xref>). In the absence of ER stress, we note a baseline increase in the polysome/80S ratio in mutant cells. In the presence of ER stress and activation of the UPR, global protein synthesis is typically attenuated to alleviate the ER load, in addition to other pro-survival mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B18">18</xref>). Expectedly, both wildtype and mutant cells show suppression of the polysome/80S ratio after 30 h of Tunicamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F4">Fig.Â 4F and</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</xref>). Interestingly, the mutant cells show a more severe suppression at this timepoint, noted by an increased free 80S fraction and decreased polysome fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</xref>). At day 7 post Tunicamycin treatment, mutant cells show a higher polysome/80S ratio (at least equivalent to baseline levels) relative to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F4">Fig.Â 4F</xref>), further mirroring the observed gene expression and cellular phenotypic differences at this timepoint.</p>

<title>Mutant SEC23B impacts ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription</title>
<p>Given our functional data suggesting a role of SEC23B in protein translation and the ribosome biogenesis pathway, we next sought to determine whether mutant SEC23B preferentially localized to specific nucleolar subcompartments with ER stress, thus homing in on more specific functions. Cell nucleoli morphologically consist of three distinguishable regions: the granular component (GC), dense fibrillar component (DFC) and fibrillar center (FC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B19">19</xref>). These nucleolar subcompartments represent the sites of progressive stages of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription from ribosomal DNA (rDNA), rRNA transcript processing and ribosome assembly prior to export to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B20">20</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining revealed non-preferential co-localization of mutant SEC23B with all three nucleolar subcompartments in the presence of ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F5">Fig.Â 5</xref>), suggesting a potential multi-faceted role in the ribosome biogenesis pathway. We then show through immunoprecipitation that mutant SEC23B binds to Upstream Binding Transcription Factor (UBF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F6">Fig.Â 6A</xref>), a key protein of the transcription pre-initiation complex, mediating RNA polymerase I (Pol I) recruitment to rDNA promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B21">21</xref>). Importantly, we show through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis enhanced UBF binding to rDNA loci in mutant cells, with significant differential UBF binding between wildtype and mutant cells at the region upstream of the promoter (H42) and promoter (H42.9) region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F6">Fig.Â 6B and</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S3</xref>). These data provide one potential mechanism of how mutant SEC23B could be impacting the ribosome biogenesis and downstream signaling pathways.

<title>SEC23B-ER stress-ribosome biogenesis axis is pertinent in Cowden syndrome patients</title>
<p>To determine whether our observations are pertinent in Cowden syndrome patients, we generated pools of control or patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines (LBLs, see Materials and Methods) that are wildtype for <italic>SEC23B</italic> (LBL-<italic>SEC23B</italic>-WT) or harboring <italic>SEC23B</italic> p.V594G heterozygous (LBL-<italic>SEC23B</italic>-V594G) mutation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F6">Fig.Â 6C</xref>). We then utilized 45S pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) transcript levels as a read-out for rDNA transcription. As expected, downstream 45S pre-rRNA transcript expression was increased in mutant LBL-<italic>SEC23B</italic>-V594G cells relative to wildtype in the presence of different doses of ER stress drugs Thapsigargin and Tunicamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F6">Fig.Â 6D</xref>). These results validate our <italic>in vitro</italic> cell line observations that in the presence of ER stress, mutant SEC23B p.V594G is associated with enhanced ribosome biogenesis, which may be mediated at least in part through enhanced rDNA transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F6">Fig.Â 6E</xref>).</p>
</sec>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our observations reveal mutant SEC23B p.V594G could localize to nucleoli, with multiple lines of evidence suggesting the observed ER stress-mediated tumorigenic cellular phenotypes are COPII-independent and downstream of the ribosome biogenesis pathway. Compared to wildtype SEC23B, mutant SEC23B cells showed increased expression of ribosomal protein genes and translation-related factors, and enhanced translational capacity in the presence of ER stress. To home in on the underlying mechanism, we sought to determine whether SEC23B localizes to particular nucleolar subcompartments. However, we found that SEC23B exists in all three nucleolar subcompartments, hinting at more generalized roles in the ribosome biogenesis pathway. We show one possible example by which mutant SEC23B binds to UBF to enhance downstream rDNA transcription.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the ribosome biogenesis pathway is known to be orchestrated at different stages by multiple tumor suppressor and oncogenic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B22">22</xref>). Relevant to Cowden syndrome (CS), the tumor suppressor <italic>PTEN</italic>, known to be mutated in the germline of â¼25% of CS/CS-like individuals, has been shown to be a master regulator of the ribosome biogenesis pathway, among many signaling pathways. Indeed, we and others have primarily shown that PTEN, classically believed to be an exclusively cytoplasmic protein, also exists and functions within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B23">23â27</xref>). PTEN has also been shown to exist in the nucleolus, impacting nucleolar morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B28">28</xref>) and repressing Pol I-mediated transcription of rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B29">29</xref>). More recently, Liang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B30">30</xref>) showed that a specific PTEN isoform, dubbed PTENÎ², localizes predominantly to the nucleolus, dephosphorylates nucleolin and negatively regulates rDNA transcription and cellular proliferation. The involvement of both PTEN and SEC23B in the ribosome biogenesis pathway could create functional crosstalk between both proteins. Indeed, since both <italic>PTEN</italic> and <italic>SEC23B</italic> are Cowden syndrome susceptibility genes, it is intriguing to find that these two apparently and functionally disparate genes, encode proteins with converging and similar downstream effects within the ribosome biogenesis pathway. The functional interplay between PTEN and SEC23B warrants further investigation, with broader implications on cancer risk in CS patients.</p>
<p>Our observations also offer an important glimpse into heritable gene mutations interacting with the environment (e.g. exposure to ER stress) to result in a particular disease phenotype (here, cancer)âand hence, genetic predisposition to cancer. While <italic>SEC23B</italic> wildtype and mutant cells show some baseline differences such as SEC23B localization, nucleolar number/mass and translational capacity, the introduction of the stress stimuli result in more prominent phenotypic differences. While <italic>SEC23B</italic> wildtype cells activate expected pro-apoptotic signaling pathways, <italic>SEC23B</italic> p.V594G mutant cells adapt to the chronic stress and reflect multiple tumorigenic phenotypes. Ultimately, it may be informative to investigate the tumorigenic effects of SEC23B in the context of other germline heterozygous variants we previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B2">2</xref>) and in other cancer types relevant to Cowden syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B3">3</xref>). This is particularly intriguing since even in the somatic cancer context, copy number amplifications in <italic>SEC23B</italic> are observed in Cowden syndrome component cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B3">3</xref>), such as breast, endometrial and colorectal cancers and melanoma. Interestingly, this preliminary data also reveal a significant tendency towards co-occurrence of somatic <italic>PTEN</italic> and <italic>SEC23B</italic> alterations in the CS-related apparently sporadic cancers derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4</xref>). The latter data further support potential PTEN-SEC23B crosstalk in cancer. Relatedly, whether increased copy number results in increased expression or tilting COPII complex-related SEC23B stoichiometry towards non-canonical function is one possible hypothesis worth testing in the future.</p>
<p>SEC23B has not been previously reported to exist or function outside of its role in COPII-mediated anterograde protein transport at the ER-Golgi interface. Interestingly, one study has shown that Sec13, a component of the outer COPII coat, can also shuttle to the nucleus, with a subpopulation stably interacting with the nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein Nup96 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B31">31</xref>). A genetic <italic>in vivo</italic> model developed years later demonstrated the distinct roles of Sec13 at both compartments, COPII and the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B32">32</xref>). Loss of COPII function results in digestive organ defects, whereas loss of NPC function resulted in retinal lamination defects. These data provide evidence for existing dual and tissue/context-specific roles of COPII proteins. Whether mutant SEC23B functions as a stress sensor or effector warrants further experimentation. Importantly, it will also be crucial to determine whether wildtype SEC23B plays a baseline role in the ribosome biogenesis pathway, with the mutant p.Val594G cells reflecting exaggerated effects within this pathway. This hypothesis is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>SEC23B has been classically and extensively studied in the context of CDA II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B6">6â8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B33">33</xref>). But even in the anemia field, despite extensive efforts, it remains unknown what the cargo(es) responsible for CDA II is(are), nor the precise mechanism. Indeed, it is thought that the cell cycle and cytokinesis of erythroid cells are dependent on sufficient SEC23B protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B6">6</xref>). We speculate that the loss of non-canonical SEC23B function could also be, at least in part, contributing to the pathobiology of this disease. In parallel, ribosomopathies characterized by ribosomal haploinsufficiency have been implicated in multiple congenital disorders with component anemias (e.g. Diamond-Blackfan anemia, DBA). Intriguingly, patients with ribosomal dysfunction have also been reported to have significantly increased lifetime risks of certain cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B35">35</xref>). Such a paradoxical transition from a hypoproliferative phenotype (anemia, cytopenia) to a hyperproliferative state (cancer) is known in the hematology world as âDameshekâs riddle,â which speculates that the initial insult resulting in ribosomal haploinsufficiency could select for cells that acquire compensatory mutations to resist and bypass impaired proliferation (survival of the fittest) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B36">36</xref>). Therefore, relevant to SEC23B-related CDA II and CS-related cancers, we question whether such downstream ribosome biogenesis regulation is at the heart of such disparate phenotypes. Overall, we report that SEC23B has largely unexplored non-canonical function, particularly within the ribosome biogenesis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddy226-F7">Fig.Â 7</xref>). This has far-reaching implications relevant to cancer and beyond that, CDAII and normal cell biology.

<p>The Nthy-ori 3-1 human thyroid follicular epithelium cell line (catalog number EC90011609, lot number 09C008, passage number 16, purchased in 2014 from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LBLs) derived from patients or controls were generated by the Genomic Medicine Biorepository of the Genomic Medicine Institute of the Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, OH) according to standard procedures and subsequently maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. LBL pools were generated by co-culturing an equal number of cells from each patient or control. All cell lines were maintained at 37Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> culture conditions and tested negative upon routine mycoplasma testing at the Eng lab (luminescence ratiosâ&lt;â0.9) using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Allendale, NJ). Cell lines used have not been listed as cells known to be misidentified according to the International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddy226-B37">37</xref>). The Nthy-ori 3-1 cell line was authenticated through STR PCR (AmpFLSTR SGM Plus PCR Amplification Kit, Life Technologies) by the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC, original source of the cell line, test date 14/04/2009). To generate stable cell lines, retrovirally transduced Nthy-ori 3-1 cells (pool as no individual clones were isolated) were kept under 1 Âµg/ml Puromycin selection forâ&gt;30 days prior to downstream interrogation. We used four different pools of cells at passage number 28 after selection.
