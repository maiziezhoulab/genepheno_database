<abstract>
<p>In this article, we examine professional discourse around the development of
polygenic risk-stratified screening (PRSS) for cancer. Analyzing a range of
contemporary professional literatures from Europe, North America and Australia,
we explore how the drive to screen for molecular markers of cancer risk makes
professionals, screening recipients and publics responsible, in different ways,
for acquiring, curating and analyzing molecular data. Investigating how these
responsibilities are invoked in discussions of new data practices, technologies,
organizational arrangements, engagement, education and protocols for
participation, we argue that agendas for PRSS for cancer are both expanding and
stratifying responsibilities. Data collection is to be achieved by intensified
responsibilities for including, reassuring and recruiting populations, as well
as by opening and enriching the datasets on which models and preventative
screening arrangements are based. Enhanced responsibilities for screening
recipients and publics are also invoked, not just in relation to personal health
but for population health more generally, via research participation and
consenting to data re-use in the public interest. Professionals, screening
recipients and publics are also to become responsible for moderating
expectations of screening according to genomic designations. Together these
discourses go beyond individual risk management to extend and diversify the
responsibilities of practitioners, screening recipients and publics as public
health genomics develops.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genomic research and techniques are key to personalized or precision medicine for a
growing range of conditions, notably cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306312719858404">Green and Guyer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306312719858404">Guttmacher and Collins,
2002</xref>). In this paper we explore how professional, screening recipient and
public responsibilities are being reconfigured as public health genomics
evolves.</p>
<p>As England’s Chief Medical Officer’s latest Annual Report, Generation Genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306312719858404">Davies, 2017</xref>: 1) notes,
delivering ‘the genomic dream’ in the National Health Service (NHS) requires
extensive public engagement and a ‘new social contract between patients and the
NHS’. Key here is the move away from what one of the report’s authors frames as
‘paternalistic’ state-based interventions at a population level, to individual
responsibility for prevention based on personalized genomic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0306312719858404">Zimmern, 2017</xref>). This move
would redistribute responsibilities amongst users of population-level services
according to their polygenic risk, in order to deliver efficiencies and overcome
problems of overdiagnosis in state-based screening programmes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0306312719858404">1</xref></sup> To achieve this, proponents of public health genomics point to a range of
organizational, social and ethical challenges that must be overcome, including
public and professional wariness of polygenic risk-stratified screening (PRSS) and
associated interventions in health and lifestyle. This invokes a new kind of genomic
citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306312719858404">Rose, 2009</xref>)
with respect to sharing, knowing and tending to genomic risks. Professionals,
screening recipients and publics also gain responsibilities for enabling and
supporting PRSS, beyond individuals’ responsibility for self-management of polygenic
risk. These processes of responsibilization reconfigure the roles and identities of
all of these actors as they assume, or are expected to assume, responsibilities for
delivering and accommodating new screening arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306312719858404">Boltanski and Chiapello, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0306312719858404">Shamir, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To understand how these processes of responsibilization operate, we conducted a case
study of a recent set of professional accounts of research, plans and proposals for
PRSS for cancer. Drawing on STS and related social scientific literatures, we widen
our analysis from the heightening of individual responsibilities for polygenic risk
management to explore the reconfiguration of professional and public
responsibilities that sit alongside these processes. We explore the kinds of
responsibilities invoked for PRSS research infrastructures, data governance,
education and participation, and examine how these are stratified between and
amongst professionals, screening recipients and publics. We argue that this
diversification and extension of the responsibilities of professionals, screening
recipients and publics are important aspects of developing markets in public health
genomics.</p>

<sec id="section2-0306312719858404">
<title>Background</title>
<p>STS and other scholars have long been concerned with the implications of genetics
and, more recently, genomic medicine for citizenship, particularly the extent to
which molecular information might be a resource for determinism and discrimination
against particular groups as responsible for their ‘faulty genes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306312719858404">Duster, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306312719858404">Lippman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0306312719858404">Shostak and Moinester,
2015</xref>). However, there has been little evidence of large-scale discrimination
against a genetic underclass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0306312719858404">Weiner et al., 2017</xref>). But STS scholars have traced the molecular turn in
biomedicine, or ‘the social processes and transformations through which phenomena
(diseases, identities, pollution, food, racial/ethnic classifications) are
re-defined in terms of their molecular components and described in the language of
molecular biology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306312719858404">Darling et
al., 2016</xref>: 51). The environment is decentralized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0306312719858404">Navon, 2011</xref>) and de-emphasized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0306312719858404">Timmermans and Shostak,
2016</xref>) in genomic research and related health interventions; the influence
of social and environmental factors is often measured via their molecular signatures
within the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306312719858404">Darling et al.,
2016</xref>). Genomics has developed from the One Gene One Disease (OGOD)
paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306312719858404">Conrad, 1999</xref>)
to encompass an appreciation of multiple variants and uncertainties within a
paradigm of malleability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306312719858404">Lappé
and Landecker, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the paradigm of malleability can still employ old demographic and
epidemiological categories that ‘naturalize difference’ and turn attention away from
the social processes through which categories are formed and inequalities
perpetuated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0306312719858404">Prainsack,
2015</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306312719858404">Duster, 2015</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306312719858404">Ackerman et al. (2016)</xref> stress, quantification is part of an unfolding
moral economy where behavioral and social risks are located in the body and
responsibilities for their prevention rest with the individual. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0306312719858404">Shostak and Moinester
(2015)</xref> show how these responsibilities emerge from a range of new genomic
fields, such as nutritional epigenetics, where the environment is being rendered
internal to the body and molecular mechanisms become a dominant focus of concern and
intervention. Meanwhile the broader social-material environment forms a kind of
‘fuzzy background’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0306312719858404">Shostak and
Moinester, 2015</xref>: 223; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306312719858404">Landecker, 2011</xref>) and the social
institutions that negatively affect people’s health and wellbeing ‘fade from view’
(p. 225). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306312719858404">Lappé’s (2016)</xref>
research on how the maternal body is constituted as an environment in autism
research makes a similar point, exploring how, as this environment is molecularized,
risk is individualized and maternal responsibilities for preventing autism are
intensified (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306312719858404">Ackerman et
al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306312719858404">Arribas-Ayllon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306312719858404">Darling et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>A focus on the molecular reconfigures professional practice across bioscience and
biomedicine, particularly in relation to data sharing and collaboration. This brings
new responsibilities for interdisciplinarity and translational agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306312719858404">Cambrosio et al., 2006</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0306312719858404">Shostak, 2007</xref>) as
well as engagement with ethical and political questions about who should take
responsibility for the health risks that these new paradigms identify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306312719858404">Darling et al., 2016</xref>: 58).
Professionals develop a range of technical, institutional and engagement strategies
as part of the process of molecularizing fields and disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306312719858404">Shostak, 2005</xref>). As with
other innovative health technologies, genomics also involves a diversity of social
responsibilities for professionals in relation to public engagement and responsible
innovation, including the need to work with, educate and enable societal actors to
develop new technologies and use services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306312719858404">Davies et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306312719858404">Glerup and Horst, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Building on these insights, in this article we explore how the emergent field of
public health genomics is configuring the responsibilities of professionals,
screening recipients and publics. In the next section, we explain our approach to
generating a corpus of literature and the case study of PRSS for cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0306312719858404">
<title>The case study</title>
<p>Public health genomics, sometimes called public health genetics, developed in the
early 2000’s in North America and Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306312719858404">Shostak, 2003</xref>). It was defined by the
founding director of the US Centre for Disease Control’s Office of Public Health
Genomics, as ‘the application of advances in genetics and molecular biotechnology to
improve public health and prevent disease’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306312719858404">Khoury et al., 2000</xref>: 5). This field seeks
to integrate new molecular knowledge into many of the activities of public health –
from screening or surveillance, through the evaluation and implementation of
population interventions to the wider practices of health education/promotion. This
involves professionals from a range of applied health fields, notably public health,
epidemiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306312719858404">Bauer, 2013</xref>)
and bioinformatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306312719858404">Lewis and
Bartlett, 2013</xref>). A range of professional bodies have been formed (such as
The Public Health Genomics Foundation in the UK and the Centre for Disease Control’s
Office of Public Health Genomics in the US) and new journals have come on the scene
(such as <italic>Public Health Genomics</italic>, established in 2015). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306312719858404">Bauer (2013)</xref> notes, the
methodologies of fields such as epidemiology are extending to incorporate concerns
such as genomic literacy, which she takes as an indicator of change.</p>
<p>The application of genomic knowledge to cancer screening has been one of the main
planks of these developments, applying rapidly developing molecular understanding of
cancer etiology to the well-developed infrastructures of cancer screening. Funding
agencies such as the European Commission and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention have made significant investment in a range of large-scale
interdisciplinary and international collaborative programs (e.g., the Collaborative
Oncological Gene-environment Study in Europe). Researchers have advocated a
‘polygenic approach to disease prevention’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0306312719858404">Pharoah, 2003</xref>), studying the continuous
distribution of risk in cancer populations and identifying higher- and lower-risk
groups.</p>
<p>To explore how responsibilities are being articulated in this subfield of public
health genomics, we conducted a case study of professional discourse on PRSS for
cancer. We explore discussions about cancer in general and about particular cancers,
notably breast and prostate cancer, as represented in the professional literatures
and online commentaries we reviewed. The analysis is also informed by an ongoing
multi-sited ethnography of contemporary professional, patient and public experiences
and approaches to cancer genomic diagnostics, treatment and screening. Whilst not
all of the multiple actors and accounts constitutive of this sub-field are available
to our analysis, our dataset nevertheless forms an important element of how
professionals circulate knowledge and construct meaning therein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306312719858404">Arribas-Ayllon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306312719858404">Myers, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>We searched the Medline database for English-language articles published between 2012
and 2016, in order to identify articles on PRSS for cancer. This produced 31
articles (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0306312719858404">Supplemental Appendix</ext-link>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0306312719858404">2</xref></sup> We also searched websites and public-facing reports available via internet
searches, to capture the wider discursive processes that make up the subfield. This
generated a ‘grey’ literature of an additional ten items, including commentary
pieces, professional blogs, research reports and magazine articles (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0306312719858404">Supplemental Appendix</ext-link>). Applying situational analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306312719858404">Clarke, 2005</xref>), we performed
a thematic analysis of these texts, which we coded using NVivo, undertaking repeated
iterative readings of the texts informed by key themes emerging from relevant STS
literatures and our wider data collection (interviews and observations). We focus on
how authors frame the possibilities, opportunities and challenges of this emergent
field, in relation to understanding genetic, genomic and environmental aspects of
disease, risk and its management, how existing and prospective forms of population
screening are presented, and the kinds of actors and responsibilities this
involves.</p>
<p>The articles, blogs and reports we reviewed are authored by professionals from a wide
range of applied disciplines and fields, including bioinformatics, oncology,
epidemiology, molecular pathology, genetics, genomic medicine, public health and
applied health research. Our sample encompasses a range of studies and reviews:
Fourteen articles are quantitative or modelling studies, two are systematic reviews,
seven are more general review articles (three of which focus on the ethical, legal
and social issues of risk-stratified screening), six involve social research (both
quantitative and qualitative), and two are personal view articles (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0306312719858404">Supplemental Appendix</ext-link> for an overview of all articles per category).
Some articles are published in specialist disease-specific or organ-specific
journals and are relatively focused, for instance reporting on specific mutations in
a certain form of cancer and reflecting on their implications for screening (nine in
total). In addition, two articles were published in internal medicine journals, six
in general cancer journals such as <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic>, five in
genetics journals, two in cancer/epidemiology journals, one in <italic>Mutation
Research</italic>, one in <italic>Cancer Prevention</italic>, one in a public
health journal, two in <italic>Public Health Genomics</italic>, and two in medical
ethics/internet studies journals. The personal view articles are generally
associated with one or more of the blogs/reports we included in the sample. Two of
the ten blogs identified were hosted by US agencies: the National Cancer Institute,
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (both Government funded). One
featured on the UK Public Health Genomics Foundation website (PHG Foundation – an
independent UK health policy thinktank) as a supplement to their report on
Stratified Screening for Cancer (also discussed in this article).</p>
<p>Several authors from the field of public health genomics are prominent in these
discussions. Khoury, the founding director of the US Centre for Disease Control’s
Office of Public Health Genomics, is the first author on one of the academic
articles and an author on three of the blog reports analysed. Members of a group
working with or for the UK Public Health Genomics Foundation (Hall, Chowdhury, Dent)
contribute to five of the articles as well as two of the blogs/reports included in
our analyses. Pashayan, who used to work for the PHG Foundation, also contributes to
eight of the articles and two of the blogs.</p>

<title>Transformative technoscience</title>
<p>In the articles we reviewed, PRSS for cancer commands great promise. Authors
frequently emphasize the benefits of rapid development of more precise genomic
information and its potential for improving health through new approaches to
screening. In typically ebullient language, in a blog post for the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306312719858404">Khoury and Richardson (2015)</xref> describe
it as ‘usher[ing] in a new era of precision prevention for many diseases in the
years to come’. Cancer screening features as a key exemplar of how the emergent
multidisciplinary agenda for public health genomics could be translated into
practice (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306312719858404">Pashayan et
al., 2013</xref>). The rapid growth of molecular epidemiology of cancer is
presented as a key driver of change in this field. For example, in an article
about ‘omics’ and personalizing risk measurements in the online magazine
<italic>Cancerworld</italic> (published six times a year by the European
School of Oncology), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306312719858404">Beishon
(2017b)</xref> notes that in 2007 ‘only a handful of genes’ for breast
cancer had been identified from Genome Wide Association Studies, but by 2017
more than 150 variants were identified for breast cancer and prostate cancer.
This presents a narrative of ever more detailed and comprehensive sequencing and
subsequent actionability. He quotes Pharoah, a professor of clinical
epidemiology at Cambridge and a leading figure in the field, who states that EU
funding has supported ‘larger and larger studies needed to find things with
smaller and smaller effects’. In a ‘personal view’ in the <italic>Lancet
Oncology</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0306312719858404">Thomas et al. (2015</xref>: e303) describe comprehensive models of
polygenic risk estimation as ‘fundamental to the transformative power of genomic
technologies in cancer genetics’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0306312719858404">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The novelty and power of these new approaches is emphasized further through a
form of ‘retrospective accounting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306312719858404">Arribas-Ayllon, 2016</xref>). Attention is
drawn to the limits of prior approaches, including the restrictive focus of
single gene studies, the emphasis on families affected by ‘organ-specific,
single-gene breast and bowel cancer syndromes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0306312719858404">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>: e303), as well as
the dubious clinical validity of some single-high-risk-gene tests developed in
commercial environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312719858404">Dent et al., 2014</xref>). Researchers also point to the continuing problem
of ‘missing heritability’ in current approaches, i.e., unidentified rare
variants with high or medium penetrance and common variants with low penetrance
and additive effects. The classification of cancer risk based on these
categories, particularly the ‘binary’ between genes with pathogenic effects and
those without, is also queried on the basis that there needs to be a greater
recognition of the ‘continuous range of biological variation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0306312719858404">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>:
e304). Here the restricted focus of clinical cancer genetics measurements is
problematized, particularly the focus on rare mutations and only a few cancers
(namely breast, ovarian and prostate). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0306312719858404">Thomas et al. (2015)</xref> put it, the
established methodologies and classificatory systems of clinical cancer genetics
are under ‘stress’ (p. e305).</p>
<p>Limitations to established methodologies are also highlighted in articles that
explore risk stratification for cancer more generally (where polygenic risk is
one of a number of components being considered), particularly in relation to the
problems of relying on family history. For example, in a systematic review
article on colorectal cancer in <italic>Genetics and Medicine</italic>, an
international group of scientists and doctors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306312719858404">Henrikson et al., 2015</xref>: 711) conclude
that, although family history remains a ‘clinically meaningful’ way to identify
those at higher risk and has yet to be superseded by polygenic risk assessment,
it is nevertheless ‘an imperfect and dynamic measure’, given that comprehensive
family history is not always available and sometimes ‘hidden’ in families. They
also caution that ‘family history may be under-reported, less well known, or not
a primary influence on the excess colorectal cancer burden in African Americans’
(p. 708). Environmental measures of risk are also presented as inadequate or
unrefined in other articles, for example, in those considering how to refine
risk measurements based on epigenetic information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0306312719858404">Pashayan et al. (2016)</xref> note:<disp-quote><p>‘Information collected on environmental exposures via questionnaire or
direct measurement is susceptible to recall bias and to inadequate
capturing of exposures with short half-lives and of low biological dose.
Epigenetic markers when used in lieu could overcome some of these
limitations’ (p. 94).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Together, these repertoires position polygenic risk measurement as more
comprehensive and better equipped to capture the complexities of family and
environmental exposures and to transform the field of public health more
generally. Rapid developments of technological capacity to capture and analyse
more data with more complex methods and models in order to produce more accurate
estimations of risk are part of a narrative of the transformative power of
technoscience in general and genomics in particular. This positions contemporary
and historic screening practices as problematic and invokes professional
responsibilities for their transformation via more comprehensive, subtle and
sophisticated polygenic evidence and models. Researchers from a range of
scientific and medical backgrounds are being enrolled in the pursuit of a more
refined molecular regime of cancer risk calculation that would better capture
and predict the risks of a wider range of cancers, individuals and
populations.</p>

<title>Prospective benefits</title>
<p>This vision of transformation also relies on a form of ‘prospective accounting’
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306312719858404">Arribas-Ayllon,
2016</xref>) that emphasizes extending ‘the benefits of personalised risk
management developed in the single-gene era to the general population’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0306312719858404">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>:
e306) to supersede ‘one-size-fits all approaches’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306312719858404">Pashayan et al., 2013</xref>). For example, in
another CDC blog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312719858404">Khoury
(2013)</xref> notes the benefits of moving away from screening applied to
the ‘average’ person to a program based on subgroups with different levels of
risk. In a report on their European Commission-funded study of prevention and
screening for breast, ovary and prostate cancer, the PHG Foundation’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312719858404">Dent et al. (2014)</xref>
advocate stratification, because this will provide more effective early
treatment for those diagnosed, reduce unnecessary surveillance for lower-risk
groups and cut healthcare system costs.</p>
<p>Researchers are nevertheless circumspect about the benefits of polygenic risk
stratification in existing programmes, anticipating only modest improvements in
the accuracy of current age-stratified and family-history-stratified screening
e.g. for breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312719858404">Dent
et al., 2014</xref>). Instead, attention is directed towards the benefits of
future stratification. For example, in a discussion of the Gail Model (a risk
assessment tool combining a range of factors to estimate the likelihood of a
woman developing invasive breast cancer), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306312719858404">Beishon (2017b)</xref> asserts that adding
information on polygenic risk and breast density only modestly increases
discriminatory power and instead suggests that ‘the impact could be more
substantial in stratifying the population into different risk groups’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306312719858404">Beishon, 2017</xref>; see also
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0306312719858404">Pashayan et al.,
2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Authors also suggest a range of obstacles that will have to be overcome. These
principally relate to the need for an evidence base that draws from genetic and
other risk information, supported by public acceptability and health system
readiness (e.g. the ‘special article’ in <italic>Genetics and Medicine</italic>,
by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306312719858404">Khoury et al.,
2013</xref>). Here the responsibilities of professionals extend to encompass
education, evaluation and public relations, building on their core
responsibility for data collection. The gathering of an array of further
supporting evidence and data is framed as fundamental to the prospects for this
kind of screening. Researchers in polygenic risk are encouraged to ‘discover’
the significant number of additional genetic and genomic factors that remain to
be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306312719858404">Litchfield et
al., 2015</xref>). Here the population is framed as a resource for further
genomic data-collection via existing screening programs. The measurability of
genomic data is one of its key advantages, according to these advocates. As
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306312719858404">Beishon (2017b)</xref>
notes, it is not that these data are, sui generis, ‘superior’, but that they can
be measured ‘incredibly accurately’. In their <italic>Genetics in
Medicine</italic> article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306312719858404">Khoury et al. (2013)</xref> also prioritize
the need for empirical data, arguing that this is paramount to the success of
PRSS for common diseases and making the point that although it has yet to be
established that PRSS is better than the current model, polygenic data are easy
to measure at any point in the lifecourse, as it precedes the development of
disease.</p>
<p>In these accounts, benefits are largely prospective and depend on professionals
delivering more comprehensive and extensive genomic data and analysis. As
epidemiologists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306312719858404">Fachal and
Dunning (2015)</xref> explain in their article on Genome Wide Association
Studies to support PRSS for breast cancer, this in turn requires ‘even larger
cohorts of breast cancer patients, as well as the development of new statistical
methods to comprehensively evaluate combinations of variants conferring low to
moderate increases in risk of an already complex disease’ (pp. 38–39).
Developments therefore hinge on increased participation in research by screening
recipients, patients and wider populations. A particular issue arises with
respect to ethnicity, as there is a predominance of participants with European
ancestry in these studies. Limited (sub)populations create problems for
stratifying individuals. Researchers note that these problems arise because
researchers sometimes exclude other ethnicities due to ‘limited sample size’
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306312719858404">Joshi et al.,
2014</xref>: 1025) or restrict their systematic reviews to studies from
Europe, North America and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306312719858404">Mavaddat et al., 2015</xref>). Because of such
limiations, we see calls for more data to be collected; for example, ‘additional
studies will be required to develop and validate genetic profiles for other
populations, in particular Asian and African populations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306312719858404">Mavaddat et al., 2015</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>In these various accounts of the transformative potential of PRSS and its
prospective benefits, then, researchers from across the fields of epidemiology,
molecular pathology, oncology and public health are responsible for collecting
and modelling more data, with more biological features from more individuals and
(sub)populations, about more cancers. The generation and measurement of data are
key to the ambition of research projects and international collaborations but
also the overall vision for PRSS. Crucially, molecular data are particularly
valued, because of their amenability to measurement, including as proxies for
environmental risks. This approach to data is also presented as qualitatively
different from previous methods rooted in the more traditional focus on
populations of European descent, family history, close genotype-phenotype
associations and rare high penetrance genes in clinical genetics: ‘The genetics
of cancer risk will shift from a qualitative basis rooted in a binary
classification of variation into a more nuanced and quantitative form’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0306312719858404">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>:
e307).</p>
<p>Alongside optimistic discourses of transformation and prospective benefits, we
also find narratives of incrementalism, with new quantitative analyses and tools
of prediction added into existing risk measures and screening programmes.
Attention is focused on the molecular level and on particular diseases where
screening might be most plausible (i.e., breast cancer and other women’s
cancers, colorectal and prostate cancer). Researchers also build upon current
genetic and age-stratified screening approaches to develop strategies for common
diseases more generally. The uncertainties and limitations of current or
previous approaches are to be solved by the collection of yet more data,
including about populations with non-European ancestry, to develop more refined
models. Here we find echoes of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0306312719858404">Timmermans et al.’s (2017)</xref> analysis,
whereby uncertainties are positioned as productive of future improvements in
understandings of genetic causality. We also see elements of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0306312719858404">Reardon (2013)</xref>
describes with respect to commercial initiatives such as 23andme, where
inclusion in the dataset is presented as a route to improved health and
attention is drawn away from the social and environmental risks of disease. In
these accounts, problematic inaccuracies in environmental and family history
information will be overcome with more measurable, molecular information
gathering and more analysis. The acknowledged limitations of these new polygenic
approaches in terms of their absolute improvement in risk estimations or their
ability to resolve problems of overdiagnosis are also rendered less significant
via appeals to the wider transformational potential of stratified screening –
ever increasing molecular data collection is both the driver for and the product
of these initiatives.</p>

<title>Extending responsibilities for PRSS</title>
<p>Developing PRSS extends researchers’ responsibilities for the richness and openness

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306312719858404">Dent et al. (2013)</xref>
note this demands ‘substantial organisational effort’ (p. 98), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306312719858404">Beishon (2017a)</xref> stresses how
difficult it will be to ‘turn around major public health programs that have
considerable bureaucracy and investment in certain IT systems and core beliefs’.
Authors claim that transforming organizational infrastructures and cultures is key
to the delivery of PRSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306312719858404">Pashayan et al., 2013</xref>) and that radical integrations of discovery and
intervention are required to make this work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0306312719858404">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>). They invoke
partnership and organizational entrepreneurship to overcome the bureaucracy,
boundaries and core beliefs of current state-based programs that limit the
acquisition and analysis of data.</p>
<sec id="section8-0306312719858404">
<title>Data infrastructures</title>
<p>A range of new data protocols for enacting these responsibilities, particularly
with respect to data sharing and re-use, are envisaged in the articles we
reviewed. Authors set out the case for recruiting screening recipients into
ongoing research studies, where their data may be used for purposes beyond the
provision of a screening result. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306312719858404">Chowdhury et al. (2013)</xref>, write:<disp-quote><p>Any proposed stratified screening program must consider in detail the
relevance of the many concerns about genetic information, taking into
account the technologies that will be used, the implications of the data
generated, and its subsequent handling. Important issues will include
the need for explicit consent for undertaking analysis of DNA; whether
the data generated can, or should, be used for other purposes; the
possibility of generating incidental findings and how these should be
dealt with; whether the information is relevant for family members and,
if so, whether and how it would be shared; whether the data would be
stored and, if so, with what safeguards; and who might have access,
including the individual, their family members, employers, insurance
companies, criminal justice agencies, and researchers. All of these
issues must be resolved in the program’s design and implementation to
the satisfaction of the public, professionals, and policy makers. (p.
427)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This anticipates an array of responsibilities for ‘health professionals and
stakeholders’ (p. 430) to develop appropriate protocols for data handling,
communication and safeguarding, including in relation to access arrangements
with market-based actors such as insurance companies. Here professionals and
interested publics are being enrolled in processes of decision-making about
appropriate policies: they are asked to take a view on and influence governance
mechanisms. Professionals and lay representatives are also asked to adopt and
deliver new kinds of ethical data infrastructures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312719858404">Dent et al. (2014)</xref> also suggest that
policy makers need to develop detailed plans that attend to the collection,
retention and storage of data:<disp-quote><p>Since genotypic and phenotypic data are retained for several purposes,
more robust and comprehensive systems need to be adopted to safeguard
data security, and also to provide an infrastructure for dealing with
issues such as the need for re-contact, incidental or unsolicited
findings or changes in capacity to consent. (p. 26)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Generating and sustaining these data governance and management infrastructures
become a part of professionals’ remit and responsibility to ensure the
development of PRSS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0306312719858404">
<title>Extending consent</title>
<p>PRSS agendas also reconfigure the role of screening recipients. Authors (e.g.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306312719858404">Chowdhury et al.,
2013</xref>) stress the need for practitioners to preserve autonomy and not
overload patients with complex information. They raise concerns about how to
communicate incidental findings as knowledge advances and datasets become richer
and more comprehensive. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306312719858404">Hall et al. (2013)</xref> advocate for
policies that ‘refine how risk prediction information is fed back to screening
participants, their health providers or potentially affected family members’ (p.
288).</p>
<p>One such policy solution, which the articles we reviewed explore, is ‘dynamic
consent’ (e.g. Chowdhury, 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312719858404">Dent et al., 2014</xref>). This involves
participants agreeing to be re-approached to extend their original consent in
the context of new uses of their data. Its advocates argue that dynamic consent
offers flexibility and the preservation of autonomy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312719858404">Dent et al., 2014</xref>) and allows for the
possibility that the information on which risk assessments are based might
change as more data are gathered and analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306312719858404">Chowdhury et al., 2013</xref>). Within these
arrangements, professionals involved with PRSS would be expected to acquire
‘adequate understanding’ to use the new kinds of algorithms and risk estimation
techniques, and to communicate these with confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306312719858404">Dent et al., 2013</xref>: 20; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306312719858404">Chowdhury et al.,
2013</xref>). Dynamic consent also extends responsibilities for screening
recipients, as they are expected to engage with informed choices now and in the
future as information about risk develops.</p>
<p>Together these discussions, by colleagues from the humanities, social sciences
and public health, extend screening professionals’ and recipients’
responsibilities for the generation and sharing of genomic data, and for onward
engagement in the analytical process and uptake of results. This is presented as
a process of modernization of institutions, systems and beliefs. Authors invoke
collaboration, flexibility and dynamism, contrasting these with the boundaries
and rigidities of the past.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0306312719858404">
<title>Organizational responsibilities</title>
<p>We find parallel contrasts in discussions of organizational change. The articles
we reviewed outlined a range of system-related responsibilities in discussions
of the multiple kinds of evaluation required to operationalize PRSS. Evaluation
practices are, of course, embedded across health care and service arrangements
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306312719858404">Mol, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306312719858404">Pollitt et al., 2010</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0306312719858404">Power, 1999</xref>) and
are a primary way in which professional responsibilities are exercised. This is
reflected in the literature we reviewed; for example, authors suggest that a
wide range of data and processes should be subject to evaluation in order to
generate robust information about cost and benefits. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306312719858404">Chowdhury et al. (2013)</xref> note,<disp-quote><p>although modelling can provide estimates of benefit and harm, evidence
from empirical data is required to decide whether the true benefits of
screening outweigh the true harms. For evaluation of the screening
elements of the program, benefits in terms of reduction in morbidity and
mortality must be weighed against the harms or costs, including
complications of clinical investigations, anxiety over abnormal results,
overdiagnosis, and even treatment of false-positive results. (p.
426)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312719858404">Dent et al. (2014)</xref>
also discuss the importance of quality assurance:<disp-quote><p>We recommend that providers of risk stratification incorporating a
genotypic element should be transparent about the evidence base and
quality assurance processes that are used, to ensure that, regardless of
provider, the risk assessments that are generated are safe, robust, and
evidence-based. (p. 30)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Once again, the collection of data is key to the exercise of accountability, as
is co-operation amongst a range of professionals involved in gathering and
analysing data and delivering services. Crucially, professionals are asked to
provide evidence and assurance to the health ‘marketplace’, to ensure that
‘policy-makers and consumers’ can compare what is being ‘offered’ when making
choices about which service to commission or use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312719858404">Dent et al., 2014</xref>). Here the need to
not only collaborate with but also facilitate an emerging market is made
explicit.</p>
<p>These various agendas for data infrastructures, consent and organizational change
map out a range of new and extended responsibilities. For professionals, this
involves modernization, flexibility and integration between fields and across
time. Data is the primary asset, not just to produce new findings, but to enable
evaluation and quality assurance processes that are key to the development of
new markets. Screening recipients play a part in these processes, too, as
research subjects who provide data and retain responsibilities for deciding on
its uses into the future.</p>

<sec id="section11-0306312719858404">
<title>Reimagining publics and participation</title>
<p>We now turn to consider how the responsibilities of professionals and wider publics
are framed in accounts of trust, communication and education. Professionals’ social
responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306312719858404">Glerup and
Horst, 2014</xref>) include education and cultivation of publics, where publics,
in turn, become responsible as partners in PRSS development and governance processes
as part of an ‘integration rationality’ of co-production.</p>
<sec id="section12-0306312719858404">
<title>Education and mitigation of (non-)participation</title>
<p>Particularly striking in these accounts is their parsing of publics into
selective ‘affected publics’ and problematic or ‘partisan publics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306312719858404">Braun and Schultz,
2010</xref>). A notable set of concerns emerges about lower-risk publics,
members of which could be offered less or no screening as it becomes stratified
along genomic lines. Here authors note the strong support for established forms
of screening. They suggest that this arises, in part, because of public
overestimations of the risk of cancer and of the benefits of screening. For
example, in an article on UK women’s attitudes to genetically-stratified
mammography screening, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306312719858404">Meisel et al. (2015)</xref> problematize ‘public perceptions of a “right to
be screened”’ (p. 238). In this framing, the problem of overdiagnosis becomes an
issue of excessive public demand, rather than a feature of the screening
programme in question (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306312719858404">Khoury et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306312719858404">Koitsalu et al., 2016</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306312719858404">Kukafka et al.,
2015</xref>). This focuses attention on problematic publics, invoking the
responsibility of professionals to provide, and the responsibility of publics to
receive, education and reassurance about PRSS.</p>
<p>As seen in our group of articles, members of this problematic or partisan public
cling to old notions of population screening and become inappropriately
‘political’. They are no longer identified by molecular models as needing
frequent screening, but they may object to reduced screening as a rationing of
health care.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Where there is already an established screening programme, such as that
for breast cancer, there may be political or public resistance to a
reduction of the screening offered to low-risk groups because women have
been encouraged for many years to see screening as universally
beneficial and may regard this reduction as service rationing. This may
be exacerbated as, inevitably with stratified screening, a small group
of women assessed as low risk and receiving less intensive or no
screening will subsequently develop cancer. This group may feel let down
by the screening programme and would need to be very carefully managed.
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312719858404">Dent et al.,
2014</xref>: 21)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Authors invoke professional responsibilities for managing these potentially
problematic groups (of women). The focus is not simply on education as a
corrective. Authors suggest other forms of compromise or mitigation that do not
diminish existing services, for example, via extending existing screening
programs (such as breast screening) to high-risk groups and not reducing such
screening for low-risk groups (even though this would be the logical outcome of
stratification). This is contrasted with opportunities for the introduction of a
more stratified approach in new screening programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306312719858404">Chowdhury et al., 2013</xref>). In so doing,
authors avoid attenuating the sense of responsibility that motivates
participation in screening and cultivate a heightened sense of responsibility
amongst newly identified, higher-risk, groups.</p>
<p>These authors also engage in some limited discussion about another kind of
problematic public that underestimates its ‘affected-ness’ and ignore or
actively resist screening, notably ethnic minority groups.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Ethnic minority status was associated with negative attitudes towards
attending screening more frequently with a higher genetic risk, although
there was no relationship with attitudes towards risk-stratified
screening in general, or towards reducing screening frequency for those
at lower risk. This suggests that the prospect of more frequent
mammography screening may be problematic for some subgroups. Breast
screening attendance has historically been lower for women from ethnic
minority groups, with notions of privacy and modesty found to be
barriers to breast screening participation. Furthermore, cancer fatalism
(i.e. the belief that cancer is inevitable) is higher in some ethnic
groups, which has also been suggested as a reason to forego breast
cancer screening. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306312719858404">Meisel et al., 2015</xref>: 240)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This problematic public is perceived as holding inappropriate beliefs about both
cancer and risk behavior. While unlikely to attend for screening if identified
as ‘affected’, members of this public are not seen as challenging other elements
of stratified screening in general, and thus there is a responsibility for

<title>Genomic citizenship</title>
<p>The texts we reviewed also address the question of how to communicate with and
educate potential screening recipients around the subtleties of risk and the
value of reconfigured or new genomic risk-stratified screening for cancer.
Authors advocate tailored communication about particular screening programs. For
example, to avoid confusing screening recipients, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306312719858404">Dent et al. (2013)</xref> suggest that the
‘offer of stratified screening … needs to convey the message that the value of
screening depends on whether participants are low or high risk’ (p. 21). This is
not just a technical exercise, but involves an overt engagement with politics.
For example, in an article on a survey of public attitudes to PRSS for breast
and prostate cancer in Sweden, a group of psychosocial researchers note:<disp-quote><p>Even if screening would be shown to be clinically beneficial, uptake of
risk-based screening programs would depend on the attitudes in the
population. … Public understanding and interest in participating are
essential to the success of risk-based screening, because the
individuals will have to understand what is being offered and why in
order to consent to it. Moreover, acceptability of stratified screening
depends on a recognition that this change in screening routines is in
the public’s interest. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306312719858404">Koitsalu et al., 2016</xref>: 46)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, the authors complement distinctions between affected publics with the
cultivation of an ethos of public interest: a rational, lower-risk public would
be content not to be screened. They place particular emphasis on the education
of these low-risk individuals to avoid the perception of rationing:<disp-quote><p>One group who may require extra resources and attention are ‘low-risk’
individuals who under a risk-stratified approach may no longer be deemed
eligible for screening, or may have a less intensive regimen; some of
whom may develop cancer. In order to avoid undermining wider trust in
health services, effective communication strategies are needed to ensure
that those designated as low risk understand that the rationale in their
case for withholding or reducing screening is also to optimize the
benefits and reduce screening-related risks. In other words, less
screening is about risk reduction not rationing health services. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306312719858404">Hall et al.,
2013</xref>: 289)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These quotes illustrate a general concern amongst professionals from across
disciplines to establish the trustworthiness and hence public acceptance of
stratified screening, especially for those who may receive less screening as a
result of their lower risk status. In contrast with previous times, when
communication was focused on encouraging all (or most) individuals to consider
themselves at risk and to be screened, this communication strategy includes an
explicit focus on lower-risk individuals. Complex messaging around personal risk
and the costs and benefits of screening attends to consumer rights but offsets
this against the public interest in order to disavow health care rationing as a
driver for these changes. Thus responsibilities for developing more stratified
messages sit alongside, rather than eclipse, responsibilities for maintaining
classic public health messages. There is still a need to convey the importance
of continued vigilance, even amongst those designated low risk and hence likely
to receive less screening:<disp-quote><p>Individuals at lower risk will need to be informed that they may still
develop cancer, as is the case with screen-ineligible younger
individuals who are considered to be at low risk under the current UK
system. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306312719858404">Chowdhury
et al., 2013</xref>: 428)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These accounts stratify publics’ responsibilities based around genomic
designations, with lower-risk subgroups responsible for revising down their
ideas about entitlement to screening. Reworked notions of social solidarity sit
alongside these changes. For example, in their review of social, ethical and
legal aspects of cancer risk-stratified screening, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306312719858404">Hall et al. (2013)</xref> highlight recent
research on genetic solidarity, which they define as ‘the collective commitment
of individuals to bear costs to help others with a different genotype’ (p. 289).
They express concerns that this might be undermined by genetic variant testing,
particularly if it is provided privately, irrespective of risk, raising concerns
about rationing and ‘distributive justice’ whereby certain marginalized groups
might benefit less from these tests because of a lack of access. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306312719858404">Chowdhury et al. (2013)</xref>
also express concerns that stratified screening could be seen as ‘undermining
the principles of solidarity and fairness’ (p. 429) of universal programs,
prompting further disengagement by already marginalized groups and worsening
inequalities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306312719858404">Hall et al.
(2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306312719858404">2014</xref>) suggest a range of solutions to these problems. For example,
in a discussion of childhood genotyping as a feature of stratified population
screening, they highlight ‘a need for a composite normative framework’ combining
‘population-centric and individualistic approaches’, including ‘less emphasis on
the protection of autonomy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306312719858404">Hall et al., 2014</xref>: 166). They also call for ‘culturally sensitive
and appropriate support’ to different groups to ensure inclusivity, suggesting
the need to develop an evidence base beyond models which ‘rely almost
exclusively on studies of Caucasian populations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306312719858404">Hall et al., 2013</xref>: 289), echoing the
concerns about the populations from which data are derived.</p>
<p>In these accounts, a multidisciplinary group of professionals begin to articulate
ethical frameworks and models of provision for PRSS for cancer. Authors invoke a
form of genomic citizenship based around distributing resources in the
collective, not just the individual, interest. Participants are expected to
provide genomic data without the promise of direct personal benefits, even in
the form of screening; this frames participants as both research subjects and as
potential recipients of results. This model of citizenship brings with it a need
to manage public trust and markets, mitigating the potentially negative
perception of stratified screening as a process of rationing through education
about risks, research and service development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0306312719858404">
<title>Risk-reducing behaviors</title>
<p>A further set of discussions invokes responsibilities of higher-risk individuals
to be committed to preventative action. A lack of such commitment is typically
presented as a barrier to effective screening to be remedied by better
information and support.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0306312719858404">4</xref></sup> For example, the importance of ‘tailoring’ preventative approaches to
encourage appropriate ‘risk reducing behaviours’, including ‘lifestyle changes’
is emphasized in a review article on risk prediction and colorectal cancer
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0306312719858404">Usher-Smith et al.,
2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0306312719858404">Pashayan
et al. (2016</xref>: 94) also stress the ‘reversibility’ of epigenetic
changes as an ‘opportunity for cancer prevention strategies’.</p>
<p>However, in other respects, the public’s growing appetite for risk information
and personalized approaches to risk reduction is framed as excessive. For
example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306312719858404">Meisel et al.
(2013)</xref> are concerned that participants have too much faith in
risk-avoidance advice and are not sufficiently aware of the limited evidence
base for some of this (such as that coming from commercial organizations like
23andme). To some extent, authors frame this faith in risk management as a
feature of the search for control in Western society, even though that is
inconsistent with other beliefs about cancer and fate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306312719858404">Beishon (2017b)</xref> quotes a bioethicist,
Inez de Beaufort, to underline the complexities of navigating risk information
and the dangers of ‘overload’:<disp-quote><p>People should also feel free to take some risk in their lives, she said,
so how far should health services try and intervene? Will there be
services to help people after they have been tested? People are now
bombarded with risk information and navigating yet more could be
hard.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These kinds of accounts frame the popularity of preventative action as good for
recruitment to stratified screening, but this becomes problematic when it is
based on over-interpretation or over-dependence on too much or too-vague
information, with the market implicated in this proliferation. Professionals,
screening recipients and wider publics thereby acquire responsibilities for
filtering and navigating a complex array of results from state-based services
and commercial outlets to realize the benefits of stratified screening. Together
they share responsibilities for being educated about risk information and
processes which are growing ever more complex. This extends responsibilities
from the ‘constant work of modulation of the self in relation to desired forms
of life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306312719858404">Rose, 2009</xref>:
80), to engaging with and parsing complex genomic information in one’s own and
the public interest.</p>
<p>Through these accounts, responsibilities for gathering, managing and interpreting
information about individual risk extend to managing the risks and benefits of
screening more generally, including the production of responsibilities to and of
the state and the collective. Within this, publics are constituted as
responsible for calibrating their sense of risk against a widening array of
data. Yet they are also presented as being ill-equipped to do so, because of a
lack of education, poor communication or a partisan commitment to universal
screening. Consequently, members of the public are expected to reorient
themselves to appreciate the benefits to society of some actors being given less
screening, taking on a sense of genomic and health citizenship more broadly.
This reframes public concerns around inequality as a problem of misperception
and deploys appeals to science, representativeness or the state to downplay the
extent to which these concerns will be realized. Expectations about access and
demands for choice in relation to screening also have to be carefully managed.
Professionals and publics thereby share responsibility for developing a hybrid
commitment to classic public health and consumerism, moralizing state and
commercial markets with a sense of the public good including state commitment to
a high quality, value-for-money service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0306312719858404">Shamir, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this analysis, we have looked at accounts of polygenic risk-stratified screening
for cancer. As with other areas of genomics, we find a widening range of diseases
and populations being rendered measurable through molecular traces and uncertainties
are productive of further molecular data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0306312719858404">Shostak and Moinester, 2015</xref>; Timmermans,
2015). This extends the responsibilities of professionals, screening recipients, and
higher- and lower-risk populations and the tools and processes through which they
are managed, such as consent and data-sharing arrangements.</p>
<p>Recipients or potential recipients of screening become responsible for developing an
appropriate sense of their risk status and therefore eligibility for screening.
Lower-risk groups acquire responsibity for developing a sense of proportion around
their expectations, whilst higher-risk groups are required to be more vigilant.
Incorporating individualization of responsibility for managing risk via dynamic
consent processes and intensified surveillance for certain at-risk bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306312719858404">Lappé, 2016</xref>) and
improvements in molecular data collection and education as solutions to perceived
inequities rather than structural change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0306312719858404">Reardon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0306312719858404">Shostak and Moinester, 2015</xref>), PRSS for
cancer elaborates and modulates responsibilities beyond the mitigation of personal
risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306312719858404">Rose, 2009</xref>).
Learning, processing and deriving meaning from ever-more complex genomic risk
information is required for population benefit as well as recipient’s or potential
recipient’s personal interest. This requires publics to be rational about risk, to
be apolitical and non-partisan, to refrain from demanding participation without
appropriate (genomic) cause and to work together with practitioners in these
endeavors: processes of responsibilization that sit alongside ‘the continuous work
of the self on the self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306312719858404">Rose,
2009</xref>: 80) as genomic risk-based screening develops.</p>
<p>For its advocates, PRSS for cancer is not only a matter of accurately identifying
individual risk but of stratifying publics according to their perceptions (for
example of entitlements or of discrimination) in order that corrective interventions
(education, communication) can be developed. Molecular measures and models align
with particular kinds of responsibilities for data acquisition, modelling, sharing
and interpretation, articulated through various protocols and exercises in
engagement. Here, social scientists lead discussion about how to engage recipients
and publics and manage the market in the public interest. Professional
responsibilities are being extended alongside those of potential screening
recipients and publics, as they work across public-private, institutional, national
and disciplinary contexts to prioritize data collection and curation. As part of
this, professionals must make arrangements for data stewardship and collection via
screening, with an eye to public sentiment and concerns. They must be sensitive to a
range of different public perspectives and appetites for/against marketization and
to plan services accordingly. Notably, this does not extend to key domains of
imperceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306312719858404">Murphy,
2006</xref>) regarding education and public involvement. There is a lack of
attention to the inadequacies of educational interventions to increase the uptake of
screening (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306312719858404">Hollands et al.,
2016</xref>), or the contribution of screening programmes to excessive public
trust and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306312719858404">Armstrong and
Eborall, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306312719858404">Howson, 1999</xref>). Perhaps most strikingly, we found little discussion of
how to tackle non-participation by ethnic and other minority groups that have had
negative experiences of data being reused without consent, or of how to manage
minority groups’ concerns through new forms of collective research governance.
Although PRSS for cancer brings with it enhanced professional responsibilities for
engagement with ethics and politics in relation to education, consent and
participation, the repertoire of responsibilities being promoted in these accounts
take other responsibilities out of the frame.</p>
<p>The vision of the genomic era explored in this case study of PRSS for cancer is not
one in which individuals would be subject to enforced surveillance or discrimination
on the basis of their genetic profiles, as critics of geneticization have feared.
Nevertheless, our analysis suggests that it does intensify responsibilities for the
provision, collection and analysis of molecular data and the configuration of
market-state arrangements through which this will be delivered. In so doing,
responsibilities are stratified amongst potential screening populations in complex
and potentially problematic ways. For example, individuals may be asked to get less
screening if they are identified as at low molecular risk, even when their social
and economic circumstances are associated with high risk. More generally, there is
an expectation in much of this literature that publics will take on new
responsibilities to educate themselves about the complexities of stratified risk and
notions of genetic solidarity, without acknowledgement of the kinds of work this
would generate, especially for the socially disadvantaged. There is also very little
attention given to the ways in which professionals will incorporate their enhanced
responsibilities to maximise molecular data collection in order to deliver the
transformative power of technoscience into already intensive workloads, particularly
in public health systems beset with funding crises. Together, these discourses go
beyond individual risk management to extend and diversity the responsibilities of
professionals, screening recipients and publics to co-produce and consume new
markets in public health genomics.</p>
