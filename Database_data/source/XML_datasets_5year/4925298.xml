<p id="P1">Developmental nicotine exposure causes persistent changes in cortical neuron morphology and in behavior. We used microarray screening to identify master transcriptional or epigenetic regulators mediating these effects of nicotine and discovered increases in <italic>Ash2l</italic>, a component of a histone methyltransferase complex. We therefore examined genome-wide changes in H3K4 tri-methylation, a mark induced by the <italic>Ash2l</italic> complex associated with increased gene transcription. A significant number of regulated promoter sites were involved in synapse maintenance. We found that <italic>Mef2c</italic> interacts with <italic>Ash2l</italic> and mediates changes in H3K4 tri-methylation. Knockdown of <italic>Ash2l</italic> or <italic>Mef2c</italic> abolishes nicotine-mediated alterations of dendritic complexity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and attenuates nicotine-dependent changes in passive avoidance behavior. In contrast, overexpression mimics nicotine-mediated alterations of neuronal structure and passive avoidance behavior. These studies identify <italic>Ash2l</italic> as a novel target induced by nicotinic stimulation that couples developmental nicotine exposure to changes in brain epigenetic marks, neuronal structure and behavior.</p>

<p id="P2">High affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are involved in early brain development, nicotine-mediated alterations of neuronal structure, and persistent changes in behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Developmental nicotine exposure induces structural and synaptic changes in the developing brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and these changes persist into later life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Accordingly, developmental exposure to nicotine is associated with many deleterious effects, including deficits in learning and later development of psychiatric disorders <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects of cholinergic signaling on early brain development are largely unknown.</p>
<p id="P3">We used microarray screening to detect long-term changes in gene expression with the goal of identifying pleiotropic master transcriptional regulators responsible for persistent morphological alterations of cortical neurons. Among identified genes that could alter a transcriptional program, a component of a histone methylase complex, <italic>Ash2l</italic>, was significantly up-regulated by nicotine exposure during development. We therefore used next generation sequencing to determine whether nicotine could alter histone methylation associated with promoter regions of ensembles of genes involved in neuronal structure. Developmental nicotine exposure induced significant enrichment of trimethylated histone 3, lysine 4 (H3K4me3) at promoter regions of multiple genes involved in development and maintenance of excitatory synapses, including the transcription factor <italic>Mef2c</italic>, which assembles with <italic>Ash2l</italic> in a histone methyltransferase complex. Taken together, this study identifies a novel role for <italic>Ash2l</italic> in the regulation of neuronal morphology during early brain development and a new molecular mechanism underlying the long-term consequences of developmental nicotine exposure.</p>

<title>Developmental nicotine treatment alters neuronal morphology</title>
<p id="P4">Exposure to tobacco smoke during human development can alter cortical structure as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Since nicotine can alter dendritic spine number and neuronal morphology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, we determined whether nicotine in tobacco smoke could underlie changes in cortical fractional anisotropy (FA) measured by DTI. Among regimens used to deliver nicotine during development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, drinking water administration results in significant blood levels in the dam and the offspring and has minimal stressful effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. We therefore exposed mice to saccharin or nicotine (200 μg/ml) from the time of conception through weaning (P21) and measured FA at 3 months of age. This regimen results in persistent neurochemical and behavioral changes in exposed pups, with no effects on maternal behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Developmental nicotine exposure induced significant increases in FA in a number of cortical areas, largely in gray matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). To determine whether changes in gray matter such as spine density and dendritic arborization underlie increased FA, we labeled neurons diolistically with DiI and performed Sholl analysis and spine counting in mice exposed to nicotine throughout pre- and postnatal development as in the DTI study, as well as in an additional group that was treated only from birth to weaning (postnatal exposure), a critical period for cortical development dependent on acetylcholine signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Nicotine significantly increased spine density in both the pre- and postnatal nicotine treated group and in the postnatal-only nicotine treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). There was a significant effect of nicotine treatment on dendritic complexity across rostral, medial and caudal regions of cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d–f</xref>), and across all cortical layers, as demonstrated by a significant nicotine treatment by dendritic complexity interaction in each cortical layer compared to the saccharin-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g–i</xref>). These results are consistent with previous studies showing that nicotine can induce persistent changes in spine density <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Postnatal-only nicotine treated mice also showed a significant increase in dendritic complexity across all cortical regions and layers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Nicotine induces a histone methyltransferase protein</title>
<p id="P5">In order to identify persistent changes in transcriptional regulation that might be responsible for the effects of developmental nicotine treatment on cortical neuron morphology, we performed microarray analysis on mRNA prepared from dissected cortical tissue from mice administered saccharin or nicotine throughout the pre- and postnatal period until P21, that were then allowed to remain nicotine-free until 3 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>; GEO accession #GSE80789). Our goal was to identify master transcriptional regulators that might maintain a program of gene expression responsible for persistent changes in neuronal morphology many weeks after developmental exposure to nicotine. We identified 18 probe sets that were significantly different between developmental nicotine-treated and control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). To determine whether these changes in gene expression were an immediate or a later consequence of developmental nicotine exposure, we evaluated mRNA levels in independent cortical tissue samples by qRT-PCR immediately after nicotine exposure (21 days postnatal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>) or in adulthood following cessation of nicotine exposure (3 months postnatal; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary Fig 2b</xref>). At P21, 9 probes identified in the microarray study were significantly induced compared to the control group using qRT-PCR, including <italic>Ash2l</italic>, <italic>Chsy3</italic>, <italic>Ntrk2</italic>, <italic>Zfp91</italic>, <italic>Zcchc11</italic>, <italic>Cep192</italic>, <italic>Alkbh1</italic>, <italic>Ctnnal1</italic>, and <italic>Tmem107</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Five out of 15 probes initially identified by microarray were significantly different as measured by qRT-PCR compared to the control group at 3 months of age. These included <italic>Ash2l</italic>, <italic>Chsy3</italic>, <italic>Zcchc11</italic>, <italic>Cep192</italic>, and <italic>Tmem107</italic>. Among these, <italic>Ash2l</italic> was the most highly regulated by two regimens of developmental nicotine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d, e</xref>) and met our criterion as a master regulator of transcription as measured in muscle development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. <italic>Ash2l</italic> belongs to the trithorax (<italic>trx</italic>) gene family, a positive regulator of gene transcription particularly critical for development and cell differentiation through trimethylation of H3K4me3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">Histone methylation provides a potential mechanism for long-term regulation of gene expression that could maintain the effects of early nicotine exposure into adulthood. We therefore evaluated H3K4me3 across the genome in cortical tissue following pre- and postnatal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and postnatal-only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>) nicotine exposure and identified 14,881 gene loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, b</xref>; GEO accession # GSE80789). Short read sequences from the ELAND pipeline were performed for quality control, and those that did not meet criteria for fidelity were discarded. Identified peaks were viewed in Genome browser and their alignment was verified (examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). 367 differentially-enriched peaks with adjusted <italic>p</italic> values &lt; 0.05 were identified in cortical samples from pre- and postnatal nicotine exposed mice, and 426 differentially enriched peaks were identified from postnatal-only exposed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">Developmental nicotine exposure altered histone methylation at genomic sites responsible for the regulation of synapses, postsynaptic plasticity and cell junctions as identified by gene ontology (GO) analysis (using adjusted <italic>p</italic> values &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Tables 3 and 4</xref>). The genomic sites in these GO categories are highly overlapping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Most of the genomic sites identified in this screen are implicated in glutamatergic synaptic transmission (<italic>Grin1, Grin2c</italic> and <italic>Grin2d</italic> NMDA receptor subunits), and synapse formation (<italic>Dlg2</italic>, <italic>Camk2a</italic>, and <italic>Dlgap2</italic>).</p>
<p id="P8">Although there was substantial overlap in genomic sites associated with increased histone methylation in both nicotine-treated groups, developmental nicotine exposure resulted in different effects depending on time and duration of exposure. We identified common genomic sites from gene lists (adjusted <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.05) of differentially enriched histone methylation following pre- and postnatal or postnatal-only nicotine exposure (example regulated locus; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). A total of 39 genes showed overlapping changes in both the pre- and postnatal and postnatal-only nicotine treated group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">In order to validate these changes, all 36 overlapping genomic sites (excluding 3 Riken genes with unknown function) were tested using chromosome immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by qPCR in independent samples. 34 of 36 tested genomic sites showed significant changes in associated H3K4me3 levels in the pre- and postnatal or postnatal-only groups compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Nicotine increases histone methylation at the Mef2c locus</title>
<p id="P10">Consistent with our search for master transcriptional regulators, we selected <italic>Mef2c</italic> for further functional characterization from among the 34 genomic sites that were verified by ChIP-PCR because the Mef2 family has been identified as part of the methylation complex along with <italic>Ash2l</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, and also participates in dendritic remodeling during neural differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. We first determined whether identified <italic>Ash2l</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> binding sites in the genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> overlap with the sites of differentially enriched H3K4me3 sites we found following developmental nicotine exposure. A large proportion of <italic>Ash2l</italic> (mouse ES cell dataset) and <italic>Mef2c</italic> (early neuronal activity-induced cortical neuron datasets) binding sites overlapped with the H3K4me3 sites found here (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). GO analysis of these 6426 overlapping genomic sites (those sites differentially enriched as a result of nicotine exposure that overlapped with previously identified sites of <italic>Ash2l</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> binding) identified synapse-related genes as a significant category (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). This suggested that <italic>Ash2l</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> may normally interact at genomic sites related to synaptic function during neuronal development and induce histone tri-methylation and transcription of these loci, and that this complex is modulated as a result of developmental exposure to nicotine.</p>
<p id="P11"><italic>Mef2c</italic> expression is normally up-regulated during neuronal differentiation and maturation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Although it was not identified in our initial microarray screen, it is likely that the genome-wide evaluation missed some upregulated targets due to stringent statistical cut-offs. We therefore used targeted analyses to determine whether the mRNA encoding <italic>Mef2c</italic> is regulated following nicotine exposure during development. Using qPCR, we found that <italic>Mef2c</italic> mRNA levels were significantly elevated in the cortex of mice treated with nicotine throughout development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). <italic>Mef2c</italic> genomic sites also showed significantly elevated H3 acetylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>), an additional histone modification related to increased transcription.</p>
<p id="P12">At 3 months of age, H3K4me3 association with the <italic>Mef2c</italic> locus was elevated across all regions of cortex as measured by ChIP-PCR following developmental nicotine exposure, although changes were somewhat more modest in the caudal region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>). These data confirm that histone changes at the <italic>Mef2c</italic> locus are maintained for a long period following nicotine exposure, and that changes in histone methylation and gene expression occur broadly across cortical regions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Ash2l and Mef2c expression levels are regulated by nAChRs</title>
<p id="P13"><italic>In vivo</italic> genome-wide screening can identify loci that may be relevant for long-term consequences of developmental nicotine exposure, but cannot distinguish between direct effects of nicotine and indirect changes of downstream pathways. To determine whether alterations of <italic>Ash2l</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> levels are due to direct effects of nicotine mediated through nAChRs, <italic>Ash2l</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> protein levels were evaluated in cultured neural progenitor cells. After 8–9 days in culture, neural progenitor cells had differentiated into neurons. Cells were treated with nicotine (1 μM) for 48 h and protein levels were evaluated by Western blotting. Nicotine exposure significantly increased <italic>Mef2c</italic> and <italic>Ash2l</italic> protein levels as compared to saline treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). The involvement of nAChR activity in the effects of nicotine on <italic>Mef2c</italic> and <italic>Ash2l</italic> expression was verified by exposure to the nicotinic antagonists mecamylamine, α-bungarotoxin, dihydro-β-erythroidine (DHβE) and methyllycaconitine (MLA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). Mecamylamine and DHβE significantly attenuated nicotine-induced increases in <italic>Ash2l</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> protein levels, whereas α-bungarotoxin and MLA had little effect, suggesting that heteromeric (likely α4/β2 subunit containing) nAChRs are more likely to contribute to these effects than homomeric nAChRs containing the α7 subunit.</p>
<p id="P14">Nicotine depolarizes neurons and increases levels of intracellular calcium, leading to induction of intracellular signaling cascades. To study the role of calcium signaling in nicotine-dependent alterations in <italic>Ash2l</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> levels, we grew neural progenitor cells for 8–9 days, then treated with nifedipine (10 μg/ml) for 48 h with or without nicotine. Co-treatment with nifedipine blocked the effects of nicotine and significantly reduced basal levels of <italic>Ash2l</italic> and Mef2c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>), suggesting that expression of these proteins is calcium-dependent and could be induced by depolarization.</p>
<p id="P15">Direct interaction of <italic>Mef2c</italic> and <italic>Ash2l</italic> was next assessed by co-immunoprecipitation using a <italic>Mef2c</italic> antibody to pull down <italic>Ash2l</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). <italic>Ash2l</italic> was recognized in samples immunoprecipitated with the specific <italic>Mef2c</italic> antibody, but much less <italic>Ash2l</italic> was observed in the control condition. Thus, <italic>Ash2l</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> form a complex in neural progenitor cells, as has been documented in muscle cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. We next determined whether additional methyltransferase complex subunits (<italic>Wdr5, Mll, Rbbp5</italic>) that form a complex with <italic>Ash2l</italic> in muscle were also present in neural progenitor cells. Wdr5 and <italic>Rbbp5</italic> were detected following formalin cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of <italic>Ash2l</italic> at baseline, and levels of <italic>Wdr5</italic> were significantly elevated following treatment of cells with nicotine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Thus, the methyltransferase complex is expressed in neural progenitors and multiple components are regulated by nicotine signaling.</p>

<title>Ash2l/Mef2c mediate nicotine effects on dendrite morphology</title>
<p id="P16">If the <italic>Ash2l</italic>/<italic>Mef2c</italic> complex is involved in transcriptional regulation of genes involved in synapse and spine formation, these proteins may be necessary for the ability of nicotine to induce changes in dendritic structure. To determine whether <italic>Ash2l</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> are involved in dendritic spine formation, we generated shRNAs specific for mouse <italic>Ash2l</italic> or <italic>Mef2c</italic> and transfected these into neural progenitor cells. Down-regulation of <italic>Ash2l</italic> or <italic>Mef2c</italic> protein was confirmed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Neural progenitor cells were transfected with <italic>Ash2l</italic> shRNA, <italic>Mef2c</italic> shRNA or scrambled control shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a–f</xref>) and exposed for 4 days to saline or nicotine. Four days of nicotine exposure significantly increased the number of spines on dendritic shafts of cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a, b</xref>). Conversely, knockdown of <italic>Ash2l</italic> or <italic>Mef2c</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a, b</xref>) significantly reduced the number of dendritic spines on apical dendrites of cultured neural progenitor cells and abolished the increase in spines induced by 4 days of nicotine exposure.</p>
<p id="P17">To determine whether the <italic>Ash2l</italic>/<italic>Mef2c</italic> complex could also be critical for effects of nicotine on cortical neuron structure <italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation was used to introduce the shRNAs targeting <italic>Ash2l</italic> or <italic>Mef2c</italic> into a subset of neurons in the cortex of mice at embryonic day 14 (E14). Control (scrambled) shRNA was electroporated into the right hemisphere of a subset of the developing embryos and <italic>Ash2l</italic> or <italic>Mef2c</italic> shRNA was electroporated into the left hemisphere of remaining littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Dams were administered nicotine or saccharin in the drinking water starting from the day of surgery and pups were euthanized on postnatal day 21 for analysis of cortical neuron dendritic structure. Exposure to nicotine increased dendritic complexity in neurons expressing the scrambled construct, whereas knockdown of <italic>Ash2l</italic> or <italic>Mef2c</italic> abolished the ability of nicotine exposure to alter dendritic branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c–e</xref>). Consistent with the possibility that the <italic>Ash2l</italic>/Mef2c complex mediates the effects of nicotine on dendritic structure, overexpression of <italic>Ash2l</italic> or <italic>Mef2c</italic> mimicked the ability of nicotine to increase dendritic complexity in the absence of drug exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">Similarly, electroporation of the <italic>Ash2l</italic> shRNA abolished the ability of nicotine to increase density of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>).

<title>Ash2l/Mef2c mediate nicotine effects on passive avoidance</title>
<p id="P19">Knockdown of <italic>Ash2l</italic> or <italic>Mef2c in vivo</italic> prevents developmental nicotine-induced remodeling of dendritic morphology and spine density. In previous studies, we showed that nicotine exposure during the first 3 postnatal weeks induces hypersensitive passive avoidance learning in response to a subthreshold foot shock that is normally ignored <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Furthermore, this effect is mediated through β2 subunit-containing nAChRs on corticothalamic neurons. We hypothesized that this behavioral consequence of developmental nicotine exposure could result from morphological changes in sensory cortex as a result of <italic>Ash2l</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> induction. We tested passive avoidance behavior in mice following shRNA-mediated knockdown or cDNA overexpression of <italic>Ash2l or Mef2c</italic> in sensory cortex via <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation. While we targeted sensory cortex based on the DTI findings and the role of sensory stimuli in passive avoidance behavior, all animals showed broad cortical expression of the shRNA constructs, and some expression was seen bilaterally. Mice were exposed to saccharin or nicotine from the time of surgery until weaning on postnatal day 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). As predicted, nicotine-exposed mice demonstrated hypersensitive passive avoidance performance, as shown by increased latency to enter a dark chamber paired with a mild foot shock, compared to saccharin-exposed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Cortical delivery of <italic>Ash2l</italic> or <italic>Mef2c</italic> shRNA by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation significantly attenuated the hypersensitive passive avoidance induced by nicotine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Despite this significant attenuation, <italic>Ash2l</italic> knockdown did not completely abolish the effects of nicotine, likely due to incomplete knockdown or variability in cortical targeting. Finally, <italic>Ash2l</italic> or <italic>Mef2c</italic> overexpression via electroporation mimicked the effect of nicotine exposure, resulting in hypersensitive passive avoidance behavior as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>), demonstrating bidirectional modulation of passive avoidance by <italic>Ash2l</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P20">The current results demonstrate that <italic>Ash2l</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> are critical for the ability of nAChR activity to alter cortical neuron architecture and behavior during development. We propose that nicotine-dependent induction of the <italic>Ash2l</italic>/<italic>Mef2c</italic> complex during cortical development induces alterations of histone methylation associated with promoter regions of genes involved in structure and function of glutamatergic synapses, and increases spine number, dendritic branching and hypersensitive passive avoidance behavior, a task modulated by nAChRs expressed in cortical neurons. Together, these results identify a molecular mechanism underlying the ability of nAChRs to influence synaptic and dendritic structure and provide a potential cellular mechanism underlying a persistent behavioral consequence of developmental nicotine exposure.</p>
<p id="P21">Among the small number of genes that are persistently regulated in adulthood following early nicotine exposure, we focused on <italic>Ash2l</italic> because it fit the profile of a protein that could maintain a broad program of gene expression changes into adulthood. <italic>Ash2l</italic> is the mammalian homolog of <italic>ash2</italic>, a gene that belongs to the trithorax (<italic>trx</italic>) gene family and is a positive regulator of homeotic genes through DNA binding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and maintenance of chromatin in a transcriptionally active conformation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The <italic>Ash2l</italic> gene is highly conserved across evolution and functions as a transcription factor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. It is a subunit of several Trx complexes that associate with the Set1 family of histone H3K4 methyltransferases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Decreased expression of <italic>Ash2l</italic> impairs histone H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and expression of SET family target genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P22">In mammals, <italic>Ash2l</italic> is expressed in fetal human and mouse brain and its expression decreases in adult tissue <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. A study of alcohol-induced changes in brain gene expression identified changes in <italic>trx</italic>-related genes, including <italic>Ash2l</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, suggesting that modulation of <italic>Ash2l</italic> may also be important for effects of alcohol and other drugs on brain development. Based on the human proteome atlas database, <italic>Ash2l</italic> protein in brain is detected only in neuronal and glial cells of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We cannot exclude the possibility that <italic>Ash2l</italic> signaling in glial cells is involved in nicotine effects on cortical morphology or behavior; however, the <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation studies may indicate that this is unlikely. Electroporation into the cortex at E14 largely targets pyramidal neurons because GABA interneurons have not yet migrated from the ganglionic eminence at E14, whereas astroglia develop later and electroporated DNA is diluted by the time glia start to differentiate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. In addition, the genes most significantly regulated by nicotine exposure during development fall into neuronally-relevant GO groups, including those involved in glutamatergic synaptic formation and maintenance. Taken together, these observations support a primary role for <italic>Ash2l</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> in neuronal signaling following nicotine exposure during development.</p>
<p id="P23">This study also identifies a novel mechanism of gene regulation during brain development that could be more generally involved in activity-dependent structural changes of cortical neurons. <italic>Ash2l</italic>-mediated changes in H3K4me3, specifically at promoters of genes involved in synapse maintenance, likely reflect transcriptional alterations at these loci during a critical period of development that become fixed in the genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. H3K4me3 has been identified as an active promoter mark <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and may regulate formation of the pre-initiation complex and gene transcription by interacting with other transcription factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P24">Of the 34 promoter regions associated with H3K4me3 changes following nicotine exposure, the <italic>Mef2c</italic> locus is of particular interest because interaction between <italic>Ash2l</italic> and Mef2d selectively induces trimethylation of H3K4, which subsequently induces gene expression changes required for muscle differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. While <italic>Mef2c</italic> mRNA levels increase in parallel with the increase in H3K4me3 associated with its promoter, it is not yet known whether these histone methylation changes alter <italic>Mef2c</italic> expression directly. In myoblasts undergoing terminal differentiation, p38α-dependent phosphorylation of Mef2d recruits the <italic>Ash2l</italic> complex to myogenic gene promoters, enhancing histone H3K4 methylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, promoting formation of the transcription initiation complex and recruiting associated transcription factors that maintain the expression of myogenic genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Thus, the enrichment of H3K4me3 and persistence of elevated <italic>Ash2l</italic> expression many weeks after developmental nicotine exposure may maintain transcription of loci associated with H3K4me3 enrichment into adulthood.</p>
<p id="P25">Although differential H3K4me3 enrichment is positively correlated with transcription of specific subsets of genes, it is weakly correlated with genome wide transcription changes. The involvement of H3K4me3 in specific gene expression changes is therefore still somewhat controversial. The current study showing differential enrichment of histone methylation at genomic sites following developmental nicotine exposure may suggest that this subset of promoter regions is among those activated by the H3K4me3 mark. While the mechanisms that distinguish genomic loci transcribed as a result of this histone methylation event are not yet clear, the ability of nicotinic signaling to stimulate synaptically-related loci may help identify components of the complex that confer specific transcriptional activation. We note that although a small subset of loci were significantly enriched by both pre- and postnatal and postnatal-only nicotine exposure compared to saccharin treatment, 99% of loci identified with the H3K4me3 mark were identified in both nicotine treatment groups. The two regimens of nicotine exposure resulted in differential enrichment of H3K4me3 patterns across this set of gene loci, likely because histone methylation changes are highly dynamic across this period of neural precursor differentiation resulting in a cumulative representation of changes at each stage of development. Thus, the subset of gene loci showing differential H3K4me3 enrichment common to the two regimens of nicotine exposure are likely to be those loci most critical for the functional effects of nicotine on adult neuronal morphology and behavior.</p>
<p id="P26">Surprisingly, most of the genes implicated in developmental response or neuroadaptation to nicotine are implicated in glutamatergic neurotransmission, synaptic structure or spine formation. In addition to its role in the <italic>Ash2l</italic> complex, the <italic>Mef2</italic> family is involved in synaptic maturation and dendritic structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Members of the <italic>Mef2</italic> family are expressed throughout the developing central nervous system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> and can regulate activity-dependent synaptic morphogenesis in hippocampal neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. <italic>Mef2c</italic> regulates gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and facilitates neuronal plasticity by regulating synaptic number and function in adult rodents <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. The identification of mutations in genes regulated by the <italic>Mef2</italic> family in human neurological diseases, including autism spectrum disorders, suggests that <italic>Mef2</italic> activity is critical for normal brain development. Conditional knockout of the <italic>Mef2c</italic> gene in mouse brain results in changes in neuronal density, disorganized cortical structure and immature electrophysiological properties, along with abnormalities in anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive tasks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The current results support the idea that <italic>Mef2c</italic> plays multiple roles in neuronal development, some of which are dependent on <italic>Ash2l</italic> and others that are likely to be independent.</p>
<p id="P27">Although loci with synapse-related functions were most clearly identified by gene ontology analysis following developmental nicotine exposure, genomic sites in the channel binding protein and activity modulator groups were also identified, including a number of calcium and potassium channel subunits (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Tables 3 and 4</xref>). In addition, developmental nicotine administration induced changes in histone methylation of acetylcholine receptor loci, including the α3 subunit of the nAChR (<italic>Chrna3</italic>) and the muscarinic subunit M1 (<italic>Chrm1</italic>). Thus, developmental nicotine exposure has persistent effects on histone structure of loci associated with glutamatergic synaptic transmission, neuronal excitability and cholinergic signaling, and common molecular and cellular changes can be induced by different durations of nicotine exposure.</p>
<p id="P28">The early postnatal weeks appear to be a critical period for nicotine-induced molecular, cellular and behavioral alterations. The first 2–3 weeks of postnatal development in the mouse corresponds to the third trimester of human pregnancy with respect to cortical synaptic development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Previous studies suggest that stimulation of nAChRs and the resulting calcium influx contributes to maturation of glutamatergic synapses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and stimulation of β2* nAChRs induces spine formation in hippocampal and cortical neurons in a cell-autonomous manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In previous studies we have shown that developmental nicotine exposure during the first three weeks of postnatal development induces persistent hypersensitive passive avoidance behavior that lasts into adulthood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Increased passive avoidance learning in response to a mild footshock that is normally ignored could represent an inability to screen out irrelevant sensory stimuli, consistent with the increased incidence of attentional disorders in children exposed <italic>in utero</italic> to maternal smoking <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Maternal smoking is also associated with increased smoking in adult offspring, although this is not modeled with the passive avoidance paradigm. The hypersensitive passive avoidance phenotype requires expression of β2* nAChRs on layer 6 corticothalamic neurons, consistent with the finding that manipulation of <italic>Ash2l</italic> or <italic>Mef2c</italic> levels in cortex can modulate passive avoidance learning.</p>
<p id="P29">The correlation between the ability of the <italic>Ash2l</italic>/<italic>Mef2c</italic> complex to regulate nicotine-dependent remodeling of dendritic morphology and changes in passive avoidance behavior suggest that the alterations in neuronal structure may mediate a persistent behavioral consequence of early nicotine exposure. The current study provides a novel molecular mechanism that underlies these cellular and behavioral consequences of nicotine administration. Moreover, the fact that DTI has the sensitivity to detect these morphological changes of dendritic spine density provides clinical opportunities to evaluate these changes in behaving human subjects. In addition to mediating the effects of developmental exposure to the nicotine in tobacco, these molecular mechanisms likely contribute to normal brain development, suggesting that dysregulation of cholinergic induction of <italic>Ash2l</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> as a result of genetic or environmental factors could increase the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p>

Eighteen averages were acquired and the 128 × 64 images were zero-filled to 256 × 256, resulting in an in-plane resolution of 100 μm × 100 μm.

Briefly, the double stranded cDNA and ChIP-enriched genomic DNA were treated with T4 DNA polymerase and the Klenow fragment for end repair. The 5’ ends of the DNA fragments were then phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase, and an adenosine base was added to the 3’ end of the fragments by Klenow (3’-5’ exo). A universal adaptor was then added to both ends of the DNA fragments by A-T ligation. Following 18 cycles of PCR with the Phusion DNA polymerase, the DNA library was then purified on a 2% agarose gel, and fragments of 170 – 300 base-pair in size were recovered. Around 15 ng of the DNA library was then used for cluster generation on a grafted GAII Flow Cell, and then sequenced on the Genome Analyzer for 36 cycles using the “Sequencing-by-synthesis” method.</p>

<title>Sequence base-calling, mapping to genome, data normalization and statistical analysis</title>
<p id="P44">Sequences were called from image files with the Illumina Genome Analyzer Pipeline (GApipeline) and aligned to the reference genome (UCSC mm9) using Extended Eland in the GApipeline. Uniquely mapped H3K4-me3 reads for each sample were retrieved from export.txt files (output of Extended Eland). Based on their mapping locations, these selected reads were parsed with in-house Perl scripts to generate base coverage in WIG file format. After moving average smoothing, the chromosome locations of enrichment peaks were identified from pooled WIG files using in-house Perl scripts.</p>
<p id="P45">The uniquely aligned reads by ELAND pipeline were considered in calling peaks. To eliminate noise and account for unequal total numbers, we used a defined analysis model (Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq, MACS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>) with default parameters to find peaks, which were called “peaks” of H3K4me3. For comparison analysis, a customized genomic interval file was created for EdgeR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> analysis.</p>
<p id="P46">Gene Ontology analysis was performed by using the Functional Annotation Tool of the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/">http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/</ext-link>). Statistical methods were not used to predetermine sample sizes, but ‘n’ sizes were based on other published studies. All confirmation experiments were performed on multiple pools of brain samples to reduce biological variability and provide adequate statistical power.</p>

<sec id="S21">
<title>Cell culture</title>
<p id="P47">Neural progenitor cell cultures were generated from C57BL/6J mice at embryonic day 15 as described in the Cold Spring Harbor protocol for neural progenitor cell culture <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Each embryonic mouse brain was placed in a clean dish containing ice-cold 1X PBS. Brains were separated into two hemispheres, followed by separation of the dorsal telencephalon. Isolated brain regions were carefully transferred to a non-treated polystyrene dish containing cold 1X PBS and tissue was disrupted with a Pasteur pipette. Papaine Enzyme solution prepared as described in protocol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> was added and incubated for 20 min at 37°C. Neural progenitor cell media (NEP) was added after adding enzyme inhibitor solution and centrifugation. Cells were counted using a hemacytometer and 4x10<sup>6</sup> cells were added to a non-treated culture dish containing NEP medium with EGF and bFGF (NEP complete medium). Once spheres formed, neural spheres were transferred to a PDL and laminin coated culture dish. The next day, after the neural spheres settled and attached to the culture dish, NEP complete medium was replaced with NEP medium containing 1% horse serum. For histological analysis, shRNA constructs were introduced into cells at DIV 8/9 when progenitor cells had already differentiated into neurons, and cultures then underwent a further 4 days of exposure to nicotine or saline. Histological analyses were performed at DIV 12/13.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S22">
<title>Western blotting</title>
<p id="P48">Approximately 40 μg of each sample was separated by 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 60 min at 25°C, washed three times in TBS-T for 15 min, and then incubated at 4°C overnight in primary antibody diluted in TBS-T. Blots were washed three times in TBS-T and incubated for 60 min at 25°C in secondary antibody in TBS with 0.1% Tween. Blots were washed three times in TBS-T and two times in water before scanning with an Odyssey Infrared Scanner (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). The scans were performed with the following scan parameters: intensity = 5.0, for each wavelength (700 and 800 nm), resolution = 169, quality = medium, and focus offset = 0 mm. The scanned intensity of the two secondary antibodies’ fluorophores was then used by the Odyssey Software v1.2 (Li-Cor Biosciences) to produce individual images for each wavelength, and a pseudocolor overlay of the 700 (red) and 800 nm (green) scans. The area of each band was selected for quantification and the integrated intensity of the 700 and 800 nm wavelengths was measured using Odyssey Software without investigator manipulation. Since Li-Cor uses the absolute intensities for quantitation, the pseudocolor images are reflections of the absolute value measured by the program. The integrated intensity values were then exported to Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) for further analysis. For <italic>Ash2l</italic> expression detection, Chemiluminescence (ECL detection kit from GE health care, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) was used.</p>

<sec id="S23">
<title>Immunoprecipitation assay</title>
<p id="P49">Approximately 4 x 10<sup>6</sup> neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were treated with nicotine or PBS. Following treatment, NPCs were lysed in Ripa buffer (0.7 % Na-Deoxycholate, 500 mM LiCl, 50mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 1% NP-40, 1mM EDTA). Samples were sonicated and protein was measured using a D/C protein assay kit (Bio-rad). 500–1000 ug of protein was used for each immunoprecipitation assay. The anti-H3K4me3 antibody (Millipore) was coupled to Protein-A beads (Novex Lifetechnologies) and immunoprecipitation and elution were performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendation.</p>

<title>Design and construction of shRNAs</title>
<p id="P50">shRNAs targeting <italic>Ash2l</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> were constructed by selecting unique 24 base or 19 base sequences in the consensus coding region of the mRNA encoding the different isoforms of <italic>Ash2l</italic> and <italic>Mef2c</italic> (<italic>Ash2l</italic>; GenBank accession NM_011791.3, <italic>Mef2c</italic>; GenBank accession NM_025282.3) as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. A random sequence of 24 bases without similarities to any known mRNA was selected for the scrambled shRNA. Synthetic oligonucleotide duplexes were designed as previously described. Annealed oligonucleotides were ligated into a pAAV-EGFP-shRNA vector as described previously and positive clones were verified by sequencing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.

<title>In utero electroporation</title>
<p id="P53">DNA plasmids encoding either scrambled or <italic>Ash2l</italic>-targeting shRNA were diluted to a final concentration of 3 μg/μl in PBS containing 0.1% fast green dye tracer. DNA solution (1–2 μl) was unilaterally injected into a lateral ventricle of E14 embryos using a glass pipette and positive pneumatic pressure. PBS soaked Tweezertrodes with 5 mm electrode diameter (45-0489; BTX) were then positioned across the heads of the embryos followed by five 44 volt square pulses lasting 50 ms each at 950 ms interval applied using a pulse generator (ECM830; BTX).</p>

<sec id="S26">
<title>Statistical analysis and computational analysis</title>
<p id="P54">All statistical analyses were accomplished using SPSS (IBM, Inc.). Shapiro-Wilks test of normality and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test were conducted to test for normal distribution. Levene’s test was conducted for homogeneity variance. Differences in fractional anisotrophy (FA) were analyzed by two-tailed <italic>t</italic> tests. One-way ANOVA with repeated mesures or two-way ANOVA were conducted on the test sholl analysis of nicotine-mediated or IUE-induced morphological changes. One-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey or LSD test for multiple comparisons, was used to analyze experiments confirming changes in mRNA and protein levels in independent samples. Fold-change in ChIP (H3K4m3) experiments was analyzed by one-way ANOVA.

<title>Passive avoidance behavior</title>
<p id="P55">Passive avoidance testing was conducted at 21 days of age in a step-through, two chamber apparatus (Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy) using a 3-day paradigm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Day 1: mice were allowed to explore the apparatus for 5 min. Day 2: mice were placed in the light chamber and received a mild, inescapable footshock (0.2 mA, 2s) after entry into the dark chamber. Day 3: mice were placed in the light chamber and time to cross into the dark chamber was measured. Latency to cross was measured on days 2 (training day) and 3 (testing day), with 5 min maximum. Passive avoidance studies were performed by an investigator blinded to condition. Both male and female mice were used for passive avoidance behavior and no sex differences were observed, as has been published previously. No animals were excluded from analysis in studies of passive avoidance behavior. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, but sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
