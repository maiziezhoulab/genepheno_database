<abstract>
<p>Multiple autism risk genes converge on the regulation of mTOR signalling, which is a key effector of neuronal growth and connectivity. We show that mTOR signalling is dysregulated during early postnatal development in the cerebral cortex of germ-line heterozygous <italic>Pten</italic> mutant mice (<italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup>), which model macrocephaly/autism syndrome. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) receives input from subcortical-projecting neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Analysis of mPFC to BLA axonal projections reveals that <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice exhibit increased axonal branching and connectivity, which is accompanied by increased activity in the BLA in response to social stimuli and social behavioural deficits. The latter two phenotypes can be suppressed by pharmacological inhibition of S6K1 during early postnatal life or by reducing the activity of mPFC–BLA circuitry in adulthood. These findings identify a mechanism of altered connectivity that has potential relevance to the pathophysiology of macrocephaly/autism syndrome and autism spectrum disorders featuring dysregulated mTOR signalling.</p>

<body>
<p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that integrates environmental cues (for example, growth factors and energy status) to control cell growth and proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. mTOR interacts with several proteins to form at least two distinct multiprotein complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). When activated, mTORC1 promotes protein synthesis mainly by phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (eIF4E-BP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Phosphorylation of eIF4E-BP by mTORC1 releases eIF4E from binding to eIF4E-BP, forming the eIF4F complex to initiate cap-dependent protein translation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) by S6K correlates with the translational efficiency of messenger RNAs containing a tract of oligopyrimidine in the 5′UTR, named 5′TOP messenger RNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Phosphorylated rpS6 (p-S6) is a readout for mTORC1 signalling, and has been shown to regulate cell size<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Moreover, studies in the mammalian nervous system have shown that mTOR-S6K signalling regulates neuronal soma size, dendritic arborization, axonal growth and connectivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p>
<p>Numerous lines of evidence implicate dysregulated mTOR signalling in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related neurodevelopmental disorders. Genes impinging on the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, for example, <italic>phosphatase and tensin homologue</italic> (<italic>PTEN</italic>)<italic>, TSC1/2, NF1</italic> and <italic>FMR1,</italic> are highly represented amongst ASD risk genes identified to date<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Elevated mTOR signalling in the cerebral cortex has been reported in postmortem samples from individuals with autism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, and several animal models of risk genes acting in this pathway also show altered mTOR signalling in the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>PTEN</italic> encodes a phosphatase that is a negative regulator of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Germ-line heterozygous mutations in <italic>PTEN</italic> are found in ∼7–17% individuals with autism and macrocephaly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> (head circumference &gt;2 s.d.'s above normal), generally reduce PTEN protein levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, and cause macrocephaly/autism syndrome (OMIM #605309) in an autosomal dominant manner. A mouse model that approximates the germ-line heterozygous <italic>Pten</italic> (<italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup>) mutations found in macrocephaly/autism syndrome displays a dynamic pattern of macroscale brain overgrowth due to altered proliferation and allocation of cell types, as well as selective impairments in ASD-relevant behaviours, particularly social behaviour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The widespread macroscale brain overgrowth, together with selective behavioural impairments, suggests that cell types and circuits underlying social behaviour may be more vulnerable or less adaptable to desynchronized patterns of growth caused by <italic>Pten</italic> mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p>
<p>This raises a critical problem for understanding the neurobiology of autism and developing effective treatments: how do mutations in general regulators of growth, such as <italic>PTEN</italic> and other members of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, lead to the relatively selective behavioural and cognitive symptoms of ASD? To answer this question, it is necessary to understand the spatiotemporal pattern of activity of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway in the developing brain and how it is impacted by mutations in ASD risk genes at the level of structural and functional connectivity in key circuits underlying ASD-relevant behaviours.</p>
<p>Here we have mapped the activity of mTORC1, using p-S6 as a readout, in the developing brains of normal and germ-line <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice. We report that p-S6 levels are unexpectedly stable in the developing cerebral cortex of germ-line <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice, with the exception of a discreet window during early postnatal life. Among the cell types that display particularly high levels of p-S6 are developing subcortical-projecting layer V neurons. We report that these neurons are hypertrophic in germ-line <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice and that cortical–subcortical connectivity is altered in these animals. Connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a particular focus of this study, as both of these areas are implicated in the processing of social information<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and autism pathophysiology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Furthermore, structural and functional connectivity between these areas is well conserved between rodents and humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Our findings are consistent with the novel hypothesis that dysregulated mTORC1 signalling during a critical period of development alters neuronal connectivity, including mPFC–BLA projections, and social behaviour.</p>

<title>mTOR activity is dysregulated in <italic>Pten</italic> mutant mice</title>
<p>To understand whether the laminar distribution of p-S6 in the cerebral cortex is altered in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice, we performed immunohistochemistry for p-S6 and compared the <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> pattern of p-S6 to that of wild type (WT) mice at postnatal day 4 (P4), P8, P14, P28, and adulthood. To our surprise, we found that the spatiotemporal distribution of p-S6 was not grossly altered in the developing cerebral cortex of <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To compare levels of p-S6 between WT and <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice, we ran western blots on whole cortices from these animals across developmental time points. We found that p-S6 levels were unexpectedly similar between WT and <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice at all stages examined with the exception of P8, when there was more p-S6 detected in the <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> cortex as compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). This indicates that p-S6 levels are transiently dysregulated during early postnatal life (between P4 and P14) in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice.</p>
<p>In carrying out immunohistochemistry for p-S6 within the early postnatal cerebral cortex, the non-uniform laminar distribution of p-S6 in WT, as well as <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup>, mice was notable. Plotting the distribution of p-S6 immunoreactivity across layers in the somatosensory cortex at P8 revealed that p-S6 levels are graded, with strongest signal in layer V and moderate signal in layers II/III and VI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). Measuring neuronal soma size and p-S6 immunoreactivity at P8, we found that p-S6 immunoreactivity is correlated with soma size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>). Moreover, within cortical layer V, subcortical-projecting neurons have greater soma size and dendritic complexity than callosal-projecting neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, and we observed that p-S6 immunoreactivity is greater in CTIP2<sup>+</sup> neurons, which are subcortical-projecting neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, than in SATB2<sup>+</sup> neurons, which are callosal-projecting neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1C</xref>). Examining other brain areas, we found that during early postnatal development p-S6 was generally enriched in larger cell types (cell soma ≥20 μm in diameter), for example, Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, layer V corticospinal motor neurons (LV neurons), dopaminergic neurons (DA neurons) and noradrenergic neurons (NA neurons; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1D</xref>). In contrast, minimal <italic>P</italic>-S6 was generally detected during development in smaller cell types (cell soma ≤10 μm in diameter), for example, medium spiny neurons, hippocampal granule cells and cerebellar granule cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1D</xref>). We interpret this expression pattern as consistent with p-S6 being a positive regulator of cell/neuronal size<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,</p>
<p>Given that we detected a change in the amplitude, but not the spatiotemporal distribution, of p-S6 in the developing cortex, we predicted that loss of one copy of <italic>Pten</italic> (that is, <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup>) might particularly impact cell types with high levels of p-S6 in WT animals. As an initial test of this, we examined the size of neurons across layers in the somatosensory cortex. We selected this region because of its relatively well-defined laminar organization within the mouse cerebral cortex. Using fluorescent Nissl staining, we detected increased soma size in layer V neurons, but not in layers II–IV or VI neurons, in P14 <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice as compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). This indicates that the growth of cell types enriched for p-S6 (for example, layer V neurons), as reflected by cell soma size, is desynchronized relative to neurons with lower levels of p-S6 (for example, layers II–IV or VI neurons) in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice.</p>
<p>As we observed enrichment of p-S6 in developing subcortical-projecting layer V neurons, amongst other cell types, and we detected a pronounced change in cell soma size in layer V neurons in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice, we decided to examine these as a representative of cell types whose growth is impacted by <italic>Pten</italic> haploinsufficiency. To understand whether overgrowth of layer V neurons is restricted to the cell soma or also occurs in neurites, we examined dendritic structure. We made use of a genetic reporter for layer V neurons (<italic>Etv1-CreERT2; Ai14</italic>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> and measured dendritic tree size of these cells in P14 <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice (<italic>Etv1-CreERT2; Ai14</italic>; <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup>). We found that, relative to controls, layer V neurons in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice exhibited increased cell soma volume and dendritic complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f–l</xref>). Thus, changes in neuronal soma size in layer V neurons caused by <italic>Pten</italic> haploinsufficiency correlate with changes in neurite growth.</p>
<p>To explore whether dysregulated neurodevelopmental mTORC1 signalling might be a point of convergence across multiple mouse models of autism risk genes, we performed these analyses in another mouse model of an autism risk gene, <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup>. We found that, similar to <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice, the spatiotemporal distribution of p-S6 in the cerebral cortex is not grossly altered, and p-S6 levels are elevated at P14 as compared with WT, but not other ages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2A–C</xref>), indicating that cortical mTORC1 signalling is transiently elevated during early postnatal life. Measuring cell soma size across cortical layers, we found that layer V neurons are enlarged in P14 <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice as compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2D,E</xref>). Consistent with overgrowth in layer V neurons, dendritic tree size is also slightly greater in P14 <italic>Etv1-CreERT2</italic>; <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup>mice as compared to control littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2F–L</xref>). This suggests that multiple autism risk genes may converge on dysregulated neurodevelopmental mTORC1 signalling and desynchronized neuronal growth.</p>

<title>Early inhibition of S6K1 corrects deficits in <italic>Pten</italic> mutants</title>
<p>The observation that p-S6 levels are transiently dysregulated in the cerebral cortex of P8 <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice led us to speculate that this could represent a critical period where normalization of p-S6 levels may suppress the overgrowth of layer V neurons and behaviour deficits in these animals. To test this possibility, we treated <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice and WT controls with the S6K1 inhibitor PF-4708671 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), injected daily from P4 to P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We found that systemic PF-4708671 treatment reduced elevated p-S6 in the cerebral cortex and suppressed the increased soma size of layer V neurons in the somatosensory cortex of P14 <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). The most robust and consistent behavioural phenotype we have observed in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice is deficits in the three-chamber social approach test in adult females<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Adult male <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice, in contrast to females, display variable phenotypes in this assay that are highly sensitive to testing conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), so three-chamber social approach testing in this study focused on female animals. We found that PF-4708671 treatment in the P4–P14 developmental window is sufficient to reverse the three-chamber social approach deficit present in vehicle-treated adult female <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). We also observed that WT mice receiving PF-4708671 treatment displayed social approach deficits, consistent with a previous report of reduced social interaction in WT mice receiving rapamycin treatment beginning at 5–6 weeks of age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Thus, we speculate that an optimal level of mTORC1 signalling is required during development for normal social behaviour, with too much or too little activity resulting in similar social behavioural deficits, in line with a previously proposed model of bidirectional control of protein synthesis and connectivity in ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Taken together, these results point to a developmental window in early postnatal life in which social behaviour is sensitive to modulation of mTOR/S6K1 signalling and normalization of p-S6 levels results in lasting correction of the three-chamber social approach deficits in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice.</p>
<p>In addition to the core symptoms of ASD, some individuals with germ-line heterozygous <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations also have deficits in working memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. To explore whether germ-line <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice also show working memory deficits and whether this phenotype may be responsive to developmental PF-4708671 treatment, we assessed spatial working memory using the non-matching to sample T-maze test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4A</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Vehicle and PF-4708671-treated WT and <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice of both sexes showed normal performance in this test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4B,C</xref>), indicating that the particular aspect of working memory probed by the non-matching to sample T-maze test is not altered in these animals.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Neuronal hyperconnectivity in <italic>Pten</italic> mutants</title>
<p>Considering that layer V neurons are the primary output neurons of the cerebral cortex, we speculated that cortical–subcortical connectivity between areas important for social behaviour might be altered in these animals. A circuit that is particularly interesting in this context involves projections from the mPFC to the BLA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Both of these areas are implicated in the processing of social information<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and autism pathophysiology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Thus, we formulated the hypothesis that dysregulated mTORC1 signalling during a critical period of development alters neuronal connectivity, including mPFC–BLA projections, and social behaviour.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we first confirmed that BLA-projecting mPFC neurons are hypertrophic in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5A–C</xref>), consistent with our observation of layer V neuron hypertrophy in somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Furthermore, we found that protein synthesis and p-S6 levels are dysregulated in the prefrontal cortex of P8 <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice, indicating dysregulated mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5D–G</xref>). We next injected reporter-expressing (tdTomato) adeno-associated virus (AAV) into the mPFC of adult female mice and visualized axon terminal branching and synaptic boutons within the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We found that axons originating from the mPFC in vehicle-treated <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice displayed excessive branching and synaptic boutons within the BLA, as compared with vehicle-treated WT mice, and that PF-4708671 treatment during development (P4–P14) was sufficient to reverse this phenotype in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b–e</xref>). These results indicate that mPFC–BLA circuitry is hyperconnected in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice, and that this phenotype is sensitive to early postnatal PF-4708671 treatment.</p>
<p>As an initial exploration into the molecular mechanism by which dysregulated mTORC1 signalling might lead to altered axon branching and structural connectivity, we measured levels of CRMP2 (collapsin response mediated protein 2) and Tau (microtubule associated protein), both of which are regulated by mTORC1 signalling and have been shown to influence axon growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. We observed a significant increase in CRMP2 levels and a trend towards increased Tau levels in P8 <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f,g</xref>). Actin remodelling is a regulator of axon growth, and homozygous <italic>Pten</italic> mutations can alter actin levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Thus, we measured β-actin levels and did not observe any differences between WT and <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>), indicating that this is a valid loading control and that heterozygous <italic>Pten</italic> mutations do not grossly alter β-actin levels, unlike homozygous <italic>Pten</italic> mutations. Since the excessive axon branching in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice was suppressed by pharmacological inhibition of S6K1 during early postnatal life, we suspected that this effect could be due to the inhibition of S6K1-dependent translation of CRMP2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). To test this possibility, we measured CRMP2 levels in the P8 cerebral cortex of <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> and WT control mice that received PF-4708671 treatment from P4 to P8, by western blot. We found that PF-4708671 treatment suppressed elevated CRMP2 in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h,i</xref>). Thus, normalization of excessive axon branching in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice by PF-4708671 treatment correlates with normalization of CRMP2 levels in these animals.</p>

<title>Hyperactivity in the mPFC and BLA of <italic>Pten</italic> mutant mice</title>
<p>To test if neuronal activity in response to a social cue is altered in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice, we measured the number of c-fos<sup>+</sup> neurons in the mPFC and BLA in response to exposure to a novel stimulus mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Previous work has shown that social exposure induces c-fos activation in the mPFC and BLA, and that the number of c-fos<sup>+</sup> cells in these two regions correlates with the amount of time engaged in social interaction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Consistent with this, we found that exposure to a novel social stimulus results in a robust induction of c-fos<sup>+</sup> cells in the mPFC and BLA of both WT and <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> adult female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b–d</xref>) and that the number of c-fos<sup>+</sup> cells in these two regions correlated with the duration each mouse spent sniffing the novel stimulus mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6A</xref>). Although the total number of c-fos<sup>+</sup> cells in the mPFC and BLA is not altered in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>), we found that social interaction time, as reflected by time spent sniffing, varied between and within genotype during the social exposure period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Because the induction of c-fos<sup>+</sup> cells in mPFC and BLA is dependent on the amount of social interaction time, we calculated a c-fos activation index (number of c-fos<sup>+</sup> neurons/time mouse engaged in sniffing; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6B</xref>). We found that the c-fos activation index is elevated in the mPFC and BLA of vehicle-treated <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice. Furthermore, we found that the elevated c-fos activation index in the mPFC and BLA is normalized in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice receiving PF-4708671 treatment during early postnatal life (P4–P14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f,g</xref>). We confirmed this result in a separate cohort of mice in which the animals were allowed to sniff a novel stimulus mouse to a fixed criterion of 30 s, thus ensuring equivalent amounts of exposure to the social cue across subjects. In this cohort, we found that c-fos<sup>+</sup> cells in the mPFC and BLA are elevated in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> relative to WT mice, and this phenotype is rescued by PF-4708671 treatment during early postnatal life (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Thus, with equivalent social exposure, there are more c-fos<sup>+</sup> cells in the mPFC and BLA of <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice, and this phenotype can be normalized by suppression of S6K1 during development.</p>

<title>Adult S6K1 inhibition does not rescue <italic>Pten</italic> mutant deficits</title>
<p>We next asked whether mPFC–BLA connectivity and social phenotypes in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice might be responsive to PF-4708671 treatment in adulthood, when cortical circuitry has reached a mature state. To address this issue, we treated adult <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice with the equivalent dosage and duration of PF-4708671 as that of developmental experiments and tested social behaviour 7 days after the final injection of PF-4708671 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>).

This result prompted us to investigate mPFC–BLA structural connectivity and c-fos reactivity in these mice.

<title>Hyperactivity of mPFC-BLA circuitry in <italic>Pten</italic> mutants</title>
<p>To test whether <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice exhibit hyperactive mPFC–BLA circuitry in response to social cues, we used c-fos expression as a measure of neuronal activity in BLA-projecting mPFC neurons in WT and <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice. To label BLA-projecting mPFC neurons, we injected an AAV vector carrying the reporter mCherry, expressed in a Cre-dependent manner (double-floxed inverted open reading frame) into the mPFC, and a retrograde-transporting canine adenovirus carrying Cre recombinase (CAV2-Cre) into the BLA of adult female WT and <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Each subject mouse was allowed to sniff a novel stimulus mouse to a fixed criterion of 30 s so that each subject mouse engaged in an approximately equal amount of social interaction. We found that a greater percentage of BLA-projecting mPFC neurons (mCherry<sup>+</sup> neurons) were c-fos<sup>+</sup> in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice as compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b,c</xref>), suggesting that mPFC–BLA circuitry is hyperactive in response to social exposure in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice.</p>
<p>To test whether decreasing activity in mPFC to BLA projections may normalize three-chamber social approach deficits in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice, we reduced excitability in mPFC neurons projecting to the BLA using retro-DREADD (Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) technology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. An AAV vector carrying hM4Di and mCherry expressed in a Cre-dependent manner was bilaterally injected into the mPFC, and a CAV2-Cre vector was bilaterally injected into the BLA of adult female <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d,e</xref>). Clozapine n-oxide (CNO) or vehicle was injected into these mice, and we then tested social behaviour using the three-chamber social approach assay. We found that the three-chamber social approach deficit present in vehicle injected hM4Di expressing <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice or vehicle and CNO injected mCherry expressing <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice was corrected in CNO injected hM4Di expressing <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f</xref>).</p>
<p>We next measured c-fos<sup>+</sup> cells in the mPFC and BLA of these mice in response to sniffing a novel stimulus mouse to a fixed criterion of 30 s. We found that the number of c-fos<sup>+</sup> cells in the mPFC and BLA in response to social exposure was reduced in CNO injected compared with vehicle injected hM4Di expressing <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice, and we found no change in the number of c-fos<sup>+</sup> cells in either vehicle or CNO injected mCherry expressing <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6g,h</xref>).

<title>Reducing mTOR activity corrects deficits in <italic>Pten</italic> mutant mice</title>
<p>To determine whether isolating <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mutations to the cerebral cortex will lead to three-chamber social approach deficits, we generated conditional <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mutant mice using <italic>Emx1-Cre,</italic> which is expressed primarily in cortical pyramidal cells throughout development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). We used a Cre driver that is expressed broadly in the cortex, rather than a Cre driver that is restricted to subcortical-projecting pyramidal cells, because we do not know at present if the effects of <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mutations on the development of this neuronal population are cell autonomous or non-cell autonomous. We have previously shown that <italic>Emx1-Cre</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup><italic>; Pten</italic><sup><italic>loxp/+</italic></sup> mice recapitulate the cortical overgrowth phenotype seen in germ-line <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Testing social behaviour using three-chamber social approach test, we found that although adult female <italic>Emx1-Cre</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup><italic>; Pten</italic><sup><italic>loxp/+</italic></sup> mice did not display a significant difference in allocation of chamber time as compared with controls, a within-group analysis revealed a lack of significant difference in time spent in the stimulus mouse versus object chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether reducing mTORC1 signalling in the cerebral cortex of germ-line <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice is sufficient to correct three-chamber social approach deficits, we generated <italic>Emx1-Cre</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>; <italic>Rptor</italic><sup><italic>loxp/+</italic></sup>; <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The genetic causes of ASD are heterogeneous. Studying a signalling pathway regulated by multiple autism risk genes at the level of circuit function will provide insights into common biological mechanisms underling ASD pathogenesis and pathophysiology. Here we have presented evidence that dysregulated mTOR signalling impacts the assembly of circuitry underlying social behaviour in germ-line <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice, a mouse model for macrocephaly/autism syndrome. We have mapped the spatiotemporal activity of mTORC1 signalling in developing mouse brain, and found that a subset of cells, including subcortical-projecting layer V neurons in the cerebral cortex, exhibit enrichment for p-S6, a readout for mTORC1 signalling. We further investigated cortical–subcortical connectivity, which is largely mediated by subcortical-projecting layer V neurons, between two brain areas that are implicated in the processing of social information and ASD pathophysiology, the mPFC and BLA. We show that <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice exhibit hyperconnectivity and hyperactivity of mPFC–BLA circuitry, excessive c-fos reactivity in response to social cues, and three-chamber social approach deficits. Correcting structural connectivity by treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor of S6K1 during early postnatal life or modulating neuronal activity by DREADDs in adulthood can suppress these phenotypes.</p>
<p>We find that <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice display non-uniform overgrowth across neuronal cell types in the developing cerebral cortex, indicating that the growth of some neuronal populations (for example, subcortical-projecting layer V neurons) is desynchronized relative to others. This finding has implications for information processing within cortical microcircuitry. <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice, which model fragile X syndrome, display a similar phenotype. One possible explanation for this finding is that mutations in genes that encode negative regulators of mTORC1 signalling, such as <italic>Pten</italic> and <italic>Fmr1</italic>, have the greatest effect on growth in cell types with high baseline levels of mTORC1 activity (for example, layer V neurons) because these cells are more dependent on negative regulation by repressive factors. It is worth contrasting the effects of heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Pten</italic> mutations in light of this explanation. Studies from <italic>Pten</italic> conditional knockout mice have shown that even relatively small neural cell types, such as hippocampal granule cells, exhibit overgrowth on conditional homozygous mutation of <italic>Pten</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Indeed, we have found that conditional homozygous mutation of <italic>Pten</italic> leads to massively increased p-S6 levels and decreased cell density throughout the newborn cerebral cortex, consistent with widespread hypertrophy, whereas we did not observe this phenotype upon conditional heterozygous mutation of <italic>Pten</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). We attribute this to an effect of <italic>Pten</italic> dosage: homozygous mutation of <italic>Pten</italic> shifts a wide variety of neural cell types towards a pathological state, with strong upregulation of mTORC1 activity and hypertrophy. In contrast, most neural cell types appear to maintain more or less normal physiological levels of mTORC1 signalling upon heterozygous mutation of <italic>Pten</italic>.</p>
<p>The normal developmental trajectory of mTORC1 activity in the brain may help to explain our finding of transient changes in cortical p-S6 levels in early postnatal life in germ-line <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> and <italic>Fmr1</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice. One study that examined mTORC1 signalling in the cerebral cortex of WT mice in both early postnatal life and adulthood found that mTORC1 signalling is most active during early postnatal life, especially the first two postnatal weeks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Just as cell types with high baseline levels of mTORC1 signalling may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of dominant-acting mutations in genes that encode negative regulators of mTORC1 signalling, neurodevelopmental time windows of peak mTORC1 activity (for example, early postnatal life) might represent critical periods of vulnerability to such mutations, as well as targets for therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p>We found that in the mature brain, axonal projections from the mPFC to the BLA have excessive branches and synaptic boutons. Given that elevated cortical p-S6 and CRMP2, and rescue by S6K1 inhibitor treatment, all occur during the early postnatal life, we predict that the initial growth of subcortical-projecting neurons is over-exuberant in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice. This would be consistent with reports of <italic>Pten</italic> and mTOR-S6K signalling acting as regulators of axonal growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Another factor that could be at play is reduced axonal pruning of subcortical-projecting neurons in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice. This is an interesting possibility given that a recent study has reported reduced dendritic spine pruning in cortical layer V cells of individuals with ASD and in <italic>Tsc2</italic> mutant mice, with this phenotype resulting from a disruption of mTOR-dependent macroautophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The contribution of mTORC1-mediated axonal branching to the white matter abnormalities reported in individuals with ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> will be an interesting area of future research.</p>
<p>This study has focused on connectivity between the mPFC and BLA, as this circuit is implicated in ASD pathophysiology and has relevance for the three-chamber social approach deficit observed in germ-line <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice. However, we anticipate that altered connectivity is unlikely to be restricted to this circuit, given that we have observed p-S6 enrichment and neuronal overgrowth outside of the prefrontal cortex (for example, in layer V neurons in the somatosensory cortex). Given the relatively selective behavioural deficits in germ-line <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, we predict that the behavioural profile of these animals is a product of altered ‘hard-wired' connectivity across multiple circuits, together with the capacity of specific circuits to adapt to these changes during development via synaptic plasticity mechanisms. Indeed, we have found that dopaminergic neurons are enriched for p-S6 during development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1D</xref>). Considering that dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area encode and modulate features of social interaction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, dopamine signalling plays a key neuromodulatory role in the PFC and limbic system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, and conditional deletion of <italic>Pten</italic> in dopaminergic neurons results in three-chamber social approach deficits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, we speculate that mesocorticolimbic circuitry may be especially vulnerable to the effects of abnormal structural and functional connectivity resulting from <italic>Pten</italic> haploinsufficiency.</p>
<p>We note that both increased and decreased brain network connectivity has been reported in individuals with ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. While we have found evidence for hyperconnectivity in our model of macrocephaly/autism syndrome caused by germ-line heterozygous <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations, it is likely that distinct subgroups of individuals with ASD may display different connectivity endophenotypes that correlate with underlying risk factors. It is possible that either increased or decreased connectivity may cause similar behavioural and cognitive deficits, potentially resulting from imbalanced excitation and inhibition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> across brain circuits and areas critical for processing of social information.</p>
<p>An important problem for developing therapeutic approaches to psychiatric disorders is defining critical periods of phenotypic reversibility. Previous studies have shown that the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, when given to <italic>Pten</italic> conditional knockout animals at different time points, is able to prevent or arrest, but not reverse, altered neurite projection patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Our results show that suppression of S6K1 by PF-4708671 during early postnatal life, but not in adulthood, results in a lasting correction of mPFC–BLA hyperconnectivity, excessive c-fos reactivity to social cues, and three-chamber social approach deficits in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice. This indicates that suppression of mTOR-S6K signalling in adulthood is not sufficient to reverse structural connectivity changes (i.e. hyperconnectivity of mPFC–BLA circuitry) in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice. Our experimental design included a washout period for PF-4708671 because we wanted to test whether treatment with this drug during development or in adulthood results in lasting changes in structural connectivity. We cannot exclude the possibility that overlapping PF-4708671 treatment with behavioural testing may result in modification of behavioural deficits through a mechanism independent of changes in structural connectivity.</p>
<p>While our data indicate that abnormal mPFC–BLA structural connectivity is hard-wired in adulthood, we find that reducing activity in mPFC–BLA projections via DREADD technology is capable of normalizing both c-fos reactivity and the three-chamber social approach deficits. Thus, we propose that there are at least two distinct windows and strategies whereby social behavioural deficits in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice can be modulated. The first window is in early postnatal life, when suppression of mTORC1-S6K1 can prevent or arrest the development of altered mPFC–BLA structural connectivity. The second window is in adulthood, where modulation of activity in mPFC–BLA circuitry can offset the consequences of pathological structural and functional connectivity. Future work will explore the specific nature of altered structural and functional connectivity between the mPFC and BLA at the level of cell types within the BLA in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice and whether modulating activity of this circuit is capable of influencing social behaviour in WT animals. It will also be interesting to investigate whether the modulation of amygdala reactivity, habituation and connectivity with the prefrontal cortex that has been associated with genetic variants influencing serotonin signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> might be a substrate for modification of social behavioural endophenotypes in <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice by second-site mutations in serotonin transporter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and pharmacological targeting of serotonin receptor signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p>
<p>An emerging theme in the field of psychiatric disorders is a shift towards stratifying populations based on common underlying risk factors and pathophysiology, and aligning preclinical research to investigate circuit and neurophysiological correlates of these risk factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. We have shown that haploinsufficiency for <italic>Pten</italic> leads to dysregulation of a disease-implicated signalling pathway (the mTOR signalling pathway) that regulates neuronal connectivity, and altered connectivity in an autism-relevant neural circuit (mPFC-amygdala) affects activity in a key brain region (amygdala) in response to social cue, as well as social behaviour. Given that both mPFC–BLA connectivity and mTOR-S6K signalling are highly evolutionarily conserved between rodents and humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>, we anticipate that the mechanism of pathogenesis and corresponding therapeutic strategy presented here may be relevant for individuals with ASD who have been exposed to risk factors associated with dysregulated mTOR signalling.</p>

<title>Pharmacological S6K1 inhibitor treatment</title>
<p>The S6K1 inhibitor PF-4708671 was dissolved in DMSO. Both vehicle and PF-4708671 were formulated in 10% DMSO, 10% tween 80 and 80% water. PF-4708671 (75 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) or vehicle were injected subcutaneously into pups from P4 to P14. For adult female mice (2–4 month of age), intraperitoneal injection of PF-4708671 (75 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) was performed for 11 consecutive days. 75 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> was selected based on prior studies reporting that doses of PF-4708671 in this range can suppress p-S6 levels in the adult mouse brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>.</p>

<title>Axon tracing of mPFC to BLA projections</title>
<p>Axon tracing in this study followed a previously published method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. AAV-tdTomato was obtained from Penn Vector Core. For injections, mice were anaesthetized under isoflurane and placed onto a stereotaxic frame. Bregma and lambda were used to find the coordinates of the mPFC (1.9 mm anterior to bregma, 0.4 mm lateral to midline and 2.3 mm ventral to bregma). The virus, diluted to 10% with water, was injected by a syringe pump at a rate of 100 nl min<sup>−1</sup>, with 200 nl volume injected per site in each mouse. Mice were perfused 2 weeks later, allowing for the expression of tdTomato. 100 μm-thick sagittal brain sections were collected to image mPFC axon terminals in the BLA (based on mouse brain atlas sagittal sections from the Allen Brain Atlas), with setting as z-series (stacks at 1 μm depth interval) using a × 25 Leica objective with constant parameter for laser power and gain. tdTomato expressing axons (300–350 μm length including the axon terminal) in the BLA were traced and analysed using Neuromantic reconstruction software<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. Protrusions more than 6 μm long were characterized as axon branches. Boutons were defined as at least two times wider than the width of axons, with fluorescence intensity at least two times that in axon backbones.</p>

<title>Mouse behaviour tests</title>
<p>For three-chamber social approach test, mice were tested as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Briefly, mice were housed under a reversed 12:12 h light cycle for at least 2 weeks before testing. Mice were put into the apparatus for 5 min to habituate on each of the 2 days preceding the test, and then returned to the housing room. During the test, each mouse was put into the three-chamber apparatus for 5 min for habituation, followed by 10 min of testing with a novel stimulus mouse inside a tube of one chamber and an empty tube in the chamber of the other side (the centre chamber was left empty). The per cent time spent in each of the three chambers, containing either a stimulus mouse in a tube, an empty tube or nothing (in the centre) was recorded during the 10-min social approach trial.</p>
<p>For non-matching to sample T-maze task, mice were food restricted to 85–90% of <italic>ad libitum</italic> body weight, to increase motivation for this test. The behaviour protocol consisted of 3 days of habituation, followed by alternation training and then delay testing. During habituation, mice were allowed to explore the maze for 4 min per trial, with a total of 4 trials per day. All mice learned to obtain food reward from the trough after 3 days of habituation. During the alternation training, each trial consisted of one forced and one free-choice run. In the forced run, the mouse ran down the centre arm of the maze and was directed into one of the arms. The mouse was then returned to the start box. In the free-choice run, the mouse was required to select the arm opposite to that visited in the forced run to receive a food reward. Mice were given daily training of four trials until they reached criterion, defined as performance of at least 75% correct per day for 2 consecutive days. Both WT and <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice reached criterion after 7 days of training. During delay testing, each day consisted of two non-delay trials and two delay trials. During delay trials, the mouse was kept in the start box for 60 s between the forced and free-choice runs. Mice received 5 days of delay testing, for a total of 10 trials each of delay and non-delay testing. The non-delay tests were used to determine if the mice maintained criterion performance.</p>
<p>For social exposure without fixed interaction time, female mice were housed individually in a home cage containing a perforated acrylic tube for 7 days before the test. On the test day, a novel conspecific female stimulus mouse was placed in the tube within the home cage of subject female mice. The subject mouse was allowed to explore the stimulus mouse for 20 min (social exposed group) and then the stimulus mouse was removed. The behaviour was video-recorded and manually scored to determine the amount of time that the subject mouse spent sniffing the stimulus mouse. After the stimulus mouse was removed, the subject mouse remained in the home cage for an additional 2 h before being perfused. For the control group, mice were individually housed in a home cage containing a perforated acrylic tube for 7 days and then perfused.</p>
<p>For social exposure with fixed interaction time, female mice were housed individually in a home cage containing a perforated acrylic tube for 7 days before the test. On the test day, a novel conspecific female stimulus mouse was placed in the tube within the home cage of subject female mice. The subject mouse was allowed to explore the stimulus mouse until it reached a fixed criterion of 30 s of sniffing time (manually scored during the social exposure period). In this way, each subject mouse received roughly equivalent social cue exposure.</p>

<title>DREADD experiments</title>
<p>Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane in the stereotaxic frame for the entire surgery and their body temperature was maintained with a heating pad. To reduce activity in mPFC neurons projecting to the BLA, 350 nl of canine adenovirus carrying Cre recombinase (CAV2-Cre)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref> was bilaterally injected into the BLA (1.45 mm posterior to bregma, 3.3 mm lateral to midline and 5.2 mm ventral to bregma), and 400 nl of AAV carrying Cre-dependent hM4Di and mCherry (AAV-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry) or mCherry alone (AAV-DIO-mCherry) were bilaterally injected into mPFC (1.9 mm anterior to bregma, 0.4 mm lateral to midline, and 2.3 mm ventral to bregma). Injections were performed at a rate of 50 nl per minute. The needle was allowed to sit in the target location for 3 min before the start of viral injection and for 7 min after injection was complete. Social behaviour was tested 4 and 6 weeks after the surgery, with each mouse being tested following vehicle and CNO injections in a counterbalanced design. Mice were given i.p. injections of either vehicle or CNO (3 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> body weight) 30 min before social approach test. CNO was dissolved in saline to a working solution of 0.5 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>.</p>

<title>Laminar plot analysis</title>
<p>After image acquisition, ROIs were cropped from the primary somatosensory cortex across the radial thickness using Photoshop. Cerebral cortex thickness was normalized, and images were then auto-adjusted for each channel and saved. Plot profiles for each channel of each image were obtained using ImageJ. Three brains of WT mice were analysed, and 3 ROIs per brain were used for the laminar plot analysis.</p>

<title>SUnSET method for measurement of protein synthesis</title>
<p>We obtained 400 μm coronal prefrontal cortical slices from postnatal day 8 (P8) WT and <italic>Pten</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice. Slices were allowed to recover in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (in mM: 124 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.25 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 Dextrose) for 2 h at 32 °C. Puromycin (5 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>) was applied to slices for 40 min at 32 °C to label newly synthesized proteins. Slices were then snap frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C until used. Protein (30 μg) was loaded on 4–12% gradient gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with anti-puromycin antibody (1:5,000, Millipore, MABE343). Anti-mouse HRP-tagged secondary antibody was used and chemiluminiscence was developed using standard ECL reagents. Slices that were not exposed to puromycin were used to control for non-specific labelling. Quantification was done by measuring intensity of each lane from 14 to 191 kDa, subtracting it from the intensity of the unlabelled lane, normalized to loading control and expressed relative to WT.</p>
