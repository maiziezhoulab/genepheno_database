<p>Increased expression of the ER membrane acetyl-CoA transporter AT-1 can cause an autism-like phenotype in mice.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>The import of acetyl-CoA into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by AT-1/SLC33A1 regulates Nε-lysine acetylation of ER-resident and -transiting proteins. Specifically, lysine acetylation within the ER appears to influence the efficiency of the secretory pathway by affecting ER-mediated quality control. Mutations or duplications in <italic>AT-1/SLC33A1</italic> have been linked to diseases such as familial spastic paraplegia, developmental delay with premature death, and autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability. In this study, we generated an AT-1 Tg mouse model that selectively overexpresses human AT-1 in neurons. These animals demonstrate cognitive deficits, autistic-like social behavior, aberrations in synaptic plasticity, an increased number of dendritic spines and branches, and widespread proteomic changes. We also found that AT-1 activity regulates acetyl-CoA flux, causing epigenetic modulation of the histone epitope H3K27 and mitochondrial adaptation. In conclusion, our results indicate that increased expression of AT-1 can cause an autistic-like phenotype by affecting key neuronal metabolic pathways.</p>

<body><p>Acetyl-CoA is an essential substrate for a wide range of biochemical reactions that occur within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pietrocola et al., 2015</xref>). Cytosolic acetyl-CoA is produced predominantly by the conversion of citrate and coenzyme A (CoA) by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) and the condensation of free acetate and CoA by acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACESS2, also referred to as AceCS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pehar and Puglielli, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi and Tu, 2015</xref>). Acetyl-CoA is then actively imported into the lumen of the ER by the ER membrane transporter AT-1 (also referred to as SLC33A1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jonas et al., 2010</xref>), where it serves as donor of the acetyl group in the Nε-lysine acetylation of ER-resident and -transiting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choudhary et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pehar et al., 2012b</xref>).</p><p>Recent reports suggest that lysine acetylation within the ER is required for ER-mediated quality control. Specifically, the ER-based acetyltransferases ATase1 and ATase2 associate with the oligosaccharyl transferase complex to acetylate properly folded glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, studies performed with two type I membrane proteins indicate that the acetylation status of nascent secretory proteins in the ER regulates the efficiency of transport along the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costantini et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mak et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Decreased influx of acetyl-CoA into the ER lumen leads to aberrant induction of autophagy in both cell-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jonas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pehar et al., 2012a</xref>) and animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2014</xref>) models. At the mechanistic level, the induction of autophagy is linked to the acetylation status of autophagy-related protein 9A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pehar et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2014</xref>). Haploinsufficiency of AT-1 in the animal results in neurodegeneration, inflammation, and propensity to infections and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2014</xref>). Heterozygous mutations in AT-1 have been identified in patients affected by an autosomal dominant form of spastic paraplegia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2008</xref>), whereas homozygous mutations have been identified in patients affected by severe developmental delay and childhood death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huppke et al., 2012</xref>). Chromosomal duplications affecting the 3q25.31 locus harboring <italic>AT-1/SLC33A1</italic> have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (SFARI Autism Database; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sfari.org/">http://sfari.org/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanders et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prasad et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krumm et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, a gain of ∼1.1–1.5 Mb in 3q25.2-3q25.31, which contained <italic>AT-1/SLC33A1</italic> and <italic>Guanine Monphosphate Synthase</italic> (<italic>GMPS</italic>, associated with myeloid leukemia) was found in three male children with autism, seizure, abnormal electroencephalogram, and facial dysmorphism (Swisshelm, K., et al. 2014. ASHG Annual Meeting; Abstract 3205T).</p><p>In this study, we sought to investigate the consequences of increased AT-1 activity. Specifically, we generated an AT-1 transgenic (Tg) mouse model that selectively overexpresses human AT-1 in neurons. These animals demonstrate cognitive deficits, autistic-like social behavior, aberrations in synaptic plasticity, increased number of dendritic spines and branches, and widespread proteomic changes. The synaptic phenotype appears to be caused by increased trafficking of nascent proteins along the secretory pathway. In addition, we found that AT-1 Tg animals display increased expression of mitochondrial enzymes related to acetyl-CoA production, suggesting that increased movement of acetyl-CoA into the ER causes downstream compensatory mechanisms in mitochondrial activity. Furthermore, this apparent mitochondrial adaptation appears to be driven by changes in the acetylation/methylation status of Lys27 on the histone protein H3 suggesting that this site acts as a sensor to adapt supply of citrate from the mitochondria to rapidly compensate for changes in cytosolic acetyl-CoA, as induced by increased AT-1 activity.</p><p>In conclusion, our results indicate that increased expression of AT-1 can cause an autistic-like phenotype by affecting key neuronal metabolic pathways.</p><sec id="s01" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s02"><title>AT-1 Tg animals display cognitive deficits and autistic-like behaviors</title><p>To explore the role of AT-1 in the brain, we generated Tg mice with an inducible neuron-specific overexpression Tet-Off system driven by the CamK2 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). For the purpose of this study, the animals (referred to as AT-1 Tg) were maintained in the absence of doxycycline (Dox); as such, they overexpressed human AT-1 during development, as well as after birth. Direct assessment of both mRNA and protein levels in neurons isolated from the adult brain confirmed successful up-regulation of AT-1 in Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B–D</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>AT-1 Tg mice selectively overexpress AT-1 in forebrain neurons.</bold> (A) AT-1 Tg mice were generated with an inducible neuron-specific overexpression Tet-Off system driven by the CamK2 promoter.

We found that AT-1 Tg animals displayed significant deficits in each of these hippocampus-dependent tasks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A–F</xref>). Specifically, we observed significant impairments in contextual FC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>) and NOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). The animals did not display differences in freezing behavior during the initial exposure to the behavior arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, Training) and did not display increased anxiety in the open field test (unpublished data). In the NOR test, WT mice spent &gt;40% of their total investigation time exploring the novel object, whereas AT-1 Tg mice displayed no preference for the novel object relative to the trained objects. During the training phase of the MWM task, Tg mice had a significantly higher escape latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>) and swam greater distances before locating the hidden platform than WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>).

We found that Tg mice displayed decreased repetitive behavior in the marble burying task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>) and failed to show a preference for investigating the novel mouse in the social preference paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>). These tests indicate aberrations in repetitive behavior and social tendencies, suggesting that our Tg mouse line shares similarities with behavioral models of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gkogkas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kouser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dere et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lugo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pucilowska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Speed et al., 2015</xref>). To assess whether the aforementioned behavioral changes were solely the result of developmental events, we also generated AT-1 Tg mice in the presence of Dox to repress expression of the transgene. The Dox was suspended at weaning and the animals were analyzed 6 mo later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>).

Although they are involved in different biochemical and cellular functions, STRING analysis revealed that the great majority of them are tightly related to synaptic plasticity (unpublished data), thus highlighting the significance of these proteins for our observed phenotype.</p><p>We recently reported that the ER-based acetyltransferases, ATase1 and ATase2, associate with the oligosaccharyl transferase complex to acetylate correctly folded glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2014</xref>). Studies conducted with two type I membrane glycoproteins suggest that Nε-lysine acetylation might regulate efficiency of transport along the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costantini et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mak et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate whether increased influx of acetyl-CoA into the ER lumen can indeed cause global changes in the efficiency of transport in the secretory pathway, we used human neuroglioma (H4) cells overexpressing AT-1. Cells were labeled with azide-modified mannosamine (ManNAz), which is metabolically incorporated into sialic acid–containing glycoproteins while they traffic through the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laughlin and Bertozzi, 2007</xref>). Sialic acid is the last sugar to be attached to the oligosaccharide chain; both the Golgi-membrane cytidine monophosphate-sialic acid transporter and the Golgi-resident sialyltransferase are located in the trans-Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hirschberg et al., 1998</xref>). Only nascent glycoproteins that have successfully reached the trans-Golgi can be sialylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hirschberg et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, ManNAz can specifically determine efficiency of trafficking of newly synthesized glycoproteins. The results show a dramatic increase in the levels of nascent glycoproteins as a result of AT-1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). To account for possible changes in protein translation, we also labeled cells with O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP), an alkyne analogue of puromycin that incorporates into newly translated proteins. The results revealed a significant increase in rate of protein biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). However, normalization of ManNAz (rate of transport) and OPP (rate of biosynthesis) labeling still showed increased delivery of secretory glycoproteins to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). Importantly, OPP incorporation does not discriminate between secretory and nonsecretory proteins, whereas ManNAz does. Therefore, we can conclude that although increased translation can partially account for the increased levels of secretory proteins in AT-1 Tg mice, increased efficiency of transport along the secretory pathway is likely to play a major role. To support the studies conducted with ManNAz, we also determined levels of cell-surface biotinylated proteins. Again, we found a significant increase in AT-1–overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>). Using a cell-impermeable reagent to biotinylate primary amines can be used as a reliable readout of steady-state levels of cell-surface proteins. Biotin labeling does not visualize secreted proteins or proteins that localize to intracellular organelles (i.e.; Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, etc.). Therefore, in contrast to ManAz labeling, it underestimates the efficiency of the secretory pathway. However, the biotin read-out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>) is consistent with the ManAz results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Finally, to confirm the aforementioned conclusions, we also determined ManNAz incorporation in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) generated from AT-1<sup>S113R/+</sup> mice. AT-1<sub>S113R</sub> is a mutant version of AT-1 associated with a familial form of spastic paraplegia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2008</xref>) and is deficient in acetyl-CoA transport activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2014</xref>).

It is worth remembering that the ER imports acetyl-CoA from the cytosol and that the cytosolic pool of acetyl-CoA is largely supplied by the conversion of mitochondria-derived citrate into acetyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pehar and Puglielli, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pietrocola et al., 2015</xref>). Given the increased influx of cytosolic acetyl-CoA into the ER lumen, caused by the overexpression of AT-1, we hypothesized that levels of cytosolic acetyl-CoA would be decreased in AT-1 Tg mice, forcing the mitochondria to compensate by generating more citrate for cytosolic conversion. To test this hypothesis, we initially determined acetyl-CoA levels in the cytosol of AT-1–overexpressing H4 cells. The results showed a significant reduction when compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>), supporting the conclusion that the increased flux into the ER lumen is able to affect the cytosolic pool of acetyl-CoA. To assess whether this conclusion could be extended to the in vivo settings, we also analyzed the cytosol recovered from total hippocampal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>), as well as isolated adult cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>) of AT-1 Tg mice. Again, we observed a significant reduction of acetyl-CoA levels when compared with WT mice. Importantly, two crucial proteins that allow cross-talk between mitochondria and cytosolic acetyl-CoA were also found to be up-regulated in our proteomics analysis: the mitochondrial carrier citrate transporter (Slc25a1) and Acly (Table S2). Slc25a1 is the mitochondria membrane transporter that translocates citrate to the cytosol, whereas Acly is a cytosolic-based enzyme that converts mitochondria-derived citrate into acetyl-CoA by using cytosolic CoA and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pehar and Puglielli, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pietrocola et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, Acss2 (also known as AceCS), which contributes to the synthesis of cytosolic acetyl-CoA through the condensation of acetate and CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pehar and Puglielli, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pietrocola et al., 2015</xref>), was not found to be up-regulated (Table S2). It is worth stressing that although both Acly and Acss2 can generate acetyl-CoA, they carry out two different biochemical reactions; they also respond to different inputs and elicit different biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wellen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu et al., 2014</xref>).

The ER-based acetylation machinery requires the membrane transporter AT-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jonas et al., 2010</xref>) and at least two acetyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ko and Puglielli, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Heterozygous and homozygous mutations in <italic>AT-1/SLC33A1</italic> have been identified in patients with familial spastic paraplegia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2008</xref>) and developmental delay/premature death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huppke et al., 2012</xref>), respectively.

The ability of Nε-lysine acetylation to regulate activity and/or levels of modified proteins is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kouzarides, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pehar and Puglielli, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pietrocola et al., 2015</xref>). Both the acetylome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) and the proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>) identified a large set of proteins that are implicated in cellular functions that could immediately explain the Tg mouse phenotype, specifically: neuronal migration and adhesion, neurite outgrowth, transport of synaptic vesicles, assembly of synaptic connections, and regulation of synaptic activity. Therefore, it is conceivable to assume that the increased influx of acetyl-CoA, and consequent changes in the ER acetylome and in the efficiency of the secretory pathway, is the primary cause of ASD-like phenotype.</p><p>The characterization of the AT-1 Tg phenotype also revealed that the animals display decreased levels of cytosolic acetyl-CoA and, as a result, mitochondrial adaptation. This adaptive mechanism appears to be driven by epigenetic changes on H3K27. Importantly, we did not detect widespread epigenetic changes (Table S3). This is likely a result of the compensatory activity of Acly; indeed, silencing of <italic>ACLY</italic> in mammalian cells causes global changes in histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wellen et al., 2009</xref>). Whether the mitochondria adaptation participates in the observed phenotype remains to be fully determined. The fact that genes, such as <italic>SLC13A5</italic> and <italic>ACLY</italic>, which can alter cytosolic levels of acetyl-CoA without affecting mitochondria activity directly, might be linked to ASD (discussed above) would suggest that mitochondria have limited impact. However, genes such as <italic>SLC25A12</italic> and <italic>SLC25A1</italic>, which immediately influence acetyl-CoA production or delivery from the mitochondria, have also been linked to ASD. Therefore, the role of mitochondria might be more complex than expected. It is also possible that cross-talk exists between mitochondria, cytosol, and ER so that either increased supply (from mitochondria and/or cytosol) or movement of acetyl-CoA into the ER lumen causes ASD. In conclusion, the specific role of the mitochondria citrate pathway and of the cytosolic citrate/acetyl-CoA pools in ASD remains to be fully dissected.</p><p>Although increased efficiency of the secretory pathway seems to be logically connected to increased expression of proteins related to synaptic plasticity and learning and memory formation, a majority of proteins identified by mass spectrometry do not insert into the secretory pathway. However, the dramatic increase in dendritic spine and branch formation observed in our animals would require targeted (and secondary) up-regulation of cytosolic and nuclear proteins related to neurite outgrowth. Establishing synaptic densities would also require the activation of cytosolic scaffolding and adaptor proteins that support the structural integrity of the synapse as well as regulate signal transduction pathways. Indeed, our proteomic assessment found significant increase of cytosolic proteins that are involved in different aspects of the aforementioned biological pathways.</p><p>In conclusion, our studies have revealed that both decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2014</xref>) and increased (present study) AT-1 activity affect neuronal biology. In particular, the data shown here have linked increased AT-1 activity to ASD, and elucidated a novel aspect of acetyl-CoA metabolism that affects learning and memory, synaptic plasticity, protein expression, mitochondrial activity, and epigenetics. Further studies are necessary to determine whether changes in AT-1 activity at various points in the lifespan of the mouse will induce significant changes in neuronal morphology and behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s08" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s09"><title>Generation of AT-1 Tg mice</title><p>cDNA encoding human AT-1 was isolated by BamHI and EcoRV digestion from Topo-AT-1 constructs and subcloned into pTRE-Tight vector (Takara Bio Inc.).
