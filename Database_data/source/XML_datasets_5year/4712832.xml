<abstract>
<p>Mechanisms of initial cell fate decisions differ among species. To gain insights into lineage allocation in humans, we derived ten human embryonic stem cell lines (designated UCSFB1-10) from single blastomeres of four 8-cell embryos and one 12-cell embryo from a single couple. Compared with numerous conventional lines from blastocysts, they had unique gene expression and DNA methylation patterns that were, in part, indicative of trophoblast competence. At a transcriptional level, UCSFB lines from different embryos were often more closely related than those from the same embryo. As predicted by the transcriptomic data, immunolocalization of EOMES, T brachyury, GDF15 and active β-catenin revealed differential expression among blastomeres of 8- to 10-cell human embryos. The UCSFB lines formed derivatives of the three germ layers and CDX2-positive progeny, from which we derived the first human trophoblast stem cell line. Our data suggest heterogeneity among early-stage blastomeres and that the UCSFB lines have unique properties, indicative of a more immature state than conventional lines.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>For many reasons, relatively little is known about human preimplantation development. The small number of cells makes embryos of any species difficult to study. In humans, the technical difficulties are compounded by other challenges. Genetic variation among individuals could contribute to developmental differences, a well-appreciated phenomenon in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C11">Dackor et al., 2009</xref>), which is difficult to assess in humans owing to the limited availability of embryos that are donated for research. In mice, culturing embryos leads to changes in gene expression patterns, such as a reduction in the differences between the transcriptomes of the inner cell mass (ICM) and the trophectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C23">Giritharan et al., 2012</xref>). In some countries, government regulations preclude the use of federal funds for research on human embryos and their derivatives, or prohibit this work altogether. Despite these inherent difficulties, there are compelling reasons for studying the molecular underpinnings of human embryogenesis. Assisted reproductive technologies have as their cornerstone <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF) and the subsequent growth of embryos. However, the culture methods are largely based on conditions optimized for mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C49">Quinn, 2012</xref>). Likewise, despite decades of searching for biomarkers, selection of embryos for transfer is largely based on morphological criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C17">Gardner and Schoolcraft, 1999</xref>). Beyond assisted reproductive technologies, methods for generating cells that will be deployed in human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-based therapies will benefit from an understanding of the pathways that govern their genesis.</p>
<p>Human preimplantation development is charted according to several crucial milestones, which are discernable at the light microscopic level. At day 3 postfertilization, the embryo is a solid ball of morphologically similar cells. By day 5, at the early blastocyst stage, segregation of the embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages is first apparent. The trophoblast (TB) cells that form the outer surface of the embryo mediate attachment to the uterine wall and contribute to the placenta. The inner cell mass (ICM) is clustered at one pole of the interior. Prior to the late blastocyst stage, the ICM is partitioned into the flattened hypoblast, the future extra-embryonic endoderm, which is in direct contact with the fluid-filled blastocyst cavity. The epiblast, the source of embryonic precursors, occupies the space between the hypoblast and the TB.</p>
<p>Most of what we know about human preimplantation development, in mechanistic terms, has been inferred from the analogous stages in model organisms. For example, investigators have immunolocalized POU5F1 (POU domain class 5 transcription factor 1; also known as OCT4) and CDX2 (caudal type homeobox 2) in human embryos because gene deletion studies in mice show that these transcription factors are required for formation of the intra- and extra-embryonic lineages, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C44">Nichols et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C55">Strumpf et al., 2005</xref>). In this species, Cdx2 binds to Tcfap2 (Tfap2e – Mouse Genome Informatics) sites in the <italic>Pou5f1</italic> promoter, shutting off transcription. Notably, the promoters of the bovine and human <italic>POU5F1</italic> genes lack these binding sites, suggesting mechanistic differences among species in the first lineage decision, and predicting the divergence of other downstream programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C4">Berg et al., 2011</xref>). In support of this concept, the expression patterns of POU5F1 and CDX2 follow different kinetics in mouse and human embryos with transient co-expression of both factors in some cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C43">Niakan and Eggan, 2012</xref>). Moreover, less than 5% of POU5F1, NANOG and CTCF sites are homologously occupied in human and mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C31">Kunarso et al., 2010</xref>). Researchers are also using global strategies to profile transcriptional activation and gene expression during human embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C64">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C14">Fang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C59">Vassena et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C1">Altmäe et al., 2012</xref>). These data enable <italic>in silico</italic> assembly of pathways that guide crucial developmental transitions. Yet we still lack insights into fundamental aspects of human embryonic and extra-embryonic development, including when and how fate specification occurs. Approaches for directly addressing these questions are limited. hESCs, which are derived from human embryos, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are currently the best models for functional analyses of early developmental processes in our species.</p>
<p>Accordingly, our group has been interested in deriving hESCs from embryos at earlier stages than the blastocysts that are commonly used for this purpose. Previously, in collaborative studies, we reported the derivation of hESC lines from individual blastomeres of early-stage human embryos that went on to form blastocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C9">Chung et al., 2008</xref>). We reasoned that the opposite approach, deriving multiple lines from single cells of individual early-stage human embryos, could give us important insights into the properties of these cells. Here, we report the results of experiments that tested this hypothesis.</p>

<title>hESC derivation from single related blastomeres</title>
<p>This study was designed to determine whether hESCs derived from early-stage embryos had unique properties compared with conventional lines that are typically derived from later-stage blastocysts. As a first step, we established hESC lines from individual blastomeres of five embryos, four at the 8-cell stage and one at the 12-cell stage. One couple donated all the embryos. We removed single cells from each embryo and cultured them in individual drops of medium on human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) feeders in a physiological oxygen environment of 8% O<sub>2</sub> according to published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C9">Chung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C28">Ilic et al., 2009</xref>). Four blastomeres from one embryo, three from another, and single blastomeres from the remaining embryos formed lines, designated UCSFB1-10 (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S1A</uri>). We attributed the derivation of different numbers of lines from different embryos to the technical difficulties involved in blastomere biopsy. Removing single cells from cleavage-stage human embryos requires the application of forces strong enough to remove individual cells, which are tightly adhered to one another.</p>
<p>We used standard methods to characterize the UCSFB hESC lines. Karyotyping showed that 9/10 lines were euploid. One was 46 XX and 8 were 46 XY. The line that was derived from the 12-cell stage embryo (UCSFB10) was tetraploid (92 XXYY) and maintained this chromosome complement through early passages. Aneuploidy of this line could reflect frequently observed genetic mosaicism among the cells of human pre-implantation embryos, which often resolves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C3">Barbash-Hazan et al., 2009</xref>). In the mouse, tetraploid cells segregate to the yolk sac endoderm and TB lineages, whereas diploid cells give rise to the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C41">Nagy et al., 1990</xref>). Although we have no data in this regard, we are interested in their relative potential to form extra-embryonic versus embryonic descendants.</p>
<p>Immunolocalization showed that UCSFB1-9 expressed antigens that are associated with pluripotency: POU5F1, NANOG, TRA-1-60 and SSEA-4 (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S1B</uri>). The nine euploid lines formed embryoid bodies (EBs) that underwent specification of the three germ layers as shown by expression of markers of ectodermal (β-III-tubulin), mesodermal (smooth muscle actin) and endodermal (α-fetoprotein) derivatives (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S1C</uri>). When transplanted in Matrigel plugs under the skin of nude mice, they also formed teratomas that contained cell types representing the three germ lineages (e.g. neuroectoderm, intestinal epithelium, chondrocytes/cartilage and melanocytes; <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S1D</uri>). Thus, as determined by standard measures that are applied to conventional hESCs and iPSCs, UCSFB1-9 were pluripotent.</p>
<p>Next, we explored the potential of a subset of the UCSFB lines to form more mature derivatives of the three embryonic germ layers. With regard to ectoderm, UCSFB5-7 generated neuronal precursors as demonstrated by immunostaining for SOX1, nestin and β-III-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F1">Fig. 1</xref>A). However, only B5 and B6 gave rise to dopaminergic neurons as shown by staining for tyrosine hydroxylase. As to mesoderm, UCSFB6 robustly formed EBs with spontaneous contractile activity; qRT-PCR analyses showed that they differentiated into cells that expressed markers characteristic of embryonic atrial, right and left ventricular, and specialized conduction (nodal) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F1">Fig. 1</xref>B). As to endoderm, UCSFB5-7 robustly formed endocrine precursors and pancreatic endoderm <italic>in vitro</italic> and insulin-producing cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (when transplanted into mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F1">Fig. 1</xref>C). Thus, based on the results shown in <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S1</uri> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F1">Fig. 1</xref>, we concluded that the UCSFB cells met the standard definition of an hESC line.

<title>Blastomere- and blastocyst-derived hESCs differ at the transcriptional level</title>
<p>To determine if there were transcriptional variations among blastomere and conventionally derived hESCs, we compared the transcriptomes of two biological replicates of UCSFB1-9 to those of 228 samples from 72 conventional hESC lines that were generated on the same microarray platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C42">Nazor et al., 2012</xref>). Initially, we plotted sample relationships in a 3D principal component analysis (PCA) matrix according to all detected autosomal mRNA probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F2">Fig. 2</xref>A, left PCA matrix). In this analysis, Euclidean distance measures were used to connect each sample to its two nearest neighbors, forcing each UCSFB sample to choose at least one nearest neighbor other than its corresponding biological replicate. UCSFB1-9 formed a distinct cluster without nearest neighbor edges drawn between these lines and those derived by conventional means. To test the stability of this clustering, we performed an unsupervised, variance-based reduction to the most variable probes on the array with the threshold set at 50% or 20% and repeated this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F2">Fig. 2</xref>A, middle and right PCA plots, respectively). The results showed that the robust separation of UCSFB cells from conventional hESC lines was maintained. Thus, we sought to explore the molecular bases of differences between pluripotent cells derived from blastomeres and blastocysts.

</p>
<p>Two major expression patterns emerged from the 1544 mRNAs that were differentially expressed by ≥1.5-fold (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) between the UCSFB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F2">Fig. 2</xref>B, yellow shaded portion of the cluster) and conventional hESC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F2">Fig. 2</xref>B, blue shaded portion of the cluster; <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Table S3A</uri>). First, approximately half of the mRNAs were uniformly highly expressed in the UCSFB lines relative to &gt;75% of the conventional hESCs. Conversely, a roughly equal number of mRNAs were strictly repressed in the UCSFB lines, but highly expressed in a majority of the conventional hESC lines. Functional enrichments were determined for these gene sets using the Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C38">McLean et al., 2010</xref>). The subset of mRNAs with elevated expression in the UCSFB lines was most highly enriched for genes expressed by trophoblasts, the ectoplacental cone (polar trophectoderm of the mouse) or involved in metabolism, particularly cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F2">Fig. 2</xref>C; <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Table S3B</uri>). These enrichments were paralleled by a striking reduction in UCSFB expression of mRNAs encoding components of pyrimidine salvage pathways, glycosylation, insulin-like growth factor family members, fibrin clot dissolution and genes that function during developmental/morphogenic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F2">Fig. 2</xref>C; <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Table S3B</uri>). Thus, a subset of the pathways that were upregulated in the UCSFB lines functioned in trophoblast and those that were differentially expressed by conventional lines pointed to the initiation of differentiation processes.</p>
<p>Of the conventional lines, 15 were more similar to the UCSFB hESCs, separated by a single bifurcation in the array tree dendrogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F2">Fig. 2</xref>B, light blue shaded portion of the cluster). Nevertheless, 953/1544 transcripts from the overall analysis were significantly differentially expressed (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) between the blastomere-derived cells and this subset of blastocyst-derived lines (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S2A</uri>; <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Table S3C</uri>). Of the 498 transcripts that were upregulated in the UCSFB lines, mRNAs associated with trophoblasts and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways continued to be the most significant (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S2B</uri>; <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Table S3D</uri>). This analysis also revealed higher expression of mRNAs encoding organelle and plasma membrane components, possibly reflecting the importance of assembling the cellular machinery in cleavage-stage embryos. <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S2C</uri> is a heatmap of the 50 most significantly upregulated UCSFB transcripts in this smaller comparison. Of the 455 mRNAs that were downregulated in the UCSFB lines, ∼10% encode gene products that are expressed in mitochondria. The others function in signaling pathways (<italic>IL1A</italic>, <italic>TNF</italic>, <italic>TCRB</italic>, <italic>NGFR</italic>, <italic>FAS</italic> and <italic>NTRK1</italic>). <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S2D</uri> is a heatmap of the 50 most significantly upregulated conventional hESC transcripts in this smaller comparison. Thus, we concluded that the UCSFB lines had significantly different transcriptomes compared with conventional hESCs.</p>

<title>Gene expression classifier for single blastomere-derived hESCs</title>
<p>Given the robust transcriptional differences between conventional hESCs and the UCSFB lines, we developed an unbiased classifier for the latter cells. For this analysis, we incorporated an additional 88 gene expression profiles of conventional hESCs from another microarray platform (Illumina HT12v4). We used half of these data to train the model and the other half for testing. The Naïve Bayes classifier we developed had an accuracy of 98.3% (sensitivity=91.7%, specificity=97.9%). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F2">Fig. 2</xref>D shows the mRNA expression patterns of 23 genes that contributed to this model. Several have interesting functions with potentially important roles in early development.

<title>Blastomere- and blastocyst-derived hESCs differ at the methylome level</title>
<p>DNA methylation, a powerful epigenetic mechanism to regulate gene expression, can be indicative of a cell's developmental history and functional maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C26">Hemberger and Pedersen, 2010</xref>). Using the Illumina Infinium 450 K DNA Methylation BeadChip platform, we investigated whether the observed transcriptional differences among the UCSFB and conventional lines were paralleled by distinct DNA methylation patterns. We profiled UCSFB5-7, which were derived from the same embryo, and compared them to a panel of 46 DNA samples from 21 conventional hESC lines. When sample relationships were plotted in a 3D-PCA matrix according to cytosine methylation, the UCSFB samples clustered at one extreme of the distribution without nearest neighbor edges drawn between these lines and those derived by conventional means (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F3">Fig. 3</xref>A). <italic>In toto</italic>, we identified 2271 cytosines that were hypomethylated and 1235 that were hypermethylated in the UCSFB lines relative to the conventional hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F3">Fig. 3</xref>B; <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Table S4A</uri>). In agreement with the functional enrichments observed for gene expression, the hypomethylated CpGs were in chromosomal locations that are highly enriched for trophoblast/placental genes and early embryonic differentiation processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F3">Fig. 3</xref>C; <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Table S4B</uri>). The functional categories included spongiotrophoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F3">Fig. 3</xref>D), cytoplasmic organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F3">Fig. 3</xref>E) and blastoderm segmentation/embryo axis formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F3">Fig. 3</xref>F). The hypermethylated CpGs in the UCSFB lines relative to conventional lines were in gene regions that are involved in peripheral immune tolerance, specifically PD-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F3">Fig. 3</xref>G) and ZAP70 signaling (data not shown). Repression of these pathways is consistent with the need to block maternal immune rejection of the hemi-allogeneic embryo, a function that is largely attributed to the placental trophoblasts that directly interface with uterine cells and maternal blood.

<p>As with the transcriptomic data, some of the conventional lines had methylation patterns that were more similar to the UCSFB cells than others. A retrospective analysis showed that they were the lines that were derived in physiological hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C7">Bradley et al., 2010</xref>), the strategy we used for the single blastomere derivations. Nevertheless, the lines from the two sources had significantly different methylation patterns at 33% of the loci from the overall comparison (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S3A</uri>; <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Table S4C</uri>).

In this more restricted analysis, functional enrichments for hypomethylated cytosines in UCSFB5-7 were in gene regions that controlled trophoblast/placental differentiation and regulation of BMP signaling (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S3C</uri>; <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Table S4D</uri>). These results suggested that the UCSFB lines had not silenced crucial determinants of embryonic and extra-embryonic development.</p>
<p>Previously, we showed that aberrant genomic imprinting was widespread across a large panel of hESCs and human iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C42">Nazor et al., 2012</xref>). A comparison of the UCSFB and conventional lines showed that the differentially methylated cytosines were associated with <italic>H19</italic>, <italic>MEG3</italic> and <italic>PEG3</italic>, which are most frequently aberrantly imprinted in hESCs and human iPSCs (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S3D</uri>, <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Table S4A</uri>). With the exception of aberrant methylation of <italic>PEG3</italic> in one of the nine UCSFB lines, the methylation status of nearly all the known imprinted regions was consistent with the normal hemi-methylated state that is observed in human tissues and primary cell cultures. In addition, a number of imprinted genes were also differentially expressed between the UCSFB and conventional hESCs (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Table S3A</uri>). For example, <italic>DLX5</italic>, <italic>GLIS3</italic>, <italic>CPA4</italic>, <italic>H19</italic>, <italic>OSBPL5</italic> and <italic>DLK1</italic> were expressed at significantly lower levels in the UCSFB lines, whereas <italic>SNORD108<italic>,</italic> PEG3</italic>, <italic>PEG10</italic>, <italic>MEG3</italic> and <italic>NNAT</italic> were expressed at higher levels (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S3E</uri>).

Plotting the distribution of Beta Values for conventional hESCs and UCSFB5-7, showed that the significance of differential methylation increased as a function of CpG density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F4">Fig. 4</xref>A, left). Unlike CpG methylation, which is symmetrical on both DNA strands, CpH methylation is asymmetric and decreases with differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C32">Laurent et al., 2010</xref>). CpH methylation was significantly lower in conventional hESCs versus the blastomere-derived lines and was restricted to regions of low CpG density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F4">Fig. 4</xref>A, right).

<title>Variations in gene expression among blastomere-derived hESCs</title>
<p>There is growing evidence of blastomere heterogeneity starting as early as the 4-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C10">Condic, 2014</xref>). Thus, we asked whether there were differences among the transcriptomes of the UCSFB lines, which were established at the 8-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F5">Fig. 5</xref>A; color-coded by embryo of origin). To answer this question, we performed an ANOVA analysis, which identified 3620 transcripts that were differentially expressed (FC≥1.5, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01; <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Table S5A</uri>). Next, we performed weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) of these transcripts, which identified four covariant gene clusters (modules 1-4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F5">Fig. 5</xref>B; <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Table S5B</uri>). Hierarchical clustering of the UCSFB samples showed that, in some cases, lines that were established from different embryos were more closely related than lines that were derived from the same embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F5">Fig. 5</xref>B; <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Table S5A</uri>). Subsets of the 72 conventional lines expressed portions of these modules, but not the entire transcriptional program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F5">Fig. 5</xref>C).
<fig id="DEV122846F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Gene expression patterns diverged among the UCSFB lines.</bold> (A) The UCSFB lines were derived from embryos that were donated by one couple.

(B) An ANOVA analysis (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, fold change ≥1.5) comparing the transcriptomes of the UCSFB lines identified 3620 mRNAs as differentially expressed. The heatmap was created by plotting the results from weighted gene correlation network analysis according to rank. Four covariant gene expression modules emerged. As shown in <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S4</uri>, they included transcripts encoding genes involved in: (module 1) the cell cycle and cholesterol biosynthesis; (module 2) MYC targets and cell type-specific pathways; (module 3) hypoxia responses, glucose metabolism and catabolic responses; (module 4) extra-embryonic development and migration. (C) A heatmap of expression data for the same genes from 72 conventional lines revealed hESCs with portions of these modules, but not the entire program. B, blastomere; E, embryo.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="develop-142-122846-g5"></graphic></fig>
</p>
<p>Analysis of the genes within each module showed that they were involved in many fundamental processes and pathways (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S4</uri>, <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Table S5C</uri>). In module 1, we observed differential expression of mRNAs encoding: (1) cell cycle, mitotic and transcriptional regulators; (2) genes involved in cholesterol metabolism; (3) SOX2 targets in hESCs and genes downregulated by CD5. Module 2 was enriched in MYC targets and transcripts of specific cell types, including keratinocytes, fibroblasts and hematopoietic stem cells. Module 3 was unique in the abundance of mRNAs that encoded components of catabolic pathways and glucose metabolism. Module 4 was enriched in transcripts that play a role in migration and amino acid transport. Among the modules, divergence in transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and WNT signaling pathways was apparent. Likewise, modules 3 and 4 were distinguished by transcripts with opposite patterns of E-cadherin (cadherin 1) regulation, increasing or decreasing in expression, respectively. We also noted that certain functions were apportioned across multiple modules. For example, modules 1-3 had mRNAs encoding different elements of hypoxia response pathways, which in some cases, had diametric actions. Modules 1 and 4 were enriched in transcripts that control different aspects of extra-embryonic development. Every module contained mRNAs that have been implicated in specific early differentiation programs that were, for the most part, unique to that module. Thus, the UCSFB lines differed in their expression of transcripts that are thought to play important roles during early development.</p>
<p>For seven of the lines, a subset of the data was confirmed by qRT-PCR, which showed, in all cases, concordance with the microarray results and confirmed differences in mRNA levels among the lines (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S5</uri>).

Together, these data showed significant differences in gene expression patterns among the lines that could have important consequences in terms of differential responses to physiological hypoxia, cell-cell adhesion and metabolic shifts.

Likewise, anti-GDF15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F6">Fig. 6</xref>G-I; mapped in <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S6C</uri>) reacted with only a subset of the blastomere nuclei. Additionally, this growth factor was detected in the cytoplasm with the strongest staining at the periphery. An antibody that recognized active β-catenin (ABC) strongly stained a majority of the nuclei with the others displaying weaker immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F6">Fig. 6</xref>J-L; mapped in <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S6D</uri>). As expected, ABC also localized to the plasma membranes. Together, these results suggested that differences in gene expression among single blastomere-derived hESCs reflected differences in protein expression among blastomeres of early-stage human embryos.

<title>Derivation and characterization of a human trophoblast stem cell line</title>
<p>Genes controlling extra-embryonic/trophoblast development were differentially expressed/hypomethylated in the UCSFB lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F2">Figs 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F3">3</xref>) and <italic>PEG3</italic>, which is highly expressed in TBs, was hemi-methylated as in the placenta (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S3D</uri>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C27">Hiby et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, we investigated their TB potential by forming EBs from UCSFB5-7 or control WA09 hESCs. At day 3, immunostaining of UCSFB-derived EBs for POU5F1 showed that expression was limited to a few cells at the center. Towards the periphery, loss of immunoreactivity was accompanied by a striking upregulation of nuclear CDX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F7">Fig. 7</xref>A). Staining for cytokeratin 7 (KRT7; also known as CK7), a TB antigen, was upregulated in the same areas as CDX2 expression was downregulated, suggesting differentiation of that lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F7">Fig. 7</xref>B). At days 3 and 5, conditioned medium (CM) from the three UCSFB lines contained higher levels of human chorionic gonadotropin than CM of WA09 cells, with UCSFB6 secreting the highest amount (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S7A</uri>). This result was in accord with the qRT-PCR analyses. Compared with the other three lines, UCSFB6 had the highest levels of mRNAs encoding the trophoblast markers CDX2, KRT7 and hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin β; also known as CGB) (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S7B</uri>)<italic>.</italic> Immunoanalyses of UCSFB6 EBs at day 6 showed that the cultures contained cells with the antigenic profile of human TB progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C20">Genbacev et al., 2011</xref>). They expressed GCM1 (glial cells missing homolog 1), HMGA2 (high mobility group AT-hook 2), GATA3 (GATA binding protein 3) and GDF15 (growth and differentiation factor 15; <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S7C-F</uri>). We also observed multinucleated cells, indicative of syncytiotrophoblast (STB) formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F7">Fig. 7</xref>C) and mononuclear cells that migrated away from the EBs, consistent with generation of extravillous/invasive cytotrophoblasts (CTBs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F7">Fig. 7</xref>D). UCSFB6 formed the highest number of TB outgrowths, sometimes covering nearly the entire plate; WA09 formed very few. Therefore, we concluded that UCSFB6 robustly formed TBs.
<fig id="DEV122846F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 7.</label><caption><p><bold>UCSFB6 EBs spontaneously formed CDX2-positive cells, which gave rise to human trophoblast stem cells.</bold> (A) By day 3, adherent EBs produced large outgrowths in which downregulation of POU5F1 (OCT4) was associated with upregulation of CDX2 expression in a nuclear pattern. (B) Cells at the periphery of outgrowths that no longer expressed CDX2 stained with anti-KRT7, a trophoblast antigen. (C) In some areas of the outgrowths, phase contrast microscopy revealed cells that appeared to have fused (arrow), consistent with a syncytiotrophoblast identity. (D) Other areas of the outgrowths were composed of mononuclear cells with membrane projections indicative of migration, a property of invasive cytotrophoblasts. (E) Areas corresponding to the CDX2-positive outgrowths (shown in A) were manually dissected and propagated under conditions that enabled derivation of human trophoblast progenitors from the chorion (see Materials and Methods). A phase contrast image of the cultures at p11 showed a mononuclear population. (F) Plating of the cells at either p11 or p14 showed that they grew at a consistent rate. (G-I) In an undifferentiated state, they exhibited nuclear staining for transcription factors that drive a trophoblast fate: TEAD4, CDX2 and GEMININ. (J-M) They also immunostained, in a nuclear pattern, for GATA3, ELF5, EOMES and GCM1, transcription factors that are required at later stages of trophoblast differentiation. (N-Q) The cells expressed other stem cell and trophoblast markers including HMGA2, LIFR, GDF15 and LGR5.

</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether we could derive human trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) from UCSFB6 EBs. At day 3, cells in the outgrowths, corresponding to the CDX2-positive areas shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F7">Fig. 7</xref>A, were manually dissected and cultured using the method we devised for establishing lines of TB progenitors from the human placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C20">Genbacev et al., 2011</xref>). The morphology of the cells at passage (p) 11 as seen by phase contrast microscopy is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F7">Fig. 7</xref>E and their growth characteristics at p11 and p14 are graphed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F7">Fig. 7</xref>F. With regard to their antigenic phenotype, the cells expressed a wide array of factors that are required for proper placentation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C51">Roberts and Fisher, 2011</xref>). In this regard, they immunostained, in a nuclear pattern, for transcription factors that are required for generation of the trophoblast lineage (TEAD4, CDX2 and geminin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F7">Fig. 7</xref>G-I) or that are required at later stages of trophoblast differentiation (GATA3, ELF5, EOMES and GCM1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F7">Fig. 7</xref>J-M). The nuclei expressed other stem cell and trophoblast markers including HMGA2, LIFR, GDF15 and LGR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F7">Fig. 7</xref>N-Q). They also displayed nuclear expression of the active form of β-catenin, which is required for the generation of implantation-competent trophoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F7">Fig. 7</xref>R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C162">Xie et al., 2008</xref>). However, the CDX2-positive cells failed to co-express T (data not shown). When conventional hESCs are treated with BMP4 they form progeny that express both markers, which are thought to be either extra-embryonic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C5">Bernardo et al., 2011</xref>) or trophoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C52">Roberts et al., 2014</xref>). With rigorous manual dissection, the cells were propagated for 20 passages without changing their antigen profile. Thus, we concluded that the phenotype of these cells was consistent with a TSC identity.</p>
<p>Finally, we were interested in their ability to form the mature trophoblast cell types of the human placenta. When the cells were plated on a thin coating of Matrigel, which stimulates CTB migration, phase contrast microscopy showed that they extended processes that were consistent with cell movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F8">Fig. 8</xref>A), which was confirmed by videomicroscopy (data not shown). They continued to express KRT7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F8">Fig. 8</xref>B) and immunostained for integrin α1, which is required for their movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F8">Fig. 8</xref>C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C65">Zhou et al., 1993</xref>). We also plated the cells on a thick Matrigel plug atop a Transwell filter, which enables trophoblast invasion. Under these conditions, they formed aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F8">Fig. 8</xref>D) that generated invasive cells, which traversed the filter pores to reach the underside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F8">Fig. 8</xref>E). The invasive cells upregulated the expression of the MHC class 1b molecule HLA-G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F7">Fig. 7</xref>F). Among all normal human cells, expression of this antigen is limited to chorionic and invasive extravillous CTBs as well as amniocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C39">McMaster et al., 1995</xref>). They also executed the integrin α6→α1 switch that accompanies TB invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F8">Fig. 8</xref>G; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C12">Damsky et al., 1994</xref>). Finally, the cells upregulated the expression of VE-cadherin (cadherin 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F8">Fig. 8</xref>H) and VCAM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F8">Fig. 8</xref>I) as do invasive CTBs <italic>in situ</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, part of the unique differentiation program in which they execute an epithelial-to-endothelial phenotypic switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C66">Zhou et al., 1997</xref>).
<fig id="DEV122846F8" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 8.</label><caption><p><bold>UCSFB6-derived human trophoblast stem cells formed the mature cell types that carry out the specialized functions of the human placenta.</bold> (A) Upon differentiation, the TSCs formed mononuclear invasive cytotrophoblasts. When they were plated on a thin coating of Matrigel, phase contrast microscopy showed numerous lamellipodia, a feature of migrating cells. (B,C) As the cells moved, they continued to express cytokeratin (KRT7) and upregulated integrin α1, which is required for this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C65">Zhou et al., 1993</xref>). (D) Plating the differentiating TSCs on a Matrigel plug on top of a Transwell filter promoted their aggregation, which was visualized by phase contract microscopy. This behavior mirrors that of primary cytotrophoblasts when they are plated under the same conditions. (E) The aggregates gave rise to invasive cytotrophoblasts that penetrated the Matrigel and migrated through the filter pores to the underside, where numerous KRT7-positive processes were visible (arrows). (F) The invasive cytotrophoblasts immunostained for HLA-G. Among all normal human cells, expression of this MHC class Ib molecule is limited to this trophoblast subpopulation.

(H,I) The cytotrophoblasts executed the unusual epithelial-to-endothelial transition that accompanies invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C66">Zhou et al., 1997</xref>), exemplified by the upregulated expression of VE cadherin and VCAM1.

</p>
<p>The TSCs also formed multinucleated STBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F8">Fig. 8</xref>J). Fusion was demonstrated by staining the cells with anti-ezrin, which confirmed the absence of plasma membranes between the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F8">Fig. 8</xref>K). We also correlated DAPI staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F8">Fig. 8</xref>L) with ploidy by using a method that was developed for analysis of mouse trophoblast giant cells, which undergo endoreduplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C118">Gasperowicz et al., 2013</xref>). The results showed that a substantial subpopulation of the cells were hyperdiploid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F8">Fig. 8</xref>M), another unusual feature of trophoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C60">Weier et al., 2005</xref>), which they share with megakaryocytes, cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C34">Leslie, 2014</xref>). Both mononuclear and multinuclear cells stained for human chorionic gonadotropin and human placental lactogen (CSH1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F8">Fig. 8</xref>N,O). Upon differentiation, the cells failed to express either SOX17 or FOXA2 (data not shown), features of the extra-embryonic mesoderm progeny of BMP4-treated hESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C5">Bernardo et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, we derived TSCs from UCSFB6, suggesting that this line formed embryonic and extra-embryonic derivatives.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Fundamental questions about preimplantation development remain. In many species, cell fate is tied to spatial orientation: blastomeres on the embryo's outer surface polarize and become trophectoderm, whereas those on the inside assume an ICM fate. Functional dichotomies are evident even earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C10">Condic, 2014</xref>). Single blastomeres of 2-cell, but not 4-cell, mouse embryos can generate an entire animal. Yet, up to the 8-cell stage, a blastomere can contribute to every cell and organ of the mouse. Thus, fate is restricted long before the blastocyst stage (70-100 cells) when TEAD4 and CDX2 specify TE allocation, and geminin, among other molecules, is required for ICM formation. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We reasoned that hESC lines derived from single blastomeres of cleavage-stage embryos might have unique properties that could, in comparison to hESCs derived from later-stage embryos, give us insights into the pathways involved.</p>
<p>Previous reports of hESCs derived from single blastomeres of 4- or 8-cell-stage human embryos described their similarities to conventional lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C29">Klimanskaya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C9">Chung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C22">Giritharan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C16">Galan et al., 2013</xref>). Our study design, which entailed analyses of nine genetically related/identical UCSFB lines, revealed their unique properties. As we had originally hypothesized, the differences were probably due to the fact that each founding cell was removed from an early cleavage-stage embryo, which is in contrast to conventional lines, which are derived by plating intact blastocysts and waiting days to weeks until hESC colonies appear. By contrast, the UCSFB lines were derived from blastomeres that began dividing immediately, rapidly forming colonies without going through formation of an epiblast-like structure, the proposed origin of lines generated from intact blastocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C46">O'Leary et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, they were not subject to signals from other cell types that were transiently present in the cultures. Thus, we expected their transcriptomes and methylomes to reflect their unique origins.</p>
<p>Compared with hESCs derived from intact blastocysts, the UCSFB lines had a distinct transcriptome that was enriched in genes involved in trophoblast/ectoplacental cone pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F2">Fig. 2</xref>C), our first indication that these cells might have trophoblast potential. The blastomere-derived lines were also enriched for components of cholesterol metabolism, possibly underscoring the importance of rapid plasma membrane assembly during early embryo development. Conversely, the conventional lines upregulated the expression of genes that are involved in myriad morphogenic and developmental processes, suggesting the relatively naïve state of the blastomere-derived lines. The finding that conventional hESCs have initiated fate specification aligns with the concept that ESCs derived from blastocysts contain cells in various metastable states, biasing them for differentiation along certain lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C24">Graf and Stadtfeld, 2008</xref>). This phenomenon has been attributed to fluctuating <italic>Nanog</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C35">MacArthur et al., 2012</xref>). We hypothesize that the genes that comprise these upregulated pathways offer glimpses into the mechanisms that progressively restrict fate during embryogenesis.</p>
<p>Consistent with the transcriptomic data, the UCSFB lines were relatively hypomethylated in gene regions that are involved in (spongio)trophoblast differentiation and basic cellular processes that are crucial to early development, including cytoplasmic organization, blastoderm segmentation and embryo axis formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The hypomethylated CpGs were significantly enriched for associations with genes that are highly expressed in extra-embryonic cell types, including HLA-G and PEG3. Likewise, the gene region near ELF5, which enforces transcriptional networks that define an epigenetically regulated stem cell compartment in the human placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C26">Hemberger and Pedersen, 2010</xref>), was also hypomethylated (data not shown). Conversely, conventional hESCs were hypermethylated at several loci, including CpGs in the proximity of <italic>HDAC4</italic>, <italic>SHH</italic>, <italic>SOX1</italic>, <italic>POU5F1</italic>, <italic>BMP7</italic>, <italic>IMPACT</italic> and <italic>LIF</italic>.</p>
<p>Comparing the transcriptomes of the UCSFB hESCs showed differences among the lines, even those established from the same embryo. These included variations in the levels of mRNAs that encode fate determinants, such as <italic>FOXA1</italic>, <italic>EOMES</italic>, <italic>T</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic> (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S5</uri>), and in major signaling pathways, including WNT (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S4</uri>). We were interested in whether or not these observations were indicative of similar differences in expression of these molecules, at the protein level, among blastomeres of 8- to 10-cell-stage embryos. Immunolocalization of EOMES, T, GDF15 and active β-catenin showed this to be the case. This finding has several implications. EOMES immunolocalizes to all nuclei of preimplantation mouse embryos up to the blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C37">McConnell et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, as discussed for POU5F1 in the introduction, this is another example of species-specific differences, between mouse and human, in the expression of fate determinants during the early embryonic period. What do the EOMES, T, GDF15 and active β-catenin immunostaining patterns signify? Although we cannot draw definitive conclusions from our data, these results could indicate that cells expressing these transcription factors have begun to assume fates that are consistent with the pathways they regulate (see below). It may follow that the UCSFB lines that have the highest expression of these factors will be most useful for modeling these lineages. Whether other transcripts that are differentially expressed among the lines are also differentially expressed, at the protein level, among human blastomeres is an interesting question that we are exploring.</p>
<p>Beyond differences in mRNA and protein levels, weighted gene correlation network analysis revealed very interesting findings, for example, in the case of mRNAs encoding gene products that are involved in hypoxia responses. Although <italic>HIF1A</italic> mRNA levels were higher in the UCSFB cells compared with conventional hESCs, they were not significantly different among the blastomere-derived lines. However, HIF1α targets showed substantial variations. Module 1 of the differentially expressed transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F5">Fig. 5</xref>; <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S4</uri>) included genes that are downregulated upon HIF1α overexpression and module 3 included transcripts that are downregulated following HIF1α knockdown. This suggested the possible divergence of HIF1α-mediated O<sub>2</sub> responses among blastomeres and the lines they generated. Whether or not this observation is related to our previous finding that physiological hypoxia differentially promotes trophoblast expansion remains to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C18">Genbacev et al., 1997</xref>). Likewise, genes downstream of <italic>CD5</italic> were under negative regulation in module 1 and positive regulation in module 4. Thus, we have evidence of differences in the lines at transcriptional and pathway levels that may be useful for exploring theories regarding the hierarchy of molecules that regulate early developmental decisions in humans.</p>
<p>Some of the most compelling evidence that the transcriptomic and methylation signatures of the UCSFB lines correlated with differences in their potential came from experiments in which we used directed differentiation protocols to compare the ability of UCSFB5-7 (derived from a single embryo) to form dopaminergic neurons, cardiomyocytes and pancreatic endocrine precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F1">Fig. 1</xref>A-C). From the results we concluded that the UCSFB lines, as a group, had the same developmental potential as conventional hESCs in terms of forming the embryonic cell types we explored. However, differences in potential among the lines were also apparent. UCSFB7 failed to form dopaminergic neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F1">Fig. 1</xref>A) and, upon transplantation, endocrine precursors formed from UCSFB6 produced fewer insulin-secreting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F1">Fig. 1</xref>C). These conclusions were reinforced by the results of parallel experiments in which we studied the unusual ability, compared with conventional hESC lines, of EBs formed from UCSFB5-7 to form trophoblast spontaneously. This is in agreement with a previous report describing derivation of mouse TSC lines from blastomeres of early-stage embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C8">Chung et al., 2006</xref>). Initial analyses of UCSFB5-7 showed that UCSFB6 secreted the most hCG (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S7A</uri>) and expressed the highest levels of mRNAs encoding the trophoblast markers CDX2, KRT7 and hCG (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S7B</uri>). This was in keeping with the fact that UCSFB6 highly expressed module 4 transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DEV122846F5">Fig. 5</xref>), which were enriched for extra-embryonic networks (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S4D</uri>). Consistent with these results, UCSFB6 was the most efficient in terms of yielding trophoblast stem cell lines. Thus, these experiments provided evidence that the developmental history of a blastomere-derived line, reflected at transcriptomic and methylation levels, influenced its plasticity <italic>in vitro</italic> as shown by differences in the ability to form embryonic and extra-embryonic descendants.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first report of the derivation of a human TSC line. Although BMP4 may induce conventional hESCs to form trophoblasts, the cells, which are terminally differentiated, cannot be propagated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C62">Xu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C2">Amita et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, this new model will enable a detailed exploration of the mechanisms of human TSC self-renewal and the pathways that generate the mature CTBs and STBs that populate the placenta in normal pregnancy. We also think that this model will be very useful for exploring the etiology of pregnancy complications that are associated with aberrations in trophoblast differentiation.</p>
<p>We considered our findings in the context of the major theories of lineage allocation during embryogenesis; namely, stochastic patterning, related to the regulative capacity of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C61">Wennekamp and Hiiragi, 2012</xref>) and pre-patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C63">Zernicka-Goetz, 2011</xref>). The latter theory predicts that prior to allocation of cells to either the inside or outer surface of the embryo there is heterogeneity in gene expression among the component cells. Supporting evidence has been accumulating from studies of mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C47">Piotrowska-Nitsche et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C6">Bischoff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C48">Plachta et al., 2011</xref>). A recent analysis that used a noninvasive, heritable, multicolor lineage-tracing strategy to study the fate of mouse blastomeres in relation to each other concluded that there is bias towards either ICM or TB differentiation that persists at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C58">Tabansky et al., 2013</xref>). We found that the ICMs of late blastocyst-stage human embryos comprised a surprising array of morphologically distinct cells (data not shown). This heterogeneity, which probably reflects transcriptomic and epigenetic differences, could contribute to the observed functional and morphological differences among hESC lines. At earlier stages, immunolocalization of the fate determinants EOMES, T, GDF15 and active β-catenin, which were differentially expressed among the UCSFB lines, showed that only a subset of the nuclei in 8- to 10-cell-stage human embryos stained. These data supported the aforementioned mouse studies and showed that a similar phenomenon is occurring in human embryos. They also suggested that derivation captured, at least in part, an individual blastomere's transcriptome/epigenome. This concept was bolstered by the fact that the differentially expressed molecules included fate determinants that are involved in lineage segregation and/or the early steps in differentiation. However, we cannot rule out stochastic changes, occurring as an individual cell generated a line.</p>
<p>As regenerative medicine therapies enter preclinical and clinical trials, we will learn whether stem cell aberrations at transcriptional, genetic and/or epigenetic levels are important to clinical outcomes. In this regard, the UCSFB lines were significantly hypomethylated compared with conventional hESCs, which was reflected in equally significant differences in the transcriptomes of lines derived by these different methods. Imprinting, including in the <italic>PEG3</italic> region, which is often lost in hESCs and iPSCs, was preserved in 9/10 UCSFB lines (<uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Fig. S3</uri>). iPSCs also have epigenetic aberrations, retaining patterns of the cell types from which they were derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C45">Ohi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C42">Nazor et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, in the near term, second generation hESCs with favorable characteristics such as blastomere-derived lines might be a better therapeutic option. However, the UCSFB lines, which were submitted to the National Institutes of Health Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry some time ago, are still listed as ‘Pending Review’. Thus, future work in the US with these cells and their TB derivatives will encounter obstacles such as obtaining funding from nonfederal sources.</p>

<title>Generation of neural stem cells and precursors from UCSFB5-7</title>
<p>To derive neural stem cells (NSCs), colonies were harvested using a scraper with care taken to avoid excessive colony fragmentation. The cells were cultured in suspension as EBs for 8 days in standard hESC medium without bFGF. Then the EBs were cultured for an additional 2-3 days in suspension in neural induction medium containing DMEM/F12 with Glutamax (Invitrogen), 1× NEAA, 1× N2 (Invitrogen) and bFGF (20 ng/ml) prior to plating. After 2-3 days, numerous neural rosettes formed. To obtain a pure population of NSCs, the rosettes were manually isolated, dissociated into single cells using Accutase (Invitrogen) and re-plated onto culture dishes. Dopaminergic differentiation was obtained by culturing NSCs in medium conditioned by PA6 cells for 5 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C56">Swistowska et al., 2010</xref>) or in xeno-free defined medium for 4-5 weeks on culture dishes or glass coverslips coated with 20 mg/ml poly-L-ornithine (Sigma) and laminin (10 mg/ml) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DEV122846C57">Swistowski et al., 2009</xref>). Expression of SOX1 was evaluated in dissociated neural rosettes by immunolocalization. At the end of the experiment, the cells were stained with anti-β-tubulin isotype III, anti-nestin or anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (see <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Table S1</uri>).</p>

<title>Embryo immunostaining</title>
<p>Six embryos per marker were grown as described above for hESC derivation. They were fixed for 10 min in 4% PFA, washed in PBS and permeabilized by incubation for 20 min in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature. Nonspecific immunoreactivity was blocked by incubation in 1× TBS/fish gelatin (SurModics)/0.1% Triton X-100 overnight at 4°C. Immunostaining was performed in blocking buffer with anti-T, anti-EOMES, anti-GDF15 or anti-active β-catenin (see <uri xlink:href="http://dev.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dev.122846/-/DC1">Table S1</uri>) at 4°C overnight. For evaluating T expression, conventional hESC-derived teratomas and cultured hESCs were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. For evaluating EOMES and GDF15 expression, human trophoblast progenitor cells and conventional hESCs were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. For immunostaining with an antibody that recognized active β-catenin, human placenta was used as a control; invasive cytotrophoblasts are immunoreactive and fibroblasts are not. After washing (2×30 min) in blocking buffer, the embryos were stained with species-specific Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) in 1 mg Hoechst 33342/ml blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Confocal images were acquired on a Leica TCS SB5 microscope. Individual blastomere nuclei were virtually isolated and the green channels quantified (Volocity 6, PerkinElmer).</p>
