<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">The outbreak of the Zika virus (ZIKV) has been associated with an increase in newborns with congenital malformations in Brazil in the past two years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. A new report describing 13 infants born in Brazil between 2015 and 2016 showed that although they did not have microcephaly at birth, they subsequently had head growth deceleration to the point of microcephaly concomitant with significant neurologic abnormalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">Given the growing threat of ZIKV spread, some researchers have focused on prophylactic measures by screening FDA- approved drugs to repurpose for ZIKV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, while still other researchers worldwide have focused on vaccine development. Accordingly, a DNA vaccine to protect against ZIKV was recently proposed, with promising results <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. While immunization initiatives are important, there is a need to develop clinical strategies to treat ZIKV-infected individuals, including pregnant women for whom prevention of infection is no longer an option. Indeed ZIKV infection during the first trimester confers the greatest risk of congenital microcephaly, thus highlighting the urgent need for treatment of infected mothers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">To provide a potential treatment against the detrimental effects of ZIKV infection we focused on testing the antiviral Sofosbuvir (SOF), a clinically-approved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor, both <italic>in vitro</italic> with ZIKV-infected human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and <italic>in vivo</italic> with mouse models. Recently, converging evidence that SOF is protective against ZIKV infection in different cell types was reported, although the precise gene expression-level events in target cells have not been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. SOF is a nucleotide analog pro-drug used in combination with other drugs for the treatment and cure of chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Upon intracellular conversion to its active triphosphate, SOF acts on HCV by inhibiting its RNA polymerase, inhibiting replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We found that the RNA polymerases of HCV and ZIKV showed strong similarities in their active sites, and thus confirmed that SOF could also act on ZIKV-infected cells. Our data corroborated the findings of other groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and expand on these findings by showing that SOF treatment rescued apoptotic human NPCs infected with multiple ZIKV strains, both in monolayer and 3D culture. In addition, SOF also restored antiviral response gene expression in human NPCs. Furthermore; we found that SOF inhibited ZIKV more efficiently in NPCs than in Vero cells. SOF was previously shown to be protective in interferon-response compromised mouse models and in neonatal Swiss mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. To extend these findings to another animal model, we chose a mouse compromised in adaptive immunity to test SOF. We found that while the placebo group had significantly increased viral load, SOF-treated mice had reduced serum ZIKV. Finally, we tested the efficacy of SOF in blocking viral vertical transmission in the ZIKV-permissive SJL strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Importantly, viral burden was reduced in SOF-treated dam serum during pregnancy. Fetuses of SOF-treated dams did not show detectable ZIKV amplification, suggesting that SOF was (1) well-tolerated by ZIKV-infected SJL dams and, most importantly, (2) was able to arrest ZIKV replication <italic>in vivo</italic> in pregnant SJL females abolishing vertical transmission. The results presented here demonstrate that repurposing the FDA-approved antiviral SOF has efficacy against ZIKV <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and warrants further molecular and translational investigation.</p>

<title>RdRp domain is highly conserved between Hepatitis C and Zika virus</title>
<p id="Par5">The <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> viral family includes both HCV and ZIKV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Both HCV and ZIKV RdRp-encoding genes lie within NS5B and NS5 domains of the viral genome, respectively. These domains are highly conserved, especially in the active site residues, among <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> members<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a–c</xref>). The NS5B C-terminal GDD motif catalyzes nucleotidyl transfer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>) and is highly conserved in <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a–c</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1A–B</xref>). The high sequence homology among the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> RdRps suggests the possibility for a common target and mechanism of action. SOF is a 2′-modified nucleotide analog, and upon intracellular phosphorylation from its prodrug state, inhibits catalysis by incorporating into the growing RNA chain and terminating synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Since SOF-triphosphate inhibits the HCV RdRp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and given the conserved structural similarities of the RdRp domain within the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, we confirmed that SOF could also inhibit ZIKV replication by targeting RdRp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b–c</xref>). Recently, the crystal structure of the ZIKV NS5 protein was released (PDB ID: 5TFR; Longenecker, K.L., Upadhyay, A.K., Cyr, M., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb">http://www.rcsb.org/pdb</ext-link>). We overlaid the ZIKV NS5 (containing the RdRp domain) structural model onto a recent structure of HCV NS5B bound to dsRNA and SOF (PDB ID 4WTG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1C</xref>, Supplementary Video <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>). This comparison shows that the active sites of the two polymerases are indeed similar, with all residues contacting SOF conserved between HCV NS5B and ZIKV NS5. The close structural similarity suggests that SOF could interact with ZIKV NS5 and could inhibit its RNA polymerase activity (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1C</xref>, Supplementary Video <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The RdRp domain is conserved between HCV and ZIKV.

This tree is intended to highlight the degree of similarity (branch length) of the RNA polymerase from different viruses.

<title>Sofosbuvir inhibits ZIKV replication in human iPSC-derived NPCs</title>
<p id="Par6">Previous work has demonstrated that ZIKV infection slows growth of human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurospheres <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and adversely affects mouse neural progenitors and radial glia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. To test if SOF arrests ZIKV replication, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived NPCs were chosen as the cellular model since they mimic the proliferative growth restrictions leading to microcephaly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. SOF blocked ZIKV activity with IC<sub>50</sub>s of 13.6 μM and 30.9 μM in NPCs and Vero cells (used as a cell-based infection system), respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a,b</xref>). The antiviral effect of varying concentrations of SOF was further assessed in multi-step growth curves on ZIKV-infected NPCs by qRT-PCR of viral genome copies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2C</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">S1</xref>). Next, we evaluated whether SOF treatment could rescue the apoptotic phenotype of ZIKV-infected NPCs. NPCs were infected with ZIKV MOI 0.1 or 1, 24 hours after plating and maintained 96 hours in culture. In mock-infected conditions, around 15% of cells were found to be apoptotic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2A–C</xref>). Upon ZIKV infection with an MOI 0.1 or 1, the percentage of TUNEL<sup>+</sup> NPCs significantly increased to 25–40% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>), similarly to previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. SOF treatment in the mock-infection had no effect on apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2B</xref>). SOF decreased significantly the percentage of TUNEL<sup>+</sup> NPCs at different doses tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). In addition, SOF significantly decreased the expression of the early apoptotic marker, cleaved caspase 3 (CC3), in ZIKV-infected hiPSC-derived NPCs and hiPSC-derived cortical neurons, using a different viral strain with higher MOI (Brazil-ZKV 2015, MOI 10) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2D–F</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>SOF blocks ZIKV replication <italic>in vitro</italic>.

<title>SOF rescues Zika viral burden in mice</title>
<p id="Par8">Next, we assessed the efficacy of SOF <italic>in vivo</italic>. While this manuscript was under preparation, SOF was shown to protect against ZIKV in immunocompetent mice treated with an anti-IFNAR1 blocking antibody and in neonatal Swiss mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, However, the first model has major limitations, as 20% of untreated ZIKV-infected mice survived, questioning the utility and efficiency of interferon (IFN)-response depleted mice to test drugs against ZIKV infections. And the second model only used neonatal pups for ZIKV infections. Thus, we chose the NOD/SCID adult immunodeficient mouse as a model for ZIKV infection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). NOD/SCID mice can control the initial viral burden through an intact interferon response. However, this mouse model lacks functional T or B cells and has defective natural killer cells, a class of cytotoxic innate lymphocytes that rapidly respond to virally infected cells in the absence of antibodies, mimicking better the human condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Another advantage of the NOD/SCID model is the lack of confounding antibody response in testing prospective antiviral agents. A previous study compared survival after ZIKV infection in two mouse models, IFN-α/β and IFN-γ receptor knockout AG129 and SCID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, and found that AG129 mice survived 18.5 days while SCID mice survived 40 days following an identical infection of 2 × 10<sup>3</sup> PFU/ml. These data suggest that animal survival depends on the viral load and adaptive immunity and not solely IFN response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In our study, NOD/SCID mice were infected with 10<sup>8</sup> PFU ZIKV intravenously (IV), and started to lose weight around day 11 with mean survival of 21± 3.36 days (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4A–C</xref>). ZIKV infected animals progressively developed severe disease requiring euthanasia (weight loss, hunched back, hindlimb paralysis). In a subsequent experiment mice were randomized to receive vehicle or SOF 50 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally (IP) beginning at day 1 p.i., for 10 days, to study antiviral activity at peak viremia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). The dosage of SOF (50 mg/kg/day) used in our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments was determined after calculating the animal equivalent dose (AED) from the recommended 400 mg/day dose for chronic HCV infection in humans. This calculation takes into account the lower metabolic rate in larger animals, requiring a smaller drug per body weight dose among other criterion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. SOF treatment was well tolerated in mice: no marked changes in body weight (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4D</xref>), fur, consistency of the stool or behavior (data not shown) during the treatment similar to previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. All mice from the ZIKV-infected vehicle-treated group had increased serum viral load, measured by plaque assays. Serum from ZIKV-infected SOF-treated mice failed to form plaques (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4E,F</xref>). Consistently, qRT-PCR of viral RNA extracted from the serum of ZIKV-infected vehicle-treated mice revealed high levels of viral RNA. In contrast, SOF-treated ZIKV-infected mice had significantly less ZIKV RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">S2</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>SOF blocks ZIKV replication <italic>in vivo</italic>.

<p id="Par9">SOF is indicated for oral (PO) administration in humans. In healthy subjects administered the clinical SOF dose of 400 mg PO daily, average steady state concentrations of the predominant circulating metabolite GS-331007 were 463 ng/mL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Hence, we considered whether SOF exposure depends on route of administration (PO versus IP). We delivered 50 mg/kg/day SOF to naïve mice daily for 4 days by IP or PO (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4G</xref>) After 4 days, sera were extracted and subjected to liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, demonstrating average minimum serum concentrations (C<sub>min</sub>) of the predominant circulating metabolite GS-331007 of 608 and 588 ng/mL in the IP and PO-treated groups, respectively, with no significant differences between groups, suggesting that SOF has antiviral activity against ZIKV at concentrations that have been shown to be safe in humans. Indeed, when we repeated the initial experiment with NOD/SCID mice infected with ZIKV to compare the efficacy of PO versus IP, both delivery routes significantly decreased viremia after 10 days in a similar fashion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par10">Finally, as the abolition of vertical transmission is of critical interest in the context of congenital ZIKV infection, we tested the efficacy of SOF to block ZIKV vertical transmission in the ZIKV-permissive SJL strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Pregnant females were infected with 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> PFU (Asian ZIKV strain PA 259459) at embryonic day (E) 12.5 as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Dose and timing of the viral inoculum were selected based on our previous publication and caused a similarly robust ZIKV infection of SJL dams, corroborating previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The viral inoculation dose was selected as comparable to vector-borne inoculation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4A</xref>). The mice were randomized to receive 50 mg/kg/day of SOF or vehicle PO from E13.5–E18.5, when they were euthanized and the fetuses extracted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). The viral RNA was detected in all vehicle-treated dam sera at E18.5, and in heads of their respective fetuses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>). Immunohistochemistry against Flavivirus Group Antigen in brain cross-sections of E18.5 embryos coming from SOF-treated dams showed a reduction of ZIKV compared to fetuses from VEH-treated dams (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3f,g</xref>). In addition, no obvious congenital malformations or weight loss were detected between fetal groups at this stage when infected with ZIKV at 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> PFU (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4H</xref>). The viral burden was significantly reduced in SOF-treated dam serum at E18.5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3h</xref>). Fetuses of SOF-treated dams did not show any detectable ZIKV amplification, suggesting that SOF was (1) well-tolerated by ZIKV-infected SJL dams and, most importantly, (2) was able to arrest ZIKV replication <italic>in vivo</italic> in pregnant SJL females abolishing vertical transmission.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par11">Here we obtained similar results regarding the reduction in ZIKV infection-induced cell death in a 2D model, and a rescue of ZIKV-mediated decreased neurosphere size in 3D cultures with SOF treatment, adding to the mounting evidence that SOF can act against ZIKV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In addition, we show that treatment with SOF further restored the antiviral response gene expression signature of ZIKV-infected NPCs. We also tested SOF in an <italic>in vivo</italic> immunodeficient mouse model. SOF treatment reduced serum ZIKV burden in all treated mice. Importantly, we show here for the first time that SOF was also well tolerated in pregnant dams and abolished vertical transmission of ZIKV to the fetuses.</p>
<p id="Par12">The prevailing ZIKV model describes a causal relationship between maternal infection, neonatal microcephaly and motor defects manifesting several months after birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, thus implicating vertical transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, effective treatment must focus on reducing viral replication in pregnant women and thus the risk of vertical transmission to the fetus. However, it is still unclear how vertical transmission occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>. Recently, we generated hiPSC-derived microglia and NPCs to mimic and study the neuro-immune interactions during embryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Microglia, the macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), are generated in the yolk sac and invade the brain during embryogenesis to become resident macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Given the timing of their invasion, microglia could spread the virus in the developing brain during its CNS infiltration acting as a Trojan horse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. We found that microglial cells could indeed transmit ZIKV to NPCs <italic>in vitro</italic> and importantly, when microglia-NPC co-cultures were treated with SOF, ZIKV infection of NPCs was limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Although out of scope of the present study, one limitation of our work is the lack of congenital disease, showing that SOF treatment can prevent birth defects in the newborn pups. To this end, a recent study treated neonatally ZIKV-infected pups with SOF and showed that short- and long-term sequelae could be prevented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, thus supporting our hypothesis regarding the benefits of SOF treatment of ZIKV- infected pregnant women. Future studies should focus on the treatment of congenital disease using SOF and analysis of other tissues such as placenta, spleen, thymus etc. Taken together with our current study, there is strong converging evidence that SOF is a reasonable option to block vertical transmission, possibly acting by limiting the infection of microglia thus restricting viral spread to the fetal brain. SOF is labeled as FDA pregnancy category B, indicating that while no controlled studies have been conducted in pregnant women receiving the drug, animal studies <italic>have not demonstrated risks to the fetus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Indeed, a clinical trial has recently commenced recruiting pregnant women with chronic HCV (NCT02683005) to study the effects of SOF during pregnancy. Comparable nucleotide/nucleoside analog antivirals such as acyclovir (herpes simplex virus) and the HIV anti-retrovirals are routinely used during pregnancy to prevent perinatal transmission and have not shown elevated risks of birth defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The placental transfer and tissue distribution of SOF and related metabolites was previously evaluated using quantitative whole body autoradiography in pregnant female rats administered a single 20 mg/kg oral dose of <sup>14</sup>C-sofosbuvir<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Importantly, SOF-derived radioactivity was detected in fetal brain with exposures that were 5-fold higher than those observed in pregnant dams at 24 hours post-dose. This finding indicates that SOF may have sufficient brain penetration to inhibit viral replication in the developing fetal brain while also achieving systemic exposure necessary to block replication at other sites. No deleterious SOF effects on fetal development have been observed at the highest doses tested in gestating rats and rabbits (Gilead Sciences). Interestingly, a study showed that SOF delivered at 44 mg/kg/d or 440 mg/kg/d for 14 days did not cause liver toxicity in the chimeric TK-NOG mice with humanized livers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Pregnancy category B states a treatment should be used during pregnancy only if the potential for benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. However, in pre-clinical reproduction toxicity studies, SOF had no effects on embryo-fetal and pre-and post-natal development at exposures at least 10-fold greater than the mean clinical exposure at the approved SOF dose of 400 mg (Sofosbuvir For Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C Infection Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee Meeting Briefing Document, Gilead Sciences, 2013). Moreover, SOF has been shown to be brain and placenta-penetrant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In line with this, our data indicate that SOF abolishes vertical ZIKV transmission in pregnant immunocompetent mice. Although the animal dosages (50 mg/kg) used experimentally exceed the human dose (400 mg) by weight, species scaling by body surface area corresponds to a scaled human equivalent dose (HED) of 4 mg/kg, less than the human SOF dose for a 70 kg individual<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Therefore, our results suggest that SOF used as a treatment for ZIKV could be prescribed at the same dosage as it is used for HCV patients.</p>
<p id="Par13">Finally, in addition to the risks in pregnant women, in adults, a high incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome has been linked to ZIKV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, as well as other ZIKV-infection sequelae, which include meningoencephalitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, uveitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, and acute myelitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. It is possible that other clinical manifestations of ZIKV infection will surface in the near future. Given our results, treatment with SOF could also arrest or help to prevent the development of other clinical manifestations observed in adults.</p>
<p id="Par14">Research in the use of nucleotide/nucleoside analog inhibitors to combat ZIKV infection has accelerated in the last year, with demonstrated antiviral activity among 2′-<italic>C</italic>-methylated nucleosides in cultured Vero cells and in a mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. In this study, we took advantage of the similarities between the RdRp domain of HCV and ZIKV and hypothesized that SOF; an FDA-approved drug indicated for treatment of chronic HCV infection, could also arrest ZIKV replication. Our work and others’ recently published studies, have shown SOF to be protective against different strains of ZIKV including the strain isolated from a microcephalic case in Brazil, used in the present study along with others. However, both our work and that of others have found a higher IC<sub>50</sub> of SOF against ZIKV when compared to HCV. Interestingly, we found the IC<sub>50</sub> of SOF against ZIKV in human NPCs to be lower than in Vero cells, suggesting greater potency in this cell type. Nonetheless, our calculated IC<sub>50</sub> values against SOF suggest reduced potency against ZIKV versus HCV. This is perhaps not surprising given that SOF was initially designed for chronic HCV infection targeting the liver - a different virus and different cell type versus our models, thus highlighting potential cell-type specific differences in drug metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> (Sovaldi ® Full Prescribing Information, Gilead Sciences, Inc, 2013). Other SOF analogs tested both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> have shown greater potency than SOF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Future research should focus on developing ZIKV-specific SOF analogs. Nonetheless, currently SOF remains the only FDA-approved drug readily available and <italic>is still protective against ZIKV</italic> as we and other groups have shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. SOF regimen for HCV infection is very costly in the United States, though it is less expensive in low-income countries such as Brazil, and a generic version could address the imminent public concern of the Zika outbreak. However, although the cost of SOF regimen is lower in developing countries, it still remains out of reach for many individuals in low-income areas to treat HCV-infected patients, making it even more challenging to treat ZIKV-infected individuals. Thus, there is an urgent need to make SOF less costly worldwide, which could increase assistance to HCV- and ZIKV-infected patients. Thus, our results warrant further study of the immediate application of SOF treatment to ZIKV-infected adults since no other treatments are currently available.</p>
<p id="Par15">In conclusion, our data illustrate the advantage of immediate translational potential through repurposing the nucleotide analog SOF that is already in wide clinical use for chronic HCV infection. In the wake of limited outcome data available for long-term effects of congenital ZIKV and no therapeutic options, multiple basic and translational options merit investigation. Our data strengthen the body of evidence for targeting ZIKV replication with nucleotide analog RNA-polymerase inhibitors in general, and SOF in particular. These promising data warrant further preclinical studies of SOF to insure efficacy and safety for congenital ZIKV infection.</p>

Although the animal dosages (50 mg/kg) used experimentally exceed the human dose (400 mg) by weight, species scaling by body surface area corresponds to a scaled human equivalent dose (HED) of 4 mg/kg, less than the human SOF dose for a 70 kg individual<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Mice were injected with SOF and monitored daily for 10 days. On day 11, mice were euthanized and blood was collected for downstream applications. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of California. All procedures followed institutional guidelines. For survival experiments, end stage was defined when the mouse had lost 20% of their initial body weight and therefore needed euthanasia.</p>
