<p id="Par1">Language development builds upon a complex network of interacting subservient systems. It therefore follows that variations in, and subclinical disruptions of, these systems may have secondary effects on emergent language. In this paper, we consider the relationship between genetic variants, hearing, auditory processing and language development. We employ whole genome sequencing in a discovery family to target association and gene x environment interaction analyses in two large population cohorts; the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and UK10K. These investigations indicate that <italic>USH2A</italic> variants are associated with altered low-frequency sound perception which, in turn, increases the risk of developmental language disorder. We further show that <italic>Ush2a</italic> heterozygote mice have low-level hearing impairments, persistent higher-order acoustic processing deficits and altered vocalizations. These findings provide new insights into the complexity of genetic mechanisms serving language development and disorders and the relationships between developmental auditory and neural systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Learning to use and understand language requires the coordinated development of a whole host of underlying skills and processes. Assuming an initial bottom-up framework as posited by Tallal &amp; others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, the first step in typical language development requires hearing, which allows infants to identify and parse meaningful signals from background noise and environmental distractors (auditory perception). These sounds are then mapped onto speech units (phonemes) enabling the extraction of meaningful linguistic constructs (comprehension). Even newborn babies turn their heads towards familiar voices and show a preference for speech over white noise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. These inclinations are fined-tuned over early life such that, at 3 months, infants show a preference for their native tongue over foreign languages and other vocal sounds (e.g. laughter)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These behavioural distinctions are mirrored at the cognitive level; many studies show that speech evokes distinct neural responses, indicating that language is subject to privileged processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Early speech processing skills correlate with later language milestones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> suggesting that they modulate successful language acquisition.</p>
<p id="Par4">While hearing is not strictly essential to successful language development (see ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>), overt disturbance of the contributory processes can directly disrupt language development; congenital hearing loss is associated with widespread cognitive deficits in domains including attention, memory and language<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Less obvious disturbances of audition can also indirectly impact spoken language development, especially if they occur during critical time periods or in addition to other insults. For example, auditory processing disorder (APD), characterized by poor central sound processing despite apparently normal hearing, can lead to difficulties understanding speech in noisy environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and, when persistent, is associated with an increased risk of Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) and Attention Deficit, Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In the current study we test this framework by assessing whether typical variations across genes that function in auditory pathways may form part of a complex risk mechanism in the emergence of language disorders. In support of our proposed framework, subtle disturbances of auditory processing have been described across many neurodevelopmental disorders where hearing is unaffected (e.g. autistic disorder (as reviewed by ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, ADHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and dyslexia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>). Similarly, declines in later-life auditory processing skills are correlated with altered language function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">The observed overlaps and comorbidities between neurodevelopmental and language disorders illustrate the complexities of contributory networks and the inter-reliance of developmental psychopathologies. In the long-term, all of these disorders are associated with academic limitation and reduced quality of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and represent an economic burden upon health-care and education systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">Although APD and DLD are both common childhood conditions (as high as 10%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, our understanding of the relationships between hearing, auditory processing and language are confounded by these comorbidities alongside a lack of consistent diagnostic guidelines and failure to identify causal mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. As for many neurodevelopmental disorders, genetic contributions are poorly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. While monogenic forms of language disorder have been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, the majority of genetic risk factors are expected to function within complex models where each variant has only a small effect size and is influenced by additional genetic and environmental interactors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Genome-wide screens indicate that large sample sets will be required to map variants that contribute to language disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and acquisition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and recent studies indicate shared genetic effects across behavioural subsets and between disorder and typical development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par7">Current research suggests that genetic effects can overlap between syndromes that have traditionally been considered as clinically distinct. Similarly, genetic overlaps are reported between Mendelian forms of disease and more complex forms of disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. These changes in the field led us to apply an alternative approach to the investigation of molecular mechanisms underlying hearing and language within the current study. More specifically, we investigate the molecular overlaps between hearing, auditory processing and language through the targeted study of a gene that has an established role in audition—<italic>USH2A</italic>. This gene encodes the Usherin protein, which acts as a lateral link between stereocilium, providing structural organization for hair cell bundle development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Homozygous pathogenic changes in <italic>USH2A</italic>, and therefore complete absence of the usherin protein, result in disorganization or loss of cochlear outer hair cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, leading to congenital hearing loss clinically described as Usher Syndrome (OMIM#276901)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This syndrome is a monogenic recessive disorder (4 in 100,000 births) associated with hearing loss specific to the high-frequency ranges, often accompanied by retinitis pigmentosa. The disorder splits into three clinical categories (Types I–III), relating to severity and age of onset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and homozygous <italic>USH2A</italic> mutations result in the majority of Type-II cases in which diagnosed individuals are born with hearing loss and develop retinitis pigmentosa at the onset of puberty, yet do not experience the vestibular dysfunction (i.e. difficulties with balance and coordination) found in other types of Usher<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In accordance with currently accepted genetic models, individuals with a heterozygous <italic>USH2A</italic> mutations are considered to be unaffected carriers.</p>
<p id="Par8">In the current study, we employ whole-genome sequencing in a discovery family to target association and gene x environment interaction analyses in two large population cohorts; the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and UK10K. We complement these statistical methodologies with the characterization of a mouse model that shows behavioural effects of a heterozygous knockout on hearing, complex acoustic processing, and communicative vocalization. We propose the existence of an “alleleic hierarchy” of variation within which different variant types have divergent effects upon auditory thresholds. We show that <italic>USH2A</italic> variants exert direct effects upon low-frequency hearing and indirectly affect the risk of language disorder through the modulation of subsequent auditory perception and language development. These findings suggest a shared genetic etiology between hearing mechanisms, central auditory processing and language development and support the targeted investigation of sub-serving mechanisms in relation to language development.</p>

<title>An<italic>USH2A</italic> variant cosegregates with language disorder</title>
<p id="Par9">A multi-generational family was ascertained for genetic investigation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). The family included seven Non-Founder individuals, all of whom were affected by a severe expressive language disorder. Affected individuals presented with slow and dysfluent speech and difficulties characteristic of APD, namely processing speech and following instructions, particularly in the presence of background noise or absence of visual cues (e.g. on the phone). The proband (IV.I, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>) and her sister (IV.2, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>) attended a special school for children with speech and language difficulties. Hearing assessments in the proband and sister were normal. Pure-tone audiometry tests in the Grandfather (II.I, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>) indicated normal hearing thresholds but deficits were noted across three tests of central auditory processing (dichotic digits, frequency pattern and duration pattern). Further details of the phenotype are provided in the Methods. Genome sequencing of two individuals (II.2 and IV.1) identified a novel stop-gain mutation (a change which results in a truncated protein) in the <italic>USH2A</italic> gene (NP_996816:p.Gln4541*) shared by all affected family members (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>, Supplementary Dataset <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>). This variant (rs765476745) has previously been documented in cases of Usher syndrome and retinitis pigmentosa in whom it was documented to occur with a secondary pathogenic variant in a compound heterozygote mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The hearing of heterozygotes was not assessed within these previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. rs765476745 has a Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) score of 40, placing it in the top 0.01% of deleterious variants in the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, and meets clinical guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) for a “pathogenic variant”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>; it confers a stop mutation (Very strong evidence of pathogenicity—PVS1), has previously been described as pathogenic (Strong evidence of pathogenicity—PS1), is absent from population databases (Moderate evidence of pathogenicity—PM2) and cosegregates with disease (Supporting evidence of pathogenicity—PP1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. No secondary putative pathogenic changes were found in other genes related to Usher syndrome or hearing loss (Supplementary Dataset <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>). Given the inheritance pattern and complete cosegregation, in the absence of a second pathogenic variant, we hypothesized that the observed heterozygous loss of USH2A could account for the observed language disorder in this family.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Discovery Family and cosegregation of <italic>USH2A</italic> variant.</title><p>Individuals affected by APD are coloured in black. Unaffected individuals are shown in white. Line through symbol indicates that individual is deceased. All descendants of individual I.1 were affected by a severe expressive language disorder. The only unaffected individuals in the family were incoming Founder members (I.2, II.2, II.3, III.4). Chromatograms show validation of <italic>USH2A</italic> variant in wider family members. The variant (position indicated by a blue highlight bar) was observed in a heterozygous form in all affected individuals.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e684" xlink:href="42003_2020_885_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>

<title>Heterozygous <italic>Ush2a</italic> KOs have altered auditory perception</title>
<p id="Par10">To elucidate the behavioural effects of heterozygous <italic>Ush2a</italic> loss, we generated heterozygous (HT) and full knockout (KO) mice. Hearing and complex acoustic discrimination thresholds were compared against WT controls on a series of prepulse inhibition (PPI) tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Initially, using a simple single-tone detection task at 40 kHz (high-frequency), individual ANOVAs revealed that KO mice trended to the expected hearing impairment typical of Usher syndrome, while HT mice performed similarly to WT controls [(Overall): <italic>F</italic>(2,32) = 1.995, <italic>p</italic> = 0.153, one-tail; (WT vs. HT): <italic>F</italic>(1, 22) = 0.619, <italic>p</italic> = 0.440; (WT vs. KO): <italic>F</italic>(1, 21) = 3.125, <italic>p</italic> = 0.092; (HT vs. KO): <italic>F</italic>(1, 21) = 1.517, <italic>p</italic> = 0.232 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). In contrast, using this same task at 15 kHz (low-frequency), HT mice performed significantly worse than KOs and trended to worse than WTs [(Overall): <italic>F</italic>(2,32) = 3.697, <italic>p</italic> = 0.36; (WT vs. HT): <italic>F</italic>(1, 22) = 3.201, <italic>p</italic> = 0.087; (WT vs. KO): <italic>F</italic>(1, 21) = 1.054, <italic>p</italic> = 0.316; (HT vs. KO): <italic>F</italic>(1, 21) = 5.016, <italic>p</italic> = 0.036], while WT and KO did not differ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). In order to assess possible higher-order processing deficits, individual scores on the above single-tone task were used as covariates (frequency-matched) to analyze more complex PPI measures (thus eliminating variance due to hearing impairments). In repeated measures ANCOVAs with Genotype as the between-subjects variable and Day and Cue as the within-subject variables, deficits were again evident for HT mice on complex low-frequency tasks [Embedded Tone 100: 10.5 kHz: <italic>F</italic>(2, 31) = 3.691, <italic>p</italic> = 0.036; Embedded Tone 10: 10.5 kHz: <italic>F</italic>(2, 31) = 4.635, <italic>p</italic> = 0.017)], and for KO mice on higher frequency tasks [Pitch Discrimination: 40.5 kHz (WT vs. KO); <italic>F</italic>(1, 20) = 9.232, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b–d</xref>).

<title>Heterozygous <italic>Ush2a</italic> KOs have altered vocalizations</title>
<p id="Par11">Given the reported comorbidity between auditory processing and language impairments and the presence of dysarthria in the discovery family, we investigated whether <italic>Ush2a</italic> knockout in mice altered the properties of their ultrasonic vocalizations. Results showed that <italic>Ush2a</italic> HT mice vocalized at significantly higher frequencies (pitch) across most syllable types [<italic>F</italic>(2, 16100) = 83.476, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000] and produced calls that were shorter and louder than WTs [duration: <italic>F</italic>(2, 16100) = 26.70, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000; volume: <italic>F</italic>(2, 16100) = 142.54, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). (See Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> for images and coding technology for eight primary call types assessed). Interestingly, <italic>Ush2a</italic> KO mice also produced higher pitched calls suggesting that disruption to auditory processing ability (regardless of the frequency of the stimuli) results in impaired expressive communication ability. This could reflect the importance of intact auditory feedback for vocal development (e.g. anomalous song production in deafened birds), and is consistent with the higher vocal pitch observed in in profoundly deaf speakers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The putative social impact of any vocalization anomalies will require additional study. Our behavioural investigations of the mouse model indicate that heterozygous disruption of <italic>Ush2a</italic> leads to altered low-frequency hearing thresholds, a phenotype distinct from the high-frequency hearing loss of Usher syndrome (and replicated in null <italic>Ush2a</italic> mice<italic>)</italic>. Moreover, these altered low-frequency thresholds were further associated with higher-order auditory processing deficits, as well as disrupted vocalizations.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title><italic>Ush2a</italic> HT mice produce altered ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs).</title><p><bold>a</bold> Syllable Frequency per Genotype collapsed across syllable category. <bold>b</bold> Syllable Duration per Genotype collapsed across syllable category. <bold>c</bold> Syllable Volume per Genotype collapsed across syllable category.

<title>Pathogenic <italic>USH2A</italic> carriers recapitulate the mouse model</title>
<p id="Par12">The description of a single case family does not warrant a claim of causation, even when supported by an animal model. We therefore sought to characterize the developmental profiles of other individuals with heterozygous <italic>USH2A</italic> knockout. The effects of pathogenic <italic>USH2A</italic> variants were explored through the investigation of developmental profiles of UK10K children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Fourteen UK10K individuals (12 M:2 F, from 1646 individuals with sequence and phenotypic data available, 0.85%, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>) were identified as carriers of <italic>USH2A</italic> changes that were designated as “pathogenic” in ClinVar. These consisted of five distinct variants which were always detected in a heterozygous form (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). The variant found in the discovery family (rs765476745) was not present in the UK10K samples (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). Analyses of developmental behavioural data showed that <italic>USH2A</italic> carriers scored below expected on measures of early vocabulary (Cohen’s d = 0.7237, 95% CI = 0.18–1.27) and word combinations (Cohen’s d = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.54–1.63) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">2</xref>). Parents of carriers were twice as likely to be concerned about their child’s speech at 3 years of age (RR = 2.07, 95% CI = 0.57–7.49) and reported a higher incidence of stuttering (RR = 2.92, 95% CI = 1.05–8.08) and dyslexia (RR = 1.88, 95% CI = 0.28–12.45) at age 8 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">3</xref>). In support of our mouse model, we also observed a low-frequency-specific hearing phenotype in heterozygous individuals; carriers had average low-frequency (500 Hz) hearing thresholds 1.2 dB HL above those of non-carriers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">2</xref>) but did not display overt hearing loss (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab3">3</xref>) or differences at higher frequencies (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">2</xref>). Thus across mouse and human data, we find evidence that heterozygous <italic>USH2A</italic> variants affect higher-order auditory processing and increase the risk of delayed language milestones. In line with current literature, these variants <italic>alone</italic> do not result in a discernible carrier phenotype (as would be expected in a monogenic model)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

<title><italic>USH2A</italic> variants are associated with low-frequency hearing</title>
<p id="Par13">Targeted association analyses were performed to investigate the wider effects of <italic>USH2A</italic> polymorphisms on hearing and language within typical development.

Three measures of language (early vocabulary size (vocab), nonword repetition (NWR) and developmental language disorder (DLD) status), and two hearing measures (low-frequency hearing (minimum air conduction threshold at 0.5 kHz; MinLow) and mid-frequency hearing (minimum air conduction threshold at 1, 2 and 4 kHz; MinMid)) were assessed. In support of the carrier and mouse findings described above, association was observed for a cluster of SNPs located between exons 4 and 12 of <italic>USH2A</italic>, specifically with low-frequency hearing (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab4">4</xref>).

<title>Gene-environment interactions associate with language</title>
<p id="Par14">We then explored a hypothesis that <italic>USH2A</italic> modulates low-frequency hearing thresholds through indirect modulatory effects on subsequent auditory perception and language development. In this model, common <italic>USH2A</italic> variants impact hearing but also exert secondary impacts on speech and language development, presumably as a result of less effective higher-order auditory perception. Specifically, we again assessed common variants in <italic>USH2A</italic> for association to language outcomes in ALSPAC, but this time included low-frequency hearing thresholds as an interaction factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Association was now observed with early vocabulary (rs7532570) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab4">4</xref>). Within this interactive model, rs7532570 had a <italic>p</italic>-value of 8.6 × 10<sup>−5</sup> compared to <italic>P</italic> = 0.15 in the additive model. When combined with the findings of the direct association analyses, these data suggest that common variants in <italic>USH2A</italic> can modify low-frequency hearing thresholds and that, when thresholds are altered <italic>USH2A</italic> can, in turn, modulate the risk of disrupted language development. This mirrors the relationship observed between low-frequency hearing and vocalization in <italic>Ush2a</italic> HT mice, suggesting a parallel modulatory gene-environment (GxE) interaction in mice and together confirming that auditory perception represents a building block for language development.</p>

Three variant selection thresholds were considered (all variants (<italic>N</italic> = 7619), rare variants (MAF ≤ 1%, <italic>N</italic> = 5424) common variants (MAF ≥ 5%, <italic>N</italic> = 1335)) in relation to the same three language and two hearing measures described above. Results showed dichotomous effects between variant frequency classes; association to hearing measures was driven by common variants while DLD status was marginally associated with rare variants (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab4">4</xref>).</p>

<title>GxE effects implicate hearing-modulated language pathways</title>
<p id="Par16">To explore similar genetic effects at a genome-wide level, a GxE interaction study (GWIs) was completed. These exploratory analyses enabled the identification of common variants that influence language through low-frequency hearing and, additionally allowed the evaluation of genes implicated in hearing within the model identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Taking direction from the GxE analyses above, a linear regression model was employed with early vocabulary as the dependent variable and low-frequency hearing thresholds as an interaction term (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Eight SNPs reached genome-wide significance (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>), while 450 SNPs across 139 HGNC transcripts were nominally associated (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 10<sup>−5</sup>) (Supplementary Dataset <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">2</xref>). Pathway analyses did not indicate an enrichment of genes previously related to hearing or language (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) but instead revealed an enrichment of protein-binding factors involved in cell adhesion and cellular movement (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab5">5</xref>). Cellular components of cell projections, lamellipodia and synapses were also over-represented (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab5">5</xref>). These genome-wide analyses therefore implicate cell migration and connectivity as potential mechanisms for the underlying effect of auditory perception upon speech and language development.<table-wrap

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par17">Language development is a multifaceted trait that relies on interactions between many sub-servant mechanisms each subject to genetic, cognitive and environmental effects, including auditory processing and hearing. In this study, we consider developmental links between a specific candidate gene (<italic>USH2A</italic>), hearing, auditory perception, communicative mouse vocalization and human vocabulary. Together, our data provide evidence that auditory perception represents a building block for communicative and language development. The identification of a <italic>USH2A</italic> stop-gain variant in the discovery family was substantiated by behavioural investigation of heterozygous <italic>Ush2a</italic> knockout mice (<italic>Ush2a</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup>). In contrast to full knockouts, these mice presented with a distinctive low-frequency hearing loss (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 at 15 Hz), accompanied by impairments in complex sound processing that was present even after variance due to hearing loss was removed, and also altered ultrasonic vocalizations. Population data corroborated the functional effects of <italic>USH2A</italic> in audition and early language development; children in the UK10K cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> who carried pathogenic variants had increased low-frequency hearing thresholds (+1.2 dB HL at 500 Hz) and showed reduced early vocabulary when compared to non-carriers. In a cohort of typically developing individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, variants at the 5′ end of the gene were directly associated with increased low-frequency hearing thresholds (minP = 6.9 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). Within an interactive genetic model, individuals carrying risk variants in the presence of altered low-frequency hearing thresholds were found to have a smaller vocabulary than those who carried only one of these risk factors in isolation (minP = 8.6 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). Together, these data demonstrate that allelic variations in <italic>USH2A</italic> are associated with altered low-level hearing thresholds that, in turn, impact speech and language development through the modulation of higher-order acoustic processing. As such, even a subtle degradation in hearing and subsequent complex acoustic processing (as seen in heterozygous <italic>Ush2a</italic> mice) could developmentally derail language processing in humans.</p>
<p id="Par18">Our findings are consistent with emerging evidence that different variant types can associate with variable outcomes, forming an “allelic hierarchy” of disease-causing and complex risk variants, representing a shift from Mendelian genetic models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. We extend this hypothesis by demonstrating a multifaceted allelic hierarchy in which rare and common variants within the same gene can form reciprocal influences upon gene functions under different environmental influences. The finding that heterozygous disruption of <italic>USH2A</italic> led to altered hearing thresholds in the low-frequency ranges was unexpected, as complete loss of this gene results in Type-II Usher Syndrome characterized by congenital high-frequency hearing loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. While one previous study suggested that carrier individuals may experience slight hearing disturbances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, heterozygotes are generally considered aphenotypic and do not show obvious deficits in clinical hearing tests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Our findings provide a molecular explanation for this; heterozygous gene disruptions are typified by subtle changes in the processing of low-frequency sounds that may be incidental to routine audiologic assessment. Such changes would not necessarily be detected in a clinical setting where the focus would be on Usher-related <italic>high</italic>-frequency hearing loss. Notably, we found that the low-frequency thresholds of carrier individuals were consistently (marginally) below those of non-carriers, though still within typical range. While it is unlikely that such subtle changes in hearing thresholds (1–2 dB) at these frequencies would directly lead to language disorder, we propose that mild changes in low-level hearing may exert a snow-ball effect that derails higher-order communicative processing. This model is akin to that described for persistent otitis media with effusion which, in itself, does not cause language disorder but may represent a risk factor when persistent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Our findings are of clinical importance given that heterozygous loss of the <italic>USH2A</italic> gene is relatively common–we found that carriers of heterozygous pathogenic variants constitute 0.85% of the UK10K cohort studied here. This figure aligns well with gnomAD European samples, of whom 1.1% are carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Thus although behavioural effects are likely to be subtle, and may exert indirect effects within a more complex genetic model as indicated by our gene-environment analyses, the fact that 1 in 100 worldwide may be at risk calls for universal updates to screening protocols.</p>
<p id="Par19">Beyond this, our study highlights a directionality of effects in which genetically-mediated differences in hearing (directly or indirectly) affect the neuronal development of central auditory processing systems and consequently influence language acquisition. These observations generate two distinct temporal models; (1), the feedback model, in which altered auditory input directly affects neuronal development leading to perceptual deficits that, in turn, increase the risk of speech and language disorders, or (2), the double-hit model, in which altered hearing thresholds combine with existing genetic factors to moderate the risk of speech and language disorders. Exploratory network analyses implicate synaptic connections and cell growth as important processes in hearing-mediated language pathways perhaps suggesting the importance of feedback mechanisms. Importantly, the mouse strains employed here (I129) have a homogeneous background that lacks overt risk mutations. This combines with low <italic>Ush2a</italic> brain-expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> and a lack of reported neuronal anomalies in <italic>Ush2a</italic> knockouts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> to further substantiate the hypothesis that patterns of emergent cochlear output can be shaped by primary stereocilia activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. The feedback model fits with a recent single-cell sequencing study, which showed that auditory input during early life can shape gene expression patterns in spiral ganglion neurons (the primary tract between the cochlea and brainstem)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Under this model, early variations in hearing thresholds can have long-lasting and complex downstream effects, presumably through the modification of central mechanisms. The double-hit model aligns with emerging knowledge from high-throughput genomic studies, which indicate the existence of complex shared mechanisms between disorders and further suggest that a “one-gene, one-disorder” expectation represents a gross simplification of genetic mechanisms both in disease and typical development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. The exact mechanisms by which low-frequency hearing may influence language development remain unclear but given the findings presented here, we propose that differences in auditory input can alter perception of speech. When these occur at critical time-points or are combined with other (as yet unidentified) risk factors, we hypothesise that this may have repercussions for the development of expressive language. The current study considers only air conductance thresholds but future studies may consider other aspects of hearing, for example through the addition of conductive hearing tests or measures of auditory brain responses and exploration of the effects of otitis media. Future investigations are needed to delineate the temporal effects reported here. Such studies will allow us to distinguish between impaired input at the synaptic interface between hair cells and the brain, versus altered linguistic circuitry or feedback, as well as to investigate genetic modifiers and define critical developmental windows for these interactions. The current study directly advances our understanding of the behavioural effects of changes in the <italic>USH2A</italic> gene and indicates that different levels of disruption can target different sound frequencies. Our mouse models further suggests that <italic>Ush2a</italic>-mediated alterations of sound perception can lead to behavioural deficits that extend to vocalization.</p>

<sec id="Sec13">
<title>Discovery family</title>
<p id="Par20">The discovery pedigree consisted of 12 members (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). Eight individuals and all descendants of individual I.1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>) were affected by expressive language disorder characterized by acute auditory processing difficulties and speech dysarthria. All descendants of individual I.1 were affected indicating an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The family was ascertained through proband IV.1.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec14">
<title>Language phenotype</title>
<p id="Par21">The proband (IV.1) was born at full-term by normal delivery following an uneventful pregnancy. There were no early developmental concerns and all gross motor milestones were achieved. However, early language milestones were delayed. First word was reported at 18 months and she was referred to a speech and language therapist at 2 years of age. A diagnosis of Specific Language Impairment (SLI) was given at age 4 years and 8 months. In this assessment, she showed particular difficulties understanding abstract language and linguistic concepts and often failed to follow conversations when no visual cues were given. She had an extensive vocabulary but her language processing was slow and she often showed difficulties finding the word she needed. She showed grammatical difficulties such as sequencing errors, simplification of sentence structure and errors with word structure. On the Children’s Communication Checklist (CCC-2), she scored below the 15th percentile on all four language scales (speech, syntax, semantics and coherence) but above this range in scales of inappropriate initiation (60th percentile), use of context (34th percentile), nonverbal communication (42nd percentile) and interests (36th percentile). At a clinical assessment at 58 months, she showed typical hand-eye coordination and performance. She did not present with dysmorphic features and hearing assessments were normal.</p>
<p id="Par22">There were also concerns regarding the proband’s younger Sister’s (IV.2) language development. Her first words appeared around the age of 2 years. Motor development was normal. She had mild to moderate bilateral conductive hearing impairment due to recurrent ear infection and grommets were inserted at the age of 3. Following this, hearing assessments were normal but her speech and language difficulties continued and she was diagnosed as having a severe speech disorder in particular with expressive language and dysfluency with very good receptive language skills. The proband (IV.1) and her sister (IV.2) both attend special language units.</p>
<p id="Par23">The proband’s Mother (III.3), maternal Great-Uncle (II.2) and Grandfather (II.1) indicate that the deficits observed in the proband are typical across all family members. The Mother and maternal Great-Uncle have not had formal assessments but both struggled at school requiring speech and language therapy and have difficulties with expressive speech and processing. The similarities between their early difficulties and that of the proband and her sister are striking. Assessment of the Grandfather (II.1) at 62 years of age indicated poor performance across cognitive tasks (verbal and nonverbal) with particular difficulties in tests of recall memory, visual recognition, literacy, executive function and information processing (all below tenth percentile). In contrast, verbal recognition, object naming and auditory attention skills were within the expected range. Pure-tone audiometry showed normal hearing thresholds but deficits were noted across all three tests of central auditory processing (dichotic digits, frequency pattern and duration pattern).</p>

<title>SNP genotyping</title>
<p id="Par24">Seven members of the discovery family (five affected individuals, II.1, II.2, III.3, IV.1 and IV.2, and two unaffected individuals, II.4, III.4, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>) were genotyped on Illumina HumanOmniExpress-12v1 Beadchips (San Diego, CA, USA; ~750,000 SNPs). SNPs were excluded if the gentrain (genotype clustering quality) score was &lt;0.5 or genotyping success rate was &lt;95%. All individuals had a genotype rate&gt;95%. Genotype data were used to construct haplotype sharing patterns across the pedigree and to call copy number variants (CNVs) as described below.</p>

<title>Haplotype reconstruction</title>
<p id="Par25">SNP genotype data from seven family members were used to construct haplotype sharing patterns within the Merlin package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. These data were employed to filter candidate variants from the whole-genome sequence data as described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec17">
<title>Copy number calling</title>
<p id="Par26">CNVs were called by two separate algorithms; PennCNV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> and QuantiSNP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. All samples had a log R ratio (LRR) SD &lt; 0.35, a B-allele frequency (BAF) drift value &lt;0.002 and a waviness factor between −0.04 and 0.04 in PennCNV and an average LRR SD &lt; 0.3 and BAF SD &lt; 0.15 in QuantiSNP. Any CNV that contained at least three consecutive SNPs, had a confidence value (PennCNV) or log Bayes Factor (QuantiSNP) of &gt;10 and was predicted by both PennCNV and QuantiSNP, with a minimum intersection of 50% each way, was considered to be of ‘high confidence’. The innermost boundaries of the two algorithm calls were used. CNVs were excluded if they spanned the centromere or telomeres.</p>

<title><italic>Ush2a</italic> mice—auditory processing</title>
<p id="Par44">Following puberty, subjects were tested on a battery of auditory processing tasks using a modified prepulse inhibition paradigm which allows free movement during the presentation of sounds that include an unpredictable loud noise burst (see Fitch et al., 2008 for review)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. PPI provides a superior index of acoustic processing at higher levels of the central auditory system most relevant to receptive communication. In brief, PPI offers an index of stimulus parameters that are behaviourally detectable, and while simple PPI is brainstem and mid-brain mediated, the use of complex acoustic cues clearly engages auditory cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. The engagement of cortical/behavioural thresholds is crucial to an ethologically-relevant model of receptive communicative processing. The ability to suppress an acoustic startle response (ASR; an involuntary, reflexive response to an unexpected auditory stimulus [startle eliciting stimulus (SES); 105 dB, 50 ms, broadband white noise burst (1–10 kHz)]) was measured. Subjects were placed on cell-loaded platforms (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT), and presented with varying auditory stimuli generated via RPvdsEx software and a RZ6 multifunction processor (Tucker Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL). Subject motor reflex responses were recorded via a Biopac MP150 acquisition system and Acqknowledge 4.1 software (Biopac Systems, Goleta, CA) connected to the load cell platforms. Tasks are detailed below and included detection of simple tones (15 or 40 kHz) in silence; and of deviant tones (variable duration) in a pure-frequency background (Embedded Tone: 10.5 or 40 kHz background tone, 5.6 or 35 kHz cue tone; Pitch Discrimination: 10.5 or 40.5 kHz tone ± 75 Hz or 8 kHz cue tone). Tone frequencies were determined based on low and high-frequency bounds of the mouse audiogram (~2–50 KHz)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. Testing began at postnatal (P) day 65 and continued to P114. Normal Single Tone consisted of 104 trials conducted over one day, where Embedded Tone and Pitch Discrimination each consisted of 300 trials and were conducted over 5 consecutive days. During cued trials, subjects were presented with an auditory cue (prepulse) 50 ms before the presentation of the SES (no cue presentation occurred during uncued trials). If the subject was able to detect the auditory cue, an attenuation (or reduction) of their ASR was expected relative to their ASR during an uncued trial. If the auditory cue was not detected, the response was expected to equate to an uncued trial. Quantification of this phenomenon was termed the “attenuation score” (ATT), which compared the mean amplitude of cued ASR to that of the uncued ASR for each subject, for each session condition.<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

<p id="Par45">Subjects were first tested on Normal Single Tone (NST) to measure baseline prepulse inhibition, general auditory ability, and to rule out any underlying auditory processing impairments that might impede performance on subsequent auditory processing tasks (i.e. impaired reflex mechanics). Subjects were required to detect a simple single tone (50 ms, 75 dB) against a silent background. This cue was presented 50 ms before the SES on half of the trials (104 cued and uncued trials each, pseudorandom and evenly distributed), at inter-trial intervals (ITI) ranging from 16 s–24 s. Two versions of this task were developed – a 15 kHz version (cue; 50 ms, 75 dB, 15,000 Hz tone) and a 40 kHz version (cue; 50 ms, 75 dB, 40,000 Hz tone). All subjects were able to perform both versions of the task (15 kHz – P65; 40 kHz – P104).

<p id="Par46">The variable duration Embedded Tone Task (EBT) consisted of 300 pseudorandom trials with ITIs ranging from 16–24 s. Subject’s ability to detect a change in tone frequency from a constant pure-tone background was measured, and ATT scored were calculated. During cued trials, a single cue was presented 100 ms before the SES; for uncued trials, the “cue” was presented 0 ms before the SES (i.e. no cue). Three versions of this task were used: (1) a long-duration EBT task, where the cue duration ranged from 0 ms to 100 ms (cue; 75 dB, 5600 Hz tone &amp; pure-tone background; 75 dB, 10,500 Hz tone); (2) a short-duration EBT task, where the cue duration ranged from 0 ms to 10 ms (cue; 75 dB, 5600 Hz tone and pure-tone background; 75 dB, 10,500 Hz tone); (3) an ultrasonic long-duration EBT task where the cue duration ranged from 0 ms to 100 ms (cue; 75 dB, 35,000 Hz tone &amp; pure-tone background; 75 dB, 40,000 Hz tone). This combination of frequencies and temporal durations was designed to capture the range of processing capacities, allowing us to test for genotype-specific differences in that range. Non-ultrasonic and ultrasonic versions of the task were necessary to determine any Genotype effects observed were frequency dependent. Both non-ultrasonic versions of the task were administered for five consecutive days, and the ultrasonic version of the task was administered for four consecutive days (P67–P78; P103–106).</p>

Using WT female homecage bedding and urine collected 5 days prior to testing, a single experimental male mouse was placed in a standard Plexiglass tub with a single novel WT female mouse and allowed to freely interact for 5 min. In this setting, a male mouse will vocalize while the female does not, such that recoded calls can be attributed to the male. A Brüel &amp; Kjær Type 4954-B microphone (Brüel &amp; Kjær, Nærum, Denmark), connected to a RME Fireface UC audio interface (RME Audio, Haimhausen, Germany), was placed 5 cm above the top of the Plexiglass tub. USVs were recorded at 192,000 Hz using DIGICheck 5.92 (RME Audio, Haimhausen, Germany) to ensure all USVs were captured. Following USV recording, sound files (.wav) were analyzed in MATLAB (MathWorks) using MUPET (Mouse Ultrasonic Profile ExTraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>). Syllables in the range of 35,000 Hz to 110,000 Hz, and duration between 8 ms to 200 ms, were analyzed. If syllables occurred less than 5 ms apart, they were excluded from analyses. Following these parameters, a syllable repertoire was generated, illustrating 40 unique syllables (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). These 40 unique syllables were then assigned to one of ten potential syllable groups, as defined by Heckman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>.

To account for individual variation in baseline prepulse inhibition and hearing, NST was used a covariate for subsequent statistical analyses (NST 15 kHz was used as a covariate for all non-ultrasonic auditory tasks; NST 40 kHz was used as a covariate for all ultrasonic auditory tasks). EBT and PD tasks were analyzed using a mixed factorial design. Differences in ATT scores for non-ultrasonic EBT 100 and EBT 10 were conducted using a 3 × 5 × 9 repeated measures ANCOVA, with Genotype (three levels; WT, HT, <italic>Ush2a</italic> KO) as the between-subjects variable, and Day (five levels) and cue Duration (nine levels) as the within-subjects variables. Ultrasonic EBT 100 data were analyzed using a 3 × 4 × 5 repeated measures ANCOVA with Genotype (three levels) as the between-subjects variable, and Day (four levels) and cue Duration (five levels) as the within-subjects variables. For Pitch Discrimination, a 3 × 5 × 9 and a 3 × 3 × 5 (for non-ultrasonic PD and ultrasonic PD, respectively) repeated measures ANCOVA was used to determine ATT differences, where Genotype (three levels) was the between-subject variables and Day (five levels, three levels) and Frequency (nine levels, five levels) were the within-subject effects.
