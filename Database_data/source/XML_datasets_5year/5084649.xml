</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Our findings suggest that morphine dysregulates synaptic balance in the hippocampus, a key center for learning and memory, via a novel signaling pathway involving reactive oxygen species (ROS), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy. We demonstrate in this study that exposure of morphine to hippocampal neurons leads to a reduction in excitatory synapse densities with a concomitant enhancement of inhibitory synapse densities via activation of the μ opioid receptor. Furthermore, these effects of morphine are mediated by up-regulation of intracellular ROS from NADPH oxidase, leading, in turn, to sequential induction of ER stress and autophagy. The detrimental effects of morphine on synaptic densities were shown to be reversed by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a pleiotropic growth factor that has been implicated in neuroprotection. These results identify a novel cellular mechanism involved in morphine-mediated synaptic alterations with implications for therapeutic interventions by PDGF.</p>

<body><sec id="s01" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Opioids such as morphine are the most potent and efficacious drugs currently available for pain management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fields, 2011</xref>). Although these are widely used clinically, in addition to their beneficial analgesic effects, abuse of opioids such as morphine often results in deleterious side effects such as opioid tolerance, addiction, and detrimental effects on cognitive performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fields and Margolis, 2015</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that neural circuits underlying addiction share some common pathways with those underlying learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hyman et al., 2006</xref>). Morphine interferes with learning and memory processes in both healthy individuals and patients with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hill and Zacny, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kurita et al., 2011</xref>). Identifying molecular aberrations underlying morphine abuse that lead to cognitive changes and providing avenues for reversing these changes remains a pressing need in the field.</p><p>The hippocampus, an integrative center for regulating learning and memory and addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koob and Volkow, 2010</xref>), is also one of the brain regions with significant expression for one of the major receptors for morphine, the μ opioid receptor (MOR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le Merrer et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that the effects of opioids on cognition could be mediated by signaling via MOR in hippocampus.</p><p>Alterations in synaptic density, structure, function, and plasticity have been identified as key components of the finely tuned machinery underlying cognition in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</xref>). Such mechanisms operate at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nelson and Valakh, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that morphine regulates excitatory spine density in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robinson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>). However, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the ability of morphine to regulate spines and excitatory synapses remains far from complete. The effects of morphine on inhibitory synapses remain unclear. The balance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses is crucial for maintenance of normal functioning of neural circuits and higher-order brain functions including cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Froemke et al., 2007</xref>). There are limited avenues for therapeutic intervention to address cognitive deficits resulting from long-term use of morphine. Identifying molecular mechanisms underlying morphine-mediated synaptic alteration is thus of critical importance in our understanding of how neural circuitry responds to opioids and could provide insights into the development of therapeutic targets aimed at restoring normal cognitive function in morphine users.</p><p>We have identified a key signaling pathway that allows morphine signaling via MOR to regulate both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic density in hippocampus. Our data indicate that morphine-mediated activation of MOR results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to downstream effects including activation of ER stress pathways followed by initiation of autophagy cascade. This eventually results in a decrease in excitatory synapse density accompanied by an increase in the density of inhibitory synapses, which likely contributes to the cognitive decline associated with morphine use. Promisingly, the detrimental effects of morphine on the density of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses can be ameliorated by PDGF-BB. Members of the PDGF family not only regulate neural development but also function as broad-acting neuroprotective agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng and Mattson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tang et al., 2010</xref>). These studies thus provide a key mechanistic link between morphine use and cognitive decline and offer a potential avenue for preventing, or perhaps reversing, these cognitive deficits.</p></sec><sec id="s02" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>Morphine alters the densities of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus</title><p>Morphine abuse is associated with cognitive changes that are likely linked to synaptic alterations. We used an in vivo model to examine if morphine administration altered the densities of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus, a key center for learning and memory. Groups of mice were exposed to either saline or morphine with intraperitoneal injection three times a day, starting at an initial dose of 10 mg/kg followed by ramping the dose by 5 mg/kg/d for six consecutive days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pal and Das, 2013</xref>). At the end of treatment, mice were sacrificed, and the hippocampus was subjected to immunostaining and confocal microscopy. Morphine administration resulted in significant decrease of density of excitatory synapses with a significant enhancement of density of inhibitory synapses in the stratum lucidum and radiatum areas of the hippocampus, as indicated by densities of presynaptic (vesicular glutamate transporter 1 [vGlut1] and glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 [GAD65; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>; and Fig. S1 A]) and postsynaptic markers (postsynaptic density protein 95 [PSD95] and gephyrin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>; and Fig. S1 B]) for excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively. To elucidate whether the synaptic alterations in response to morphine were region specific, we examined the protein levels of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic markers in the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum from control or morphine-treated mice (Fig. S2). Consistent with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A–D</xref>, the levels of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic markers were significantly altered in the hippocampus (Fig. S2, A and B). Interestingly, no alterations were observed in either the cortex or striatum (Fig. S2, C–F). To further examine if morphine-mediated synaptic changes in the hippocampus could be attributed to transcriptional alterations, we examined the levels of transcripts for excitatory and inhibitory synaptic markers in hippocampi from control and morphine treated mice (Fig. S3). In the hippocampus, we observed a significant decrease in the transcript levels of excitatory synaptic markers (Fig. S3 A). However, the transcript levels of inhibitory markers remained unchanged (Fig. S3 A). Consistent with the lack of synaptic alterations in the cortex and striatum, there were no changes in the levels of transcripts encoding excitatory or inhibitory synaptic markers in these regions (Fig. S3, B and C). Collectively, these in vivo results suggested that: (a) morphine-mediated synaptic alterations are likely region specific; and (b) morphine likely regulates the levels of excitatory synaptic proteins via transcription and inhibitory synapses translationally.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Morphine alters the densities of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus.</bold> Representative confocal images of the stratum lucidum and radiatum regions of mouse hippocampi were stained with presynaptic protein vGlut1 and GAD65 (A) and quantification of vGlut1 and GAD65 puncta (B).

There are two advantages to this approach. Because primary culture model is predominantly neuronal in nature, if we observed synaptic alterations with morphine, it would indicate that these effects are mediated by a direct effect on neurons, as opposed to a secondary consequence of activation of other cell types in hippocampus, including microglia and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horvath et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vacca et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, this is a well-established tractable model that would allow the exploration of underlying mechanisms.</p><p>We exposed GFP-expressing rat primary hippocampal neurons at 20 d in vitro (DIV) to morphine (10 µM) for 24 h followed by immunostaining for presynaptic and postsynaptic markers for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The neurons were subjected to confocal microscopy and synapse densities for both types of synapses were quantitated. Similar to our in vivo findings, morphine exposure resulted in a significant loss in the density of both dendritic spines and excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E and G</xref>) and enhanced the density of inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, F and G</xref>). Morphine exposure promoted a decrease in the density of excitatory synapses with an increase in the density of inhibitory synapses in vitro. Collectively, the in vivo and in vitro data indicate that morphine regulates density of excitatory and inhibitory synapses and that these effects are mediated by its direct action on neurons.</p><p>To confirm that these effects on synapses are specifically mediated by morphine-mediated activation of MOR, we pretreated neurons with opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (10 µM) 1 h before morphine treatment before subjecting neurons to immunostaining with synaptic markers, confocal microscopy, and quantitation of synaptic densities. Pretreatment of neurons with naltrexone significantly abrogated morphine-mediated loss of dendritic spines and excitatory synapses while suppressing up-regulation of inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, H and I</xref>). The effects of morphine on synaptic densities are thus mediated by its ability to bind and activate MOR.</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>The role of oxidative stress in morphine-mediated synaptic alterations</title><p>We sought to examine the components of the cellular signaling pathway that allow morphine to regulate synapses. Morphine has been shown to induce oxidative stress via generation of ROS in both macrophages as well as in vivo in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhat et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ibi et al., 2011</xref>). We next examined whether exposure of hippocampal neurons to morphine resulted in increased production of ROS and also sought to identify the intracellular source of ROS.</p><p>We took advantage of the 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA) fluorescence assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gomes et al., 2005</xref>) to measure ROS levels in primary rat neurons exposed to morphine. Morphine promoted ROS production in a time-dependent manner with the peak response in ∼1 h after exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Mitochondria and NADPH oxidases are the two major intracellular sources of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brennan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shadel and Horvath, 2015</xref>). To determine the major contributing source of ROS after morphine exposure, neurons were pretreated with pharmacological inhibitors specific for either mitochondrial or NADPH oxidase ROS, exposed to morphine, and investigated for levels of ROS generated using the H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA fluorescence assay. Pretreatment of cells with naltrexone (MOR antagonist), ROS scavenger phenyl-<italic>N</italic>-tert-butylnitrone (PBN), or inhibitor of NADPH oxidase apocynin significantly suppressed morphine-mediated induction of ROS generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO, however, failed to inhibit morphine-mediated induction of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). These results are thus consistent with a role for NADPH oxidase, but not that of mitochondria, in generating ROS in hippocampal neurons exposed to morphine.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>The role of oxidative stress in morphine-mediated synaptic alterations.</bold> (A) Time course of ROS generation in primary hippocampal neurons exposed to morphine by H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA assay.

Pretreatment of cells with apocynin resulted in inhibition of morphine-mediated synaptic alterations, including down-regulation of both spine density and excitatory synapses with a concomitant up-regulation of inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). These data are consistent with a model in which morphine-mediated ROS generation, via MOR, influences densities of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in hippocampal neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s05"><title>The role of ER stress in morphine-mediated synaptic alterations</title><p>We examined downstream mechanisms that link morphine-induced ROS generation to synaptic alterations. To this end, we focused on the ER stress pathway. The cellular redox status altered by ROS generation has been reported to affect ER protein folding, resulting in ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In response to ER stress, there is an initiation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) that is induced as an adaptive mechanism, involving up-regulation of the three cascading sensors—protein kinase R–like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring protein 1α (IRE1α), and activating transcription factor (ATF) 6—and the ER chaperone binding Ig protein (BIP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2016a</xref>). Although ER stress triggered by oxidative stress has been suggested to play a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Uehara et al., 2006</xref>), its effects in synaptic structure and function remain unclear.</p><p>To examine whether morphine exposure could induce ER stress, we investigated expression of several critical UPR mediators—BIP, phosphorylated PERK (pPERK), IRE1α, and ATF6—in hippocampus of mice exposed to morphine. Hippocampal lysates from mice with morphine injection were assessed for expression of UPR mediators by Western blots. There was a significant increase of the major UPR mediators in hippocampal lysates of morphine-injected mice compared with the saline-injected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). In addition, we found a time-dependent increase of BIP in primary hippocampal neurons exposed to morphine, indicating that morphine also triggered ER stress in vitro<italic>,</italic> consistent with our in vivo findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). To confirm that these alterations are a direct consequence of the activation of MOR by morphine, we pretreated primary neurons in culture with MOR antagonist naltrexone before morphine exposure and examined expression of ER stress markers by Western blots. Pretreatment of neurons with naltrexone inhibited morphine-mediated increase of ER stress markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>). These studies thus indicated that morphine-mediated activation of MOR promotes ER stress and initiates the UPR response, both in vivo and in vitro.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>The role of ER stress in morphine-mediated synaptic alterations.</bold> Representative Western blot (A) and quantification of ER stress mediators (BIP, pPERK, IRE1α, and ATF6; B) in the hippocampal lysates from mouse injected with saline or morphine (<italic>n</italic> = 3 to 4/group; *, P &lt; 0.05; **, P &lt; 0.01 versus saline group using Student’s <italic>t</italic> test).

Contrast and brightness of overall images were consistent in each set of experiments. For primary neurons in vitro, the number of synapses and dendritic spines were counted manually in Zen 2010 SP1 (ZEISS) using a digital zoom of 4× with Z-stack projection. These measurements were obtained on one dendrite per neuron within 80 µm from the cell body. Data were obtained from four independent cultures. The numbers of synapses and dendritic spines are indicated on the bar graph.

Recording electrodes (tip resistance 5.0–8.0 MΩ) were pulled from borosilicate glass micropipettes (World Precision Instruments) with a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments Company). The intracellular solution contained: 120 mM potassium-gluconate, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 11 mM EGTA, 10 mM Hepes, 2 mM Mg-ATP, and 1 mM GTP, adjusted pH to 7.3 with KOH. The extracellular solution contained: 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM Hepes, and 10 mM glucose, adjusted pH to 7.4 with NaOH, and extracellular solution was preoxygenated for 30 min in before recording. Picrotoxin (150 µM) was added to bath solutions to block GABA-A receptor–mediated currents, which allowed the recording of mEPSCs. The α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and kainate receptor blocker 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (10 µM) and the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (1 µM) were added in the bath solutions for the measurement of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs). The recording electrodes were positioned by a Burleigh micromanipulator (PC-5000; EXFO). The cells were allowed to stabilize for 3–5 min after establishment of the whole-cell patch configuration. Cell capacitance was compensated &gt;70%. The mEPSCs and mIPSCs were recorded at holding potential at −60 mV during voltage clamping.
