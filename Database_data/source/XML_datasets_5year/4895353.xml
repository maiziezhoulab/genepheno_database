<abstract>
<p>Several genome- and proteome-wide studies have associated transcription and translation changes of <italic>CRMP2</italic> (collapsing response mediator protein 2) with psychiatric disorders, yet little is known about its function in the developing or adult mammalian brain <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here we show that brain-specific <italic>Crmp2</italic> knockout (cKO) mice display molecular, cellular, structural and behavioural deficits, many of which are reminiscent of neural features and symptoms associated with schizophrenia. cKO mice exhibit enlarged ventricles and impaired social behaviour, locomotor activity, and learning and memory. Loss of <italic>Crmp2</italic> in the hippocampus leads to reduced long-term potentiation, abnormal NMDA receptor composition, aberrant dendrite development and defective synapse formation in CA1 neurons. Furthermore, knockdown of <italic>crmp2</italic> specifically in newborn neurons results in stage-dependent defects in their development during adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our findings reveal a critical role for CRMP2 in neuronal plasticity, neural function and behavioural modulation in mice.</p>

<body>
<p>Dysregulated neural development can lead to chronic impairments in neural function and increased vulnerability to environmental toxins or stressors. Among the many factors that can disrupt early brain development, there are a few known genetic mutations that are causal for specific disorders, and many more that have been implicated to varying degrees in conferring risk for psychiatric disorders with a developmental origin. Schizophrenia is one such psychiatric disorder that affects ∼1% of the general population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Expression and severity of symptoms can be heterogeneous but several clusters of symptoms are considered to be hallmarks of the disease, including positive symptoms (such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thoughts and abnormal motor behaviour), negative symptoms (decreased motivation, reduced expressivity and anhedonia) and cognitive deficits in attention, learning and memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Pathology identified from imaging and post-mortem analyses includes reduced hippocampal and cortical volume<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, enlarged lateral ventricles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, decreased neuronal density and size<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and reduced dendritic arborization and spine density<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Schizophrenia is a highly heritable disorder and dysregulated neurodevelopmental processes are thought to play a key role<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Major advancements have recently been made in identification of genetic risk factors for schizophrenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and understanding biological roles of these risk factors in brain circuitry formation and maintenance at the molecular, cellular and behavioural levels can lead to a better picture of disease aetiology and targeted strategies for future drug development.</p>
<p>Several genetic association and linkage studies have implicated chromosome region 8p21 in conferring susceptibility for schizophrenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Subsequent linkage studies and a linkage meta-analysis suggested associations of <italic>CRMP2</italic> (collapsing response mediator protein 2) located at 8p21.2 with schizophrenia in large family samples from various ethnic cohorts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Furthermore, functional genetic variants of <italic>CRMP2</italic> have been suggested to be associated with both schizophrenia risk and lower expression of CRMP2 in post-mortem brains of schizophrenia patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Corroborating these genetic studies, proteome-wide analyses have found significantly altered CRMP2 protein expression levels in post-mortem brains of schizophrenia patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. CRMP2, a microtubule-associated protein, belongs to the CRMP family with 5 homologues (CRMP1–5). Knockout studies of all other CRMPs, except CRMP2, have been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, CRMP2 has been shown to regulate various aspects of neuronal development, including axonal and dendritic growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, synaptic physiology and neurotransmitter release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Knockdown experiments in the embryonic mouse brain further suggest a role of CRMP2 in neuronal polarity and migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In addition, constitutive activation of CRMP2 through <italic>Crmp2 S522A</italic> knockin mice exhibit deficits in cortical dendrite patterning in the adult brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The functional role of CRMP2 in neuronal plasticity and animal behaviour <italic>in vivo</italic>, however, remains unknown.</p>
<p>Here we report that brain-specific <italic>Crmp2</italic> knockout (cKO) mice exhibit increased locomotion, and social, cognitive and affective behavioural impairments. At the molecular and cellular levels, these cKO mice display aberrant composition of NMDA receptor subunits and abnormal long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission. Furthermore, knockdown of <italic>Crmp2</italic> in newborn neurons in the adult mouse dentate gyrus results in deficits in dendritic and synaptic formation at specific time points of the neuronal developmental process. Our study provides strong evidence at multiple levels to support an important role of CRMP2 in neural development, circuitry integrity and brain function. Furthermore, our results provide mechanistic insight on how mutations in this gene may contribute to developmental and behavioural phenotypes.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>Crmp2</italic> brain-specific KO mice</title>
<p>CRMP2 is broadly and highly expressed in multiple brain areas, including cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum, both during early postnatal development and in the adult brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. To investigate the impact of CRMP2 expression during neural development, we generated a <italic>Crmp2</italic> conditional null mutant through targeted deletion of exon 3, which causes a frame shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). To specifically disrupt the <italic>Crmp2</italic> gene in the nervous system, these mice were crossed with <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> mice to generate <italic>Crmp2</italic> cKO. <italic>Crmp2</italic> deletion in different brain areas in cKO mice was confirmed at both protein and mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b–d</xref>). We also analysed mRNA levels of other <italic>Crmp</italic> family members and did not find an apparent compensatory effect due to <italic>Crmp2</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). cKO brains exhibited largely normal surface features and cortical lamination with comparable density and thickness of both deep layer and upper layer cortical cells labelled by CTIP2, FOXP1, SATB2 and TBR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c,d</xref>). Interestingly, most cKO mice displayed a variable degree of lateral ventricle enlargement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>), similar to what has been observed in imaging studies of schizophrenia patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, in addition to lower overall body weight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Behavioural deficits by <italic>Crmp2</italic> cKO mice</title>
<p>To determine whether <italic>Crmp2</italic> cKO mice express behavioural impairments, we subjected these animals to a battery of behavioural tests. In the open-field test, cKO mice showed increased locomotion compared with their wild-type littermates (Ctrl, hereafter; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Although hyperactivity has been associated with animal models of various disorders, it has been proposed that this phenotype may be analogous to psychomotor agitation in schizophrenia patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Moreover, the hyperactivity was suppressed by administration of an antipsychotic drug, clozapine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). cKO mice were also hyperactive in their home cages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), indicating that their open-field behaviour was not simply a reaction to a novel environment. In addition, there was no significant difference between cKO mice and Ctrls in the time spent in the centre of the open-field (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>), or the fraction of time spent in the open or closed arms of the elevated plus maze (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). These results suggest that increased locomotor activity is not due to altered anxiety levels. Motor coordination, balance and motor learning skills appeared to be intact as measured by performance on an accelerating rotarod test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>)</p>
<p>Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a common measure for assessing sensorimotor gating, which is impaired in many schizophrenic patients and in animals models of psychosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. We found that cKO mice displayed a significant PPI deficit at multiple intensities of prepulse stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Importantly, there was no significant difference in the startle response between cKOs and Ctrls, suggesting no apparent hearing deficit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>).</p>
<p>Social behaviour in animals can be quantified in several assays to evaluate interactions with conspecifics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Nest building is often used to assess well-being, social and mating behaviours. We found that cKO mice had a substantially decreased nesting score measured after 16 h with the nestlet material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). We further used the three-chamber test to probe animals for their voluntary initiation of social interaction and their preference for social novelty<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In the sociability phase, Ctrl mice spent significantly more time in the chamber with the social partner (S1) than the empty cage (E). In contrast, cKO mice showed no apparent preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). In the social novelty phase, a novel partner (S2) was introduced into the previously empty cage. Control mice displayed a preference for S2, while cKO mice spent more time with S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). These abnormal social behaviours were not due to impaired olfactory function as revealed by comparable performance of the Ctrl and cKO mice in the buried food pellet test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether cKOs have deficits in spatial working memory and hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, we subjected the mice to the Y maze, contextual fear conditioning and Morris water maze tests that are often used to study associative learning and spatial learning and memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. In the Y maze test, cKO mice showed a reduction in spontaneous alternation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g</xref>), but a similar number of total arm entries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2g</xref>). In the contextual fear conditioning test, freezing responses were also found to be significantly reduced in cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2h</xref>), although this result must be interpreted with some caution in light of differential basal activity observed in locomotor assays. In the Morris water maze, cKO mice took a longer time to reach the hidden platform in the training trials and spent less time in the target quadrant during probe trials, indicating impaired hippocampus-dependent learning and memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2i,j</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, results from this battery of tests indicate that cKO mice exhibit behavioural deficits in locomotor activity, sensorimotor gating, social behaviour and spatial learning and memory.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Perturbation of hippocampal synaptic function</title>
<p>To elucidate potential consequences of <italic>Crmp2</italic> disruption on synaptic function, we performed electrophysiological recordings of the Schaffer collateral CA1 circuit in brain slices acutely prepared from Ctrl and cKO animals. Theta-burst stimulation (TBS)-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) was substantially reduced in cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). There was no difference in the input–output curve and the paired-pulse ratio, thus the presynaptic function was less likely to be affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>).</p>
<p>Impaired LTP is most likely due to postsynaptic deficits in synaptic function and/or a reduction in the number of functional synapses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. We therefore isolated the hippocampal postsynaptic density (PSD) from both Ctrl and cKO mice to quantify synaptic proteins. We first verified the purity of PSD by western blot with the presynaptic marker SYP and postsynaptic marker PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). The presence of CRMP2 was also confirmed in the PSD fraction from the Ctrl, but not cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e,f</xref>). We then analysed the composition of both NMDA and AMPA receptor subunits. Interestingly, we observed a significant reduction of NMDA receptor subunits, including both GluN2B and GluN1 levels, in the PSD fraction in cKOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>). These results indicate that defects in synaptic plasticity are likely due to dysregulation of NMDA receptor subunit expression.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Morphological abnormalities of hippocampal pyramidal neurons</title>
<p>The perturbation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and the aberrant composition of NMDA receptors led us to postulate that those defects might be caused by abnormal neuronal development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. To test this hypothesis, we crossed our <italic>Crmp2</italic> cKO mice with <italic>Thy1-GFPm</italic> transgenic mice. Thy1-GFPm-labelled CA1 pyramidal neurons from cKOs exhibited a significant decrease in both total dendritic length and dendritic arborization complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in the spine density of CA1 pyramidal neurons of cKOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Detailed analysis of different types of spines showed that the volume of mushroom spines and thin spines, but not stubby spines, in apical dendrites was significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). We further examined synapse structures in detail using electron microscopy. Analysis of PSD morphology in hippocampal stratum radiatum showed an apparent decrease in PSD thickness in cKOs, while the synaptic cleft was largely normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). These data, together with the reduction in postsynaptic receptor proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>), indicate an essential role for CRMP2 in the development and/or maintenance of dendrites and synapses in CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Involvement of CRMP2 in adult hippocampal neurogenesis</title>
<p>Adult neurogenesis has been suggested to play an important role in brain function and abnormal adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. We therefore characterized the role of CRMP2 in the development of newborn neurons in the adult dentate gyrus. Retrovirus mediated birth-dating and genetic manipulation was used to knockdown <italic>crmp2</italic> expression specifically in newborn cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. We generated multiple shRNAs against mouse <italic>crmp2</italic> and found two to be effective (shC2#2 and shC2#5, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Retrovirus co-expressing GFP and control shRNA or shC2 was stereotaxically injected into the dentate gyrus and newborn granule cells were analysed at 2, 4 and 6 weeks post-retroviral injection (w.p.i.). Unexpectedly, newborn granule cells with CRMP2 knockdown showed markedly enhanced total dendritic length and dendritic complexity compared with that of controls at 2 w.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a–d</xref>). The specificity of shRNAs was further validated by rescue experiments by wild-type CRMP2 expression <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Interestingly, while control newborn neurons exhibited normal development with an increase in total dendritic length and complexity over time at 4 and 6 w.p.i., the CRMP2-deficient granule cells failed to develop further, resulting in reduced total dendritic length and dendritic complexity of more mature adult-born dentate granule neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c–f</xref>), which is consistent with morphological deficits observed in Thy1-GFPm-labelled mature CA1 pyramidal neurons from cKOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p>
<p>Newborn neurons are synaptically integrated into the existing circuitry between 2 and 6 w.p.i. (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). We next examined the synaptic development of newborn granule cells during adult neurogenesis. Surprisingly, CRMP2 deficiency led to an increased number of morphological dendritic spines at all time points examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g,h</xref>). However, the mature mushroom spines were not maintained and the density was significantly lower than that of controls at 6 w.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5i</xref>), consistent with our findings that there is a reduction of mature spines in mature CA1 pyramidal neurons of cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). We also examined the synaptic boutons of mossy fibers, the synaptic output of dentate granule cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5j</xref>). The CRMP2-deficient neurons exhibited a significantly decreased volume of mossy fibre boutons at 6 w.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5k</xref>). Furthermore, there were axonal outgrowth and targeting defects in newborn granule cells with CRMP2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Proper brain function relies on stereotyped patterns of neural development. Dysregulation of any process during neural development can have severe and long-lasting consequences. There has been considerable progress in the identification of genetic risk factors for complex psychiatric disorders that have developmental origins, due to the decreased cost of sequencing, increasing numbers of whole-genome sequencing studies, and data analyses from large-scale consortiums<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. How these genetic variants contribute to abnormal neural circuitry formation and its behavioural consequences remain largely unclear. One of the key challenges is to translate the wealth of new information on genetic risk factors into general principles that can guide hypothesis-driven investigations of the aetiology.</p>
<p>Genome-wide linkage studies have consistently identified 8p21 as a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia and the <italic>CRMP2</italic> gene within this locus has been suggested as a risk factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Interestingly, altered CRMP2 protein levels have been observed in post-mortem brains of schizophrenia patients, and antipsychotic drugs can modify the level of CRMP2. The physiological role of CRMP2 and its underlying mechanisms remains unknown. Animal models are essential to investigate how individual genes can modulate intact neural circuitry and modify the behaviour of an organism. In this study, we used animal models with a brain-specific knockout, or cell-type-specific knockdown, of <italic>Crmp2</italic>, and provide evidence to support a critical role of <italic>Crmp</italic>2 dysfunction in the expression of several structural abnormalities and behavioural impairments. A growing body of evidence suggests that NMDA receptors play an important role in circuit assembly, and their subunit composition is differentially regulated during postnatal development resulting in unique synaptic properties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. In particular, GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors were found to promote the maturation of excitatory synapses in hippocampal neurons during postnatal development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. CRMP2 has been shown to bind GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors from mass spectrometry analysis in rat hippocampus and to regulate the surface expression and trafficking of GluN2B, which is necessary for LTP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Consistent with these data, we found that CRMP2 protein is highly enriched in the PSD fraction and required for the maintenance of normal NMDA receptor subunit composition. Importantly, a loss of CRMP2 leads to a significant reduction of GluN2B in the hippocampal PSD fractions in the cKOs. Together with the ultra-structural finding of reduced thickness of PSD in pyramidal neurons from the CA1 region of the hippocampus, our data suggest a potential role of CRMP2-mediated synaptic GluN2B in hippocampal plasticity. Indeed, we found that there is a considerable decrease in theta-burst-induced LTP in the Schaffer collateral circuitry in the cKO. Taken together, we reveal a postsynaptic mechanism underlying CRMP2 regulation of neural plasticity in the hippocampus, which may contribute to spatial learning and memory deficits observed in cKO animals. Additional mechanistic studies are warranted to elucidate the function of CRMP2 in GluN2B trafficking and its contribution to hippocampal-dependent cognition and affection.</p>
<p>The diametric effect of CRMP2 on the morphological development of adult-born granule cells is intriguing. During early developmental stages (2 w.p.i.), the loss of CRMP2 results in increased complexity of dendritic structures and a higher density of immature dendritic spines. At later stages (6 w.p.i.), however, this accelerated growth cannot be maintained, leading to decreases in both the dendritic complexity and mature spine density. These results suggest that CRMP2 also plays an important role in morphological and synaptic development and synapse maintenance. Consistent with this finding, in the <italic>Crmp</italic>2 cKO mice, CA1 neurons exhibited immature characteristics, including a reduced number of mature spines and less dendritic complexity than those of control mice, reflecting a stable phenotype in mature neurons resulting from the loss of CRMP2 during development. Interestingly, an immature dentate gyrus has been associated with schizophrenia based on observations in human patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Although this could be due to an arrested state of development, our data support the alternative possibility that this immaturity might be a consequence of failed maintenance of mature synapses, or over-pruning. It would be valuable for future studies to investigate the protracted and dynamic neurogenesis that occurs during adolescence and early adulthood, critical time periods when genetic and environmental factors might interact to contribute to the manifestation of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.</p>
<p>We and others have shown that neuronal polarity and migration were affected by <italic>Crmp2</italic> knockdown using <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation to manipulate the expression of CRMP2 in a subset of cells during early embryonic development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The cKO brains, however, exhibit largely normal exterior surface features and cortical lamination. This discrepancy could be due to differences in the level and timing of CRMP2 manipulation or potential off-target effect of shRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. While in knockout mice there is sufficient time to allow developmental redundancy mechanisms to evolve<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>, acute gene manipulation by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation in a subset of cells is less likely to activate these compensatory mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Significantly enlarged lateral ventricles in the cKO mice are reminiscent of structural brain features in patients with schizophrenia. The exact cause of this structural change is still unknown, but is generally believed to be associated with a reduction of the grey matter, which we did not find in the cKO brain. But this does not rule out the possibility of reduced neural stem cell proliferation, which has also been reported in schizophrenia patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref> and in some animal models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>.</p>
<p>Together, our results suggest a critical contribution of <italic>Crmp2</italic> deficiency in distinct physiological, neuroanatomical and behavioural phenotypes. We observed specific abnormalities associated with neuronal development in the hippocampus that, if recapitulated throughout the brain, could help explain dysregulation of neural circuits and effects on disparate types of behaviours. Our <italic>Crmp2</italic> cKO mice exhibit key structural deficits in neurons that would affect synaptic plasticity, and behavioural impairments analogous to multiple symptomatic domains in schizophrenia. In light of the emerging focus on research domain criteria in the clinical field, it will be important to map genetic risk to functional domains at the cellular, systems and behavioural levels to identify points of convergence and divergence in biological pathways associated with aetiology of psychiatric disease.</p>
<p>Not all genetic risk factors for a single disorder will lead to the same phenotypes. Conversely, a single genetic risk factor is often associated with more than one psychiatric disorder. Hub genes that appear to link many risk genes into the same biological pathway, or core genes that are implicated in multiple cellular and behavioural phenotypes, may be particularly informative in establishing connections among gene networks based on cellular phenotypes, changes in neural structure, behavioural effects, and association with particular psychiatric disorders. <italic>Crmp2</italic> is unusual among the relatively few risk genes that have been studied so far in that we have identified CRMP2-mediated phenotypes from synaptic function to morphological development to gross brain structure. These mice may therefore serve as a valuable new animal model for psychiatric disorder research, amenable to targeted investigations of mechanistic hypotheses of neurodevelopmental dysregulation.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>Crmp2</italic> conditional knockout mice</title>
<p>The mouse <italic>Crmp2</italic> genomic DNA (7.4 kb) was obtained from a C57BL/6 BAC clone (RPC123-414A17). The targeting vector construct was designed to flank exon 3 of the mouse <italic>Crmp</italic>2 gene with two loxP sites to allow Cre-mediated deletion of exon 3 and resulting in a frame shift. The vector was linearized before electroporation into B6/129-derived hybrid ES cells. Selected and confirmed clones were injected into blastocysts from C57BL/6 to generate chimeric mice. Chimeric males were crossed with C57BL/6 to generate heterozygous floxed <italic>Crmp2</italic> (<italic>Crmp2</italic> loxP/+) mice, and homozygous mice (<italic>Crmp2</italic> loxP/loxP) were produced by mating heterozygous mice. Mice homozygous for the floxed <italic>Crmp2</italic> allele were crossed with mice carrying a Nestin promoter-driven Cre transgene (Jackson Laboratory, B6.Cg (SJL)-TgN(Nes-Cre)1Kln), which expresses Cre primarily in the central and peripheral nervous system under the control of the rat nestin promoter and enhancer. The resulting heterozygous mice were used to generate homozygous cKO (<italic>Crmp2</italic> loxP/loxP; Nes-Cre/+, cKO) or heterozygous (<italic>Crmp2</italic> loxp/+; Nes-Cre/+) or homozygous (<italic>Crmp2</italic> loxP/loxP) mice. The homozygous and homozygous conditional knockout mice were used to investigate defects related to CRMP2 deficiency. To obtain GFP labelled neurons, the <italic>Crmp2</italic> cKO mice were crossed with Thy1-GFPm mice (Gift from Yi Zuo, Tsinghua University). The primers used for genotyping were designed for discriminating loxP (forward: 5′-TCTCTATCCACTCTACCACCTC-3′, reverse: 5′- ATTCAATGCCAAGTTATCAGA-3′), Cre (forward: 5′ -CGATGCAACGAGTGATGAGG-3′, reverse: 5′- GCATTGCTGTCACTTGGTCGT-3′) and GFP sequences (forward: 5′- AAGTTCATCTGCACCACCG-3′, reverse: 5′-TCCTTGAAGAAGATGGTGCG-3′).</p>

<title>Behavioural tests</title>
<p>All the mice for behavioural tests were housed in groups, 5 mice per cage with mixed genotypes. All behavioural tests were performed during the light phase of the cycle between 09:00 and 17:00. All behavioural testing began on day 8 and mice were allowed 2 h to habituate to the testing rooms before tests. Experimenters were blind to the genotype when behavioural tests were carried out. Male mice at 8–10 weeks of age were used for all the behaviour tests, except for the three-chamber test, in which mice were tested at 5–6 weeks of age. The number of mice per group is indicated in the figures.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Open-field test</title>
<p>To measure locomotion and spontaneous activity levels, we quantified the behaviour of mice as they freely explored an open-field arena (40 × 40 cm area, 35 cm high walls) using a video tracking system (Smart). Mice were placed in the centre of the arena at the beginning of the session and the total test time was 30 min. To evaluate anxiety-like behaviour, total distance and time spent in the centre region (20 × 20 cm) versus the periphery was compared.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Home-cage activity</title>
<p>Singly caged mice were habituated in the cage for 12 h and activity was recorded for 10 min. The total distance travelled in the cage was used as a measure of locomotor activity in the cage.</p>

<title>Three-chamber test for social interaction and social novelty</title>
<p>The three-chamber social test for sociability and response to social novelty was performed as previously described with minor modifications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>. Briefly, 5–6-week-old male cKO mice and wild-type (WT) littermate controls (Ctrls) were used in all tests. Age-matched WT male mice were used as Strangers 1 and 2. Stranger mice were habituated to the apparatus by being placed inside wire cages for 25 min each day for 3 days before the test. The three-chamber apparatus consisted of a transparent acrylic box with removable floor and partitions dividing the box into three equally sized chambers (19 × 40 cm). Each chamber could be closed and opened with a door. For the sociability test, the test mouse was put in the middle chamber and left to habituate for 5 min at which time Stranger 1 was introduced into a wire cage in the left side chamber and an empty wire cage on the right side chamber. The dividers were then raised and the test mice were allowed explore freely all three chambers for a 5 min session. Following the 5 min session, the animal was allowed for another 5 min (post-test) to become familiar with the Stranger 1 mouse. Following this, Stranger 2 was introduced into the previously empty wire cage and again the test mouse was allowed to freely explore all three chambers for a 5 min session. Time spent in each chamber and the test mouse’s trajectory were recorded using Avta Maze software (Anilab Software &amp; Instruments).</p>

<title>Nest building assay</title>
<p>The nest building test was performed as previously described with minor modifications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>. Briefly, one square piece of material made of cotton fibre (9 × 9 cm) was put in a cage with an individual mouse. Pictures of the nests were taken 16 h later. The quality of the nest was assessed using the following score: 1, nest not noticeably touched; 2, nest partially torn up; 3, mostly shredded but not identifiable nest site; 4, an identifiable but flat nest; 5, a well-defined nest with walls.</p>

<title>Startle response and prepulse inhibition</title>
<p>The startle response and PPI test was performed as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref> (Med Associates). Mice were acclimated to the test room for 1 h before the test. The test began with a 5 min acclimation period when the mice were left in the chamber’s cylinder undisturbed. The remainder of the test session consisted of three blocks of trials. The first block consisted of five 40 ms, 120 dB sound bursts used as startle stimuli, presented with varying intertrial intervals (10–15 s). The second block consisted of 12 trials each, with four different trial types: startle only, or a 20 ms prepulse sound at 4, 8 or 12 dB above the background noise level (69 dB) presented 120 ms before the startle stimulus. The third block consisted of five trials each, with different startle stimuli: 90, 100, 110 or 120 dB. The trial types were presented in pseudorandom order throughout each block with an average intertrial interval of 15 s (range from 10 to 20 s). For PPI, the average startle response was used as the primary dependent measure of the startle reflex. Percentage of prepulse inhibition was calculated using the following formula: (100−(prepulse+startle/startle alone) × 100), where the startle alone mean response was obtained from trials conducted in the absence of prepulse stimuli.</p>

<title>Contextual fear conditioning</title>
<p>The conditioning apparatus consisted of a shock-chamber set up in a sound attenuated box (Panlab). On the training day, mice were placed within the conditioning chamber for 2 min of habituation before three 2 s, 0.7 mA footshocks were delivered at 58 s intervals and then returned to home cages.

<title>Morris water maze</title>
<p>The Morris water maze was used to measure acquisition and expression of spatial memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. A circular water tank (120 cm diameter and 40 cm height) was filled with water (22 °C, 25 cm deep) and in the presence of a constellation of spatial cues visible to the mice. Nontoxic white powder paint was added to the water to make the surface opaque and to hide the escape platform (circular platform, 6 cm in diameter, 1 cm below the surface). The experimental protocol required five days of acquisition with the platform in place (four trials per day) and removal of the platform on the sixth day for a probe test. During the acquisition phase, the platform stayed in the same location for each animal. At the beginning of each trial, the mouse was placed into one of the four quadrants facing the wall and the starting location varied pseudorandomly across trials for each mouse. Mice were given 60 s to find the platform, at which point the experimenter would guide the animal to the platform if necessary. Mice remained on the platform for 30 s, and were then dried with a towel and placed under a 37 °C lamp between trials. To measure the rate of acquisition, the latency to reach the platform was averaged over all four trials each day. For the probe trial, mice were given 60 s to swim and the trajectory and amount of time spent in each quadrant was quantified using a video tracking system (SMART).</p>

<p>Electron microscopy was performed as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>. Briefly, mice were assigned a code before dissection to maintain a blinded genotype across all procedures, including dissection, sample processing, imaging and quantification. Dissected hippocampus from fixed brain with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, pH7.4) was transferred into a 4% glutaraldehyde solution after 24 h post-fixation (4% PFA) and kept at 4 °C for 3 days. The samples were washed twice, 20 min each, in 7.5% sucrose, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 h with initial microwave treatment for 6 min. Next, the samples were washed twice in 0.11 M veronal acetate buffer for 20 min each. Following en-block staining in 1% uranyl acetate in distilled water for 1 h the samples were washed twice in 0.11 M veronal acetate buffer for 20 min each. Samples were dehydrated using serial dilutions of ethanol (70%, 95%, 2 × 100%) for 20 min each, with initial microwave treatment of 2 min. Samples were then treated for 20 min twice with propaline oxide and impregnated with 50:50 propaline oxide: Epon resin overnight at 4 °C, with initial microwave treatment for 3 min. Next, the samples were impregnated with 100% Epon resin, three changes of 2 h each, with initial microwave treatment for 3 min each. Tissue samples were embedded in moulds and incubated for 48 h at 60 °C. Tissues were sectioned to 65 nm with a Leica ultra-microtome.

<title>Dendritic and spine analyses</title>
<p>For analysis of the CA1 region dendrites and spines, Coronal brain sections (100 μm) were prepared from age-matched Ctrl and cKO with Thy1-GFPm. Slides were individually coded and randomly ordered for image acquisition. Images of dendrites (randomly 5 neuron per mouse) were acquired on Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope with a 20 × lense. Images of the 2nd segment apical dendrite spine were acquired on LSM 700 confocal microscope with 100 × 1.4 numerical aperture (NA) lense and 2 × optical zoom. The investigator was blind to genotype during image acquisition and analysis of spine morphology. For dendritic analysis, both apical and basal processes of CA1 pyramidal neuron were analysed. For analyses of adult newborn neurons, coronal brain sections (50 μm) were prepared from retrovirus-injected mice and processed for immunostaining using following GFP antibody (goat, 1:500; Rockland &amp; Abcam ab290). Images were acquired on confocal system (Zeiss LSM 700 and 510). Images for dendritic and spine morphology were deconvoluted with Auto Quant X (Media Cybernetics) using the blind algorithm, which employs an iteratively refined theoretical PSF. No further processing was performed prior to image analysis. For visualization, brightness and contrast levels were adjusted using Image J (NIH). For analysis of dendritic development, three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of entire dendritic processes of each GFP<sup>+</sup> neuron were obtained from Z-series stacks of confocal images. The two-dimensional (2D) projection images were traced with NIH Image J. All GFP<sup>+</sup> dentate granule cells with largely intact dendritic trees were analysed for total dendritic length as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. The measurements did not include corrections for inclinations of dendritic process and therefore represented projected lengths. For complete 3D reconstruction of spines, consecutive stacks of images were acquired using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm at high magnification (× 63, five times zoom) to capture the full depth of dendritic fragments (20–35 μm long) and spines using a confocal microscope (Zeiss). Confocal image stacks were deconvoluted using a blind deconvolution method (Auto Quant X, Media Cybermetics). The structure of dendritic fragments and spines was traced using 3-D Imaris software using a ‘fire’ heatmap and a 2D <italic>x</italic>–<italic>y</italic> orthoslice plane to aid visualization (Bitplane). Dendritic fragments were traced using automatic filament tracer, whereas dendritic spines were traced by means of an autopath method with the semi-automatic filament tracer (diameter; min: 0.1, max: 2.0, contrast: 0.8). For spine classification, a custom MatLab (MathWorks) script was used based on the algorithm; stubby: length (spine)&lt;1.5 and max width (head)&lt;mean_width (neck) *1.2; mushroom: max width (head) &gt;mean width (neck) *1.2 and max_width (head) &gt;0.3; if the spine was not classified as mushroom or stubby, it was defined as long thin.
