<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Aberrant DNA methylation is a hallmark of various human disorders, indicating that the spatial and temporal regulation of methylation readers and modifiers is imperative for development and differentiation. In particular, the cross-regulation between 5-methylcytosine binders (MBD) and modifiers (Tet) has not been investigated. Here, we show that binding of Mecp2 and Mbd2 to DNA protects 5-methylcytosine from Tet1-mediated oxidation. The mechanism is not based on competition for 5-methylcytosine binding but on Mecp2 and Mbd2 directly restricting Tet1 access to DNA. We demonstrate that the efficiency of this process depends on the number of bound MBDs per DNA molecule. Accordingly, we find 5-hydroxymethylcytosine enriched at heterochromatin of Mecp2-deficient neurons of a mouse model for Rett syndrome and Tet1-induced reexpression of silenced major satellite repeats. These data unveil fundamental regulatory mechanisms of Tet enzymes and their potential pathophysiological role in Rett syndrome. Importantly, it suggests that Mecp2 and Mbd2 have an essential physiological role as guardians of the epigenome.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Methylation of DNA is generally accepted to be decisively involved in regulating gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In mammals, 5-methylcytosine (5mC) accounts for 1% of all DNA bases and is primarily found as symmetrical methylation of CpG dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). A minor proportion of 5mC is localized within so-called CpG islands at the 5΄ ends of many genes, including those, responsible for genomic imprinting and X-inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The vast majority of methylated cytosines, however, are found in repetitive, endoparasitic sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), whose transcriptional activity must be repressed to prevent translocations, gene disruption and chromosomal instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The methylome is read and translated by conserved families of proteins, such as the methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). All members (of which the five best studied ones are Mecp2, Mbd1, Mbd2, Mbd3 and Mbd4) share a common protein motif, the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), which enables all family members except for Mbd3 to selectively bind to single methylated CpG dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Moreover, all MBD proteins with the exception of Mbd4 have been described to function in transcriptional repression in part by recruiting silencing complexes such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>Mecp2, the founding member of the MBD protein family, is highly expressed in brain and was shown to mediate silencing of neuronal genes by the recruitment of the Sin3a–HDAC chromatin remodeling complex via its transcriptional repression domain, abbreviated TRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In addition, Mecp2 was described to link methylated DNA with the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR), as well as the silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid receptor (SMRT) in a neuronal activity dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Unlike its name suggests, Mecp2 binds preferentially, but not exclusively to methylated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In addition to its core methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD), Mecp2 contains various non-sequence specific interaction sites for double-stranded DNA, including the TRD domain and, based on their relative location to the MBD and TRD, the so-called intervening domain (ID), as well as the C-terminal domain alpha (CTD alpha) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Upon binding to DNA, the ID and TRD domains of Mecp2, which constitute a large proportion of the extensively disordered protein, acquire secondary structure and stabilize Mecp2-chromatin complexes. Accordingly, deletion of these DNA binding domains were shown to considerably increase the fraction of unbound Mecp2 molecules within the cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Besides this, MBD-based binding affinity was described to highly depend on the density of methylated CpG sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and, thus, might vary extensively among different cell types. In mouse cells, Mecp2 was described to highly accumulate at densely methylated pericentric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). As a consequence of homo- and hetero-interactions with itself and Mbd2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), as well as its multivalent DNA and 5mC binding ability, Mecp2 induces large-scale chromatin reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) accompanied by dampening transcriptional noise of highly methylated repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p>
<p>More recently, three mammalian enzymes (TET1-3) named after the ten-eleven translocation (t(10;11)(q22;23)) identified in a few cases of acute myeloid and lymphocytic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), were shown to catalyze the conversion of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxycytosine (5caC) in an iterative, Fe(II)- and oxoglutarate dependent oxidation reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). This may either result in the erasure of the repressing methylcytosine mark with the aid of deaminases and enzymes of the base excision repair system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), or the stable genomic integration of the oxidized cytosine derivatives as additional epigenetic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Consequently, TET proteins have been proposed to play a key role in the long sought mechanism of active DNA demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), as well as in diversifying the epigenetic landscape, whose composition is dynamically regulated during development and in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p>
<p>DNA hypo- as well as hypermethylation as a consequence of miss- or nonfunctioning 5mC writers, readers and modifiers, have been implicated in many malignancies including neurological and autoimmune disorders and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Mutations in the X-linked <italic>MECP2</italic> gene cause Rett-syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), a debilitating neurological disease that, at a molecular level, is characterized by increased expression and retrotransposition of repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p>
<p>By dissecting the interplay of 5mC readers and modifiers, we test the hypothesis of whether the anomalous transcriptional response observed in Rett patients is due to unconfined access of TET proteins to their substrate 5mC. In accordance with this, our data unveil a molecular mechanism by which Mecp2 and Mbd2 protect 5mC from Tet1 mediated oxidation <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> and provide definite indications of aberrant Tet activity in a mouse model for Rett syndrome, which lacks the aforementioned MBD-based defense system.</p>

<p>For calculation of mean Mecp2-, 5mC- and 5hmC level at pericentric heterochromatin of Mecp2 y/- and wild-type mouse brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), mid-optical sections of the 5mC channel were used to generate chromocenter (CC) masks. Therefore, images were processed using a median filter and thresholded in three successive steps using the basic algorithm. For the generation of binary chromocenter masks, all pixels below the final threshold were set to 0 and all pixels above the final threshold were set to 1. Total Mecp2-, 5mC- and 5hmC- signals overlapping with the chromocenter mask were calculated and divided by the total number of pixels corresponding to the area of chromocenters.

For this purpose, chromocenter masks were generated as described above, except that mid-optical sections of the 5mC channel were filtered only once. Binary nuclear masks were prepared by filtering and thresholding the DAPI channel as described earlier.

<title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
<sec id="SEC3-1">
<title>Mecp2 and Mbd2 protect 5-methylcytosine from Tet1 mediated oxidation in a concentration dependent manner</title>
<p>Considering that MBD and Tet proteins share a common substrate, we aimed at clarifying whether binding of MBD proteins to methylated DNA protects epigenetically silenced regions from Tet- mediated DNA demethylation. To this end, we either radioactively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, top), or immunologically (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, bottom and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>) labeled and subsequently quantified global 5hmC levels in genomic DNA of FACS sorted HEK cells expressing comparable levels of the catalytic active (Tet1CD) and inactive domain (Tet1CDmut) of Tet1 alone, or in combination with Mecp2 and Mbd2, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). When compared to mock and Tet1CDmut transfected cells, both, the radioactive (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, top), as well as the immunological (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, bottom) assay revealed increased 5hmC levels in genomic DNA of cells expressing the catalytic active domain of Tet1 alone. Coexpression of Mecp2 or Mbd2, however, significantly decreased global 5hmC levels by at least 50%, demonstrating reduced Tet1 effectiveness in the presence of substrate-competitive proteins.</p>
<p>Further single-cell analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>) of transiently transfected mouse myoblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and HEK cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>) immunostained for 5hmC revealed a correlation between Tet1CD protein and 5hmC levels in a subpopulation of cells containing low Mecp2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, bottom, left and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>, bottom, left) and Mbd2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, bottom, right and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>, top, right) protein amounts, respectively. The remainder cells of the population, characterized by high expression levels of the Mbd2 and Mecp2 proteins, in contrast, showed no longer any correlation between Tet1CD protein levels and the occurrence of its oxidation product. Instead, 5hmC levels anti-correlated with increasing levels of Mecp2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, bottom, left and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>, bottom, left) and Mbd2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, bottom, right and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>, top, right), respectively, indicating that protection of 5mC from Tet1 catalyzed oxidation highly depends on the MBD protein concentration. In contrast to Mecp2 and Mbd2, even the highest expression levels of GFP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, top, left and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>, top, left) and Mbd3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, top, right) proved insufficient to repress Tet1 activity. As both proteins are not capable of binding to (methylated) DNA (for Mbd3, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>), this suggests that direct interaction with (methylated) DNA is a prerequisite for the effective conservation of 5mC.</p>
<p>To determine, whether the levels of mCherry-Tet1CD obtained through overexpression in mouse myoblasts and human embryonic kidney cells are within the physiological range of endogenous Tet1 in primary mouse neurons and mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we stained all of the four cell types for Tet1 and quantified the resulting immunofluorescent signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). To allow a direct comparison to the Tet1 expression levels plotted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>, transiently transfected mouse myoblasts and HEK cells were binned according to the ectopic Tet1CD signal (e.g. group 1 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref> corresponds to the first column of all heatmaps in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>, respectively). We found that bins 1 and 2 of mouse myoblasts, as well as bin 1 of HEK cells express (combined ectopic+endogenous) Tet1 levels comparable to mouse ESCs. As shown previously, the level of overexpressed Mecp2 in mouse myoblasts is in the range of endogenous physiological Mecp2 levels per mouse neuronal cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Accordingly, cells expressing low Tet1CD protein levels do not create an artificial phenotype and, thus, reflect the situation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Finally, we immunologically quantified 5hmC levels in genomic DNA of Mecp2 lox/y and -/y mouse tail fibroblasts (MTF). Compared to the floxed control group (lox/y), we detected increased 5hmC levels in the corresponding Mecp2 knockout cell line (-/y), indicating that Mecp2 represses the formation of 5hmC <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>).</p>

<title>Prior binding of Mecp2 and Mbd2 to 5-methylcytosine enhances blocking of Tet1 catalyzed 5-hydroxymethylcytosine formation <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>As described above, Tet1 mediated 5hmC formation is impaired by Mecp2 and Mbd2 <italic>in vivo</italic>. To gain a deeper understanding of the protective mechanism, we next sought to determine, whether the chronological order of DNA binding by MBD and Tet1 proteins would influence the extent of 5mC protection. Since at the cellular level the chronological access of MBD- and Tet1CD proteins to DNA is difficult to control, we further investigated its influence on 5mC protection in <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. Therefore, various conceivable binding scenarios were systematically mimicked on a molecular level. Briefly, same molar ratios of Tet1CD and MBD proteins were incubated simultaneously or consecutively with a PCR fragment containing multiple methylated cytosines. Following 2 h of Tet1CD incubation, DNA was blotted on a membrane to then immunologically detect the amount of remaining unoxidized 5mC, as a measure of 5mC protection by MBD proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, 5mC levels were comparatively high in any of the samples containing, in addition to Tet1CD, Mecp2 and Mbd2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref>), respectively, indicating restricted Tet1CD activity in the presence of 5mC binding proteins, which is in accordance with our <italic>in vivo</italic> data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In more detail, when compared to the fully unprotected control group (DNA + Tet1CD) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref>, first column), 5mC levels were increased by a factor of 1.9 (Mecp2) and 1.6 (Mbd2) in samples allowing simultaneous access of Tet1CD and MBD proteins to their common substrate 5mC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref>, second column). Incubation of MBD proteins with the methylated DNA prior to the addition of Tet1CD enzymes, yielded 5mC signals 3.9 (Mecp2) and 2.1 (Mbd2) fold higher relative to control samples without MBD proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref>, third column). Delayed addition of methylated DNA to pre-incubated Tet1CD and MBD proteins resulted in relative 5mC levels of 2.1 (Mecp2) and 1.3 (Mbd2) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref>, fourth column). Accordingly, among all tested conditions, early incubation of MBD proteins with methylated DNA before the addition of Tet1CD enzymes revealed the highest 5mC signals and, thus, the best possible protection against Tet1CD catalyzed oxidation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref>, third column).</p>
<p>As Mecp2 can bind to a single methylated CpG site (mCpG), we further tested whether the protection against Tet oxidation could take place on single mCpG containing substrates. Therefore, we measured the degree of protection over time using a methyl sensitive restriction endonuclease assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Consistent with our previous results, single 5mC containing, double-stranded oligonucleotides that were pre-incubated with Mecp2 lost the least amount of 5mC. Even after 2.5-h treatment with Tet1CD, the presence of Mecp2 (previously incubated with DNA) protected 80% of 5mC from oxidation versus only 20% of 5mC surviving in the absence of Mecp2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>).</p>
<p>On this basis, we conclude that binding of MBD proteins to DNA, especially prior binding provides the greatest contribution towards preserving the methylation status of CpG dinucleotides. Alternatively, protein-protein interactions, which could have formed most effectively by pre-incubation of Tet1CD and MBD proteins, do not play a role in protecting DNA from Tet1CD driven oxidation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="SEC3-3">
<title>Direct binding to DNA is sufficient to effectively prevent 5mC oxidation by Tet1</title>
<p>As indicated earlier, Mecp2 contains various different interaction sites for DNA. While the IDTRD domain of Mecp2 was shown to bind both, methylated and unmethylated DNA with similar affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), the MBD domain of Mecp2 has a preference for methylated CpG dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether and which of the above-mentioned binding mode is responsible for the conservation of 5mC, we tested the protecting ability of both Mecp2 subdomains using the battery of assays employed before (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Quantification of 5hmC levels in genomic DNA of human HEK cells revealed that both subdomains of Mecp2 avert Tet1CD mediated 5mC oxidation to a similar extent, indicating that the adverse impact on Tet1CD activity does not directly correlate with 5mC affinity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). To further test this conclusion, we measured the protective effect of full length Mecp2 proteins carrying an R111G mutation in their MBD domain. While mutation of arginine 111 abolishes binding to 5mC <italic>in vitro</italic> and to methylated heterochromatin <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>), the mutant protein is still able to interact with unmethylated DNA in a sequence unspecific manner. Accordingly, it shifts 5mC containing DNA in the absence, but less efficiently in the presence of poly dI:dC competitor DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>). As cells expressing this mutant Mecp2 variant also exhibited low 5hmC levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10A</xref> left), we deduce that sequence unspecific DNA interactions, considerably contribute to defending 5mC from Tet1CD mediated oxidation. Additional 5mC recognition by a functional MBD, as demonstrated by wild type Mecp2, improved the protecting ability only marginally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10A</xref> left). Indeed, we found that two proteins specifically binding major satellite DNA sequences independent of methylation, the polydactyl zinc finger MaSat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>), as well as the transcription activator-like effector protein msTALE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>), repressed the formation of 5hmC <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10A</xref>, right). Thus, 5mC recognition by the MBD is unlikely to <italic>per se</italic> play a major role in the protective mechanism.</p>
<p>To validate and extend these results, we immunostained and quantified genomic 5hmC levels in single C2C12 mouse myoblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) and HEK cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Similar to C2C12 and HEK cells coexpressing Mecp2 and Mbd2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>), genomic 5hmC content correlated with Tet1CD protein levels in a subpopulation of cells containing low IDTRD protein amounts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, top, left and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>, bottom, middle; rows 3 and 4 from top to bottom). Cells, characterized by high expression levels of IDTRD proteins, in contrast, showed no longer any correlation between Tet1CD protein levels and its oxidation product. Instead, 5hmC levels anti-correlated with increasing levels of IDTRD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, top, left and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>, bottom, middle; rows 1 and 2 from top to bottom). In C2C12 cells, the MBD domain of Mecp2 repressed merely the catalytic activity of a small number of Tet1CD molecules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, top, right (columns 1 and 2 from left to right) and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, bottom). In the presence of high Tet1CD protein amounts, even the highest MBD protein concentrations failed to repress the formation of 5hmC by Tet1CD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, top, right (columns 3 and 4 from left to right)). In HEK cells, which expressed ectopic proteins at a substantially higher level per cell than the previously analyzed C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>), however, MBD protein levels were sufficient to avert the catalytic activity of low to high Tet1CD protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>, bottom, right). Accordingly, we conclude that the extent of 5mC protection substantially depends on the concentration of MBD and IDTRD molecules per cell as it determines the coverage of DNA in a sequence-unspecific manner (see also Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p>

<p>Similar to the MBD domain of Mecp2, Mbd2 has been shown to preferentially bind 5mC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). In contrast, though, Mbd2 was more efficient than the MBD in protecting 5mC from oxidation (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). To test whether binding kinetics <italic>in vivo</italic> may contribute to 5mC protection, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. Whereas the MBD showed fast recovery at pericentric heterochromatin with halftimes of 2 s, Mbd2 recovered 15-fold slower after photobleaching (30 s) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10B and S10C</xref>). Hence, we propose that long retention times of Mbd2 at methylated cytosines improve the efficiency of 5mC protection. However, since the IDTRD subdomain depicted similar fast recovery kinetics (2 s) like the MBD domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10B and 10C</xref>) but was more efficient in protecting 5mC, we deduce that additional sequence-unspecific DNA binding parameters (e.g. stoichiometry) must play a role.</p>
<p>Finally, <italic>in vitro</italic> 5mC oxidation studies using a PCR fragment containing multiple methylated cytosines showed that similar to Mecp2 and Mbd2, prior binding of MBD and IDTRD to DNA additionally strengthens the conservation of 5mC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, these data highlight the complexity of the MBD based 5mC protection mechanism, which achieves best performance through prior and long lasting coverage of DNA in a sequence-unspecific manner. It also differs from previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>) suggesting that 5mC binding <italic>per se</italic> is critical to protect from oxidation.</p>

<p>To investigate how prior binding of MBD proteins to DNA protects 5mC from Tet catalyzed oxidation (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), we next analyzed which of the above-mentioned step is affected. To this end, we tested the DNA binding ability of Tet proteins, considered as the first step towards 5mC oxidation, in the presence of low and high concentrations of 5mC specific (MBD, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S12B</xref>), as well as sequence-unspecific (IDTRD, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S12B</xref>) Mecp2 DNA binding domains by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S12A</xref>).</p>
<p>To validate that both Mecp2 subdomains bind to DNA under the given reaction conditions, we initially verified their efficiency to form complexes with short double-stranded (ds), single 5mC-containing DNA in the absence of Tet1CD proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">C</xref>, first and second row). While incubation of DNA with low substoichiometric MBD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, first row) and IDTRD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, first row) protein concentrations, resulted in a single, slow migrating band, increasing protein amounts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">C</xref>, second row) gave rise to an additional high molecular super-shift, originating from additive accumulation of proteins to an already bound DNA molecule. Hence, our data prove the suitability of the present reaction conditions. Furthermore, it indicates that at high protein levels, where most of the unbound DNA substrate is depleted, multiple binding of either Mecp2 subdomain to the same DNA fragment is promoted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">C</xref>, compare first and second rows). As the ratio of high molecular weight versus low molecular weight shifted DNA in the IDTRD is higher than with the MBD, we conclude that the IDTRD of Mecp2 is more efficient in fully covering DNA molecules than the MBD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">C</xref>, second row).</p>
<p>Addition of Tet1CD molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S12B</xref>) to single 5mC containing dsDNA, which was pre-incubated with low protein amounts of the MBD or IDTRD, respectively, resulted in two discrete prominent DNA shifts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">C</xref>, third row). While the fast migrating DNA co-localized with MBD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, third row) and IDTRD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, third row) protein signals, respectively, the high molecular DNA band coincided with protein signals for the catalytic domain of Tet1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">C</xref>, third row). Consequently, our data indicate that in the presence of low competitive protein concentrations and excess availability of uncovered DNA substrate, Tet1CD binds to DNA without compromising efficiency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">C</xref>, third row). Pre-incubation of dsDNA with a higher number of IDTRD molecules, in contrast, greatly diminished Tet1CD signals (arrowhead), which instead strongly colocalized with signals derived from IDTRD proteins (arrow, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, fourth row). Thus, we conclude that under the present reaction conditions, under which most of the DNA substrate is covered by IDTRD molecules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, second row), binding of Tet1 proteins to their common substrate is almost entirely averted. Similar to the IDTRD, however, as a result of lower DNA coverage, less significant, higher protein level of MBD (arrow) reduced the formation of Tet1-DNA complexes (arrowhead) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, fourth row). Similar results were obtained with equimolar amounts of MBD/IDTRD and Tet1CD proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S13</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, these data demonstrate that the amount of free Tet1CD enzyme highly correlates with the number of bound methyl-CpG binding domain proteins per DNA molecule. Hence, we conclude that binding of MBD proteins to DNA protects 5mC from oxidation by restricting access of Tet1CD enzymes to DNA, whereby any further steps of the oxidation procedure are inhibited. Besides this, we deduce that the efficiency of Tet DNA binding inhibition, which is proportional to DNA coverage by MBD proteins, may differ from cell type to cell type, as the binding mode of MBD proteins is strongly affected by DNA methylation density and binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p>

<title>The Tet oxidation product 5hmC is enriched in neurons of a mouse model for Rett syndrome</title>
<p>As we found that Mecp2 represses Tet1-mediated 5mC oxidation <italic>in vivo</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), we next tested whether the previously reported transcriptional increase of repetitive elements in Mecp2 knockout brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), may be considered as pathophysiological consequence of unconfined Tet activity. To address this hypothesis, we analyzed genomic 5mC- and 5hmC levels in the pons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S14A and S15</xref>) of a mouse model for Rett syndrome (Mecp2<sup>−/ytm1.1Bird</sup>), which was previously identified as brain region partially responsible for the devastating breathing disturbances observed in Rett patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>). Since in wild type brain Mecp2 was primarily found at pericentric heterochromatin of neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S14B and C</xref>), we consequently focused our analysis to these chromatin regions, which in mouse cells assemble into higher order aggregates known as chromocenters (CC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S15</xref>).</p>

<p>While knockout of Mecp2 had little effect on the distribution of pericentric 5mC levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), the amount of the Tet oxidation product 5hmC was significantly increased at chromocenters of Mecp2 deficient neurons of the pons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>), which is in agreement with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>). Using LC–MS it has been shown in different brain regions, that 4.5% of all cytosines are methylated and 5mC levels do not change between regions. Moreover, 5hmC levels were shown to vary between 0.3% and 0.6%, with an average 0.45%, i.e. 10 times lower than 5mC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>). Using similar methods, Wu and colleagues showed that the distribution of 5hmC, but not of 5mC, varies between tissues. They, furthermore, showed that in Tet1 knockdown ES cells, although the 5hmC decreased to less than half of the control cells, 5mC did not change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>), which is similar to our results. As we measured a change of 40% for 5hmC in Mecp2 knockout relative to wild type neurons, we would expect maximally 4% change of 5mC levels in a pure population of neuronal cells. According to Münzel <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>) the maximally expected change of 4% lies within the experimental error rate (±5% for 5mC and 5hmC) and is, therefore, most likely not detectable as our results indicate. Importantly, it should be noted that the increase in 5hmC was not due to enhanced Tet1 expression as wild type and Mecp2 deficient neurons had comparable Tet1 levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S14D and E</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data demonstrate on the subcellular level that knockout of Mecp2 results in increased neuronal 5hmC levels. We cannot exclude that other secondary effects may contribute to the increase of 5hmC at chromocenters <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, expression of Mecp2 in cells that do not normally express endogenous Mecp2 (mouse myoblasts, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), decreases Tet-mediated oxidation of 5mC. The only difference between both sets of cells is the presence or not of Mecp2. Hence, according to our cell data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">B</xref>), unconfined access of Tet1 proteins to pericentric heterochromatin, which is occupied when Mecp2 is present, is very likely the dominant mechanism that allows 5hmC accumulation at pericentric heterochromatin.</p>
<p>Previous data showed that both, Mecp2 protein and 5hmC levels are high in neurons. To address this apparent contradictory coexistence, we furthermore analyzed the expression of Tet1 in different cell types and found high levels of the 5mC oxygenase Tet1 in NeuN positive compared to surrounding glial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S14A–C</xref>). Furthermore, we found the degree of colocalization between pericentric heterochromatin and 5hmC considerably increased as a consequence of Mecp2 depletion. While in wild-type brain, 5hmC is anti-correlated with DNA dense chromocenters, this is not the case for Mecp2 deficient neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, top). Similar results were obtained from line intensity plots of 5hmC distribution through pericentric heterochromatin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), as well as accumulation studies of 5hmC at chromocenters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S16D</xref>). Accordingly, 5hmC is indeed abundant in neurons of wild-type mice, however, only at sites of low Mecp2 accumulation. Therefore, Mecp2 has a local protective effect at pericentric heterochromatin.</p>

<title>In the absence of Mecp2, Tet1 reactivates expression of major satellite repeats</title>
<p>Next, we tested whether hypomethylation of chromocenters (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">B</xref>), which were previously described to be rich in major satellite repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>), leads to reactivation of these epigenetically silenced elements. Hence, we labeled and subsequently quantified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S16A and B</xref>) their RNA transcript levels by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in single cells of Mecp2 knockout mouse cerebella (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Compared to wild type, mean major satellite RNA FISH signals were significantly increased in nuclei of Mecp2 deficient cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Moreover, line intensity profiles of RNA FISH levels across chromocenters of the same nuclei, showed accumulation of major satellite transcripts directly at and in close proximity to pericentric heterochromatin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). To ensure that the observed transcriptional increase of major satellite DNA is not limited to the analyzed brain region, we additionally confirmed its elevated expression levels in whole Mecp2 y/- mouse brain by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>, right). Moreover, we made use of C2C12 mouse myoblasts, which show no detectable levels of Mecp2 and Mbd2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S16C</xref>, top; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>)) and, thus, allowed us to directly test the effect of Tet proteins on the expression of DNA repeats. Hence, mouse myoblasts ectopically expressing the catalytic active domain of Tet1 were sorted by flow cytometry and the transcriptional levels of major satellite repeats were quantified by RT-qPCR. When compared to mock treated cells, major satellite RNA transcripts were increased in mouse myoblasts, congenitally lacking Mecp2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S16C</xref>, top) and ectopically expressing Tet1CD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>, left). Coexpression of Mecp2, however, abolished Tet1CD-mediated reactivation of major satellite repeats and reduced major satellite transcription by half when compared to mock treated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>, left). While transcription level of major satellite repeats almost doubled upon ectopic expression of the catalytically active Tet1 domain, overexpression of the inactive variant resulted in an increase of only 40% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>, left). Accordingly, we conclude that the induction of major satellite expression requires at least in part the catalytic activity of Tet1 and, thus, results from increased 5hmC levels. As overexpression of both, the catalytically active and inactive domain of Tet1 leads to decondensation of pericentric heterochromatin (Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, submitted), we furthermore deduce that the 40% increase of major satellite expression in cells expressing mutant Tet1CD, might be partially caused by reorganization of chromatin to a more open and, thus, accessible state.</p>
<p>Finally, we analyzed expression of satellite elements in triple Tet-knockout (KO) and wild type (wt) mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) by RNA-seq. The median log2-fold change was -0.99, indicating that the expression of most genomic satellite sequences is down-regulated upon Tet1/2/3 depletion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). Taken together, our data demonstrate that in the absence of Mecp2, Tet1 reactivates the expression of epigenetically silenced (major) satellite repeats, which in turn might compromise genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that unrestricted Tet activity may be part of a pathogenic cascade in Rett syndrome, which is initiated by Mecp2 gene mutations that reduce or abolish DNA binding.</p>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrate that prior binding of methyl-CpG binding domain proteins Mecp2 and Mbd2 to DNA protects 5mC from Tet1CD mediated oxidation in a concentration dependent manner, thereby regulating chromatin composition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The underlying molecular mechanism relies on competitive, sequence unspecific coverage of DNA and is affected by the respective MBD protein dwell time on DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Accordingly, Tet binding to its substrate and, consequently, 5mC modification are inhibited and chromatin composition maintained. Hence, we infer that Tet1 activity is likely to vary according to tissue and cell specific distribution of methylated CpG sites, as it influences the binding affinity of MBD proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Furthermore, we propose that the quantity of methyl-CpG binding domain molecules per cell must be precisely regulated to accurately control Tet1 activity. Indeed, either duplication of the <italic>MECP2</italic> gene with increased respective protein level or mutant MECP2 proteins with impaired DNA binding, are both observed in Rett patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>).</p>
<p>As a biological consequence, we measured increased 5hmC at pericentric heterochromatin in neurons of Mecp2 deficient mice with concomitant reactivation of epigenetically silenced major satellite repeats (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Compensatory effects by Mbd2 cannot come into play as its expression levels are significantly reduced in Mecp2 knockout brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). As Tet1 reactivates transcription of major satellite repeats in the absence of Mecp2 and Mbd2 proteins, we conclude that the transcriptional noise increase in Rett animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) is likely to result, at least in part, from unconfined Tet activity and, thus, provide a potential Tet-induced pathophysiological pathway in Rett syndrome.</p>
<p>Since almost all mature, postmitotitc neurons were shown to express abundant levels of methyltransferases Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>), we propose that stabilization or reversion of Rett symptoms upon delivery of Mecp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>) results from re-methylation and subsequent binding and protection of 5mC by the exogenous wild type Mecp2 protein.</p>
<p>In summary, these data provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of Tet1 activity by methyl-CpG binding domain proteins and argue for a role of the MBD proteins as guardians of the epigenome.</p>
