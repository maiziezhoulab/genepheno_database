<abstract>
<sec id="S1">
<title>Objective</title>
<p id="P1">Approximately 20% of women with a premutation in the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene experience primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). We explored diagnostic patterns, frequency of appropriate hormone replacement, obstetric outcomes, fertility treatment, reproductive decisions, and counseling of women with fragile X- associated POI (FXPOI).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Methods</title>
<p id="P2">Semi-structured interviews with 79 women with FXPOI were conducted by a single interviewer. <italic>FMR1</italic> CGG repeat size was determined from a blood, saliva, or buccal sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Results</title>
<p id="P3">The median age of POI onset for women in our study was 33 years. 72% of the women had a <italic>FMR1</italic> CGG repeat length of 80â€“100. Mean length of time from symptom onset to POI diagnosis was 1.12 years, longer in women with a younger age of POI onset and shorter in women who knew they were carriers. After diagnosis, 52% of women never took hormone therapy, started it years after POI diagnosis, or stopped it prior to 45 years of age. 49% of the women had infertility, but 75% had had at least one genetically- related child. Obstetric outcomes were similar to the general population. 46% of women had a diagnosis of low bone mineral density or osteoporosis, and an additional 19% had never had a bone density assessment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="P4">Women with FXPOI are at significant risk for delayed POI diagnosis and undertreatment with hormone therapy. Although nearly 50% of the women had infertility, most were able to conceive at least one child and had no elevated risk of adverse obstetric outcomes.</p>
