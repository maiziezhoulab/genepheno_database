<abstract id="ABS1">
<sec id="S1">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p id="P1">Adults with established diagnoses of serious mental illness (bipolar disorder and schizophrenia) exhibit structural brain abnormalities, yet less is known about how such abnormalities manifest earlier in development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Method:</title>
<p id="P2">Cross-sectional data publicly available from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) were analyzed. Structural magnetic resonance neuroimaging data were collected on a subset of the PNC (N = 989; 9–22 years old). Cortical thickness, surface area (SA), and subcortical volumes were calculated. Study participants were assessed for psychiatric symptomatology using a structured interview and the following groups were created: typically developing (n = 376), psychosis spectrum (PS; n = 113), bipolar spectrum (BP; n = 117), and BP + PS (n = 109). Group and developmental differences in structural magnetic resonance neuroimaging measures were examined. In addition, the extent to which any structural aberration was related to neurocognition, global functioning, and clinical symptomatology was examined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Results:</title>
<p id="P3">Compared with other groups, PS youth exhibited significantly decreased SA in the orbitofrontal, cingulate, precentral, and postcentral regions. PS youth also exhibited deceased thalamic volume compared with all other groups. The strongest effects for precentral and posterior cingulate SA decreases were seen during early adolescence (13–15 years old) in PS youth. The strongest effects for decreases in thalamic volume and orbitofrontal and postcentral SA were observed in mid-adolescence (16–18 years) in PS youth. Across groups, better overall functioning was associated with increased lateral orbitofrontal SA. Increased postcentral SA was associated with better executive cognition and less severe negative symptoms in the entire sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p id="P4">In a community-based sample, decreased cortical SA and thalamic volume were present early in adolescent development in youth with PS symptoms, but not in youth with BP symptoms or with BP and PS symptoms. These findings point to potential biological distinctions between PS and BP conditions, which could suggest additional biomarkers relevant to early identification.</p>
