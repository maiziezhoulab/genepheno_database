<abstract>
<p>We show that in an animal model of anxiety the overall excitation, particularly in the infralimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (IL), is increased and that the activity ratio between excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons (AR PN/IN) is shifted towards excitation. The same change in AR PN/IN is evident for wildtype mice, which have been exposed to an anxiety stimulus. We hypothesize, that an elevated activity and the imbalance of excitation (PN) and inhibition (IN) within the neuronal microcircuitry of the prefrontal cortex is responsible for anxiety behaviour and employed optogenetic methods in freely moving mice to verify our findings. Consistent with our hypothesis elevation of pyramidal neuron activity in the infralimbic region of the prefrontal cortex significantly enhanced anxiety levels in several behavioural tasks by shifting the AR PN/IN to excitation, without affecting motor behaviour, thus revealing a novel mechanism by which anxiety is facilitated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Anxiety disorders belong to the most common mental illnesses within the western world affecting a total amount of about 20% of the human population, a lifetime prevalence of nearly 30% and with a steadily increasing occurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref003">3</xref>]. One of the key areas involved in the expression of anxiety and fear, beside the hippocampus and the amygdala, is the infalimbic region (IL) of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref009">9</xref>], which is the rodent homolog to the anterior cingulate cortex of humans. In contrast to fear, which is a specific in time limited response to a threatening stimulus, often investigated with fear conditioning, anxiety is a sustained negative emotional state, in which unknown or uncertain situations are encountered with defensive behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Studies have repeatedly shown, that neuronal excitability is increased in the prefrontal cortex of patients with anxiety disorders and in animal models of anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref012">12</xref>]. Consequently, mainly disturbances in GABAergic neurotransmission have been associated with the manifestation and appearance of anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref013">13</xref>]. Treatments of choice for generalized anxiety disorders are in many cases benzodiazepine, which act on GABAergic receptors and enhance inhibitory neurotransmission in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref014">14</xref>]. But also contradictory result have been obtained, lesions of the mPFC, or inhibition did not affect anxiety behaviour at all or elicit even opposing effects, i.e. anxiogenic or anxiolysis, on innate fear and learned fear, pointing to a highly complex role of the mPFC in anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>One striking hypothesis for neuronal mechanism underlying various psychiatric diseases, is that changes in cortical excitation inhibition (E/I) balance are responsible for observed cognitive deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Neuromodulatory systems, such as the noradrenergic or in particular the serotonergic system seem to contribute to the development and manifestation of anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref018">18</xref>]. For example, anxiety disorders such as panic, posttraumatic stress, social phobia or obsessive-compulsive disorder are commonly treated by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) suggesting an important role of 5-HT in these diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref019">19</xref>]. As the serotonergic system projects to all parts of the well known tripartite anxiety circuitry, namely the ventral Hippocampus, the Amygdala and the prefrontal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref022">22</xref>]it is likely that the serotonergic system might be potent modulator of anxiety behaviour. The mPFC receives massive input from the serotonergic system and 5-HT affects postsynaptic excitatory, as well as inhibitory neurons mainly by 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref017">17</xref>]. Low levels of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor have been associated with the manifestation and development of anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref018">18</xref>] and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> knock mice are a well established genetic model of anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref025">25</xref>]. A previous study indicates that 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> heteroreceptor expression in cortex and hippocampus is primarily responsible for the anxiety phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref026">26</xref>]. In conjunction, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> knock out mice show abnormalities within the GABA-glutamate system of the prefrontal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref027">27</xref>] pointing again to an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission within the prefrontal cortex, probably mediated by disturbances in the 5-HT system. However, so far the underlying neuronal mechanisms are still largely unknown and despite numerous studies on 5-HT signalling and anxiety, their involvement in modulating the ratio between excitatory pyramidal and inhibitory interneurons activity (AR PN/IN) has not been scrutinized.</p>

<title>Material and methods</title>
<p>All experiments in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Research Facility (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz NRW). Mice were housed in standardized cages and maintained on a 12:12 (h) light-dark cycle (lights on from10.00 pm-10.00am) in a temperature and humidity controlled scantainer. Food and water were available ad libitum. All behavioral experiments were performed in the main activity phase of the animals. Experiments were performed in C56Bl/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory) and in two different transgenic mousselines with a C56Bl/6J background obtained from collaborators. For characterizing the activity pattern of different neuron types during anxiety 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>(-/-) mice (kindly provided by L. Tecott, University of California San Fransisco)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref023">23</xref>] were used. To specifically express ChR2 or a fluorescent control plasmid (td-tomato) in pyramidal neurons Nex-Cre(-/-) mice were used (kindly provided by K. Nave and S. Goebbels, Max Planck Institute für Experimentelle Medizin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Viral vectors and surgery</title>
<p>3–6 month old C56Bl/6J mice were stereotaxically injected with Fluorogold (Thermo Fisher, H22845) for retrograde tracing into the dorsal raphe nucleus (AP -4.5 mm, ML 0 mm, DV -2.5mm, -2mm, -1.5mm), the IL region (AP + 1.66 mm, ML 0.3 mm left, DV -2mm, -1.8mm, -1.6mm) or the amygdala (AP -1.58 mm, ML -3 mm left, DV -3.8mm). Nex-Cre(-/-) mice were injected with AAVs, encoding for Cre depended expression to target ChR2 (AAV9.EF1a.DIO.hChR2(H134R)-eYFP.WPRE.hGH (Adgene 20298, Penn Vector Core)) or td-tomato (pAAV1.CAG.FLEX.tdTomato.WPRE.bGH (Penn Vector Core, Adgene 51503)) to pyramidal neurons in the IL region.</p>
<p>All surgical procedures were performed under anesthesia with Isofluran (Initial 5%, 2% for surgery). Pressure injections of virus or tracer, by customized glass pipettes (tip diameter 10μm), were performed at various depths to ensure proper virus spreading within the target area. For optogenetic experiments a customized ceramic ferrule (Thorlabs, 1,25mm diameter with 230μm bore hole, CFLC230-10) with an opitical fiber (Thorlabs, FT200EMT, length 1.8mm, diameter 200μm) was implanted directly above the IL region for optical stimulation. Therefor the skull was prepared with the primer and adhesive of Optibond FL (Kerr) and the implant was fixed with Gradia direkt—Flo dental cement (Henry Schein, 103322) and cured with UV light. After surgery animals received subcortical injection of Carprofen (2 mg/kg) for analgesia and 0.1ml glucose. Animals were from now on housed individually and were allowed to recover at least for 14 days before behavioral experiments were performed. To identify projections between the prefrontal cortex and the serotonergic system and vice versa, as also between the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala, we injected Fluorogold dissolved in NaCl into the dorsal raphe, the IL region or the amygdala respectively. Mice were perfused after 5–7 days of retrograde transport and injection sites were verified by fluorescence microscopy and immunhistochemistry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>For immunohistochemical analysis mice were perfused transcardial after exposure to different conditions: 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>(-/-) mice and Wt littermates were either sacrificed naïve, i.e. directly from their homecages, or 90 minutes after a 5 minute exposure to the Elevated-Plus maze (anxiety stimulus). Nex-Cre(-/-) mice were either sacrificed naïve, 90 after 5 minutes exposure to the Open-Field, or 90 minutes after 5 minutes within the Open-Field plus light stimulation (473 nm, 20Hz) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Mice were euthanized with an overdose of Ketamin (0,33mg/g) i.p. and brains were post fixed in 4% PFA in PBS overnight and processed in 30% sucrose for cryosectioning. Obtained brain slices (40μm) were washed 3x times in PBS. After blocking in 3% donkey serum in 0.3% PBST slices were stained overnight in 1,5% donkey serum in 0.3% PBST at room temperature with rabbit-anti-c-Fos (226003, Synaptic Systems), mouse-anti-Gad67 (MAB5406, Merck Millipore) and sheep-anti-TPH (MBS502127, MyBioSoure) for the DRN and rabbit-anti-c-Fos (226003, Synaptic Systems, 1:1000), mouse-anti-Gad67 (MAB5406, Merck Millipore, 1:500) and goat-anti-CamKIIa (sc-5391, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:300) for the IL region and amygdala.</p>

<title>Behavioral experiments</title>
<p>We used male mice for all behavioral experiments. Before implantation mice were housed in groups. Each mouse was tested only once in each behavioral test and at least one week was in between different anxiety tests. Trials between groups were always interleaved.</p>

<title>Elevated-Plus maze</title>
<p>For the Elevated-Plus Maze 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>(-/-) mice were transported individually from the mouse facility to the experimental room. Prior to the experiment mice were marked with a green label to be later recognized by the tracking software (TDT). The Elevated-Plus maze consists of two open (total length 33,5cm, 5cm wide) and two closed arms (total length 33,5cm with a 17cm high wall, 5cm wide) all connected to a center platform in the middle. After 10 minutes of habituation to the experimental room, mice were placed at the center of the maze facing the open arm directed to the experimenter. Its behavior was recorded for 5 minutes and analyzed by a customized Matlab routine. For optogenetic stimulation of pyramidal neurons in the cortex of Nex-Cre(-/-) mice, optogenetic implants were connected via a sleeve and optical cable to the light source (473 nm LED, Pizmatix, Optogenetics-LED-STSI). After habituation in an extra waiting cage (10 min) mice were placed in the center of the EPM, directly facing the experimenter. The behavior was recorded and analyzed by Ethovision XT (Noldus) for 18 minutes with alternating 3-minutes off and on trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref031">31</xref>]. In three trials (1,3,5) no light stimulation occurred, whereas in all remaining trials (2,4,6) light stimulation was on. Videos were analyzed by the tracking software EthoVision XT. Time mice spend on the open arms, open arm entries and distance moved in total was quantified.</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>Open-Field</title>
<p>For the openfield test mice were transported individually from the mouse facility to the experimental room. Optogenetic implants were connected via a sleeve and optical cable to the stimulating light source (473 nm LED, Prizmatix, Optogenetics-LED-STSI). After connecting animals to the light stimulation fiber, mice were allowed to habituate in an extra waiting cage, which was positioned outside of the testing arena.</p>
<p>The Open-Field arena is a squared plexiglasbox with sandblasted walls (50x50x50cm). After 10 minutes of habituation mice were placed into the left lower corner, facing towards the center. In total, mice behavior was recorded for 20min. Obtained data was analyzed offline by EthoVision XT (Noldus). Each experiment consisted of four 5-minute trials with alternating light on and light off [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref031">31</xref>]. In two trials (2,4) light stimulation was switched on (20Hz, 1mW) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref030">30</xref>], in the remaining trials (1,3) no stimulation was done. The arena was divided into 16 equal squares, whereby the 4 inner squares build the center (25x25cm). Videos were analyzed automatically with a tracking software (Noldus) for time spend in the center of the open field, entries to the center and distance traveled.</p>

<title>Novelty-Suppressed feeding</title>
<p>For the Novelty-Suppressed Feeding test mice were deprived from food for 24h but had access to water ad libitum. On the testing day mice were transported individually from the facility to the experimental room. Optogenetic implants were connected via a sleeve and optical cable to the stimulating light source (473 nm LED, Prizmatix, Optogenetics-LED-STSI). After connecting to the light stimulation fiber, mice were allowed to habituate in an extra waiting cage, which was positioned outside of the testing arena. After 10 minutes of habituation mice were placed in the left lower corner of the Open field arena (see openfield test). The floor of the openfield was covered with litter and a standard food pellet, situated on a 5x5 cm filter paper, was placed in the middle of the center. Recordings were stopped as soon as mice started feeding, defined as mice holding the food pellet in their fore pads and biting into it. During the experiment mice were either stimulated by light (20Hz, 1,mW) (Liu et al. 2014, Zhao et al., 2011), or only connected to the optical fiber without performing light stimulation. Subsequently, mice were allowed to eat their food pellet for additional 5 minutes in their home cage. Afterwards the food pellet was weighted to calculate the amount of food intake. For analysis time to feed, and time in the center of the openfield during the first minute were taken into consideration.</p>

<title>C-fos expression in the dorsal raphe nucleus during anxiety</title>
<p>To test now whether disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission might contribute to changes in cortical activity patterns we performed immunohistochemical analyses of neuronal activity in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>(-/-) knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g001">Fig 1</xref>), which exhibit enhanced anxiety levels in comparison to wildtype mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We examined anxiety behaviour in two behavioural tests, the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) and the Novelty Suppressed Feeding test (NSF), both tests revealed enhanced anxiety in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>(-/-) knockout mice. In the EPM time spent in open arms (Wt 47.91±6.12s; 1A-ko 31.59±4.34s, p = 0.036) and open arm entries (Wt 10.6±1.25; 1A-ko 7.28±0.66, p = 0.015) were significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s001">S1B and S1C Fig</xref>), while the overall distance moved (Wt 3859.34±979.26cm, 1A-ko 4373±669.08cm, p = 0.487) was not affected at all (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s001">S1D Fig</xref>).

<p>Having confirmed increased anxiety in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>(-/-) we started to compare neuronal activity, i.e. c-fos expression, in wildtype and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>(-/-) knockout mice in naïve (homecage) and fearful situations (Elevated-Plus Maze) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). For this, animals were subjected to either a neutral situation, i.e. remaining in their homecage (naïve) or underwent an anxiety provoking Elevated-Plus Maze test for 5 min followed by additional 90 min in their homecage, in which c-fos expression reaches its maximum. Brains were removed and coronal sections of the DRN and IL were immunolabelled for the neuronal activity marker c-fos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In the literature extensive interconnectivity between the serotonergic system, mainly the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and the prefrontal cortex is described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref033">33</xref>]. To verify this interconnectivity we decided to perform tracer injections in the IL and DRN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Injections of fluorogold in the IL revealed retrogradly stained neurons in the DRN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s002">S2A Fig</xref>) and specific expression of td-tomato in pyramidal neurons of NEX-Cre revealed anterogradly labelled fiber terminals in the DRN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). Vice versa, fluorogold injections in the DRN labelled pyramidal neurons in the IL region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s002">S2C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Once we have revisited extensive connections between the DRN and the IL, we focused our analysis of the activity marker c-fos in naïve and fearful situations first within the DRN.</p>
<p>Our analysis revealed an increase of total c-fos expression in TPH and GABAergic neurons in anxiety provoking situations in Wt as well as in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>(-/-) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g001">Fig 1B, 1C and 1D</xref>). Whereby in all conditions and cell types the number of c-fos is increased in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>(-/-) mice (Wt naïve 22.14±2.06, 1A-ko naïve 43.43±2.47, p≤0.001, Wt anxiety 74.47±5.48, 1A-ko anxiety 141.14±7.8 p≤0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>), probably due to missing feedback inhibition of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref034">34</xref>]. However, ratios between c-fos expressing serotonergic (TPH) and c-fos expressing GABAergic neurons is not changed due to anxiety in Wt (Wt naïve 2.77±0.33, Wt anxiety 2.79±0.19, p = 0.372) as well as in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>(-/-) mice (1A-ko naïve 4.11±0.27, 1A-ko 24.76±0.36, p = 0.238) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Hence no significant changes in AR 5-HT/GABA between naïve and anxiety condition is present in the DRN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g001">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>C-Fos expression in the infralimbic cortex in anxiety</title>
<p>To test now whether anxiety may originate in the prefrontal cortex we examined c-fos expression in the IL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Again we found a highly significant increase of total c-fos in fearful situation in Wt, as well as in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>(-/-) mice (Wt naïve 11.64±0.45, 1A-ko naïve 32.74±1.45, p≤0.001, Wt anxiety 179.9±4.6, 1A-ko anxiety 211.33±5.36, p≤0.001.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g002">Fig 2A–2D</xref>). The number of c-fos positive cells is increased in pyramidal (CamkII) and GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). But now a significant change in the ratio between active glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and active interneurons (AR PN/IN) between naïve conditions and anxiety is evident in Wt mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). In Wt mice the AR PN/IN is nearly doubled (Wt naïve 2.24±0.17, Wt anxiety 3.8± 0.18, p≤0.001) during anxiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), suggesting that a certain balance between excitation and inhibition, in the IL is important in the regulation of anxiety behaviour. Consequently, in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>(-/-) knockout mice this AR PN/IN values are already elevated in naïve conditions and do not further increase in anxiety (1A-ko naïve 5.53±0.42 1A-ko anxiety 4.2±0.18, p = 0.291)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).This would suggest that probably enhanced anxiety levels in 1A-ko and Wt mice is triggered by a change in cortical E/I balance.</p>

<title>Optogenetic excitation of pyramidal neurons in the IL promotes anxiety</title>
<p>To directly probe the role of increased cortical excitation, i.e. elevation of AR PN/IN in the IL, we optogenetically excited specifically pyramidal neurons during the OFT and the NSF and analysed c-fos immunolabeling subsequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). We expressed ChR2 in pyramidal neurons of the left IL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) and implanted an optical fiber directly above the IL to specifically increase pyramidal neuron activity and therefore increase the AR PN/IN of the IL region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). In the OFT we alternated light stimulation with control phases in which no light stimulation occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). Stimulation of pyramidal neurons resulted in decreased center times (Off1 39.49±6.9s, On1 19.87±4.47s, Off2 28.13±8.55s, On2 23.42±9.32s) in comparison to the first control phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). During the second control phase anxiety behaviour did not recover completely, but showed only a non-significant increase in center duration times. Control mice, in which dt-tomato was only expressed in pyramidal neurons, showed no alteration in anxiety behaviour due to light stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). Light stimulation had no effects on motor behaviour (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s004">S4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s005">S5A</xref> Figs) and did not induce long lasting changes in anxiety behaviour (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). Next we scrutinized the influence of excitation of IL pyramidal neurons in the NSF. Now we stimulated pyramidal neurons permanently during the execution of the NSF. After 24 h of food deprivation animals were challenged with a food pellet situated in the center of an OFT. Control animals, expression of dt-tomato with and without light stimulation, as well as ChR2 injected mice without light stimulation showed significant shorter latencies to start feeding than ChR2 injected mice with light stimulation (CT no light 112.42±14.9s, CT light 129.38±22.96s, EXP no light 93.38±17.41s, EXP light 225.86±32.76s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>) as also higher center duration times (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s005">S5C Fig</xref>). While excitation of pyramidal neurons increased latencies to feed more than twofold (EXP no light 93.38±17.41s, EXP light 225.86±32.76s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) it divided center time duration by four (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s005">S5C Fig</xref>). Overall food intake was not changed among groups (CT no light 0.12±0.02g, CT light 0.15±0.02g, EXP no light 0.16±0.03, EXP light 0.15±0.02 CT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). In addition we also conducted the EPM in ChR2 injected and control mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). But unfortunately we noticed that during the execution of the EPM 42% of experimental and control animals fall off the maze. These animals had to be excluded from our analyses. All other animals, which did not fall off immediately had difficulties to walk on the open arms: they regularly slipped off from the open arms and then started consequently to avoid them categorically. Due to this behaviour control animals and experimental animals started to avoid open arms during all consecutive trials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s006">S6A–S6C Fig</xref>). As this observed behaviour was completely independent from stimulation protocols (light or no light) or from the injected virus (ChR2 or control fluorophore) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s006">S6D–S6F Fig</xref>), we think decreased open arm times in experimental, as well as in control mice do not permit to make any statement on the anxiety behaviour in the EPM. Taken together our results demonstrate that excitation of IL pyramidal neurons during the OFT and NSF enhance anxiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g004">Fig 4B–4E</xref>).</p>

<title>C-Fos expression indicates that an elevated AR PN/IN in the IL induces anxiety</title>
<p>Subsequent immunohistochemical analyses in the IL revealed again increased c-fos expression in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in fearful situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g004">Fig 4F–4I</xref>), with even higher neuronal activity in glutamatergic neurons during additional light stimulation (naïve EXP 47.11±3.25, Anx EXP 160.14±10.14, Anx+L EXP 323.38±13.6). In control animals light stimulation had no further effects (Anx CT 231.21±9.93, ANX+L CT 192.11±9.51) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g004">Fig 4F–4I</xref>). Consequently AR PN/IN is increased during light stimulation in experimental mice (Anx EXP 2.65±0.08, Anx+L EXP 3.59±0.1) and did not further change in control mice (AnxCT 2.47±0.05, Anx+L CT 2.38±0.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210949.g004">Fig 4I</xref>). Hence shifting the activity ratio between excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons in the IL towards excitation promotes anxiety behaviour. To ensure, that optogenetic stimulation within the IL does not induce any stimulation artefacts within the DRN, which probably promote anxiety behaviour we additionally analysed AR 5-HT/GABA in the DRN during optogenetic stimulation in the IL. Light stimulation in the IL does not induce any significant changes in the activity ratio of the DRN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210949.s007">S7 Fig</xref>), emphasizing the pivotal role of IL cortex in the modulation of anxiety levels.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By combining behavioural and immunohistochemistry studies we could show, that in a model of anxiety an imbalance of excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitiory interneuron activity in the IL is evident and that optogenetic elevation of the pyramidal neuron activity in the IL is sufficient to resemble this phenotype and drives anxiety behaviour. In conjunction with current models of anxiety our study provides further evidence that a functional decrease of serotonergic neurotransmission at postsynaptic sites and subsequent disinhibition of IL pyramidal neurons may be a pathogenic mechanism of anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<sec id="sec017">
<title>Circuitry of anxiety</title>
<p>Previous studies have identified the prefrontal cortex as part of a tripartite anxiety network, consisting of the amygdala, the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and the prefrontal cortex. Manipulations within this network are able to chance anxiety behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref022">22</xref>]. During the expression of anxiety, activity between the vHPC and the prefrontal cortex are highly synchronized and power in theta frequencies (4–12 Hz) is markedly increased in an anxiogenic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref035">35</xref>]. Adhikari et al. (2011) hypothesize that place fields within the vHPC are well suited to encode the emotional valence of the environment and can provide contextual information to the mPFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref035">35</xref>], which in turn can act on the amygdala to modulate exploratory behaviour. In general the PFC is associated with a role in active inhibition of behaviour (Shah and Treit 2003) and it is an intriguing hypothesize that the PFC is by this connectivity able to modulate the expression of anxiety behaviour. Single unit recordings in mPFC have revealed that neurons in the mPFC encode safe and aversive places in the EPM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref036">36</xref>], pointing again to the involvement of PFC neurons in guiding exploratory behaviour.</p>
<p>Our results are in conjunction with studies that report large increases in theta power and prefrontal cortex firing rates in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>(-/-) knockout and high avoidance Wt mice during anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref037">37</xref>]. Presumably, in our experiments an acute optogenetic increase in pyramidal neuronal activity amplified theta synchrony, which in turn leads then to an enhanced expression of anxiety by the generalization of aversiveness throughout the anxiety probing test. This might also explain, that in contrast to a study by Fuchikami et al. 2015, in which a continuous light stimulation of layer 5 pyramidal neurons over 60 minutes one day prior to testing induced anxiolytic and antidepressant behavioural responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref038">38</xref>], acute light stimulation of pyramidal neurons in all cortical layers during a stressful situation is anxiogenic. Acute changes in pyramidal neuron activity might directly act on anxiety behaviour by modulating the encoding of safe vs. aversive places, whereas spine sprouting in the prefrontal cortex by ketamine or optogenetic stimulation could probably prime the prefrontal cortex to less inhibition of exploratory behaviour.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec018">
<title>The role of the prefrontal cortex in anxiety</title>
<p>Contradictory results have been obtained regarding the role of the PFC in anxiety. Studies report a decrease in anxiety after lesioning of the PFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref039">39</xref>], but also anxiogenic behaviour was observed after inhibition of the PFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref016">16</xref>]. In the course of this conflicting results differential roles of subdivisions of the PFC, i.e. the IL and prelimbic cortex (PL) were proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>Pharmacological manipulations of inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission within the PFC indicated that enhanced excitatory inputs to the PFC, i.e. increased glutamate or decreased GABA neurotransmission and therewith an imbalance of excitation inhibition, support anxiety behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref009">9</xref>]. These results are in tight conjunction with our results and underlie the notion that disturbances in cortical excitation inhibition balance promote pathological conditions and are one possible cause of anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref044">44</xref>]. Two recent studies have revealed the importance of projections and connections to the IL in extinction learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref007">7</xref>] pointing to the complex role of the PFC in anxiety and fear regulation and underlining probably different mechanism in innate anxiety and acquired anxiety.</p>

<sec id="sec019">
<title>Serotonin and anxiety</title>
<p>Numerous studies have investigated the influence of serotonergic neurotransmission on anxiety. One of the most famous genetic mouse models of anxiety is a 5-HT<sub>1A(-/-)</sub> receptor knockout mouse line. This mouse line provides further evidence for a close link of the serotonergic system with anxiety. Pharmacogenetic studies revealed that an increase in serotonergic neuronal activity results in elevated anxiety (Teissier et al. 2015) whereas depletion of 5-HT reduces anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref045">45</xref>]. As serotonin preferentially acts on 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors of GABAergic interneurons, the net effect of serotonin release into the cortex results in inhibition of GABAergic interneurons and therefore in a disinhibition of pyramidal neurons, which is associated with an increase in pyramidal neuron activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref046">46</xref>]. Hence serotonin would be a potential candidate to initiate a transition from balanced excitation/inhibition ratios to enhanced excitation. Our observations of an enhanced AR PN/IN in 5-HT<sub>1A(-/-)</sub> mice is in accordance with former studies, which reported an important role of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors in tuning E/I balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<p>However, pre- and postsynaptic effects of serotonin in the prefrontal cortex might act differently on anxiety. A study by Kjaerby et al. 2016 convincingly showed that presynaptic 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors are able to selectively supress hippocampal and callosal input leading to an inhibition of prefrontal theta oscillations and in turn to reduced anxiety mediated avoidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref048">48</xref>]. It is likely that disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission could cause changes in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity ratios by altering synaptic input strength or by incorrect gating of inputs.</p>
<p>Postsynaptically mainly 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, located on pyramidal, as well as on GABAergic interneurons, are expressed in the prefrontal cortex. Several studies, in humans and animal models have shown that, especially dysfunction of postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors is associated with anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref052">52</xref>]. Albert et al. 2014 propose an anxiety model, in which either too low or too high levels of serotonin will induce anxiety by an increased pyramidal neuron output, mediated by the highly sensitive 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref018">18</xref>]. Our studies support this anxiety model and underlines further the necessity of balanced E/I in the prefrontal cortex for healthy anxiety behaviour.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec020">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our findings suggest that an exact balance between excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons in the IL of the prefrontal cortex is a prerequisite to maintain healthy anxiety responses and that an increased activity of cortical pyramidal neurons can drive anxiety. Follow-up studies have to proof if shifting this ratio towards interneuron activity will already be anxiolytic or if specifically, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> signalling in the IL is needed to maintain normal anxiety levels. Nevertheless an oversimplification should be avoided, i.e. excitation and inhibition might be regulated differently at different circuits levels, for example neurons in different microcircuits targeting other brain areas could be modulated independently and excitatory and inhibitory inputs might even vary at different cell compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0210949.ref053">53</xref>].</p>
<p>Our study further supports that a dysregulation of AR PN/IN in cortical areas, presumably caused by disturbed serotonergic signalling, is one possible cause of generalized anxiety giving new insights into underlying mechanism of anxiety.</p>
