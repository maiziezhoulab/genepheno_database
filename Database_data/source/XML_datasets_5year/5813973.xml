<abstract>
<p>Friedreich’s ataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder, which results primarily from reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. FA has an estimated prevalence of one in 50,000 in the population, making it the most common hereditary ataxia. Paradoxically, mortality arises most frequently from cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure rather than from neurological effects. Decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-l) levels in the general population are associated with an increased risk of mortality from cardiomyopathy and heart failure. However, the pathophysiology of heart disease in FA is non-vascular and there are conflicting data on HDL-cholesterol in FA. Two studies have shown a decrease in HDL-cholesterol compared with controls and two have shown there was no difference between FA and controls. One also showed that there was no difference in serum Apo-A-I levels in FA when compared with controls. Using a highly specific stable isotope dilution mass spectrometry-based assay, we demonstrated a 21.6% decrease in serum ApoA-I in FA patients (134.8 mg/dL, n = 95) compared with non-affected controls (172.1 mg/dL, n = 95). This is similar to the difference in serum ApoA-I levels between non-smokers and tobacco smokers. Knockdown of frataxin by &gt; 70% in human hepatoma HepG2 cells caused a 20% reduction in secreted ApoA-I. Simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor caused a 200% increase in HMG-CoA in the control HepG2 cells with a similar increase in the frataxin knockdown HepG2 cells, back to levels found in the control cells. There was a concomitant 20% increase in secreted ApoA-I to levels found in the control cells that were treated with simvastatin. This study provides compelling evidence that ApoA-I levels are reduced in FA patients compared with controls and suggest that statin treatment would normalize the ApoA-I levels.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Friedreich’s ataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder, which results primarily from reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref003">3</xref>]. Although the exact mechanism of frataxin action has not been completely defined, the protein is involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters, which are important for optimal mitochondrial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref004">4</xref>]. Progressive ataxia is a characteristic feature of FA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref005">5</xref>], although a significant number of patients also experience hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that eventually progresses to heart failure. In fact, heart failure due to cardiomyopathy rather than neurodegeneration, is the primary cause of death in FA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref009">9</xref>]. The heart typically maintains adequate systolic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref010">10</xref>] in FA patients who develop a severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy until shortly before death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref011">11</xref>]. The hypertrophy is associated with a striking proliferation of mitochondria within the cardiomyocytes, coupled with significant loss of contractile fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref013">13</xref>]. Impaired myocardial perfusion reserve, fibrosis and iron overload represent early manifestations of cardiomyopathy in FA prior to left ventricular hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref006">6</xref>]. It was suggested that these effects could be due to subclinical myocardial disease in FA caused by mitochondrial cardiomyopathy with metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, fatty acids are the predominant energetic substrates for the heart, with β-oxidation providing 50% to 70% of myocardial ATP need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref014">14</xref>]. After transport into cardiomyocytes, fatty acids are imported into mitochondria via acylcarnitine intermediates, converted to acyl-CoA thioesters, then oxidized via β-oxidation or re-esterified into triglycerides and stored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref015">15</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Importantly, a prolonged bioenergetic shift away from fatty acid oxidation is a well-described characteristic in the etiology of heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref016">16</xref>], suggesting that this shift might contribute to the cardiomyopathy seen in FA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref007">7</xref>]. A conditional gene-targeting approach has led to the development of frataxin-deficient animal models, which reproduce some pathophysiological features of FA, such as cardiac hypertrophy without skeletal muscle involvement, and large sensory neuron dysfunction without alteration of the small sensory and motor neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref017">17</xref>]. Frataxin-deficient cells from these animal models exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction together with an abnormal abundance of lipid droplets, which suggested a defect in one (or more) of the many steps of lipid homeostasis and metabolism in FA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref017">17</xref>]. In addition, Chen <italic>et al</italic>. discovered that the iron/sphingolipid/3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1)/myocyte enhancer factor-2 pathway (Mef2) was activated in Drosophila melanogaster upon loss of frataxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref018">18</xref>]. In a follow-up study, they showed that loss of frataxin in the nervous system in mice also activates an iron/sphingolipid/PDK1/Mef2 pathway. Furthermore, sphingolipids and PDK1 activity were up-regulated in heart tissues from FA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref019">19</xref>].</p>

<p>Decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-l) levels in the general population are associated with an increased risk of mortality from ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref021">21</xref>]. Cardiomyopathy and heart failure are also risk factors that are elevated in FA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref022">22</xref>]. Unfortunately, there are conflicting data on HDL and ApoA-I levels in FA. Two studies have shown a decrease in HDL-cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref023">23</xref>] compared with controls; whereas, two studies showed there was no difference between FA and controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref025">25</xref>]. One of these latter studies also showed that there was no difference in serum ApoA-I levels in FA when compared with controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref025">25</xref>]. However, the immunoassay used in this study could have suffered from typical problems encountered with immunoassay procedures such cross-reactivity with unknown serum proteins and/or competition with ApoA-I autoantibodies in the serum, which would lead to an underestimate of the ApoA-1 concentrations. In view of the known presence of serumApoA-I antibodies in cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref027">27</xref>], this seems to be the most likely explanation. Therefore, when analyzing serum ApoA-I, it is critical to employ an identical internal standard in order to compensate for any losses that might occur during the analytical procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>The widely-used statin drugs, which increase levels of serum ApoA-I through inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref029">29</xref>], have had a significant therapeutic benefit by reducing the risk for cardiomyopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref030">30</xref>] and heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref031">31</xref>]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 32,258 dyslipidemic patients included in 37 randomized studies revealed that the percentage increase in ApoA-I levels was virtually identical to the increase of HDL levels at all doses of three statins (rosuvasatin, atorvastatin and simvastatin) that had been administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref029">29</xref>]. This raised the potential for a possible intervention in FA if serum ApoA-I levels are in fact reduced in FA patients when compared with normal subjects. Therefore, we have employed a highly specific assay based on stable isotope dilution ultraperformance liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry (UPLC-MRM/MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref028">28</xref>] to compare serum ApoA-I concentrations in FA cases with control unaffected subjects.</p>

<title>Sample preparation for ApoA-I quantification</title>
<p>Recombinant SILAC ApoA-I internal standard was spiked into all samples to adjust for any bioanalytical variability. All samples (serum and cell medium) were thawed at room temperature. A 10 μL of serum sample was diluted 5 times with DPBS. To each 5 μL of this dilution, 5 μL of SILAC-ApoA-I, 3 μL of BME and 7 μL of NuPage LDS sample loading buffer (5x) were added. All samples were loaded on NuPage Novex 10% Bis-Tris gels (Promega, Madison, WI) for protein separation. The samples were cut from gels, followed by reduction, alkylation, and tryptic digestion. The digested samples were extracted by addition of 50% acetonitrile with 3% formic acid and bath sonication for 20 min. An extra step of desalting and concentration was carried out on Macrospin column (The Nest Group Inc, Southborough, MA) according to manufacturer’s instruction. The eluted peptides were dried and re-suspended with 50 μL of mobile phase A.</p>

Quantification was conducted by determining the ratio of the sum of the peak areas from the three most intense MRM/MS signals with the sum of three most intense signals from the corresponding [<sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N]-ApoA-I-derived tryptic [<sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N]-peptide. [<sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N]-ApoA-I, prepared using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref028">28</xref>] was used as the internal standard. It was added to each calibration standard, quality control (QC) sample (22.5, 200.0 and 400.0 mg/dL), and serum sample before loading samples on the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel. In-batch QCs were analyzed on the SDS-PAGE gel along with the FA case samples, and run in the queue every 50 samples. Serum concentrations were determined by interpolation of the area ratios with a standard curve prepared in mouse serum at the same time by adding known amounts of ApoA-I to a fixed amount of the ApoA-I SILAC-standard. UPLC-MRM/MS was performed on a TSQ Vantage (Thermo Scientific, San Jose CA) equipped with a CaptiveSpray<sup>™</sup> ion source (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA). The mass spectrometer was interfaced with a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) equipped with an autosampler and sample thermo-controller (set at 4 °C). Both the UPLC and mass spectrometer were controlled by Xcalibur software (Thermo Scientific). Separations were performed using a Waters BEH130 C18 column (150 μm x 100 mm, 1.7 μm, 130 Å) at 30 °C using a partial loop injection. Samples were eluted with a linear gradient at a flow rate of 2 μL/min. Solvent A was water/acetonitrile (99.5:0.5, v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid, and solvent B was acetonitrile/water (98:2, v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid. The UPLC gradient was as follows: 95% A for 5 min, linearly decreased to 40% A over 35 min, 5% A at 36 min, held to 45 min, then re-equilibrate at 95% A from 46 to 55 min. The MS operating conditions were as follows: spray voltage, 1800 V; ion transfer capillary temperature, 270 °C; collision gas, argon at 1.5 mTorr; ion polarity, positive; scan type, multiple reaction monitoring; chrom filter peak width, 15 s; S-lens, 127 v; cycle time, 1.5 sec; Q1 peak width (FWHM), 0.7 u; Q3 peak width, 0.7 u; dissociation voltage (DCV), 10 V.</p>

<p>A stock solution of simvastatin was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then diluted using culture media such that the final concentration of DMSO added to cells did not exceed 0.1%. Control cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO. The doses of simvastatin used in this study relate closely to blood levels of simvastatin in patients treated with 10–80 mg of the drug. Biological samples were prepared in triplicates. Reverse transfection involving simultaneously transfecting and plating cells was performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX according to the manufacture protocol (Invitrogen). Briefly, the transfection mix including 30 pmol siRNA and transfection reagent was made and added to the 6-well plates. After 16 h knockdown by siRNAs, medium was changed to fresh and cells were cultured another 24 h to get 70% frataxin knockdown effect. The knockdown cells were re-plated in a new 6-well plate, and treated by different doses of simvastatin. After 48 h simvastatin treatment, medium was taken out for analysis of ApoA-I. Cell pellets were used for analysis of intermediates of MVA pathway. Total protein content was estimated using Bradford assay.</p>

<title>Data and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Analysis of ApoA-I chromatograms was performed in Skyline (MacCoss Laboratory). The three most intense MRM transitions of each peptide were selected based on the UPLC-tandem MS spectra on a TSQ Vantage. The peptide ratios were calculated by the total light (unlabeled)/heavy (labeled) peptide ratios of three MRM/MS transitions. The ApoA-I protein ratio was calculated by the average of eight selected peptides. Serum concentrations of ApoA-I were obtained by interpolation from a standard curve prepared in surrogate matrix. Data analysis of HMG-CoA and intermediates of MVA pathway were processed in Xcalibur and TraceFinder (Thermo Scientific). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (v 5.01, GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) and Stata (v 15, Stata Corp, College Station, TX). Descriptive statistics were computed for all study variables including mean, standard deviation (SD), and range for continuous variables and proportion for categorical variable. Nonparametric Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) rank sum test was used for comparison using p-value of 0.05 as cutoff for a statistical significant result. Differences in mean ApoA-I between FA cases and controls were evaluated using multiple linear regression models to adjust for age, gender, and GAA1 length in a separate linear regression analysis, trend in ApoA-I across GAA1 length (in roughly four equal-size groups) in FA cases was also tested. To determine the value of using ApoA-I to classify FA cases from controls, an ROC analysis was performed to estimate the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the associated confidence interval. A cutoff value of ApoA-I that maximized the accuracy (i.e., sum of sensitivity and specificity-1) was determined. Comparisons of ApoA-I level and HMG-CoA in 0.1% DMSO or simvastatin treated groups were made using two-way ANOVA models.</p>

<p>All eight tryptic peptides showed the same trends in both groups. The FA patients on average had statistically significant lower serum ApoA-I concentrations compared with controls (21.6% reduced, rank sum test, p&lt; 0.001). The mean reduction in ApoA-I concentration between cases and controls remained statistically significant at 36.4 mg/dL (p&lt;0.001) after adjusting for age and sex. Among all the samples, four cases showed abnormally high level of serum ApoA-I, which fell into the high range of control ApoA-I concentration. Re-analysis of the serum samples from these FA patients one-year after the initial analysis revealed almost identical values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192779.s002">S2 Table</xref>) showing that samples do not deteriorate on storage and showed that the assay is very robust. Although ApoA-I levels increased with age, serum ApoA-I levels among cases were not correlated with GAA1 length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Unadjusted correlation between GAA1 length and ApoA-I levels was -0.12 (p = 0.26) and the age-adjusted partial correlation was -0.11 (p = 0.31) and the sex adjustment did not make any difference, -0.11 (p = 0.32). After adjusting for age, sex, and GAA1 length, mean ApoA-I concentrations for cases remained to be lower than controls (mean difference: 30.5 mg/dL, 95%CI: 8.6 mg/dL to 52.2 mg/dL, p = 0.006). The generation of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve by ApoA-I in FA patients (N = 95) and ApoA-I in controls (N = 95) revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.72–0.85).

<title>ApoA-I secretion was reduced with frataxin knockdown in HepG2 cells</title>
<p>We did not observe a time-dependent depletion of protein frataxin pools from whole cell lysate for all tested siRNAs, thus for convenience we used the 16 h time-point. Of the siRNAs tested, sFXN#11 resulted in the strongest frataxin knockdown among five siRNAs. Image quantification was conducted only on the biologically active 14.3 kDa mature frataxin (81–210). After 16 h knockdown by sFXN#11, mature frataxin expression was reduced by 76% when compared with control cells (P &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). In sFXN#10 cells, frataxin expression was reduced by 62% compared with the control cells (P &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). However, the knockdown was significantly less than for sFXN#11 (P &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). There was a significant 23% decrease in ApoA-I secretion when compared with the control cells (p &lt; 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In contrast, for sFXN#10 where frataxin was reduced by 62% compared with the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), there was no effect on ApoA-I protein secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p>

<title>ApoA-I was increased by simvastatin treatment of frataxin knockdown HepG2 cells</title>

<title>Modulation of HMG-CoA and MVA metabolite formation by frataxin knockdown</title>
<p>Baseline levels of HMG-CoA (determined by UPLC-HRMS) in sFXN#10 group (117.4 ± 17.2%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) and sFAN#11 knockdown group (134.3 ± 31.1%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) showed a trend to higher levels than the si-NC group (100.0 ± 17.3%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) and in regular HepG2 group (100.4 ± 54.3%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). However, the differences did not reach statistical significance. HMG-CoA demonstrated a dramatic increase after treatment with 2 μM simvastatin in all groups (average 243.3 ± 31.6%). A greater increase of HMG-CoA was observed after treatment with 10 μM simvastatin (mean 317.0 ± 46.7%). We also quantified MVA and its downstream metabolites by UPLC-HRMS. Basal levels of MVA, MVA-5P, MVA-5PP and IPP were detectable before treatment with simvastatin at very low levels (&lt; 3 pmol/mg protein) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref033">33</xref>]. However, after simvastatin mediated inhibition of HMG-CoA, they were below the limit of detection of the UPLC-MS assay (&lt;0.2 nmol/mg protein) in the control HepG2 cells as well as the frataxin knockdown cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There are currently no approved treatments for FA although numerous therapeutic approaches are currently under development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref034">34</xref>]. While there there is no necessity to develop biomarkers for disease diagnosis because it is readily identified from GAA-repeat analysis, there are no reliable biomarkers ailable to monitor the effect of new therapies. We have recently implemented a method that examines the ability of platelets to metabolize labeled glucose and palmitate to acyl-CoA metabolites. Unfortunately, this method is very labor-intensive and requires sophisticated sample collection techniques that are not available in many centers treating FA. Therefore, we have developed an alternative approach that could have wider utility. Our platelet data indicated that there could be dysregulation of HMG-CoA biosynthesis, which could result in downstream down-regulation of ApoA-I through the PPARα pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This observation, together with the finding that decreased ApoA-l levels in the general population are associated with an increased risk of mortality from cardiomyopathy and heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref021">21</xref>], led us to compare serum Apo-AI levels in FA with a large cohort of control subjects.</p>
<p>The levels of serum ApoA-I found in the control subjects (172.1 mg/dL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g002">Fig 2</xref>) was almost identical to the value we obtained for a completely separate cohort of controls (170.4 mg/dL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref028">28</xref>]. It is difficult to compare these values to those obtained previously by ELISA methodology in control subjects because such assays are unable to detect differences in serum ApoA-I between non-smokers and tobacco smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref035">35</xref>], another population at risk for heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref036">36</xref>]. Furthermore, in a large study, the widely used statin Lipitor (atorvastatin) was found by ELISA to cause a decrease rather than the excpeted increase in serum ApoA-I levels with increasing doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref029">29</xref>]. Smoking cessation is known to reduce the risk for heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref037">37</xref>] and a meta-analysis of 27 studies revealed that HDL levels were elevated upon smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref038">38</xref>]. As ApoA-I is a major component of HDL, our more specific stable isotope dilution UPLC-MRM/MS assay should reveal an increase in serum ApoA-I in smokers who quit. In addition, we anticipate that the assay will provide much more reliable data on serum ApoA-I levels in FA cases in the future. The 21.6% reduction in serum ApoA-I that we found in FA is very similar to the reduction levels (20.2%) that we found in tobacco smokers. There was no correlation with GAA repeat length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g003">Fig 3</xref>) but the ROC curve discriminated cases from controls with an AUC of 0.78 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, ApoA-I biosynthesis is not regulated by PPARα in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref039">39</xref>], which meant that a human cell line had to be used to test the <italic>in vitro</italic> effects of statins rather than the numerous model rodent FA cell lines that are available. Furthermore, ApoA-I is only synthesized in liver and intestinal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref040">40</xref>] and so human hepatoma HepG2 cells have provided a useful model system to test the effect of statins on ApoA-I biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref043">43</xref>]. Consequently, HepG2 cells were employed in the present study to test whether frataxin knockdown combined with statin treatment could also have effects on ApoA-I biosynthesis. Statins are inhibitors of the early rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, HMG-CoA reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to MVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Previous studies have revealed that atorvastatin, simvastatin and pitavastatin all increase the biosynthesis of ApoA-I in HepG2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref043">43</xref>]. Additional studies revealed that effects of statins on apoA-I biosynthesis were abolished by MVA, the immediate downstream metabolite of HMG-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref041">41</xref>]. In contrast, inhibition of geranylgeranyl transferase activity or treatment with an inhibitor of the Rho GTP-binding protein family increased ApoA-I biosynthesis through activation of PPARα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>Frataxin protein has not previously been analyzed in HepG2 cells. We found that it was primarily the mature 14.3 kDa mitochondrial form of frataxin (81–210) by specific SDS-PAGE western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) and proteomic analysis. This form of frataxin was expressed at a level similar to that found in human HEK293 kidney cells, SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, HeLa cells, and dermal fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref045">45</xref>]. We also found that HepG2 cell frataxin was readily down-regulated by siRNA techniques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) to give levels of frataxin found in FA patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g002">Fig 2</xref>), which are typically &gt; 70% lower than in normal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref046">46</xref>]. Changes in ApoA-I secretion with or without treatment with simvastatin in HepG2 cells were determined by UPLC-MRM/MS. Cells with a frataxin knockdown of &gt; 70% secreted ApoA-I at a level that was 23% lower than the control HepG2 cells. Interestingly, when frataxin was only reduced to levels that were 62% of normal values in the HepG2 cells, there was no effect on ApoA-I secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Statin treatment caused a dose-dependent increase in ApoA-I secretion in both frataxin knockdown and control HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). There was a concomitant increase in HMG-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) together with a decrease in the immediate downstream metabolites of MVA to levels that could not be detected by UPLC-MS. These data are in keeping with a statin-mediated reduction of geranylgeranylation of RhoA, which results in increased expression of PPARα (a transcription factor for ApoA-I) followed by increased transcription of ApoA-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192779.g001">Fig 1</xref>) as described by Martin <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>Although statins can only up-regulate ApoA-I expression in hepatic and intestinal tissues, the concomitant increase in HMG-CoA levels would occur in all tissues. The potential therapeutic benefit in neurodegenerative disease has not been explored in detail. However, simvastatin reversed the cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and improved cardiac function in a transgenic rabbit model of human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<sec id="sec019">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The finding that ApoA-I is reduced in FA (a disease with reduced frataxin expression) and that statins can induce the biosynthesis of ApoA-I in a cellular model of frataxin deficiency suggests that statins could be used to increase serum ApoA-I levels in FA patients. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> model system revealed that there might be a threshold frataxin level where statins would not be effective. Furthermore, the ApoA-I levels did not correlate with GAA repeat length. Therefore, it will be important in the future to assess frataxin levels in particular FA cases in order to determine whether there is a threshold level required for optimal ApoA-I secretion. We have recently developed an assay to rigorously quantify mature frataxin in human platelets as surrogates for liver tissue so that such determinations can be readily made [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0192779.ref048">48</xref>]. Interestingly, there were four FA patients with serum ApoA-I levels that were in the normal range and repeat analyses confirmed that this was not due to assay specificity. It will be interesting to determine whether the elevated levels in these patients persist and whether have a decreased risk for cardiovascular disease.</p>
