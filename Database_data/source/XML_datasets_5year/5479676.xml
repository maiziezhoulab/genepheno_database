<p>Serotonin enhancement during developmental stages restores autism symptoms in a mouse model of human 15q11-13 duplication.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Serotonin is a critical modulator of cortical function, and its metabolism is defective in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) brain. How serotonin metabolism regulates cortical physiology and contributes to the pathological and behavioral symptoms of ASD remains unknown. We show that normal serotonin levels are essential for the maintenance of neocortical excitation/inhibition balance, correct sensory stimulus tuning, and social behavior. Conversely, low serotonin levels in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice (a model for ASD with the human 15q11-13 duplication) result in impairment of the same phenotypes. Restoration of normal serotonin levels in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice revealed the reversibility of a subset of ASD-related symptoms in the adult. These findings suggest that serotonin may have therapeutic potential for discrete ASD symptoms.</p>

<body><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Copy number variation (CNV) is one of the most prevalent genomic abnormalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>). We previously generated a 15q11-13 duplication model mouse corresponding to one of the most cytogenetically frequent CNVs in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>) and showed that paternal duplication (<italic>15q dup</italic>) mice displayed ASD-like behaviors including poor social communication and interaction, behavioral inflexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>), and abnormalities of cortical spines and cerebellar functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>). We also found a reduction in the level of serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] and in the volume of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), which contains a large proportion of 5-HT neurons providing serotonergic projections to cortical forebrain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). A decreased rate of 5-HT synthesis in developmental stages has been reported in the central nervous system of ASD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>), suggesting a hyposerotonergic state. The 5-HT system also has abnormal modulatory effects on cognitive function in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>), and behavioral abnormalities are thought to result from 5-HT–impaired neural networks, although direct evidence is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>). Excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance is suggested to be disrupted in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>), and enhancement of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)–ergic system rescues physiological and behavioral deficits in ASD model mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>). However, the hyposerotonergic state and its physiological and behavioral consequences (particularly for cortical E/I balance and social behavior) remain unexamined in ASD model mice.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>15q dup</italic> mice have reduced excitatory transmission and glucose metabolism in the DRN</title><p>We initially measured the electrophysiological properties of 5-HT neurons in the DRN of wild-type (WT) and <italic>15q dup</italic> mice. 5-HT neurons were identified by their firing patterns and action potential shapes, along with subsequent immunohistochemistry with a tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph) antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The resting membrane potential of <italic>15q dup</italic> neurons was hyperpolarized compared with that of WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), whereas other properties related to action potential generation did not differ (table S1) and dendritic complexity of 5-HT neurons was unchanged (fig. S1). We also recorded spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) from DRN neurons. The sEPSC amplitudes in <italic>15q dup</italic> neurons were smaller in both ventromedial DRN (vmDRN) and lateral wing DRN (lwDRN), whereas sEPSC frequencies showed no changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, C to E). We assessed DRN activity in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCGM) with a 2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-2-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-glucose ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG) probe. The global brain activity of <italic>15q dup</italic> mice did not significantly differ from that of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, F and G), but a voxel-based statistical parametric mapping analysis revealed lower rCGM in the DRN of <italic>15q dup</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, H, J, L, and M). We also observed increased rCGMs in the hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, H to M), which may reflect elevated levels of anxiety in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice. Together, these results suggest that the hyposerotonergic state in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice is caused by overt low activity of the DRN and may be explained in part by 5-HT neurons receiving a weaker drive from afferent excitatory inputs.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title><italic>15q dup</italic> mice have reduced excitatory synaptic transmission onto 5-HT neurons and low glucose metabolism in the DRN.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative action potential recordings of non–5-HT (Tph-immunoreactive–negative, −Tph) and 5-HT (Tph-immunoreactive–positive, +Tph) neurons in DRN in response to depolarizing current injections of 100 and 140 pA, respectively (left).

We recorded from the somatosensory cortex where the circuit organization is well known to be affected by 5-HT level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>), and patients with ASD show poor response reliability in sensory cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>). Using a transgenic mouse expressing GCaMP7, we measured the reliability of sensory-evoked response tuning in the somatosensory cortex barrel field (S1BF) in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice by transcranial calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The size of the peak response area of the principal barrel to single whisker stimulation (principal area) was unchanged, whereas that of the responded area (surrounding area) was significantly larger in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, B and C). Moreover, the peak amplitude was smaller, and the percentage of its decay slope was slower in the principal area in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, D to F), indicating that <italic>15q dup</italic> mice have degraded responsiveness to the principal whisker. To evaluate the responsiveness of a single neuron to whisker stimuli, we performed in vivo patch-clamp recordings of layer 2/3 (L2/3) regular spiking neurons of the S1BF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, G and H). In <italic>15q dup</italic> regular spiking neurons, firing properties were normal (table S2), but the amplitudes of surrounding whisker responses (S1Ws) were larger than those in WT mice, whereas the amplitudes of principal whisker responses (PWs) were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). In line with the calcium imaging data, the tuning of whisker selectivity was less evident in <italic>15q dup</italic> S1BF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Sensory-evoked somatosensory receptive field tuning responses are impaired in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The right barrel field (yellow open square) was analyzed in the transcranial calcium imaging.

Therefore, we examined whether inhibition is impaired in <italic>15q dup</italic> S1BF. The densities of several types of interneurons in the S1BF were comparable between genotypes (fig. S2). We next analyzed inhibitory synapses by immunostaining for vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). VGAT puncta density was reduced specifically in L2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, B and E) but not in L4 or L6 of <italic>15q dup</italic> S1BF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, C and D). On the other hand, the density of L2/3 excitatory synapses stained by vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Electron microscopy also supported a reduction of inhibitory synapses in <italic>15q dup</italic> S1BF (fig. S3). To confirm these abnormalities at the functional level, we recorded miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and EPSCs (mIPSCs and mEPSCs, respectively) from L2/3 pyramidal neurons in the S1BF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, G to J). The frequency of mIPSCs was significantly decreased in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice, although the amplitude and 10 to 90% rise time were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>). The paired-pulse ratio of evoked IPSCs in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice was the same as that of WT (fig. S4), suggesting normal release probabilities of inhibitory synapses.

To examine this possibility, we administered the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine (FLX) to infant mice through their mothers via milk to increase extracellular 5-HT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) because the previously observed 5-HT reduction in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice was seen from postnatal 1 to 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>). The serum levels of FLX and norfluoxetine (a metabolite of FLX) in the treated offspring were 6.4 ± 6.4 and 220 ± 38 ng/ml at 2 weeks old and 43 ± 23 and 320 ± 70 ng/ml at 3 weeks old, respectively, and neither FLX nor norfluoxetine was detected in serum 1 week after the last treatment. These results indicate that FLX was substantially transferred to offspring mice.

Our electrophysiological results suggest that the cortical E/I balance of <italic>15q dup</italic> mice is shifted to an excitatory state due to decreased inhibitory connections and intrinsic hyperexcitability of pyramidal neurons, which is affected by a weakened 5-HT system. Effects of the serotonergic system on the cerebral cortex remain unclear because 5-HT receptors have heterogeneity in their function and diversity of their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>). Regarding the major receptors, it is suggested that the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor can suppress the excitability of pyramidal neurons and that 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors can enhance interneuron activity in the rat prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><italic>25</italic></xref>), which may be associated with acute serotonergic modulation in the S1BF of <italic>15q dup</italic> mice (see fig. S8). Such serotonergic neuromodulation was focused in the study of regulatory mechanisms in sensory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>). The increased E/I ratio is associated with an abnormal sensory system in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27"><italic>27</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28"><italic>28</italic></xref>), and disruption of inhibitory circuits is potentially associated with abnormalities in cortical processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><italic>29</italic></xref>). Our findings further strengthen these associations, because <italic>15q dup</italic> mice exhibited inaccurate sensory processing. However, the chronic effect of altered 5-HT levels is not well studied at the in vivo circuit level. Thus, further investigation on whether the recovered inhibitory connections ameliorate sensory response in the FLX-treated mice should be undertaken in future studies.</p><p>Our findings also suggest that a subset of ASD-like behaviors, including reduced social behavior and abnormal communication behavior in infant stages but not elevated anxiety in adulthood and behavioral inflexibility, is caused by reduced 5-HT levels. Recovery of the 5-HT system in <italic>15q dup</italic> mice may extend to cortical regions associated with higher brain function [for example, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)]. It is reported that 5-HT exerts a potent control on slow and gamma oscillations through 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors in the rat secondary motor cortex and mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><italic>30</italic></xref>). Moreover, optogenetically elevated E/I balance of mPFC induces social dysfunction in WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><italic>31</italic></xref>). There is a possibility that abnormal E/I balance in mPFC of <italic>15q dup</italic> mice, which is induced by low 5-HT as in the case of S1BF, can affect social behavior and that it can be recovered by FLX treatment. This hypothesis will be interesting to examine in future studies.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Potential for developmental therapeutic intervention in the 5-HT system of ASD</title><p>Our results reveal the potential of developmental therapeutic interventions in the 5-HT system to restore normal cortical E/I balance and behavior in ASD, although it is difficult to simply apply the strategy used in this study to humans.

For quantitative analysis of the rCGM, we evaluated the standardized uptake value of glucose as an index and compared the values between <italic>15q dup</italic> and WT mice using PMOD image analysis software (version 3.4; PMOD Technologies Ltd.). Each PET image was co-registered to an FDG-mean image template created using all PET images in the experiment. For identification of the rCGM, a typical mouse brain magnetic resonance T1-weighted image obtained with a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging system (Signa Horizon Lx VH3, GE Healthcare) from an age- and sex-matched mouse of the same strain was used. To identify the precise locations of brain regions showing statistical significance, averaged PET images made by left-right flipping were used. A broader analysis of the rCGM was performed by a two-group comparison test using SPM8 software (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London, London, UK).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Three-week-old male mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).

For VGluT1 puncta analysis, a total of 150 images at 512 × 512 pixels were acquired from five mice per genotype. For VGAT puncta analysis, a total of 15 images were acquired from five mice per genotype. Using the area selection tool of ImageJ software, 108 × 108 pixel areas (688.75 μm<sup>2</sup>) devoid of somata were selected and converted into binary data with a certain threshold. The threshold was determined to outline as many immunopositive puncta as possible throughout all images with subsequent linearity check, where the linear increase of the number of puncta as a function of the number of image stacks was tested (focal planes taken at a distance of 1 μm).

Mice were anesthetized with urethane [1.5 g/kg, intraperitoneally (ip); 15% solution in PBS buffer], fixed to a stereotaxic stage by the ear bar, and placed under a fluorescence stereomicroscope (MZ10F, Leica). The GFP3 filter set (excitation, 470 ± 20 nm; emission, 525 ± 25 nm; Leica) was used with the EL6000 light source (Leica). Images were acquired using the ORCA-Flash 2.0 CMOS camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) using HC Image software (Hamamatsu Photonics). The HC Image software also controlled a shutter unit to illuminate the skull only during imaging. Images were acquired with a size of 512 × 512 pixels and 16-bit resolution at a 30-Hz frame rate. The left C2 whisker was cut at 10 mm above the skin, and the surrounding whiskers were trimmed. By the custom device made out of a piezo driver, the C2 whisker was backwardly deflected 20 times with a 200-ms duration at a frequency of 1 Hz and 10 times with a 25-ms duration at 10 Hz and repeated 16 times at an interval of 30 s.</p><p>The original 512 × 512 pixel images were reduced to 64 × 64 pixels by binning. The ratio of the relative fluorescent change and the baseline fluorescence (Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>) was calculated by taking the baseline (<italic>F</italic>) as the signal 500 ms before the stimulus presentation. For the analysis of sensory-evoked response area, the principal area is defined as the region that exceeds the mean response in the 3 × 3 binned area around the peak value during 500 ms from the stimulus onset; the surrounding area is defined as the region that exceeds 60% of the mean peak amplitude during 500 ms from the stimulus onset. In this analysis, the principal area size in WT mice was about 0.04 to 0.05 mm<sup>2</sup>, which is consistent with the histological C2 barrel size. To compute the decay slope, the mean whisker-evoked responses for respective periods were normalized to their peak value. Pseudocoloring was carried out using Origin 9.0 (OriginLab).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>In vivo electrophysiology</title><p>Male and female littermates (4 to 8 weeks old) were used. Mice were anesthetized with urethane [1.5 g/kg, ip; 15 to 20% solution was prepared in Hepes-buffered saline containing 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.3)]. The depth of anesthesia was monitored by vibrissa movements and withdrawal reflex to hindlimb pinch. Body temperature was maintained at 37° ± 1°C using a heating pad. The animal’s head was fixed on a stereotaxic apparatus using ear bars (Narishige). After cutting the skin and removing muscles and connective tissues, the skull over the cerebral cortex was exposed. Lidocaine gel was applied to the skin incision. A craniotomy (diameter, 1 to 2 mm) was performed by using a microdrill (NSK) to expose a barrel cortex at 3.5 to 4 mm lateral and 1 to 1.5 mm posterior from the bregma. Subsequently, the dura was cut using a 30-gauge syringe needle and fine forceps. The craniotomy was then filled with 1.5% low–melting point agarose dissolved in Hepes-buffered saline as described above. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) by in vivo blind patch-clamp techniques as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><italic>40</italic></xref>). Briefly, a high positive pressure (100 to 200 mbar) was applied to the pipette to prevent tip occlusion while penetrating the agarose and the pia. After passing the pia, the positive pressure was immediately reduced (25 to 35 mbar) to prevent cortical damage. The pipette advanced in 2-μm steps, and monitoring pipette resistance was used for searching target cells under voltage-clamp mode with a square voltage step (10 mV, 20-ms duration at 50 Hz). When current pulse amplitude decreased suddenly (20 to 50%), quick removal of the positive pressure (following gentle suction, if required to obtain tight seals) resulted in a gigohm seal (&gt;1 gigohm). After cell-attached configuration, whole-cell configuration was obtained by the breaking of the patch membrane using a slow ramp of negative pressure. The resistance of the patch pipette was 5 to 10 megohms when filled with one of the internal solutions with the following compositions: 135 mM K-<sc>d</sc>-gluconate, 4 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, 4 mM Mg–adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and 0.3 mM Na<sub>3</sub>–guanosine triphosphate (GTP) (pH 7.3). Liquid junction potential (7 mV) was not corrected. Series resistance was typically 20 to 100 megohms. Electrophysiological data were filtered at 10 kHz and digitized at 20 or 50 kHz with an ITC-18 interface (Instrutech) and acquired with AxoGraph X software (AxoGraph Scientific). Data were analyzed with AxoGraph X, Microsoft Excel (Microsoft), and OriginPro (OriginLab). Single whisker deflection was performed by a voltage step with a 10 to 90% rise of 4.5 ms to a piezoelectric stimulator with an attached glass capillary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"><italic>41</italic></xref>). The deflection point of the whisker was about 5 mm from its base. The whisker was deflected backward by 0.8 mm for 200 ms at a frequency of 0.5 Hz and repeated typically 10 to 20 times consecutively. The peak amplitude of whisker-evoked PSP was calculated from averaged traces within 100 ms from stimulation onset. The principal whisker was identified as the whisker-evoking, shortest-latency PSP. The analysis was performed blind to genotype.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>In vitro electrophysiology on 5-HT neurons</title><p>Brain slices for experiments were prepared from 5- to 8-week-old male mice as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42"><italic>42</italic></xref>). The mice were deeply anesthetized by halothane inhalation (~2% in air, v/v) for decapitation.

Borosilicate glass-patch electrodes (World Precision Instruments) were used for whole-cell recordings from DRN cells and had a resistance of 4 to 6 megohms when filled with an internal solution of 150 mM K-methanesulfonate, 1 mM KCl, 0.2 mM K-EGTA, 20 mM Hepes, 3mM Mg-ATP<sub>2</sub>, 0.4 mM Na-GTP, and 15 mM biocytin (pH 7.38). DRN serotonergic cells were visually identified on infrared–differential interference contrast images using a water-immersion objective (40×, numerical aperture of 0.80; Olympus). The recorded neurons were infused with biocytin via the recording patch electrode. After the experiments, immunohistochemical procedures were used to visualize the cell morphology and identify Tph immunoreactivity, which is a marker of 5-HT neurons. Briefly, the slices were immersion-fixed overnight in 4% PFA prepared in 0.1 M PBS and then stored in PBS until use. The fixed sections were incubated with anti-Tph polyclonal antibody for 3 days at 4°C. Subsequently, the sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated secondary antibody and Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated streptavidin (1:1000 dilution; Life Technologies) to visualize Tph immunohistochemical labeling and biocytin, respectively.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>In vitro electrophysiology for L2/3 pyramidal neurons in somatosensory cortex</title><p>Male and female P15 to P23 littermate mice were used.

Pyramidal neurons were identified on the basis of the triangular appearance of the cell soma and the presence of a single apical dendrite as well as electrophysiological properties. All experiments were carried out at 32° ± 1°C. The composition of intracellular solutions were as follows: 35 mM K-<sc>d</sc>-gluconate, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.34 mM Na<sub>2</sub>-GTP, and 4mM Mg-ATP (pH 7.3 with KOH) for IPSC recording and 140 mM K-<sc>d</sc>-gluconate, 8 mM KCl, 2 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EGTA, 10 mM Hepes, 3 mM Mg-ATP, and 0.5 mM Na<sub>2</sub>-GTP (pH 7.3 with KOH) for EPSC recording. The membrane potential was held at −80 mV for both EPSC and IPSC recordings. By using the intracellular solution containing high chloride ion, IPSCs were detected as inward currents at a holding potential of −80 mV. Miniature PSCs were recorded in the presence of 0.5 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) 10 min after the establishment of whole-cell patch clamp. The normal external solution was supplemented with 5 μM (<italic>R</italic>)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid and 10 μM 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[<italic>f</italic>]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide for IPSC recording to block NMDA (<italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate) and AMPA receptors or 50 μM picrotoxin for EPSC recording to block GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. sIPSCs were recorded in the absence of TTX. Ionic currents were recorded with an Axopatch 1D patch-clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices) or EPC10 USB (HEKA). Signals were digitized at 20 kHz for recording-evoked responses or at 40 kHz for recording miniature responses. Online data acquisition and offline data analysis were performed using the PULSE or PATCHMASTER software (HEKA). For electrical stimulation, a stimulating electrode filled with standard saline was placed in L2/3 around recording cells. Electrical stimuli (duration, 0.1 ms; amplitude, 0.8 to 5.5 mA) were applied at 10- to 3000-ms intervals. For acute 5-HT treatment, 10 μM serotonin creatinine sulfate was added in the external bath solution. The sIPSC and mIPSC recordings before 5-HT treatment and 2 to 4 min after treatment were analyzed as pretreatment and 5-HT conditions, respectively. The mIPSCs in saccharin- or FLX-treated mice were recorded in the presence of 0.5 μM TTX, 10 μM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione disodium salt hydrate, and 50 μM <sc>d</sc>-(−)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid.

The neurons were held at −40 mV and hyperpolarized with 2-s voltage steps from −50 to −120 mV in 10-mV increments. Whole-cell capacitive transients and leak currents were not compensated for in this recording. The <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> currents were calculated by dividing the instantaneous current measured at the beginning of the step by the steady-state current measured at the end of the step.

The homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000<italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 0°C. The pH of the supernatants was adjusted to approximately 3 by adding 1 M sodium acetate, and the pellets were used for protein quantification. The supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-μm filter (Millipore), and 10 μl of the filtrate was applied to the HPLC system. The system had a 3 × 150 mm octadecylsilane column (SC-5ODS, Eicom) and an electrochemical detector (HTEC-500, Eicom) set to an applied potential of 750 mV versus an Ag/AgCl reference analytical electrode. The changes in electric current (in nanoamperes) were recorded using a computer interface. The mobile phase was composed of 0.1 M aceto–citric acid buffer (pH 3.5), methanol, 0.46 M sodium-1-octane sulfonate, and 0.015 mM disodium-EDTA at a ratio of 830:170:1.9:1.

The total ambulation distance and percentage of time spent in the center of the field were recorded automatically using Image OF software.

Wire cages [11 cm (height) × 9 cm (diameter)] were placed at the left corner of the left chamber and at the right corner of the right chamber. Before the test, each subject mouse was allowed to acclimate to the test box by free exploration for 5 min. Subsequently, an unfamiliar younger WT C57BL/6J male mouse (stranger mouse) that had no previous contact with the subject mouse was placed in the wire cage at one corner, whereas the cage at the opposite corner remained empty. The locations of the stranger mouse and the empty cage were alternated between the left and right chambers on consecutive sessions. At the beginning of the test, the subject mouse was placed in the middle chamber and allowed to move freely throughout all three chambers. During a 10-min session, the behavior was recorded, and the time spent in the interaction zone (approaching time), which is defined as an area within 9 cm from the edge of the wire cage, was measured automatically using Image CSI software.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>MWM test</title><p>The visible platform, hidden platform, probe test, and reversal probe test components of the MWM test were conducted. A circular pool [100 cm (diameter) × 20 cm (height)] filled with water (23° ± 0.5°C) was used for the tests. Each training trial began by placing the mouse into the quadrant that was adjacent right, adjacent left, or opposite to the target quadrant containing the platform (10 cm in diameter and 1 cm beneath the water surface), in a semi-random order. A different order of the start positions was applied every day, but the identical order of start positions was used for all mice. The training trials were 60 s in maximum duration. A mouse that failed to reach the platform within 60 s was subsequently guided to the platform. Four trials per day (25-min intervals between trials) were conducted for six successive days for acquisition of the hidden platform test with the original platform location and four successive days with a new platform location (reversal probe test) rotated 180° from the original platform location. At 1 hour after the end of the 6th day and 10th day of hidden platform training, a probe test and a reversal probe test were conducted for 1 min to confirm that these spatial learning tests were acquired on the basis of navigation by distal environmental room cues, respectively. The time spent in each quadrant and numbers of crossings above the former target site were automatically recorded with a CCD camera connected to a personal computer and analyzed by TimeWMZ software.

On the day of the study, the pups with their mother were moved to the experimental room at least 60 min before the initiation of the study. After habituation, each pup was removed from its mother and placed in a stainless steel cylinder [7.5 cm (diameter) × 7 cm (height)] on the COOL PLATE (NCP-2215, Nisshin Rika Co.

Then, analog signals were converted to digital signals by an analog-to-digital converter (CH-3150, Exacq Technologies Inc.) and stored in a personal computer. The numbers of vocalizations were counted by the recording software (Dasy Lab 9.0, measX GmbH and Co. KG) with a digital filter at 20 kHz to count the vocalizations generated at the ultrasound range.
