<p id="P1">Microglia, the only lifelong resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), are highly specialized macrophages which have been recognized to play a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). However, in contrast to other cell types of the human CNS, <italic>bona fide</italic> microglia have not yet been derived from cultured human pluripotent stem cells. Here we establish a robust and efficient protocol for the rapid production of microglia-like cells from human embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that uses defined serum-free culture conditions. These <italic>in vitro</italic> pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia-like cells (termed pMGLs) faithfully recapitulate the expected ontogeny and characteristics of their <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts and resemble primary fetal human and mouse microglia. We generated these cells from multiple disease-specific cell lines, and find that pMGLs derived from MeCP2 mutant hES cells are smaller than their isogenic controls. We further describe a culture platform to study integration and live behavior of pMGLs in organotypic 3D-cultures. This modular differentiation system allows the study of microglia in highly defined conditions, as they mature in response to developmentally relevant cues, and provides a framework to study the long-term interactions of microglia residing in a tissue-like environment.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="P2">Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Expanding on previous developmental studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, recent genetic lineage tracing in the mouse determined that microglia take up residence in the developing neural tube shortly before closure of the blood-brain barrier <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. They emigrate as erythromyeloid precursors or primitive macrophages from the yolk sac, before further hematopoiesis takes place in the periphery. In contrast to other adult tissue monocyte-derived macrophages, microglial identity is a combination of unique mesodermal ontogeny (primitive myelopoiesis) and lifelong residence in an immune-privileged neuro-glial environment. Their phenotype is shaped by the developmental stages of the nervous system as it transitions from neurogenesis and gliogenesis, to synaptogenesis and network maturation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, to a largely post-mitotic aging tissue in absence of injury.</p>
<p id="P3">Microglia have emerged in recent years as primary modulators of both development and pathogenesis of the nervous system, urgently requiring study. However, unlike bone marrow and monocyte-derived macrophages, primary human microglia remain poorly characterized as they differ greatly from mature mouse microglia, are not easily accessible and current methods employed for isolation likely alter their defining characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic> approaches to model and study CNS disorders using human iPS and ES derived cultures are currently lacking this important component. Robust protocols have been developed to induce human ES or iPS cells to differentiate into the different neuroectodermal cell types of the CNS including neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Protocols recapitulating classical hematopoiesis, followed by expansion of monocytes have shown that myeloid cells can be generated from mouse and human ES cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. However, generation of microglia-like cells matching the recently identified signatures of acutely isolated microglia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and following their non-monocytic yolk sac ontogeny <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, has not been reported from pluripotent human cells.</p>
<p id="P4">Here, we describe an efficient method to generate microglia-like cells from human ES and iPS cells representing a collection of control and disease subjects. Using recent insights into microglial differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, we show that microglia-like cells can be efficiently generated and enriched from multiple ES and iPS cell lines. Expression signatures of these pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia resemble those of purified human fetal microglia maintained in the same culture conditions and recapitulate the recently defined consensus signature of microglia compared to other macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. They perform the functions of professional phagocytes, are positive for microglial markers such as TMEM119, and react to canonical stimuli. Our results provide a system to study the maturation and steady-state behavior of human microglia in a highly defined cellular environment, and their involvement in disease onset, propagation and resolution.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="S3">
<title>A basal medium for the maintenance of human and murine fetal microglia</title>
<p id="P5">Serum-based media have been the mainstay of microglial isolation techniques over the years but these undefined culture conditions may unpredictably alter their characteristics. Building on recent refinements of the work of Brewer and colleagues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> we have developed a fully-defined, serum-free Neuro-Glial Differentiation media (referred to as NGD), the component concentrations of which were adjusted to match those of human cerebrospinal fluid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Compared to the complexity of other published culture conditions, NGD constitutes a single defined serum-free medium allowing culture of multiple neural and glial cell types, as well as other cells of interest. Neural differentiation can be initiated in NGD by addition of a small molecule inhibitor of TGFβ signaling (dorsomorphin) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Neural progenitors can be expanded by addition of FGF2 to the NGD base and differentiation into neurons and glia can be subsequently triggered by FGF2 removal.</p>
<p id="P6">To selectively culture microglia, we used commercially available modified polystyrene (Primaria) plates that allow adherent maintenance of mouse neonatal microglia and human fetal microglia (mNMG and hFMG, respectively) while maintaining the possibility of enzymatic passaging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). In contrast, neuroglial derivatives from neural progenitors are poorly adherent, and thus selected against on this substrate (not shown). IL-34 and CSF1g, important for microglia differentiation and maintenance <italic>in vivo</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, were added to the medium. Both hFMGs and mNMGs died in the absence of any CSF1R agonist, with hFMGs adopting a more ramified morphology in the presence of high concentrations of IL-34 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 1a, b</xref>). Primary cells could be maintained in this medium for more than a month without passaging, suggesting this formulation may be generally useful for primary myeloid cultures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Induction of primitive microglia from human pluripotent cells</title>
<p id="P7">Human ES or iPS cells were grown in hES medium on feeder layers of murine embryonic fibroblasts. Following enzymatic passaging, uniform cell clusters, free of single cells, were used for initial embryoid body seeding. These clusters were re-suspended directly in NGD (without stepwise adaptation) containing 10ng/mL CSF1 and IL-34 (microglial differentiation medium, MGdM) in Corning ultra-low adherence plates. After one week, we observed the formation of two types of structures: dense neuralized spheroids appearing alongside embryoid bodies forming cystic structures, bound by a single cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). When plated at these early stages on poly-D-lysine, the neuralized EBs flattened into typical rosette-forming neuroepithelium, while the small cystic EBs flattened into cell lawns reminiscent of endothelial cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Island whorls could be seen giving rise to three-dimensional clusters of round cells at their borders, organizing themselves in ropes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Proliferation and growth of these structures after attachment is CSF1R-ligand dependent, as they arrested and devolved in absence of CSF1 and IL-34 (not shown).</p>
<p id="P8">The cells at the island borders and in the three-dimensional ropes were positive for VE-Cadherin, c-kit CD41 and CD235a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>), which have been identified in mouse as markers of early yolk sac myelogenesis before definitive hematopoiesis or the establishment of embryonic circulation (&lt;E8.5) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. This immuno-histochemical panel is consistent with these cells representing the <italic>in vitro</italic> counterparts of early haemogenic endothelia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Based on this pattern of marker expression in the cystic EBs, we refer to them hereafter as <bold>Y</bold>olk <bold>S</bold>ac-EBs (YS-EBs). Large domains of the YS-EBs were positive for the master myeloid transcription factor PU.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), which is necessary for microglial differentiation and maintenance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and can induce macrophages from fibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Under phase-contrast microscopy, clusters of cells were seen to delaminate towards the lumen of the cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>) as well as directly into the outer medium or on the plastic culture surface.</p>
<p id="P9"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> summarizes the protocol and the timeline used to generate microglia-like cells from human ES and iPS cells. When harvested and plated separately on Primaria, semi-adherent cells appear vacuolated, round and motile, and stain positive for PU.1, as well as CD11b and IBA1 (AIF1) ((<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). These markers have been extensively used to label or define microglia in various systems <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. These cells can be further sorted by FACS and are homogeneously positive for IBA1, CD45 and CD11b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2d, e</xref>), with the majority of cells physically selected by the growth conditions positive for all markers. We went on to characterize these immature cells and their progeny, which we refer to as <bold>p</bold>luripotent stem cell-derived <bold>m</bold>icro<bold>g</bold>lia-<bold>l</bold>ike cells (pMGLs). The immature pMGLs initially delaminating from YS-EBs are round yet already highly phagocytic, as observed by the uptake of fluorescent latex beads and the appearance of filopodia and membrane ruffles, allowing the capture of nearby corpuscles such as inert plastic beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f, g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movies 1, 2</xref>). The cells are highly motile and will readily tax to and encapsulate foreign bodies such as fibers present in the well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">Initially, EdU incorporation was seen in 60% of nuclei from early pMGLs (2 weeks from onset of production). After 2 months in culture, EdU incorporation showed that less than 5% of pMGLs kept in MGdM were mitotic within a 24-hour period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). Importantly, both primary fetal microglia and pMGLs could be maintained for several months in culture despite ultimately limited renewal potential, demonstrating their longevity.</p>
<p id="P11">To assess the reproducibility of the differentiation protocol, we induced microglia from 20 different ES and iPS cell lines representing a panel of healthy and disease genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), and successfully generated pMGLs from all lines. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 2</xref> reports quantitative output at an early cutoff of 4 weeks, matching the cutoff for NPCs. The cumulative yields are significantly higher. For example, after 8 weeks of differentiation, hES-wibr1, iPS-wt1, iPS-wt4, iPS-ALD4 and iPS-ALD1 respectively generated 1×10<sup>6</sup>, 1×10<sup>6</sup>, 3×10<sup>6</sup>, 2×10<sup>6</sup>, and 8×10<sup>6</sup> microglia-like cells, from 2×10<sup>6</sup> pluripotent stem cells at the onset. We conclude that the differentiation protocol is efficient and robust, though the genetic background of the pluripotent donor affects the kinetics and yield of the microglia-like cells.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Phenotypic and functional characterization of pMGLs</title>
<p id="P12">In culture, monocyte-derived macrophages adopt either a “fried-egg” morphology, or an axial bipolar spread reflecting the macrophage polarization and activation status <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. In contrast, a typical characteristic of microglia is to become highly ramified <italic>in vivo</italic>. To assess the phenotypic characteristics of the cells, we cultured pMGLs in a maintenance medium (MGM) containing high concentrations of IL-34 (100ng/mL) and low concentration of CSF1 (5ng/mL), in NGD base. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 3 and 4</xref>, primary human FMGs and pMGLs derived from hES or hiPS cells adopted an identical morphology, characterized by multiple thin first-order branching terminated by actively motile membrane ruffles, around an immobile soma.</p>
<p id="P13">Microglia were missing from our study of isogenic <italic>MECP2</italic> wild type and mutant human ES-derived neural cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, yet their involvement in Rett syndrome has become in recent year the focus of great interest <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, following controversial findings that transplanted wild-type phagocytes derived from bone marrow could rescue features of Rett syndrome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. pMGLs have the potential to clarify some of the cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous aspects of Rett microglial biology. We derived pMGLs from isogenic male wild-type and <italic>MECP2</italic> mutant cells, and observed that mutant cells were significantly smaller than the wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">Mature pMGLs stained positive for markers of murine and human microglia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, with both TMEM119 and P2RY12 displaying a broad membrane and punctate vesicular expression pattern, consistently with their roles as part of the microglial sensome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e, f</xref>). The majority of pMGLs at this stage were positive for TMEM119, IBA1 and CD45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">We assessed cytokine and chemokine profiles released in the supernatant of pMGL cultures. Unstimulated pMGLs secreted detectable levels of various cytokines and chemokines, including IL-8, CXCL1 or CCL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). Furthermore, the addition of IFN-γ and endotoxin (LPS) triggered the release of chemokine and cytokines above baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a–d</xref>). In particular, CXCL10, MIP1a, IL-6 and TNFα were increased more than 2-fold within the dynamic range of this assay. We verified that this effect was detectable at the transcriptional level, with an increase in mRNA of IL-6 and TNFα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c, d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">These results indicate that monocultures of pMGLs can be a substrate to study the functional and morphological changes in microglia, derived from isogenic parental cells, or to screen for modulators of inflammation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>pMGLs resemble primary human microglia, and differ from peripheral macrophages</title>
<p id="P17">We used the molecular signature specific of microglia, which is distinct from other macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, to compare the transcriptome of pMGLs with <italic>bona fide</italic> primary human microglia. Isolated human fetal microglia and pMGLs were grown in the same maintenance medium for a week (MGM). This comparison is relevant since pMGLs are directly isolated from differentiating pluripotent stem cell cultures and grown in serum-free neuroglial-compatible conditions. We found that pMGLs display a signature strikingly resembling that of fetal human microglia kept in the same conditions. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref> shows that the top GO categories coincide between both cell types. pMGLs differ in the enrichment of gene categories related to the establishment and modulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Tables 4 and 5</xref>). The differentially expressed genes between primary cells and <italic>in vitro</italic> derived pMGLs did not include any of the canonical myeloid ontology terms, supporting their use as surrogate for human microglia. Several individual genes were highly expressed in primary human fetal microglia and pMGLs, consistent with their identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2a</xref>). Among those genes were <italic>CD11b</italic> (<italic>ITGAM</italic>), <italic>ITGB2</italic>, <italic>CSF1R</italic>, <italic>CD45</italic>, <italic>IBA1</italic>, <italic>ADORA3</italic> or <italic>LGMN</italic>. In addition, pMGLs highly expressed genes relevant to nervous system disorders such as <italic>APOE</italic>, <italic>CD33</italic> and <italic>TREM2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Likewise, <italic>HEXB</italic>, a causal gene for the lysosomal storage Sandhoff disease, was highly expressed in pMGLs, supporting the interest in microglial catabolism of GM2 ganglioside <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Neural progenitors derived from the same pluripotent stem cells and further differentiated into complex cultures of neurons and glia (Diff. NPCs, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), express these genes to much lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), highlighting the lack of overlap between these mesodermal and neuro-ectodermal lineages, despite their side-by-side residence in the brain, <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p id="P18">To characterize pMGLs we used a consensus subset of genes that is highly expressed in microglia but poorly expressed in other macrophages, combining the most relevant genes of the microglial sensome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, the unique TGFβ-dependent signature of microglia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and the microglial cassette found to be upregulated in TMEM119<sup>+</sup> microglia during postnatal mouse development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 8</xref> for microglial genes compounded from Bennett et al. 2016). These include genes coding for the transmembrane protein TMEM119, the proto-oncogene MERTK, the phospholipid binding protein PROS1, the putative synaptic-tagging complement factor C1QA, the inhibitory receptor LAIR1, the GPCR GPR34, the ectonucleotidase ENTPD1, the purinergic sensors P2Y12/13, and the main TGFβ signaling partners TGFβ1 and TGFβR1. The expression of these markers appears to be positively correlated with maturation time <italic>in vivo</italic>, increasing in adult animals as compared to newborns <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Conversely, their expression seems to be negatively correlated with time in culture, being highest in freshly isolated cells and lowest in maintained primary cells and transformed lines. Most of these genes are in fact expressed at higher levels in pMGLs than in primary human fetal microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), supporting their identity as <italic>in vitro</italic> generated microglia. Notably, these genes are expressed at low levels in cultured macrophage cell lines as well as in previously described mouse ES-derived microglia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Conversely, genes such <italic>SLPI</italic>, <italic>SAA1/2</italic>, <italic>PRG4</italic>, <italic>CFP</italic>, <italic>CD5l</italic>, <italic>CRIP1</italic> are expected to be highly expressed in peripheral macrophages, and low in microglia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>: these genes are in the lower expression quartile of our dataset. Genes such as <italic>GPR56</italic> and <italic>BIN1</italic> are expressed in microglia and in other CNS cell types, but have not been described in peripheral macrophages. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2c</xref> shows their expression in pMGLs, fMG, as well as differentiated NPCs. We performed unbiased hierarchical clustering of our data against previously published sequencing for primary and induced macrophages. As expected, all myeloid cells cluster away from parental iPS cells and NPCs. Strikingly, we find that pMGLs and primary fetal microglia cluster together, separately from other macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 3b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">In the mouse, several microglia-specific genes appear to be upregulated in brain-resident microglia through early postnatal development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.

<title>The pMGL phenotype is affected by co-cultivation with neurons</title>
<p id="P21">We observed that exposure to undifferentiated neural progenitor conditioned medium maintains the rounded phenotype of immature microglia and promotes their proliferation. We investigated whether maturation of pMGLs in the presence of human pluripotent stem cell-derived mature neural cells would further refine their molecular signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, top panel). Principal component analysis of the transcriptome revealed that primary fetal microglia and pMGLs cluster tightly together along PC1, and segregate away from differentiated neural progenitors cultured in the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The difference between NPCs and pMGLs along PC1 may reflect the main myeloid vs neural identity, accounting for ~77% of sample variance, while the variation along PC2 (~12% of sample variance) may be refined by tissue residency, ECM and cell/cell interactions. To directly test this notion, we grew pMGLs in conditioned medium from differentiating neural cultures (defined before conditioning, with no other variation in recombinant growth factor concentrations). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref> shows that, after 2 weeks, the pMGLs partially shifted their signature towards that of primary microglia along the PC2 axis.</p>
<p id="P22">To test whether physical embedding and maturation of pMGLs in a 3D organotypic neuroglial environment would accentuate their branching patterns and allow us to observe their surveying behavior, we transduced immature pMGLs with a GFP lentivirus and re-aggregated the GFP-positive pMGLs with pre-differentiated neural cultures, at a stage where neurons have already become post-mitotic and gliogenesis is ongoing (&gt;4weeks). The re-aggregates were either kept in spinning suspension cultures to maximize viability, or as 200μm-thick cultures in transwells, so as to avoid triggering pMGL activation from hypoxia of the surrounding tissue and allow live observation. In this context, an entire spheroid or cellular stack is self-assembling, laying down its own extracellular matrix without need for additional scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>, lower panel). The neural progenitors progressively differentiated into neurons and macro-glia (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes), and would be devoid of any microglia without the exogenous addition of pMGLs. GFP-labeled pMGLs, which had adopted rounded to first-order ramified morphologies when cultured on plastic, integrated into the three-dimensional cultures, tiled the volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>), and projected highly branched ramifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). The 3D culture matrix is a cortex-like mesh of MAP2 positive neurites and GFAP positive astrocytic branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). Live Imaging of the GFP positive pMGL branches <italic>in situ</italic> showed rapid extension and retraction of filopodial arbor termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f, g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movies 6, 7</xref>). These results suggest that pMGLs can integrate into organotypic neural cultures, and mature into what is currently defined as resting yet dynamically motile microglia. We note that this magnitude of extension and retraction is not observed in 2D cultures on Primaria or glass coverslips, where non-amoeboid pMGLs only display terminal ruffle movement, on a much smaller scale.</p>

<title>Embedded pMGLs rapidly respond to cellular damage</title>
<p id="P23">One of the characteristics of microglia <italic>in vivo</italic> is their ability to survey the parenchyma from their static tiling positions, yet revert to an amoeboid and actively migrating state in response to injury. Migration towards a site of cellular damage is driven by purinergic receptors such as P2RY12/13, in response to ATP/ADP release from dying cells. We took advantage of our 3D culture system to model such localized damage and observe microglial behavior in real-time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movies 8, 9</xref> display the time-lapse reaction of embedded GFP+ microglia to a focal laser injury (yellow arrowhead at 5′). Microglia reacted within minutes by extending a single long process towards the injury center, making contact with the damaged zone (<italic>t</italic> =20′). They then rapidly migrated their cell body to surround the damaged area. In contrast, microglia away from the injury site stayed in place.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P24">In this work we have established a robust protocol that allows the derivation of microglia-like cells from human pluripotent stem cells. These cells are derived in a defined medium that mimics the serum-free environment of the CNS interstitial milieu, supporting electrophysiological maturation of neurons, proliferation and maturation of astrocytes, and differentiation and maintenance of oligodendrocytes. We demonstrated that pMGLs are highly phagocytic and, based on their phenotypic and gene expression profiles, resemble primary fetal and adult human microglia. In particular, they bypass a colony-forming monocytic stage, are initially amoeboid and capable of proliferation, extensive migration and phagocytosis. They eventually settle into a highly ramified morphology, enhanced by co-culture with differentiated neurons and glia. These cells express many of the markers expected to be characteristic of microglial expression phenotypes, such as P2RY12/13, HEXB, GPR34 and TMEM119. Transcriptome sequence analysis shows that they resemble human primary fetal and adult microglia, unlike other macrophages.</p>
<p id="P25">Primary microglia and cell lines have been maintained for short periods on canonical polymer linkers such as poly-D-Lysine (PDL) + Laminin, but this is also a substrate for neural progenitors, neurons and glia. To exclude the growth of neuro-ectodermal derivatives we used Primaria plastic to positively select pMGLs. It is notable that coatings such as PDL or matrigel can represent another layer of variability between cultures, and their exclusion contributes to the reproducibility of this protocol.</p>
<p id="P26">Macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF1) is a primary actor of proliferation, differentiation and function of myeloid cells, but microglia develop normally in CSF1 mutant mice, though their numbers are drastically decreased in <italic>CSF1R</italic> mutant animals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, it was suggested that an additional cognate ligand of CSF1R is crucial for microglia development. Addition of the recently identified alternative ligand for CSF1R, Interleukin-34 (IL-34) to the base medium improved the morphological phenotype of microglia-like cells. Immature pMGLs delaminate and adopt directly a macrophage identity, with no colony-forming intermediate. This is consistent with our current understanding of microglial development, which supports the notion that microglia derive from non-monocytic primitive myeloid cells acting as precursors, unlike adult bone marrow-derived macrophages, but similarly to some other tissue-resident macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. As pMGLs populate the substrate, they clearly isolate from their nearest neighbors, an <italic>in vitro</italic> behavior which may correspond to the ability to tile the CNS by their <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts. Unlike other tissue-resident macrophages, microglia derive from <italic>PU.1<sup>+</sup>/IRF8<sup>+</sup>/MYB</italic><sup>−</sup> precursors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Expression of the same markers in pMGLs supports this ontogeny. pMGLs kept in mono-culture express high levels of SELPLG, TXNIP, CST3 and OLFML3, suggesting they adopt a relatively more mature profile than primary fetal cells.</p>
<p id="P27">Embryonic microglia, when first colonizing the nervous system, do not display the extensively ramified morphology observed in the adult CNS, instead adopting an amoeboid morphology as they migrate and spread through the parenchyma. Likewise, pMGLs progressively adopt a ramified morphology when cultured in isolation, as they lose their proliferation potential. In isolation, their morphology and function can be analyzed for cell-autonomous phenotypes. We showed that <italic>MECP2</italic> mutant microglia are smaller than their isogenic counterpart: this may contribute to functional differences in Rett microglia worthy of further investigation.</p>
<p id="P28">pMGLs further adopt canonical high-order branching patterns once embedded in a differentiated neuro-glial environment. Their surveying behavior is reminiscent of that observed <italic>in vivo</italic> in the landmark two-photon imaging studies of the dynamic process motility of microglia in intact mouse brains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Furthermore, they respond to localized injury by migrating and encapsulating the damaged area. pMGLs are capable of major and rapid morphological changes, as well as secretion of highly bioactive cytokines and chemokines. It will be particularly interesting to study their secretomes in the context of disease models to which we applied this paradigm.</p>
<p id="P29">It is well established that microglia perform key functions in the development of the brain such as in circuit refinement, neurogenesis, and neuronal growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Microglia mediated inflammation can have deleterious consequences for the brain and much evidence indicates that microglial activation contributes to neurodegenerative disease such as AD, PD and ALD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. In ALD, phagocytes derived from autologous bone marrow transplants likely elicit their beneficial effects by replacing mutant microglia, as they stall terminal neuro-inflammation and demyelination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. In addition, other brain dysfunctions including depression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, schizophrenia and autism have been suggested to involve microglial dysfunction. The availability of a robust protocol to generate and maintain microglia from patients suffering from these conditions allows studying the interaction of neurons and microglia and will facilitate the investigation of these diseases in defined culture conditions.</p>

Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y27632 (10mM, Stemgent) was added to the medium during each of the first 3 passages.

<p id="P48">2mL of NGD was added to 100k pMGLs in a 35mm well and allowed to condition for 24 hours. For IFN-γ/LPS stimulation, LPS was added at 100ng/mL along with 20ng/mL IFN-γ at the onset. 400uL of this supernatant were added to a prepared cytokine antibody panel membrane, per the manufacturer’s instructions (RnD Systems, kits ARY005 and replacement ARY005B). After incubation, the membranes were revealed with ECL reagent.</p>

(<bold>e):</bold> Optical section through a fixed 3D neuroglial culture (without embedded pMGLs), stained for DAPI (blue, top), neuronal MAP2 (green, middle) and astrocytic GFAP (magenta, bottom). Scale bar: 50μm. (<bold>f)</bold> Maximum projection of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary movie 5</xref> (scale bar: 2μm) pointing to rapidly extending (yellow arrowhead) and retracting (red arrowhead) protrusions in the 3D neuroglial cultures. (<bold>g)</bold> 1/5 frames of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary movies S5 and S6</xref>, showing branch movements over 300s. (<bold>h)</bold> Example montage of time-lapse images depicting GFP-labeled pMGLs (grayscale) response to localized cellular damage in 3D culture. Yellow arrowhead indicates the site of two-photon laser ablation after 5 minutes of acquisition. Red arrowheads point to microglia-like cells further away from injury, not reacting to the damage. Bottom right panel represent the color-coded individual trajectories of pMGLs during acquisition, highlighting radial migration towards the injury. Scale bar = 100μm.</p>
