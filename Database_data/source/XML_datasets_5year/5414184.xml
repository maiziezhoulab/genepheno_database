<abstract>
<p>Chromosomal rearrangements are essential events in the pathogenesis of both malignant and nonmalignant disorders, yet the factors affecting their formation are incompletely understood. Here we develop a zinc-finger nuclease translocation reporter and screen for factors that modulate rearrangements in human cells. We identify UBC9 and RAD50 as suppressors and 53BP1, DDB1 and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase 3 (PARP3) as promoters of chromosomal rearrangements across human cell types. We focus on PARP3 as it is dispensable for murine viability and has druggable catalytic activity. We find that PARP3 regulates G quadruplex (G4) DNA in response to DNA damage, which suppresses repair by nonhomologous end-joining and homologous recombination. Chemical stabilization of G4 DNA in <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells leads to widespread DNA double-strand breaks and synthetic lethality. We propose a model in which PARP3 suppresses G4 DNA and facilitates DNA repair by multiple pathways.</p>

<body>
<p>Chromosomal rearrangements, including translocations, are essential events in the pathogenesis of malignant and nonmalignant disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Both germline defects in DNA repair and certain clastogens increase the risk for oncogenic rearrangements that drive tumour progression and therapeutic resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p>
<p>Rearrangements are believed to occur when two DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) fuse inappropriately. Because DSBs pose a serious threat to genomic stability, multiple mechanisms exist to repair them. Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathways repair DSBs throughout the cell cycle by direct re-ligation of the broken ends; nucleotides may be lost or added at the broken ends before ligation, resulting in sequence modifications. NHEJ pathways include classical NHEJ (c-NHEJ), which is essential for ionizing radiation (IR) resistance and V(D)J recombination, as well as one or more pathways of alternative NHEJ. In contrast to NHEJ, homologous recombination (HR) repairs DSBs during S and G2 phases by copying a portion of the sister chromatid to bridge the lesion.</p>
<p>Because they largely result from the fusion of nonhomologous sequences, chromosomal rearrangements are thought to primarily occur through NHEJ. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated that loss of XRCC4-LIG4, the essential ligase complex involved in c-NHEJ, reduces translocation formation between endonuclease-induced DSBs in human cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p>
<p>Chromosomal rearrangements between endonuclease-induced DSBs occur in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> at frequencies of up to 50% (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). These high rates have allowed for agnostic strategies to identify factors that modulate rearrangements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In contrast, rearrangements in mammalian cells between endonuclease-induced DSBs are much less frequent, which has precluded an effort to screen for modulators. As a result, only a small number of c-NHEJ and alternative NHEJ factors are known to affect rearrangements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. We developed a tractable strategy for inducing and quantifying targeted translocations across a range of human cell types. Using this approach, we perform a medium-throughput loss-of-function screen to identify factors that promote or suppress chromosomal rearrangements in human cells.</p>

<title>A screen for modulators of chromosomal rearrangements</title>
<p>Previous approaches to induce targeted translocations in human cells have utilized PCR to quantify frequency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, which precluded the use of pooled loss- or gain-of-function screens. To facilitate screening for genetic factors that modulate chromosomal rearrangements, we established a flow cytometry-based zinc-finger nuclease translocation reporter (ZITR) assay by randomly integrating either a <italic>GFP</italic> or <italic>CD4</italic> transgene downstream of sequence from the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Cleavage of the integrated <italic>AAVS1</italic> sequence by zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and cleavage at the endogenous <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus on chr.19 followed by rearrangement between the heterologous DSBs resulted in transgene expression in 0.5–1.5% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>).</p>
<p>We performed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen targeting 169 DNA repair-associated genes with 5 shRNA/gene plus controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b–d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells carrying a <italic>GFP</italic>- or <italic>CD4</italic> reporter were transduced with individual shRNAs at high multiplicity of infection and then pooled. After 7 days, ZFNs were delivered by adenovirus and transgene-positive cells were flow-sorted 48 h later. In total, we performed 7 replicates (3 GFP-reporter and 4 CD4-reporter) with 2.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> shRNA-expressing cells per replicate. We quantified the representation of individual shRNAs within transgene-positive and transgene-negative populations by massively parallel sequencing and compared the abundance of each shRNA in these two populations.</p>
<p>Of the 169 genes, 5 merited further consideration, based on ≥2 shRNAs with ≥2 fold change in the same direction compared to controls, without causing significant toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). It is likely that additional factors assayed in the screen are capable of affecting translocation frequency but did not meet our threshold for further consideration because of either incomplete gene suppression (for example, KU70; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>) or excessive toxicity from the shRNA (for example, MRE11 or RFC1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>
<p>To validate the five hits in a separate lineage, we performed the ZITR assay in HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cells and confirmed that all five hits affected rearrangement frequency as expected. Specifically, RAD50 and UBC9 suppressed rearrangements, while 53BP1, DDB1 and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase 3 (PARP3) promoted them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a–e</xref>). In validation, all 5 (100%) genes met the criteria of ≥3 shRNAs resulting in the predicted phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>) without causing significant changes in cell cycle distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). We observed striking correlations between the extent of knockdown and fold effect on rearrangement frequency, with <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;0.5 for 3 of the 5 factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, multiple factors from diverse protein families have dose-dependent effects on chromosomal rearrangements.</p>
<p>Among the five factors, <italic>rad50</italic> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) and <italic>ubc9</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) were previously identified as suppressors of translocations in yeast. 53BP1 is known to promote long-range end-joining events, including class switch recombination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. However, DDB1 and PARP3 have not been previously implicated as promoters of chromosomal rearrangements.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>PARP3 promotes rearrangements across lineages and reporters</title>
<p>We elected to focus on PARP3, as it has druggable catalytic activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> and is dispensable for murine and cellular viability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The PARP family of 17 proteins contains 3 enzymes (PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3) that have been implicated in DNA repair. PARP3 is known to cooperate in the recruitment of DNA repair factors, including mediators of c-NHEJ, and PARP3 loss delays the repair of DSBs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. A recent study catalogued PARylation targets of PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3; PARP3 had the highest number of total targets and only ∼10% of these were shared with the other PARP enzymes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, indicating unique but poorly elucidated cellular roles for PARP3.</p>
<p>Three different <italic>PARP3</italic> shRNAs reduced chromosomal rearrangement frequency between 60 and 70% in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). We considered multiple ways in which this observation could be the result of a confounding effect from PARP3 knockdown. Importantly, PARP3 knockdown did not affect either: (1) the extent of cleavage at the targeted locus 18 h after ZFN transduction, (2) cell cycle distribution, (3) the number of basal DSBs (that is, without ZFN transduction), or (4) the ability of IR to induce cell cycle checkpoint activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a–c</xref>). PARP3 re-expression after depletion with an untranslated region-directed shRNA rescued the shRNA effect on rearrangements (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3d,e</xref>). Notably, overexpression of PARP3 did not further increase rearrangement frequency above the frequency in cells transduced with control shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>). To test the effects from complete PARP3 loss, we generated <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> A549 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>) carrying the <italic>AAVS1</italic> ZITR. As expected, re-expression of wild-type PARP3 in these cells increased the frequency of ZFN-induced rearrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f,g</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we devised a CRISPR translocation reporter (CRITR) assay in unmodified 293T human embryonic kidney cells by targeting CAS9-mediated DSBs downstream of the constitutively expressed <italic>CD71</italic> promoter on chr.3 and upstream of the non-expressed <italic>CD4</italic>-coding sequence on chr.12. Translocation between these DSBs results in aberrant CD4 expression on der(3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h,i</xref>). <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells had significantly reduced translocation frequency compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3k,l</xref>). As with the ZFNs, loss of PARP3 did not affect the extent of cleavage by CAS9 at the target site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3m</xref>). <italic>PARP3</italic> knockdown had a similar effect on translocations to <italic>PARP3</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4e,f</xref>). We also generated 293T cells lacking either <italic>53BP1</italic> or <italic>LIG4</italic>. These cells had a similar decrease in translocation frequency using the CRITR as <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3k–o</xref>); the reduced frequency of translocations was in <italic>LIG4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells was previously shown using a PCR-based assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p>
<p>PARP3 is known to localize to laser-induced DNA damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. To confirm that PARP3 localizes to a single, targeted DSB, we used CAS9-based transgenesis to knock-in a haemagglutinin (HA) tag at the endogenous <italic>PARP3</italic> locus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using an anti-HA antibody confirmed that PARP3 accumulates at sequences flanking a CAS9-mediated DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3p</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4g</xref>).</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>PARP3 loss sensitizes cells to pyridostatin</title>
<p>To further explore the mechanism of PARP3 in mediating DSB repair, we next determined the sensitivity of <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> A549 cells to genotoxins with distinct effects on DNA. <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> A549 cells were not significantly sensitive to IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), as previously shown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and were only slightly sensitive to etoposide and bleomycin at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>), as previously shown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p>
<p>In contrast, <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells were profoundly sensitive to pyridostatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>) and PhenDC3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4h</xref>), small molecules that stabilize G quadruplex (G4) DNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. G4 DNA is a secondary structure that can form in single-stranded guanine-rich DNA sequences. G4 DNA structures arise when four guanine bases interact through non-Watson–Crick base pairing to form planar G-tetrads that can stack into thermodynamically stable structures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Estimates of the occurrence of G4 DNA in the human genome range from ∼375,000 from computational predictions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> to &gt;700,000 experimentally observed G4 DNA structures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. G4 DNA can obstruct replication and repair<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. In fact, pyridostatin leads to cell cycle arrest by inducing replication- and transcription-dependent DNA damage that preferentially, but not exclusively, occurs within gene bodies enriched for G-quadruplex forming sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Although pyridostatin is an imperfect tool for studying G4 DNA, two recent studies have reported clear enrichments for G4 motifs at sites of pyridostatin-induced damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> and pyridostatin binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Therefore, we used pyridostatin as a tool to preferentially target regions that are enriched for G4 DNA. Furthermore, the observation that <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells are also sensitive to PhenDC3, a structurally distinct G4 DNA ligand, lends support to the hypothesis that <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells are preferentially susceptible to stabilization of G4 DNA.</p>
<p>At a concentration of 2.5 μM, pyridostatin reduced colony formation of wild-type A549 cells by &lt;1 log<sub>10</sub> but completely eliminated colony formation of <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). The pyridostatin sensitivity of <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells was complemented by re-expression of PARP3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4i,j</xref>). Knockdown of PARP3 with short interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in pyridostatin sensitivity that was similar to the <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4k</xref>). In contrast, siRNA knockdown of either PARP1 or PARP2 did not increase sensitivity to pyridostatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent study demonstrated that PARP1 can influence transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, raising the possibility that the DNA repair abnormalities we observed are related to alterations in transcription from loss of PARP3. To agnostically assess transcriptional effects, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of wild-type and <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells in the presence or absence of pyridostatin. We found that only 61 genes were significantly differentially expressed between wild-type and <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> A549 cells in the absence of pyridostatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). We performed gene ontology enrichment analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and KEGG pathway analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> using this 61 gene signature, which did not identify any pathways that would explain the observed sensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Next, we compared the differentially expressed genes in the pyridostatin-treated wild-type and <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells, which identified only 64 differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). These genes were highly overlapping with those identified in the absence of pyridostatin, suggesting relatively minor differences in the transcriptional response to pyridostatin across genotypes. Again, neither gene ontology enrichment analysis nor KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes following pyridostatin treatment revealed any pathways that might explain the observed phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 6b and 8</xref>). Thus, and in contrast with PARP1, PARP3 does not appear to serve a major regulatory role in transcription, at least within our experimental system.</p>
<p>To test whether the effect on pyridostatin resistance depends on PARP3 catalytic activity, we treated wild-type cells with ME0328, a PARP3-specific inhibitor that inhibits PARP3 with sevenfold greater potency compared with PARP1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). ME0328 (3 μM) did not elicit any cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>), but the same concentration sensitized cells to pyridostatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>).

In addition, BLM facilitates replication through G4 DNA in telomeric sequences <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. However, the role of BLM in promoting DSB repair specifically within regions that harbour abundant G4 DNA remains unclear. On the basis of the <italic>in vitro</italic> data, one possibility is that BLM facilitates the repair of DSBs within G4-rich regions by unwinding secondary DNA structures. We examined the recruitment of BLM to a CRISPR-CAS9-targeted DSB in the <italic>CD4</italic> locus by ChIP. We selected the <italic>CD4</italic> locus because two different <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms (QGRS and Quadbase2) predicted that the <italic>CD4</italic> locus contains abundant guanine-rich repeats predicted to form G4 DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Furthermore, a genome-wide sequencing-based study reported a high concentration of G4 DNA at this locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p>
<p>After induction of a DSB at the <italic>CD4</italic> locus, BLM recruitment was significantly increased in <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells by ChIP relative to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h</xref>). One possible explanation for this finding is that BLM is recruited to unwind G4 DNA that is more abundant in <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells. We validated the ChIP signal given by the BLM antibody by immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>) and by using an siRNA specificity control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9c</xref>). Consistent with the finding at a single DSB, overall chromatin-bound BLM was increased in <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells in the absence of exogenous damage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9f,g</xref>). If recruitment of BLM in <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells is dependent on the presence of G4 DNA, it would follow that PARP3 status would not influence the recruitment of BLM to a CRISPR-CAS9-targeted DSB at a locus with minimal G4 DNA. In contrast to the <italic>CD4</italic> locus, the oestrogen receptor 1 (<italic>ESR1</italic>) locus is predicted and observed to contain relatively little G4 DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4i</xref>). As predicted, we found that there was no significant difference between the recruitment of BLM to a DSB in <italic>ESR1</italic> between wild-type and <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4j</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent study described hf2, an engineered single-chain antibody specific for G4 DNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. To validate hf2 at sites of enriched G4 DNA in our experimental system, we tested loci previously characterized for G4 DNA content: (1) telomeric DNA features the most abundant G4 DNA in the cell, (2) the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter is known to contain abundant G4 DNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9h</xref>), as mentioned above, (3) the <italic>ESR1</italic> enhancer locus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4i</xref>) and two loci on chromosomes 8 and 22 that are predicted and observed to contain very little G4 DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9i,j</xref>). Following IP with hf2 using pyridostatin-treated 293T cells, we observed no enrichment at the <italic>ESR1</italic>, chr8 and chr22 loci, but significant enrichments at the <italic>MYC</italic> promoter and at telomeres in the absence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4k</xref>). We therefore measured the G4 DNA content at the <italic>CD4</italic> locus following induction of a targeted DSB following treatment with pyridostatin. G4 DNA was enriched to a greater extent in <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells compared to wild-type cells at sites flanking the DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4l</xref>).

<p>On the basis of the increased sensitivity of <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells to pyridostatin, we hypothesized that ligand-stabilized G4 structures would result in more extensive DSBs. To test this, we performed immunofluorescence (IF) to quantify γH2AX and 53BP1 foci following pyridostatin treatment. <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells exhibited significantly more γH2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>) and 53BP1 foci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10b,c</xref>) at earlier time points with a high degree of co-localization between damage markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). This effect was reversed by ectopic expression of PARP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 10d,e and 12</xref>).

<title>PARP3 promotes CtIP and RPA deposition at DNA DSBs</title>
<p>We hypothesized that the increased prevalence of G4 structures in PARP3-deficient cells would suppress binding by the endonuclease CtIP, which converts DSB ends into single-stranded DNA tails that are intermediates for HR. In fact, the efficiency of HR at a single DSB was reduced in PARP3-depleted cells containing a HR reporter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10f–h</xref>), consistent with a previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Cutting by CAS9 at the <italic>CD4</italic> locus was similar in wild-type and <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>), but <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells had less CtIP accumulation flanking the DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The ChIP signal given by the CtIP antibody was validated by IP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9d</xref>) and siRNA specificity control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9e</xref>). Processing by CtIP facilitates deposition of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA. <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells also had reduced RPA deposition around the targeted DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>) but significantly increased γH2AX signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). The latter finding is consistent with a report that depletion of PARP3 leads to the persistence of γH2AX foci<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. In contrast, we did not observe any significant PARP3-dependent differences in CtIP or RPA deposition or γH2AX signal at a targeted DSB in <italic>ESR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 14a–c</xref>), where little or no G4 DNA is expected to form.</p>
<p>To further support these findings, we examined RPA occupancy following targeted DSBs at six additional loci: three in G4-rich regions and three in G4-poor regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>). We observed that RPA deposition was significantly reduced in <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells near DSBs in G4-rich regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 15a–c,g–i</xref>) but not affected by PARP3 deficiency in G4-poor regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 15d–e,j–l</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm these findings using an orthogonal method, we performed IF microscopy for RPA at 2 h after 10 Gy IR. Compared to wild-type cells, fewer <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells had both γH2AX and RPA foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e,f</xref>). We observed the same reduction in <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells with double-positive foci after synchronizing the cells in S-phase by serum starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 16a</xref>). Thus, the reduction in RPA foci was not attributable to alterations in cell cycle. Together, these data suggest that PARP3 deficiency inhibits CtIP and RPA deposition at DSBs in G4-rich regions, perhaps leading to a delay in repair as evidenced by persistent γH2AX signal.</p>

<title>PARP3 and BLM cooperate to promote NHEJ</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that PARP3 loss reduces the efficiency of NHEJ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, which delays the repair of IR-induced DNA damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.

<p>We used siRNA to deplete BLM in wild-type and <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells, and measured the kinetics of IR-induced 53BP1 and γH2AX foci. Deficiency of either PARP3 or BLM decreased the formation of 53BP1 foci between 1 and 6 h after 10 Gy IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,c</xref>). Knockdown of BLM in <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells further suppressed 53BP1 focus formation after IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,c</xref>). Knockdown of BLM in <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells also resulted in significantly more γH2AX foci as early as 1 h following 10 Gy compared to cells lacking BLM or PARP3 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b,c</xref>). In wild-type cells and in cells lacking either BLM or PARP3, 40% or more of γH2AX and 53BP1 were co-localized, compared to &lt;10% of foci in <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells with BLM knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 16e</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We performed a medium-throughput screen for genetic factors that modulate the formation of chromosomal rearrangements. We identified and validated two genes that suppress (<italic>UBC9</italic> and <italic>RAD50</italic>) and three genes that promote (<italic>53BP1</italic>, <italic>DDB1</italic> and <italic>PARP3</italic>) chromosomal rearrangements. The results of our screen are useful both for significantly expanding the catalogue of factors involved in rearrangements in human cells and for demonstrating the feasibility of genetic screening for factors involved in rare chromosomal events. On the basis of our stringent definition of ‘hits’, all five factors validated in an alternate cell lineage, but the stringent definition likely resulted in multiple false-negatives. Importantly, we intentionally utilized shRNA-based knockdown rather than CRISPR-based knockout for the screen, as this allowed for the identification of factors required for viability (for example, DDB1) and the assessment of dosage effects.</p>
<p>We examined PARP3 in detail and observed that, as previously reported, PARP3-deficient cells had reduced efficiencies of both HR and NHEJ but relatively little or no sensitivity to traditional DSB-inducing agents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a–c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 10g,h and 16c,d</xref>). This creates a conundrum, as cells must presumably either repair DSBs, arrest or undergo apoptosis. A key insight came from the finding that PARP3-deficient cells are highly sensitive to pyridostatin and PhenDC3, small molecules that preferentially but not exclusively stabilize and damage regions of G4 DNA. This raised the possibility that PARP3-deficient cells are susceptible to G4 DNA-mediated damage. In fact, <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells had increased G4 DNA compared to wild-type cells at sites flanking DSBs within G4-rich regions. Taken together, these findings suggest that <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells accumulate more G4 DNA than wild-type cells. Of note, the EJ5 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>) and DR-GFP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref> reporters used to measure NHEJ and HDR, respectively, contain high concentrations of sequence predicted to form G4 DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 16f,g</xref>).</p>
<p>We propose a model in which the existence of G4 DNA delays but does not prevent the repair of DSBs in the absence of PARP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). There are several aspects of the model that require experimental clarification: (1) As discussed above, the specificity of G4 DNA ligands is imperfect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Therefore, it will be important to conclusively define the mechanism of sensitization to pyridostatin and PhenDC3 in the absence of PARP3. The RNA-seq experiments described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 5–8</xref> represent an important first step but further experiments are needed. (2) The role of BLM helicase at DNA DSBs within G4-rich regions remains unclear. We have shown that BLM accumulates to a greater extent in the absence of PARP3 at a DNA DSB targeted to a region of abundant G4 DNA potential. Given that BLM has been shown to unwind G4 DNA <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, one possibility is that BLM unwinds G4 DNA in the context of DSBs <italic>in vivo</italic> as well. However, several other functions for BLM have been reported during repair of DSBs including unwinding Holliday junctions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>, promoting DNA DSB resection by recruiting EXO1 and DNA2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>), and blocking recombination by disrupting RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. Further experiments are required to distinguish between these mechanistic possibilities. (3) Our data showing PARP3-dependent differences in accumulation of G4 DNA and BLM helicase at DNA DSBs is based on profiling of two targeted loci: one with high G4 DNA potential (<italic>CD4</italic>) and one lacking the potential to form G4 DNA structures (<italic>ESR1</italic>). Altogether, our data showing PARP3-dependent differences in RPA accumulation assessed eight loci with varying G4 DNA potential; however, this remains a relatively small set of loci. Therefore, to strengthen our model and overcome potential artefacts resulting from comparison of a small number of loci, data from a larger set of loci with varying G4 DNA content is needed. Techniques that will allow profiling of the PARP3 dependency of G4 DNA in a genome-wide manner were recently reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. The combination of these techniques with a larger set of targeted DNA DSBs will provide important future data to refine or even refute our model. (4) Further experiments are needed to determine the extent to which PARP3 plays a role in G4 DNA resolution in the absence of damage, at sites of damage other than DSBs (for example, interstrand crosslinks), and in species other than humans.</p>
<p>Recent studies have begun to shed light on the role of chromatin structure in G4 DNA formation. For example, ATRX, a member of the SWI–SNF nucleosome remodelling complex, binds specifically to G4 DNA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. A recent study identified PARP3-specific targets of mono(ADP)ribosylation, including several histones and chromatin-bound factors; among the latter was ATRX<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. One possible hypothesis generated by our data is that PARP3 modifies chromatin structure to establish an environment that limits G4 DNA.</p>
<p>As previously reported, PARP3-deficient cells were not sensitized to IR but were partially sensitized to bleomycin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Bleomycin has been shown to preferentially induce DSBs near DNA secondary structures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref> and in particular in telomeric regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>. Therefore, bleomycin could be selectively targeting DNA DSBs to regions with abundant G4 DNA, and thereby confer a slight sensitivity in PARP3-deficient cells.</p>
<p>Several additional questions remain unanswered by our findings. First, are the suppression of NHEJ and binding of CtIP and RPA by PARP3 loss mechanistically linked to the lower frequency of chromosomal rearrangements in cells lacking PARP3? Although significant, the reduced binding of RPA at the targeted break in the <italic>CD4</italic> locus in <italic>PARP3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells was modest and thus bears further exploration in other systems. How does PARP3 catalytic and/or scaffold function mediate the suppression of G4 structures on chromatin in the presence of DNA damage? Finally, does PARP3 inhibition have a therapeutic role, either alone or in combination with G4-stabilizing therapeutics? In fact, G4 DNA structures are enriched in proto-oncogenes such as <italic>MYC</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>, suggesting the potential for simultaneously targeting of DNA damage and modulating oncogene expression. Small molecules that bind G4 structures have shown promise in early studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>. Certain malignancies, including those of the stomach and liver, have abundant G4 DNA relative to the surrounding stromal tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref> and may therefore be ideal targets for G4 DNA ligands. Selective PARP3 inhibitors could represent a tractable strategy to combine with G4 DNA ligands to exacerbate G4 DNA formation, DSB induction and tumour cell death.</p>

<title>Model of PARP3 regulation of G4 DNA at DNA DSBs.</title>
<p>PARP3 negatively regulates G4 DNA after DNA DSBs to facilitate repair of the damage (left). In the absence of PARP3, G4 DNA accumulates at sites of damage and delays repair of DSBs by preventing deposition of repair factors.</p>
