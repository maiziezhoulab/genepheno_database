<abstract>
<p>HepaCAM (GlialCAM) is frequently deleted in carcinomas, and reintroduction of hepaCAM into transformed cell lines reduces cellular growth and induces senescence. Mutations in <italic>HEPACAM</italic> give rise to the neurodegenerative disease megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) since mutated hepaCAM prevents shuttling of MLC1 protein to astrocytic junctions in the plasma membrane. Here we identify that hepaCAM associates with connexin 43, a main component of gap junctions, and enhances connexin 43 localization to the plasma membrane at cellular junctions. HepaCAM also increases the levels of connexin 43, not by enhancing its transcription but by stabilizing connexin 43 protein. In the absence of hepaCAM, connexin 43 undergoes a faster degradation via the lysosomal pathway while proteasomal degradation seems not to be involved. Mutations in hepaCAM that cause MLC, or neutralization of hepaCAM by antibodies disrupt its association with connexin 43 at cellular junctions. By discovering the requirement of hepaCAM for localizing connexin 43, a well-established tumor suppressor, to cellular junctions and stabilizing it there, this study suggests a mechanism by which deletion of hepaCAM may support tumor progression.</p>

<body>
<p>Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are cell surface proteins that mediate cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell-cell interactions. These molecules with tightly-regulated expression are essential for the development and maintenance of tissue architecture. Besides mediating cell adhesion, there is increasing evidence that CAMs also function as receptors which modulate signal transduction in many cellular processes including proliferation, apoptosis, migration and differentiation. Deregulation of these biological processes in malignant tumors has been associated with the aberrant expression of CAMs, demonstrating that alterations in CAMs play a pivotal role in cancer development and progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p>
<p>HepaCAM was first identified as a cell adhesion molecule which is frequently downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. HepaCAM is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and consists of an extracellular domain with two immunoglobulin loops, a transmembrane segment and a cytoplasmic tail<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p>
<p>HepaCAM has been found to be downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, and reexpression of hepaCAM in hepaCAM-negative hepatocellular carcinoma cells inhibits their growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> which is characteristic of a tumor suppressor. Similar data have been obtained for many other solid cancers. HepaCAM is suppressed in carcinomas of the breast, kidney, colon, rectum and stomach<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. HepaCAM reexpressed in renal carcinoma and breast cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell senescence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In bladder cancer, it has been found that the expression of hepaCAM is silenced by hypermethylation, and reversal of hypermethylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases led to the reexpression of hepaCAM and reduction in cell growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Further, hepaCAM expression has been shown to induce differentiation of glioblastoma cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In addition, hepaCAM regulates cell adhesion and migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, processes which are essential for normal development and metastasis.</p>
<p>HepaCAM was also discovered in the central nervous system (CNS) where it was called GlialCAM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. HepaCAM associates with MLC1, and is required to shuttle MLC1 to the cell membrane where it localizes to cellular junctions. Mutations in either gene, <italic>HEPACAM</italic> or <italic>MLC1</italic>, lead to the development of the neurodegenerative disease megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. HepaCAM also associates with the chloride channel ClC-2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study we demonstrate that hepaCAM associates with the major gap junction protein connexin 43 and shuttles it to cellular junctions on the cell surface. Further, hepaCAM stabilizes connexin 43 protein at cellular junctions. Antagonistic anti-hepaCAM antibodies and hepaCAM mutations that cause MLC also prevent its association with connexin 43. Since connexin 43 has anti-tumor activity, its regulation by hepaCAM may explain the anti-tumor activity of hepaCAM.</p>

<title>HepaCAM associates with connexin 43 and regulates its localization and expression</title>
<p>Since hepaCAM has been shown to associate with MLC1, a gap junction protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, we hypothesized that hepaCAM may also associate with connexin 43 a component of gap junctions. Indeed, the two proteins colocalized at cell-cell contacts of U373 MG cells as shown by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Connexin 43 is predominantly localized intracellularly in U373 MG cells. Expression of WT hepaCAM redistributed connexin 43 to the cell surface, particularly to sites of cell-cell contacts, where colocalization of the two molecules was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Since mutations in hepaCAM can cause the disease MLC, we also investigated the effects of mutations on connexin 43 localization. We selected two naturally occurring mutations, R92Q and R92W, in the hepaCAM extracellular domain, specifically in the first Ig-like domain. These two mutations not only cause MLC but also diminished the colocalization with connexin 43 at cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>The physical interaction of WT hepaCAM and connexin 43 was verified by a co-immunoprecipitation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The R92Q and R92W mutations, however, diminished the physical association of hepaCAM and connexin 43 since the two proteins could hardly be co-precipitated when carrying one of the two mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>The confocal staining of connexin 43 in the hepaCAM-transfected cells indicated not only a cellular redistribution of connexin 43 by hepaCAM but also an induction of connexin 43 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). An enhancement of connexin 43 expression by WT hepaCAM was confirmed by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D,E</xref>). However, the two hepaCAM mutations, especially R92Q, were less effective in enhancing connexin 43 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D,E</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to the mutations in hepaCAM, neutralization of hepaCAM by an antibody diminished its colocalization with connexin 43 at cell-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In addition, anti-hepaCAM antibody treatment resulted in decreased connexin 43 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The reduction in connexin 43 levels in U373 MG cells by neutralization of hepaCAM appears to be stronger in the confocal images compared to the Western blot. This is possibly due to lesser connexin 43 clustering at the cell membrane in the presence of the anti-hepaCAM antibody, which affects the intensity of the confocal staining more than the signal on the Western blot. Wang and Rose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> had observed that a high expression of connexin 43 did not necessarily result in immunostaining for connexin 43 clusters at cell-cell contacts.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>HepaCAM stabilizes connexin 43</title>
<p>The reduced connexin 43 levels in the absence of hepaCAM is consistent with the higher connexin 43 levels in cells expressing WT compared to mutated hepaCAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>). However, the presence of hepaCAM did not enhance transcription of connexin 43 since connexin 43 mRNA levels did not differ between cells expressing no hepaCAM or WT or mutated hepaCAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>), which suggests that hepaCAM stabilizes connexin 43 protein, or that hepaCAM induces a translation-mediated or posttranslational increase in connexin 43. To further assess whether hepaCAM influences connexin 43 protein stability, the kinetics of connexin 43 degradation were determined by a cycloheximide (CHX) chase experiment. Cells expressing WT hepaCAM had increased stability of connexin 43, as shown by its slower rate of degradation upon inhibition of translational elongation with CHX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B,C</xref>). The influence of hepaCAM on connexin 43 stability was supported by observations of enhanced connexin 43 protein levels in HEK293T cells transiently transfected with WT hepaCAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D,E</xref>). Treatment with the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine led to a gradual increase in connexin 43 expression in control U373 MG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3F</xref>), while treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 had no effects (data not shown). This suggests that connexin 43 is predominantly degraded by the lysosomal pathway in U373 MG cells, and that hepaCAM expression slows down connexin 43 turnover via this pathway.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>HepaCAM has been identified as a tumor suppressor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. But the underlying mechanism(s) of hepaCAM-mediated suppression of cancer cell growth is largely unknown. A gene expression analysis of hepaCAM-expressing and control bladder cancer cells identified a large number of differentially regulated genes, indicating that hepaCAM may mediate its growth-inhibitory effect via multiple pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p>
<p>Connexin 43, like hepaCAM, has been identified as a tumor suppressor protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Both molecules are frequently downregulated in cancers and exert growth-inhibitory activities. In addition, several studies have also shown an abnormal localization of connexin 43 in the cytoplasm of tumor cells, instead of the cell membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. As with previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, a predominant localization of connexin 43 in the cytoplasm of glioblastoma cells was observed in this study. Since hepaCAM increases connexin 43 levels, and promotes its trafficking from the cytoplasm to cellular junctions, the deletion of either gene may have similar growth-promoting effects for cancer cells.</p>
<p>In the absence of hepaCAM, connexin 43 may become unstable or may cease to get shuttled from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, and therefore its amount gradually diminishes at cellular junctions, which may lead to reduced cell-cell communication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). Connexin 43 is known to undergo rapid turnover<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, either by the proteasomal and/or the lysosomal pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. We found connexin 43 expression to be increased in U373 MG cells expressing WT hepaCAM, which is not due to an increase in connexin 43 transcription, but due to a slower rate of turnover by the lysosomal pathway. The increased stability of connexin 43 protein depends on its interaction with hepaCAM, as treatment of cells with an antibody against the hepaCAM extracellular domain disrupts this interaction and causes a downregulation in connexin 43 expression. Similarly, the R92Q and R92W mutations in hepaCAM, which lead to a weaker interaction with connexin 43, did not enhance connexin 43 protein levels in U373 MG cells, unlike WT hepaCAM. This is in line with previous observations that the interaction of hepaCAM with MLC1 in rat astrocytes increases the protein stability of MLC1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p>
<p>Neutralization of hepaCAM by antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>) or inactivation by mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>) reduced not only expression of connexin 43 but also its localization at the plasma membrane. This is paralleled by the finding that hepaCAM ablation reduced expression of MLC1 at the plasma membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Both MLC1 and connexin 43 are structural components of cellular junctions which implies that hepaCAM may be a general regulator of cellular junctions. Similarly, hepaCAM associates with the chloride channel ClC-2, and coexpression of hepaCAM with ClC-2 in HeLa cells led to an increased presence of ClC-2 on the plasma membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p>
<p>It had been found that it is the extracellular domain of hepaCAM that is necessary for its targeting to cell junctions, and for its interactions with itself and with MLC1 and ClC-2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. This finding is in line with our data that the mutations as well as the monoclonal antibody that interrupt the association of hepaCAM with connexin 43 are located in or target the extracellular domain.</p>
<p>By discovering the requirement of hepaCAM for localizing connexin 43, a well-established tumor suppressor, to cellular junctions and stabilizing it there, this study identifies a mechanism by which deletion of hepaCAM may support tumor progression.</p>
