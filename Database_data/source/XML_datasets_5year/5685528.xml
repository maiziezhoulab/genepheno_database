<p id="P1">Social interaction is a fundamental behavior in all animal species, but the developmental timing of the social neural circuit formation and the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing its formation are poorly understood. We generated a mouse model with mutations in two <italic>Dishevelled</italic> genes, <italic>Dvl1</italic> and <italic>Dvl3</italic>, that displays adult social and repetitive behavioral abnormalities associated with transient embryonic brain enlargement during deep layer cortical neuron formation. These phenotypes were mediated by the embryonic expansion of basal neural progenitor cells (NPCs) via deregulation of a β-catenin/Brn2/Tbr2 transcriptional cascade. Transient pharmacological activation of the canonical Wnt pathway during this period of early corticogenesis rescued the β-catenin/Brn2/Tbr2 transcriptional cascade and the embryonic brain phenotypes. Remarkably, this embryonic treatment prevented adult behavioral deficits and partially rescued abnormal brain structure in <italic>Dvl</italic> mutant mice. Our findings define a mechanism that links fetal brain development and adult behavior, demonstrating a fetal origin for social and repetitive behavior deficits seen in disorders such as autism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Social interaction is a fundamental behavior found in nearly all organisms. Uncovering the developmental mechanisms and genetic pathways governing social behavior is essential for understanding pathophysiological processes that may lead to the development of treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders that display social interaction abnormalities. Social behaviors result from extensive cognitive processes such as obtaining, retrieving, and processing information about the lives, relationships, and mental states of others. The cerebral cortex is responsible for integrating this complex information from multiple brain networks in order to respond to complex social behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. As social interaction behaviors become more complex, the related regions in the frontal cortex become more active, reflecting the transfer of information processing from automatic to cognitive processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Thus, it is likely that abnormal brain development can cause long-term alterations in brain circuitry that may later manifest in behavioral affective disorders in the adult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">During cerebral cortical development, neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) in the cerebral cortex undergo temporally and spatially coordinated proliferation, differentiation into neurons, and migration to their final destination, where they will form functional contacts with other neurons to form neuronal circuits (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>). The highly conserved Wnt/wingless signaling cascades regulate many of the processes involved in cortical development, including proliferation, differentiation and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Wnt signals are relayed from the receptors to the downstream effectors by scaffold proteins of the Dvl family. Wnt signals can be transduced through multiple pathways, including canonical Wnt/β-catenin, planar cell polarity (PCP), and Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> cascades. The canonical WNT pathway plays a role in the development and patterning of the brain. Dvl can convert naive ectoderm into neural tissue in Xenopus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In addition, WNT signaling via Dvl, posteriorizes neural ectoderm, generating an anteroposterior pattern in the central nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Dvl also appears to be important for later events in neural development, governing the morphology, differentiation and function of neurons in vertebrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P4"><italic>Dvl1</italic>-null mice (<italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) exhibit abnormal social interaction behaviors and defects in prepulse inhibition of startle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. No gross pathological abnormalities were previously detected in the brains of adult <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice that could account for their behavioral phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. It is possible that <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice have a subtle brain phenotype, due to the known functional redundancy among the <italic>Dvl</italic> genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Another possible explanation is that transient brain abnormalities are present during development that impact adult brain function. Thus, we hypothesized that the study of <italic>Dvl</italic> double mutants may unravel the subtle developmental pathological abnormalities in the <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. To test this hypothesis, we generated <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutant mice and uncovered transient fetal brain growth abnormality that was associated with increase in NPCs proliferation and premature differentiation. These embryonic phenotypes were regulated by a novel transcriptional mechanism downstream of canonical Wnt signaling that links fetal brain development with adult social behavior and structural brain defects.</p>

<title>Mice</title>
<p id="P5">All animal care and experiments were performed under protocols approved by UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. We generated Wild-type (WT); <italic>Dvl3</italic><sup>+/−</sup><italic>; Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice on the 129S6 background by mating WT with <italic>Dvl3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> with <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>; 3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. BAT-gal mice on the 129 background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> were crossed with the <italic>Dvl</italic> mutants to generate the BAT-gal <italic>Dvl</italic> mutant mice. Genotyping for all the mouse strains used were previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. <italic>Brn2</italic> mutant mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> were maintained on C57BL/6 mice background as heterozygotes and genotyping for the <italic>Brn2</italic> mutants were previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. For rescue experiments WT and <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> dams were IP injected daily from E9.5 to E14.5 with 4mg/kg CHIR99021, a potent and highly selective inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> (Tocris), which was dissolved according to manufacturer’s instructions (4mM DMSO in PBS). The CHIR99021 delivery regime was chosen to maximize effectiveness of the compound taking into consideration diffusion to the target and induction of the normalization of the transcriptional cascade that requires two steps of transcriptional regulation. For BrdU incorporation experiments WT and <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> dams were IP injected 60 min prior embryos collection with 40μg of BrdU per g of mouse weight. The experimental data from each genotype was generated from at least 3 litters. Mice were housed in standard cages and maintained on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle at 22°C. All testing occurred during the light portion of the cycle.</p>

<title>Behavioral analysis</title>
<p id="P6">Wild-type, <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice (129S6 background) were subjected to a behavioral phenotyping battery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Briefly, several behavioral and physical features of the mice were assessed. Next, with the use of a cotton-tipped applicator, each mouse was assessed for several sensorimotor reflexes and its response to an approaching object. Finally, several postural reflexes were also assessed.</p>
<p id="P7">A separate cohort of wild-type, <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, and a third cohort of CHIR99021 and mock treated mice were subjected to: nest building, open field, three chamber social approach and marble burying. Mice were 6 weeks of age at the start of the home cage nesting behavioral testing. Mice were transferred to the Gladstone behavioral facility and allowed one week to habituate before behavioral testing began. The open field task was conducted first followed by three-chambered social approach task then finally marble burying task was perfomed. Time between the two tasks ranged from 2 days to 6 days. Behavioral testing was conducted in dedicated behavioral testing rooms during the standard light phase, usually between 1000 h and 1500 h. All procedures were approved by the Gladstone Institute and the UCSF Animal Care and Use committee.</p>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Nesting</title>
<p id="P8">Nest building activity was assessed in their home cages, 3–4 mice per cage. On the day of the testing a clean cage with equal amounts of bedding and a 5×5cm piece of commercial nesting pad (Ancare, Bellmore, NY) was placed in the cage. Assessments were made at 20, 40, 60 min and 24hours. At each time point the activity of the mice and an estimate of percentage of chewed nestlet were recorded. The depth of the thickest part of the nest was measured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Open field</title>
<p id="P9">General exploratory locomotion in a novel open field environment was assayed as previously described 18. Briefly, mice were transferred to the testing room and acclimated for at least one hour. Individual mice were placed in a standard Photobeam Activity System (PAS) open field apparatus (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA, USA). Test chambers consisted of clear Plexiglas sides and floor, approximately 40 × 40 × 30.5 cm. Mice were placed in the center of the open field at the initiation of the testing session. Photocells at standard heights for recording activity were aligned 16 to a side detecting horizontal and vertical activity. Total distance, horizontal activity, vertical activity, and center time were automatically collected using PAS software. Test chambers were cleaned with 30% ethanol between test subjects. At least five minutes between cleaning and the start of the next session was allowed for ethanol evaporation and odor dissipation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>Social approach</title>
<p id="P10">Social approach was assayed in a three-chambered apparatus using methods previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Briefly, the apparatus was a rectangular, three-chambered box made of opaque white polycarbonate (60L × 40W × 25D, in cm). Mice were transferred to the testing room and acclimated for at least one hour. The test session began with a 10 min habituation session in the center chamber only, followed by a 10 min habituation to all three empty chambers. Following the second habituation phase, a clean novel object (wire cup) was placed in one of the side chambers and a novel mouse was placed in an identical wire cup located in the other side chamber. After both stimuli were positioned, the subject mouse was allowed access to all three chambers for 10 min. Trials were video recorded and time spent sniffing the novel object and time spent sniffing the novel mouse were later scored by a trained observer that was blinded to the experimental groups and treatments. Mice that did not explore both chambers with the mouse and the object were excluded from the test. On 129S6 genetic background, 10–30% of the cohorts tested were excluded. This behavior was not associated with any specific genotype or treatment. However, very few (&lt;5%) mice were excluded when they were on the B6 genetic background (WT and Brn2<sup>+/−</sup> mutants).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S8">
<title>Acoustic startle and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle</title>
<p id="P11">Acoustic startle and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle responses were measured using four SR-Lab Systems (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA). A test session was begun by placing a subject in the Plexiglas cylinder where it was left undisturbed for 5 min. A test session consisted of seven trial types. One trial type was a 40 ms, 120 dB white noise sound burst presented alone as the startle eliciting stimulus. There were five different acoustic prepulse plus acoustic startle stimulus trials. The prepulse sound was presented 100 ms before the startle stimulus, and was 20 ms in duration. Prepulse sounds used were 74, 78, 82, 86, or 90 dB in each of the five respective trial types. Finally, there were test trials where no stimulus was presented. These were used to measure baseline movement in the cylinders. Six blocks of the seven trial types were presented in pseudorandom order such that each trial type was presented once within each block of seven trials. The average inter-trial interval was 15 sec (ranged from 10 to 20 sec). The startle response was recorded for 65 ms (measuring the response every 1 ms) beginning at the onset of the startle stimulus. The background white noise noise level in each chamber was 70 dB. The maximum startle amplitude recorded during the 65-ms sampling window was used as the dependent variable. Percent prepulse inhibition of a startle response was calculated as: 100 − [(startle response on acoustic prepulse and startle stimulus trials/startle response alone trials) × 100].</p>
<p id="P12">A separate startle response curve session was conducted using procedures identical to that described above, except that startle stimulus only trials were presented at dB levels ranging from 0 to 48 dB above the 70 dB baseline. The different startle stimuli were presented in a random order, with five presentations at each level. This procedure provided a gross indication of the hearing and startle.</p>

<title>Marble burying</title>
<p id="P13">Marble burying repetitive pattern of behavior was assessed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Clean cages (31 × 17 × 14 cm) were filled with 4.5 cm SANI-CHIP bedding, and mice were tested for 20 min. The number of marbles buried (&gt;50% marble covered by bedding material) was recorded.</p>

<title>Histology and immunohistochemistry on whole brains</title>
<p id="P14">Embryonic brain samples were dissected without perfusion, and included forebrain through hindbrain. Brain weight was measured and brains were immediately fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Embryos tails were collected for PCR analysis to determine the genotype of the embryo. Samples were transferred to a 30% sucrose solution for 24 hours and then embedded and flash frozen in O.T.C. compound (Tissue-Tek, Torrance, CA). Frozen coronal sections (25 μm) were collected serially every 250μm, mounted on super-frost slides and stored at −80°C until use. Sections were treated identically and staining was performed on the same day for all genotypes. Cresyl-violet/Nissl staining was performed by standard protocols. The cortical wall and subregions of the cortical wall were measured at 3–4 locations mediolaterally across the neocortex and across the rostal caudal axis every 200μm, using imagePro software. The Atlas of the Prenatal Mouse Brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> was used as guides for the frontal neocortex, specifically coronal sections #1–4 at E12.5; #1–4 at E14.5; #4–9 at E16.5 and #7–11 for E18.5 were used for all the histological analysis.</p>
<p id="P15">For immunohistochemistry, sections were air dried for 1 hr and then rehydrated in PBS followed by incubation with blocking solution (5% donkey serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 hr at room temperature (RT). For Tbr2 staining, antigen retrieval was performed by placing slides in Sodium Citrate Buffer (10mM Sodium Citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0) at 100°C for 30 min and the slides were then incubated in blocking solution. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for 24h at 4°C, followed by the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488, 568, or 647 (Invitrigen; 1:1000). Primary antibodies used were anti-Sox2 (Santa Cruz, sc17320; 1:200); anti-Tbr2 (Milipore, AB15894; 1:1000); anti-Tbr2 (gift from Dr. R. Hevner, Seattle Children’s Research Institute; 1:500); anti-5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (Sigma, B8434 1:500); anti-phospho-Histone H3 (Sigma, H0412; 1:500); anti-Ki67 (Dako, M7249; 1:200); anti-Ctip2 (Abcam, ab18465; 1:2000); anti-Cux1 (Santa-cruz, sc-13024; 1:200); anti-NeuN (Millipore, MAB377; 1:500); anti-FoxP2 (Abcam, ab1307; 1:2000); Anti-Brn2 (Santa Cruz, cs6029; 1:400) anti-Brn2 (2R2; 1:2000)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, anti-Tbr1 (Abcam, 31940; 1:200). After immunohistochemistry, slides were mounted with DAPI counter-stain (Invitrogen, P36930).</p>
<p id="P16">For Lac-Z enzymatic staining (β-gal), sections were air dried for 1 hr and washed three times in PBS for 5 min. The sections were transferred to β-Gal staining solution [1 mg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactoside (X-Gal), 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.02% Nonidet-P40] at 37°C overnight. The samples were washed in distilled water three times, counterstained by Neutral Red, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, cleared in xylene, and mounted. Sections were treated identically and the enzymatic reaction was performed on the same day for all genotypes (n=3 for each genotype, derived from at least 3 litters). Staining reaction was timed to ensure uniform exposure and slides from all the mice were randomized.</p>

<title>Neurospheres</title>
<p id="P17">Cerebral cortices were isolated from E14.5 mouse embryos, and dissociated by papain-containing dispersion solutions (Sumitomo Bakelite Co. MBX-9901) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. At the final step, cells were filtered, added to uncoated tissue culture six-well plates containing N2 supplement with DMEM, 10 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor, and 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (NPC media), then incubated at 37°C in 95% air and 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber. Half of the media was replaced every other day, allowing cells to grow as floating neurospheres. When culture media began to turn yellow or after 10 days cells were passaged by incubation in 0.0025% Trypsin/EDTA solution (Gibco) for 5 min at 37°C, trypsin inhibitor 1mg/ml (Sigma, T6522) for 5 min at room temperature, collected by centrifugation and re-suspended in fresh NPC media. Doubling time was calculated by counting the number of NPCs at plating and at each passage using a hemocytometer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.doubling-time.com/compute.php">http://www.doubling-time.com/compute.php</ext-link>). Each embryo derived line of NPCs was passaged 3 times. Experimental results were obtained from secondary and tertiary neurospheres. In preparation for immunostaining, neurospheres were fixed in 4% PFA for 16 hours at 4°C, samples were transferred to a 30% sucrose solution for 24 hours at 4°C, embedded and flash frozen in O.T.C. compound (Tissue-Tek, Torrance, CA). Frozen coronal sections (10 μm) were then cut on a cryostat and mounted on super-frost slides and stored at −80°C until use.</p>

The number of deep layer Ctip2<sup>+</sup> cells in the CP was increased in <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants compared to WT at E14.5, then decreased by E18.5 in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a–b</xref>).

<p id="P58">Previous studies demonstrated that β-catenin activates Brn2 expression in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. The reduced levels of Brn2 in Dvl deficient VZ/SVZ and cultured NPCs led us to hypothesize that β-catenin may directly regulate Brn2 in NPCs. To test this hypothesis, we examined Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional activity using TOP-flash assays in WT and <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NPCs. TOP-flash encodes seven copies of LEF/TCF binding sites linked to firefly luciferase and reflects Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional activity.

These results suggest that the transient increase in proliferation and early expansion of deep layer neurons in the <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> embryos at E14.5 was associated with reduced β-catenin transcriptional activity and reduced canonical Wnt signaling in the VZ and CP.</p>

Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with a β-catenin antibody demonstrated specific enrichment for β-catenin interaction with a putative TCF binding site on the Brn2 promoter region in WT E14.5 cortex, but not with the known β-catenin interaction sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> on Axin2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4f–g</xref>), while this enrichment was reduced in <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> cortex.

Thus, CHIR99021 treatment displayed a degree of specificity for the development of specific brain structures, including several regions of the cerebral cortex.</p>

<title>A β-catenin/Brn2/Tbr2 pathway regulates fetal brain growth and development, as well as adult social and repetitive behavior</title>
<p id="P68">Social interaction is a fundamental behavior found in nearly all organisms, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing this behavior are poorly understood. We generated <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, which allowed us to identify a β-catenin/Brn2/Tbr2 transcriptional pathway that regulates embryonic brain size and deep layer neurogenesis that is essential for normal social and stereotypic behaviors. We propose a model in which Dvl1 and Dvl3 facilitate canonical Wnt signaling via β-catenin to directly promote expression of the Brn2 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10a and 10b</xref>). Brn2 in turn acts as a direct repressor on the Tbr2 promoter to inhibit expression of this transcription factor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10a and 10b</xref>) and the expansion of basal progenitors during deep layer neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10c and 10d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P69">Multiple lines of evidence support our proposed mechanism. The genetic loss of <italic>Dvl</italic> genes leads to an early enlargement of the embryonic brain, which is the result of a transient over-proliferation of neural progenitors in the cerebral cortex and premature differentiation of deep layer cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10c and 10d</xref>). During cortical development in WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10a</xref>), activation of the canonical Wnt pathway in the VZ results in the activation of β-catenin transcriptional activity, increased Brn2 expression, and suppression of Tbr2 in neural progenitors to promote accurate temporal proliferation and neurogenesis. In <italic>Dvl</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10b</xref>), there is less activation of the canonical Wnt pathway, reduced β-catenin transcriptional activity in the VZ, decreased Brn2 expression, and premature expression of Tbr2. <italic>In vitro</italic>, both β-catenin transcriptional activity and Brn2 levels were decreased while Tbr2 levels were increased in cortical NPCs from <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> versus WT embryos, associated with increased proliferation. Activation of β-catenin transcriptional activity in <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NPCs by LiCl reversed both the decrease in Brn2 levels and the increase in Tbr2 levels, resulting in reduced proliferation of the <italic>Dvl</italic> mutant NPCs. Knock-down of Brn2 in WT NPCs resulted in increased Tbr2, while forced expression of Brn2 rescued the proliferative phenotype of <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> NPCs. <italic>Brn2</italic> null mice phenocopied the embryonic cortical phenotype of the <italic>Dvl</italic> mutant mice, and <italic>Brn2</italic> heterozygotes display similar adult behavior deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4m–q</xref>). Finally, the activation of the canonical Wnt pathway by CHIR99021 specifically during this critical embryonic period (E9.5–14.5) rescued the embryonic dysregulation of the β-catenin/Brn2/Tbr2 transcriptional cascade in the developing brain, the transient over-proliferation of neural progenitors and the premature differentiation of deep layer cortical neurons. Importantly, this treatment also rescued the social and stereotypic behavioral deficits that were observed in adult <italic>Dvl</italic> mutant mice. Finally, restoration of the canonical Wnt pathway in <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutant embryos specifically during E9.5–14.5 resulted in the recovery of specific adult brain morphological and structural deficits, including areas of the cerebral cortex. The ability to reverse an adult phenotype by transient embryonic normalization of the Wnt pathway provides strong evidence for our model.</p>
<p id="P70">The β-catenin/Brn2/Tbr2 transcriptional cascade and its role in the regulation of NPC number and brain size during development have not been previously described, although features of this cascade are supported by previous studies. Early in neurogenesis, NPCs respond to Wnt stimulation by proliferating symmetrically, whereas later in development Wnts also induce neuronal differentiation by promoting terminal neurogenesis of intermediate progenitors (IPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. These studies highlight the complex temporal and context-dependent control of Wnt signaling in distinct progenitor types during brain development. It is likely that some of the temporal and context-dependent effects of β-catenin on NPCs are mediated by transcriptional regulation of Brn2. In melanoma cells, β-catenin directly regulates Brn2 expression and controls proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, which implies that the regulation of Brn2 expression by canonical Wnt signaling is not unique to NPCs. In the brain, Brn2 is a positive regulator of genes that are expressed in apical NPCs such as Nestin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> and Sox2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, while Brn2 co-regulates neurogenesis with Mash-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Brn2 is one of three factors necessary for the direct reprogramming of fibroblasts to induced neurons by contributing long-term transcription of selected genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Similar to <italic>Dvl</italic> mutants, initial examination of Brn2 knockouts failed to reveal significant cortical brain abnormalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, but our more detailed examination revealed that <italic>Brn2</italic> mutant mice display similar embryonic brain enlargement and social behavior phenotypes as <italic>Dvl</italic> mutants, strongly supporting the linkage of these phenotypes and the molecular pathway. <italic>Dvl</italic> and <italic>Brn2</italic> mutant mice are maintained on 129S6 and C57Bl6/J inbred genetic backgrounds, demonstrating that the embryonic brain development and the behavioral phenotypes are strain independent. <italic>Tbr2</italic> null mice are severely affected and cortical layers are reduced in thickness, confirming that Tbr2<sup>+</sup> IPs are necessary to expand the pool of the neurons of each cortical layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. It was previously shown that sustained β-catenin activity in the developing cortex delays the onset of Tbr2 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, which is consistent with our finding that reduction of β-catenin activity due to the loss of <italic>Dvl</italic> genes resulted in an increase in Tbr2 expression, while CHIR99021 treatment of WT embryos resulted in reduce Tbr2 expression. In contrast to our findings, it was recently reported that Brn2 promotes the expression of Tbr2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. This study employed the N2a cell line and the Engrailed dominant negative system to eliminate Brn2 function, which may result in off target effects on closely related POU-domain transcription factors such Brn1 and Oct6. Our studies used <italic>Brn2</italic> genetic mutants as well as Brn2 knock-down or overexpression in primary cells with findings consistent with our model.</p>
<p id="P71">The initial expansion of deep layer neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a–b</xref>) in <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice was due to the deregulation of Brn2 levels, but the mechanism for the rapid decrease in the deep layer neurons at about E16.5 is not clear. We were unable to find evidence for several potential mechanisms that could account for the decrease of deep layer neurons. Premature NPCs depletion is unlikely to account for the deep layer neuronal decrease, since the later born superficial layer neurons are unaffected in the <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice. Apoptosis of the increased numbers of deep layer neurons could potentially account for the deep layer neuronal decrease, but the number of apoptotic nuclei was not different between <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and WT mice at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11a</xref>). Interneurons invade the CP after E15.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, however, the number of GABA positive neurons in the cortex of E18.5 <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and WT mice are similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11b</xref>). Lastly, it was reported that microglia (Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells) could limit the production of cortical neurons by phagocytizing neural precursor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. However, the number of Iba1<sup>+</sup>Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells was not different between <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and WT mice at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11c</xref>). Thus, we speculate that the rate of neurogenesis at early stages of cortical development in <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice is rapid due to β-catenin transcriptional activity that drives the induction of basal identity of the progenitor pool, and then decreases at E16.5 due to the lack of β-catenin transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>) and Brn2, a proneuronal transcription factor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10e</xref>).</p>

<title>Redundancy of Dvl genes in development and social behavior</title>
<p id="P72">Our study was aimed at unraveling the molecular mechanism that controls abnormal social interaction behaviors in <italic>Dvl1</italic> mutant mice. Adult <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice display social interaction abnormalities, but detectable brain gross pathological abnormalities were not found that could account for their behavioral phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. One reason for the lack of detectable abnormalities in adult <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutants is that the relevant phenotypes occurred during embryonic development, since <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> embryos displayed brain enlargement mediated by expansion of basal progenitors during the production of deep layer neurons (E14.5). In addition, the known functional redundancy of <italic>Dvl2</italic> and <italic>Dvl3</italic> resulted in a subtle, difficult to detect brain phenotype in <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice that was revealed only by after examination of <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants. Once embryonic brain defects were uncovered in <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants, some of these phenotypes were also found in <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> or <italic>Dvl3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants. Functional redundancy among the <italic>Dvl</italic> genes results from their overlapping expression patterns and their high degree of conservation, and this is highlighted by their ability when overexpressed to cross-rescue phenotypes resulting from loss-of-function of other <italic>Dvl</italic> genes 14. Some of the embryonic brain phenotypes (Sox2<sup>+</sup>Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells at E14.5 and reduced Brn2 in layer 5 at E18.5) were found in all <italic>Dvl</italic> mutants, other phenotypes (cortical thickness) were present only in <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−</sup><italic><sup>/</sup>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants, while all phenotypes were found in <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants. In addition, while <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−</sup><italic><sup>/</sup>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants share the social behavior deficits, <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−</sup><italic><sup>/</sup>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants display additional behavioral deficits, such as marble burying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). These observations are consistent with complex functional redundancy of <italic>Dvl1</italic> and <italic>Dvl3</italic>, affecting the penetrance and expressivity of an individual embryonic brain or adult social behavior phenotype in <italic>Dvl3</italic><sup>+/−</sup>, <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants, as is the complete penetrance of all phenotypes in the <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants. It does not appear that <italic>Dvl2</italic> plays an important role in social behavior, since preliminary studies of <italic>Dvl2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>+/−</sup><italic>2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants did not reveal social interaction abnormalities (J.L., A.W.B., unpublished). This suggests that functional redundancy among <italic>Dvl</italic> genes is incomplete, which is supported by <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of <italic>Dvl</italic> genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Fetal development and autism</title>
<p id="P73">The embryonic brain enlargement and developmental defects displayed by <italic>Dvl</italic> mutant mice appear to be responsible for the adult social and stereotypic behavioral deficits displayed by <italic>Dvl</italic> mutants, supporting an embryonic origin for the social interaction phenotypes in the mouse. The embryonic brain phenotypes are mediated by expansion of basal progenitors during the production of deep layer neurons (E14.5) due to the dysregulation of a β-catenin/Brn2/Tbr2 transcriptional cascade. Premature neuronal differentiation of deep layer neurons was observed in <italic>Dvl</italic> mutant mice without affecting superficial layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The initial enlargement was due to the deregulation of Brn2 levels. We speculate that the rate of neurogenesis at early stages of cortical development in <italic>Dvl1</italic> mutant mice is rapid due to induction of basal identity of the progenitor pool, and then decreases due to the lack of β-catenin transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>) and Brn2, a proneuronal transcription factor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10e</xref>). The linkage of embryonic brain phenotypes and adult social interaction deficits in both <italic>Brn2</italic> and <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants further supports the embryonic origin of the social behavioral deficits. Finally, the successful rescue of the embryonic brain defects in the <italic>Dvl</italic> mutants by the specific and restricted activation of the canonical Wnt pathway between E9.5 and E14.5 also rescued the adult social behavior deficits that were observed in <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants. Surprisingly, CHIR99021 treatment resulted in lack of sociability and increase of stereotypic behavior in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>), suggesting that both activation and inhibition of β-catenin canonical pathway during deep layer neurogenesis are associated with these behavioral abnormalities. Such a “bell-shaped” dose response relationship in canonical Wnt signaling was recently proposed for autism based on genetic studies in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, as well as in syndromic mouse models of autism, such as <italic>Tsc2(</italic>+/−<italic>)</italic> and <italic>Fmr1(</italic>−<italic>/y)</italic> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> and MECP2 gain- and loss-of-function mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. This provides additional support for a bell-shaped dose response relationship in ASD.</p>
<p id="P74">The phenotypes and molecular mechanisms responsible for the behavioral defects in the <italic>Dvl</italic> mutants may model some aspects of autism. <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup><italic>3</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants displays both social deficits and repetitive patterns of behavior, similar to autism. Postmortem brain gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> and neuronal counting in young autistic cases 62 identified developmental disturbances in molecular and genetic mechanisms that govern proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis, and inferred that these events occurred prior to birth. Two recent independent studies of human ASD genes identified spatial and temporal convergence of these genes in human mid-fetal cortical development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. Interestingly, one study identified coexpression of ASD genes with deep layer 5/6 projection neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, while the second study identified superficial layer glutamatergic inter- and intra-cortical neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. In addition, two Wnt associated genes (Wnt10B and CTTNBP2) and Ctip2 (Bcl11b) were present in their coexpression networks with genes important for the development of autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, supporting a role for prenatal canonical Wnt signaling in the development of deep layer neurons in humans.</p>
<p id="P75">Embryonic neurogenesis has been identified as a critical temporal period in other environmental and genetic mouse models of autism. Several known environmental exposure models, including maternal infection and maternal valproate administration, have emphasized the importance of this embryonic period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. Knockdown of Tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1) from the thalamic circuitry at E12.5 alters neuronal physiology, resulting in both seizures and compulsive grooming in adult mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. By contrast, only a subset of these phenotypes occurs when thalamic Tsc1 is deleted at a later embryonic stage.</p>
<p id="P76">Structural histopathological abnormalities in the adult <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice that could account for their behavioral phenotypes have not been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. By employing state-of-the-art T2 and DTI MR imaging, we found that the whole brain volume of <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6f</xref>) and that multiple brain regions of the <italic>Dvl</italic> mutant brains displayed abnormal size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6g–i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">6</xref>). A previous report investigated 26 different mouse lines with relevance to autism, and clustered these lines into three large groups that differed in both directional volumetric differences as well as localization of anatomical phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Based on this study, the <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse brain MRI phenotype corresponds to group 1, and closely and specifically resembles the <italic>Fmr1</italic> (FVB) and <italic>Nrxn1α</italic> models, with less resemblance to the <italic>Shank3</italic> and <italic>En2</italic> models. The common phenotype of mouse mutant within this group is increased volumes in large white matter structures and frontal and parieto-temporal lobes as well as decreased volumes in the cerebellar cortex. Consistent with these mutants, the frontal (FDR=0.15) and parieto-temporal lobes (FDR=0.14) were increased in relative volume in the <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p>
<p id="P77">T2 and DTI MR imaging also revealed that of the 21 brain regions that were abnormal in <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutants in the adult brain, 6 were rescued by CHIR99021 treatment: the fundus of the striatum; olfactory bulb; copula white matter; frontal association cortex; primary motor cortex; and the primary somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">6</xref>). These regions were previously reported to be associated with the neurological manifestation in autistic patients. The striatum was previously implicated in the stereotypic pattern of behavior 67. The abnormalities in the olfactory bulb could be associated with the heightened olfaction that was reported in autistic patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. We have not behaviorally tested olfaction in <italic>Dvl</italic> mutant mice and future studies will be needed to address this in detail, both molecularly and behaviorally. The motor cortex and the copula (part of the cerebellum) structural abnormalities could participate in the motor impairments found in 80% of patients with autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>, as well as the reduced somatosensory response and connectivity in the somatosensory cortex found in autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. Lastly, the increased volume of the frontal association cortex (FAC) in <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mock treated mice was almost completely recovered by <italic>in utero</italic> CHIR99021 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9c</xref>). Interestingly, the FAC was also increased, though not significantly, in WT mice that were <italic>in utero</italic> treated with CHIR99021 that also displayed abnormal behavior. The specific involvement of the FAC in the social behavioral deficits seen in <italic>Dvl1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mock treated and WT CHIR99021 treated mice, provides further support for an important role of the embryonic canonical β-catenin signaling on the development of specific brain structures central for the neurological/behavioral abnormalities in autism.</p>
<p id="P78">In summary, our studies of the <italic>Dvl</italic> and <italic>Brn2</italic> mutant mice support a model in which abnormalities in embryonic brain development are responsible for abnormal adult brain structures and behavioral abnormalities. We identified a critical period during embryonic brain development for the establishment of normal social behavior in mice, when deep layer projection neurons are produced, which is regulated by a β-catenin/Brn2/Tbr2 transcriptional cascade. In addition, we link this critical period with abnormalities in specific adult brain structures. These findings are consistent with a model that autism may be caused by increased production of neurons during cortical prenatal development 62, specifically during the development of deep layer glutamatergic projection neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. Further studies will be required to determine the consequences of the abnormal development of deep layer neurons to the adult brain circuitry and function and possible therapeutic interventions.</p>
