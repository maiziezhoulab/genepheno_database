<abstract id="ABS1">
<p id="P3">Uremic syndrome (also known as uraemic syndrome) in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease involves the accumulation in plasma of small-molecule uremic solutes and uremic toxins (also known as uraemic toxins), dysfunction of multiple organs and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. As such, uremic syndrome can be viewed as a disease of perturbed inter-organ and inter-organism (host–microbiota) communication. Multiple biological pathways are affected, including those controlled by solute carrier (SLC) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes, many of which are also involved in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME). The remote sensing and signaling hypothesis identifies SLC and ABC transporter-mediated communication between organs and/or between the host and gut microbiota as key to the homeostasis of metabolites, antioxidants, signaling molecules, microbiota-derived products and dietary components in body tissues and fluid compartments. Thus, this hypothesis provides a useful perspective on the pathobiology of uremic syndrome. Pathways considered central to drug ADME might be particularly important for the body’s attempts to restore homeostasis, including the correction of disturbances due to kidney injury and the accumulation of uremic solutes and toxins. This Review discusses how the remote sensing and signaling hypothesis helps to provide a systems-level understanding of aspects of uremia that could lead to novel approaches to its treatment.</p>
