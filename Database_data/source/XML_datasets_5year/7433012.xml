<p id="P4">Cortical organoids are self-organizing three-dimensional cultures that model features of developing human cerebral cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. However, the fidelity of organoid models remains unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Here, we perform single cell transcriptomics of primary human cortex spanning developmental periods and cortical areas. We find that cortical development is characterized by progenitor maturation trajectories, the emergence of diverse cell subtypes, and areal specification of newborn neurons. In contrast, organoids contain broad cell classes, but fail to recapitulate distinct cellular subtype identities and appropriate progenitor maturation. Although molecular signatures of cortical areas emerge in organoid neurons, they are not spatially segregated. Organoids also ectopically activate cellular stress pathways, which impairs cell type specification. However, organoid stress and subtype defects are alleviated by transplantation into mouse cortex. Together, these datasets and analytical tools provide a framework for evaluating and improving the accuracy of cortical organoids as models of human brain development.</p>
<p id="P5">Organoid models harness natural properties of self-assembly to produce three-dimensional cultures from stem cells that recapitulate aspects of an endogenous organ’s structure and function. Organoids have applications in disease modeling, drug screening, and regenerative medicine. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a powerful method for comparing the fidelity of organoid cell types to their primary cell counterparts across tissues. In the liver and kidney, benchmarking studies to normally developing organs indicates that three-dimensional culture better recapitulates primary cell types than adherent culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, the lack of a comprehensive catalog of cell types and their molecular features during normal human brain development has prevented careful evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of cerebral organoids.</p>
<p id="P6"><italic>In vitro</italic> models of human cortical development are particularly valuable because early events during neurogenesis and synaptogenesis may underlie neuropsychiatric disorders, and experimental access to developing cortex is otherwise limited. Initial studies indicate that broad classes of cells are preserved in cortical organoid models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> but also hint at distinctions between organoids and primary cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In particular, the extent to which spatial and temporal gradients of gene expression and cell type maturation are recapitulated in organoids is unclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). Although some of the first organoid models suggested the emergence of spatial gradients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, we know little about the fidelity and organization of areal cell types in organoids, in part because we lack molecular cell signatures across cortical areas in developing brain.</p>
<sec id="S1">
<title>Comparison of Human Cortex and Organoids</title>
<p id="P7">In order to evaluate the fidelity of cortical cell types in organoids we performed high-throughput scRNAseq of developing human cortical samples and cortical organoids, and compared the results to published organoid single-cell sequencing datasets. To characterize molecular features and gene expression signatures during human cortical development, we performed scRNAseq of dissociated cells from five individuals ranging from 6-22 gestational weeks (GW), encompassing the period of neurogenesis. To assess cell-type differences across cortical areas, primary samples were collected from seven regions, including prefrontal (PFC), motor, parietal, somatosensory and V1 cortices as well as hippocampus, resulting in transcriptomic data from 189,409 cells (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). This primary data was compared to data from 235,121 single-cells generated from 37 organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We generated forebrain organoids with three previously published protocols utilizing different levels of directed differentiation to evaluate whether increased stringency in patterning signals results in more endogenous-like cellular subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). To assess biological replicability, we utilized three induced pluripotent stem cell (PSC) lines and one embryonic stem cell line. Organoids were maintained under the same conditions, except for protocol-specific media formulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>), and were harvested for immunohistochemistry and scRNAseq after three, five, eight, ten, fifteen and twenty-four weeks of differentiation to evaluate relevant cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figs. 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">4</xref>). Last, we compared our reference dataset to published organoid single-cell data generated from 276,054 cells across eight protocols, including time points from six months to a year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. This enabled us to extend our comparisons throughout later stages of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Figs. 5</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">6</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S2">
<title>Impaired Cell Type Fidelity in Organoids</title>
<p id="P8">We identified broad cell types that corresponded to radial glia, intermediate progenitors (IPCs), maturing neurons, and interneurons in both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">3</xref>). In the primary data we also found clusters of microglia, oligodendrocyte precursors, mural and endothelial cells. Additionally, we identified previously described radial glia subtypes, as well as a few instances of area and layer specific excitatory neuron subtypes. In the primary samples, there was extensive intermixing within clusters of ages and cortical areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4A</xref>). Within our organoids, cell lines, protocols, and ages also intermixed, with variation primarily resulting from differences between cell types. Across lines and protocols the forebrain marker FOXG1 was broadly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7A</xref>), and the cell type composition was similar across organoids of the same ages, even between lines and protocols, validating differentiation towards forebrain identity. Organoids had 45% fewer cells expressing HOPX, a marker of outer radial glia (oRG), than primary samples, and, 63% fewer EOMES positive IPCs, as previously noted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. We also found a 94% reduction in the number of SATB2 positive upper layer neurons in organoids compared to primary samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">To quantitatively compare primary and organoid cell types, we performed correlation analysis of marker genes (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>) based upon our clusters in each dataset. We categorized each cluster in terms of its class (neuronal or non-neuronal), cell cycle state (dividing or postmitotic), type (radial glia, excitatory neuron, etc.), and subtype (eg. oRG, layer IV excitatory neuron, etc.), and quantified the correlation between organoid and primary cell categories. Neural class and proliferative state were largely preserved, as has been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. However, cell types and subtypes were significantly less well correlated to all organoid-derived cells regardless of protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Our correlative analysis across all published organoid datasets suggested that a number of radial glia or neuronal clusters corresponded equally well to multiple primary cell subtypes and thus were designated as “pan-radial glia” or “pan-neuronal”. Lack of subtype resolution resulted in a smaller number of high-quality subtypes in organoids compared to primary samples (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We validated our observation of limited subtype specificity between datasets using five additional batch correction methods and observed little overlap of organoid and primary clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Organoid Radial Glia Lack Specificity</title>
<p id="P10">The differentiation program that generates neurons from radial glia is highly conserved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and we sought to identify genes that strongly discriminate progenitors from neurons. We were surprised to find that primary cell types are defined by more than twice the genes as organoid cells, and that type defining genes largely did not overlap between datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). We utilized a gene score metric that quantifies the degree of enrichment and specificity for each marker gene in a dataset (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>), which is initially low in primary cells but increases substantially over development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7E</xref>). In all cases, organoids exhibited a significantly lower gene score that did not resolve over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7E</xref>), suggesting that markers of progenitors and differentiated cells might be co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). We plotted the normalized counts for each gene that discriminated neurons from radial glia in primary samples, finding that neurons had low expression of radial glia markers, and radial glia did not express neuronal markers. However, we found substantial co-expression in organoid cells, resulting in a lower correspondence between organoid and primary cell types and subtypes.</p>
<p id="P11">We explored how well organoid radial glia recapitulated their primary cell subtype counterparts at the transcriptomic level by focusing the comparison on oRG cells. A number of genes were more highly expressed in organoid oRGs, largely corresponding to glycolysis or ER stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">STable 7</xref>). One of the genes most highly upregulated in primary oRG cells, but with very low expression in organoid oRG cells, was <italic>PTPRZ1,</italic> a known oRG marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. To validate this finding, we stained primary and organoid samples for PTPRZ1 and HOPX, a canonical oRG marker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, and observed more HOPX and PTPRZ1 co-expressing cells in primary tissue than organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9E</xref>). We performed similar differential expression between upper layer neuron clusters, observing that two genes required for neuronal maturation and projection pattern specification, <italic>MEF2C</italic> and <italic>SATB2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, were significantly upregulated only in primary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref>). Even when cellular subtypes can be assigned to organoids, they lack molecular subtype identifiers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Cell Maturation Is Impaired in Organoids</title>
<p id="P12">The progression of developmental events, such as the birth of neuronal and glial cell types, occurs more rapidly in organoids, and progenitor and neuronal zones do not expand as broadly as <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). A primitive radial glial scaffold is observed at 5 weeks of differentiation in the organoid, whereas the oRG scaffold expands predominantly after 15 weeks of primary human cortical development. Over the course of 15 weeks of differentiation the organoid progenitors differentiate, the ‘scaffold’ dissolves and intermixed populations of neurons and glia are present. Using our transcriptomic data we sought to explore how cellular maturation was affected as a result of the faster temporal development we observed cytoarchitecturally. To explore maturation of progenitor cells, we used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>) to generate gene modules that strongly correlate to one another in the primary radial glia. We consolidated the networks with a correlation to sample age into a pseudoage metric and then correlated pseudoage to actual age, observing a strong positive correlation in primary radial glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). With confidence in our networks, we applied them to the organoid radial glia. We saw limited correlation between organoid pseudoage and actual age, suggesting a lack of activation of the molecular maturation programs that exist <italic>in vivo</italic>. Importantly, this heterogeneous maturation level existed within each organoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10C</xref>), indicating variability between individual cells and not just across organoids, lines, or batches. The lack of a radial glia molecular maturation signature in organoids correlates with absence of molecular diversity in this model. The impact of radial glia subtype and maturation on their role as neural precursors is unknown, but the dysregulation of these programs in organoids may impact their ability to completely recapitulate differentiation trajectories of cortical neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Definition of Cortical Areal Signatures</title>
<p id="P13">Recent studies have uncovered molecular differences between excitatory neurons across cortical regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and these differences may emerge during neurogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Given that regional specification may represent a central feature of neuronal identity, we investigated how molecular properties of areal identity emerge. We leveraged primary cell data collected for seven cortical regions. For genes uniquely enriched in each region, we calculated a weighted average expression (eigengene) across primary and organoid cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). In primary cells, some signatures, such as those from the PFC, temporal lobe, hippocampus, and V1 were highly enriched in their respective areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">Extended Data Fig. 11</xref>). Interestingly, the parietal lobe tracked closely with the temporal lobe and the somatosensory and motor cortex co-expressed signatures, suggesting a lack of areal segregation between these regions at the time points sampled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">Extended Data Fig. 11C</xref>). The earliest samples in our dataset preceded the development of anatomical distinctions between cortical regions, and thus could not be sub-dissected. The early ‘telencephalon’ samples were highly enriched for V1 signatures, but additional work is required to disentangle whether excitatory neurons born early in development all begin by expressing V1 areal genes, or if this was a sampling artifact of our dissections. These data offer a new categorization of cortical area signatures and enable us to evaluate areal identities of cortical organoid neurons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Areal Signatures Reflected in Organoids</title>
<p id="P14">Our analysis indicates that many aspects of neuronal subtype are not preserved or are averaged into a “pan-neuronal” identity in organoids. However, our primary data suggests that areal identity is an early marker of neuronal differentiation. Based on areal signatures from primary cells, we were able to evaluate the closest areal identity for each excitatory organoid neuron profiled by scRNA-seq. We were surprised to discover that most neurons correspond to a defined areal signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) despite the lack of thalamic input, which is thought to refine areal identity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Although each organoid contained neurons with multiple areal identities, the strength of areal correspondence of organoid excitatory neurons was robust, including to regions such as PFC and V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">Extended Data Fig. 11D</xref>). Regardless of the PSC line or differentiation protocol, cortical organoids were comprised of heterogeneous areal identities. To explore whether cells corresponding to different areas were spatially segregated within an organoid, we performed immunohistochemistry for two sets of area-specific genes. We recently described that PFC excitatory neurons co-express the projection specification transcription factors <italic>SATB2</italic> and <italic>BCL11B</italic> (CTIP2), and through a narrow topographical transition these markers segregate entirely in V1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. We explored the expression of these factors in our organoids, and observed both co-expression and segregation of SATB2 and CTIP2 in adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). AUTS2 and NR2F1 are well described genes with rostral-caudal gradient expression patterns, and we similarly observed cells expressing either of these factors in proximal space. Together, these data suggest a model where cortical excitatory neuron differentiation is strongly defined by areal identity, and organoids recapitulate this process, but without spatial organization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>Cellular Stress Increases in Organoids</title>
<p id="P15">We and others have observed an enrichment of modules related to the activation of glycolysis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in organoid cells, and additional analysis with four orthogonal co-clustering methods found universal upregulation of stress pathways in organoids across all protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Fig. 12</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">13</xref>). We validated that several genes upregulated in organoid datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, including the glycolysis gene, PGK1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, and the ER stress genes, ARCN1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> and GORASP2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, were enriched at the protein level in organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Fig. 12</xref>). Immunostaining verified that, regardless of stage of organoid differentiation or PSC line used, there was significant activation of PGK1, ARCN1 and GORASP2 in distinct organoid domains, not restricted to the organoid core.</p>
<p id="P16">To probe the origin of this cellular dysregulation, we first evaluated the expression of stress genes during normal human cortical development and observed little expression in fixed cryosectioned tissue samples throughout peak neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Fig. 12C</xref>), though some ER stress was observed at earlier cortical stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Extended Data Fig. 13B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">C</xref>). As ER stress and glycolysis genes are not canonically activated during cortical development, we hypothesized that the <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions of the organoid model resulted in increased cellular stress. We first evaluated activation of stress pathways in PSCs and were surprised to find expression of both ARCN1 and GORASP2, suggesting that ER stress occurs in stem cells prior to organoid formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Fig. 12B</xref>). To determine the rate at which cellular stress arises <italic>in vitro</italic>, we cultured organotypic cortical slices for one week and observed negligible change in stress activation compared with acutely fixed samples.

<title>Increased Stress Impairs Cell Subtype</title>
<p id="P18">Mouse knockout studies have suggested activation of ER stress pathways can inhibit cell type specification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, so we assessed whether metabolic stress was affecting specification in transplanted primary cells. We noted similar subtypes when comparing pre-transplantation cell clusters and our primary reference data. In contrast, post-transplanted primary cells had significantly lower subtype correlation, similar to organoid cells, and they lacked markers of specific progenitor or neuronal subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 11E). In order to test if the differences were driven by induction of stress pathways, we also generated three-dimensional aggregates of dissociated primary cortical cells from GW14/15 and found a similar upregulation of metabolic stress genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Extended Data Fig. 13E</xref>). However, we observed an intermediate phenotype on subtype correlation where primary aggregates were significantly higher than post-transplanted primary cells, but still significantly lower than pre-transplant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F19">Extended Data Fig. 14E</xref>). Some of these discrepancies might be attributable to other cell types, including microglia, endothelial cells, and pericytes in the primary aggregate that may promote normal maturation and differentiation.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="P20">Here, we provide a comprehensive molecular characterization of developing human cortical cell types and their preservation in brain organoid models. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we identify broad cell classes and types, as well as fine grain subtypes such as outer radial glia progenitors in primary human samples. Compared to primary tissue, organoids contain a smaller number of cell subtypes and often co-express marker genes resulting in broad type assignment, such as pan-radial glia or pan-neuron. We use this dataset to generate pseudoage metrics and provide in-depth analysis of area specific gene signatures and their developmental trajectories in primary and organoid neurons. Finally, we identify a role for stress pathway activation in impaired subtype specification of cortical organoid cell types; the lack of specificity in organoids must be carefully considered when studying developmental processes, cell type specific disease phenotypes, or cellular connectivity. Additionally, metabolic stress in utero could lead to molecular identity changes with potential consequences to human brain development. Overall, our compilation of raw and analyzed data, paired with visualization of single-cell clustering in a cell browser, provides a valuable resource to better understand normal human development and benchmark the fidelity of <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular data.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p id="P26">Cortical organoids and primary human cortical tissue were collected, fixed in 4% PFA, washed with 1xPBS and submerged in 30% sucrose in 1xPBS until saturated. Samples were embedded in cryomolds containing 50% O.C.T. (Tissue-tek) and 50% of 30% sucrose in 1xPBS and frozen at −80C. Primary samples were sectioned at 20uM and organoids at 16uM onto glass slides. Antigen-retrieval was performed on tissue sections using a citrate-based antigen retrieval solution at 100x (Vector Labs) which was boiled to 95C and added to slides for 20mins. After antigen retrieval, slides were briefly washed with PBS and blocked with PBS containing 5% donkey serum, 2% gelatin and 0.1% Triton for 30mins. Primary antibodies were incubated in blocking buffer on slides at 4C overnight, washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton three times and then incubated with AlexaFluor secondary (Thermo Fisher) antibodies at room temperature for 2 hours. Primary Antibodies included Mouse: Sox2 (Santa Cruz, 1:500, sc-365823), Hopx (Santa Cruz, 1:250, sc-398703), Satb2 (Abcam, 1:250, ab51502), AUTS2 (abcam, 1:100, ab243036), Human Nuclei (Millipore, 1:500, MAB1281), Rabbit: Hopx (Proteintech, 1:500, 11419-1-AP), GORASP2 (Proteintech, 1:50, 10598-1-AP), ARCN1 (Proteintech, 1:50, 23843-1-AP), PGK1 (Thermo Fisher 1:50, PA5-13863), PTPRZ1 (Atlas, 1:250, HPA015103), NR2F1 (Novus, 1:100, NBP1-31259), Rat: Ctip2 (Abcam, 1:500, ab18465), Sheep: Eomes (R&amp;D, 1:200, AF6166), Guinea pig: NeuN (Millipore, 1:500, ABN90), Chicken: Gfp (Aves, 1:500, GFP-1020).</p>

<title>Primary Sample Collection</title>
<p id="P27">All primary tissue was obtained and processed as approved by the UCSF Human Gamete, Embryo and Stem Cell Research Committee (GESCR) approval 10-05113. All experiments were performed in accordance with protocol guidelines. Informed consent was obtained prior to sample collection for the use of all tissue samples within this study. First and second trimester human cortex tissue was collected from elective pregnancy termination specimens from San Francisco General Hospital and the Human Developmental Biology Resource (HDBR). Tissue was collected only with previous patient consent for research and in strict observation of legal and institutional ethical regulations.</p>

<sec id="S17">
<title>Dissociation</title>
<p id="P28">Primary human cortical samples were dissociated using Papain (Worthington) containing DNase. Samples were grossly chopped and then placed in 1mL of Papain and incubated at 37C for 15mins. Samples were inverted three times and continued incubating for another 15 mins. Next samples were triturated by manually pipetting with a glass pasteur pipette approximately ten times. Dissociated cells were spun down at 300g for 5mins and Papain removed.</p>

<sec id="S18">
<title>10X Capture and Sequencing</title>
<p id="P29">Single-cell capture from live cells was performed following the 10X v2 Chromium manufacturer’s instructions for both primary and organoid samples. For primary samples, each sample was its own batch. For organoid samples, batch is indicated in the metadata annotation in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">STable 1</xref>. In each case, 10,000 cells were targeted for capture and 12 cycles of amplification for each the cDNA amplification and library amplification were performed. Libraries were sequenced as per manufacturer recommendation on a NovaSeq S2 flow cell.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S19">
<title>Clustering</title>
<p id="P30">We first explored the cell type identities of primary and organoid samples using Louvain-Jaccard clustering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Prior to clustering, batch correction was performed similar to previous approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Briefly, each set of cells within a batch were normalized to the highest expressing gene, making the range of expression from 0 to 1. These values were multiplied by the average number of counts within the batch. These normalized datasets were piped into Seurat v2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, where cells with less than 500 genes per cell or greater than 10% of reads aligning to mitochondrial genes being discarded. Normalized counts matrices were log<sub>2</sub> transformed, and variable genes were calculated using default Seurat parameters. Data was scaled in the space of these variable, and batch was regressed out. Principal component analysis was performed using FastPCA, and significant PCs were identified using the formula outlined in Shekhar et al. In the space of these significant PCs, the k=10 nearest neighbors were identified as per the RANN R package. The distances between these neighbors was weighted by their Jaccard distance, and louvain clustering was performed using the igraph R package. If any clusters contained only 1 cell, the process was repeated with k=11 and up until no clusters contained only 1 cell. Cluster markers and tSNE plots were generated with Seurat package default parameters.</p>

<title>Cell Type Annotations</title>
<p id="P31">Primary cell type annotations of clusters were performed by comparison to previously annotated cell types, and when a repository of substantial matching was not available, a combination of literature based annotation of layer or maturation stage identity was used. The genes used to annotate each cluster are highlighted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. When a cluster was substantially enriched based upon an age or an areal metadata property, this empirical observation was used to inform the annotation. Organoid cell types were first annotated by their similarity to primary cell clusters, if the correspondence was at or above 0.4 and only one primary cell type had such a high correspondence, the primary cell type was applied to the organoid cluster. If the correspondence was between 0.2 – 0.4 and included only one similarity, that cell type was used to identify the organoid cell type unless there was an obvious discrepancy in top marker gene expression between the two clusters. If no correlation was above 0.2, literature annotations or unknown identities were assigned. If an organoid cluster correlated equally well (within 10%) of multiple primary subtypes of the same or similar cell type, “pan” identity was assigned. Low quality cell types for all analyses were assigned when markers were dominated (&gt;60%) by mitochondrial genes, ribosomal genes, or pseudogenes. Occasionally, an intersection of these approaches was used for organoid clusters, and is indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S21">
<title>Correlation Analysis</title>
<p id="P32">Correlation analysis was generated in the space of marker genes. For each marker gene, a speificity score was calculated. This score equaled the ‘enrichment’ – log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) of the marker compared to other clusters – and the ‘specificity’ – the percent of the relevant cluster expressing the marker divided by the percent of other clusters expressing the marker. These two values were multiplied by one another to obtain the final score, and was represented across all marker genes for each sample in box and whisker plots. A matrix of all markers across all clusters was created for each individual dataset; if a marker was not expressed at all in a certain cluster, it was marked as 0. If a value was divided by 0 to calculate the score, the score was placed as a dummy score at 1500. Matrices between comparisons were correlated in the space of overlapping marker gene space using Pearson’s correlations.</p>

<sec id="S22">
<title>Co-clustering Analysis</title>
<p id="P33">Each of the five batch correction methods were performed with default parameters. For each analysis, the same 20,000 cell subset of each organoid and primary cells was used because most of the algorithms were too computationally intensive to perform on the full dataset.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S23">
<title>Linear Mixed Models</title>
<p id="P34">VariancePartition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> was used for linear mixed model analysis. Analysis was performed in a randomized subset of 50,000 genes in the space of expressed genes across the meta data properties noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Figure 5</xref>. Age was used as a continuous variable and all other variables were assigned as discrete.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S24">
<title>WGCNA and Maturation Analysis</title>
<p id="P35">WGCNA networks were calculated as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> in 10,000 randomly chosen primary radial glia cells and in parallel from 10,000 randomly chosen organoid radial glia cells. These networks were applied to the remaining primary and organoid cells using the ModuleEigengene function from the WGCNA R package. Pseudoage was calculated by taking networks that correlated highly to age in the 10,000 cell subset and combining their genes into a single gene set. PCA was performed in this gene space in the full space of radial glia and the loading of the first principle component dictated the pseudoage. This analysis was performed reciprocally.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S25">
<title>Area Signatures</title>
<p id="P36">Area signatures were obtained by performing pairwise differential expression between each of the seven cortical areas and the six remaining areas. Differential expression across all of the areas was combined, with a count of how many times a gene was differentially expressed in an area from each of the pairwise comparison. While combining the lists, the enrichment and specificity were averaged across all six analyses and multiplied by the number of times the gene appeared as a marker for an area of interest. This value, the “area specificity score” was compared across all areas. For any genes that were considered markers of multiple areas, the area with the highest area specificity score was allocated to the gene as a marker, thus making all area markers unique to one area alone. This is how some areas have a higher percentage of cells assigned to another area other than their area or origin, and enables cleaner comparison of areal pattern emergence. Each set of area marker genes were designated as a network, and the correlation of each cell to this area was calculated by applyModules and calculating a module eigengene. After assignment, in order to normalize unequal module eigengene distributions, within a dataset the module eigengenes were normalized by area and the assigned area for a cell was the area for which that cell had the highest module eigengene.</p>

<title>PSA-NCAM Protocol &amp; Viral Infection of Primary Cells</title>
<p id="P37">Primary cortical samples were grossly dissected to isolate the ventricular and subventricular zones excluding cortical plate neurons. Dissociated cells were enriched for neural progenitor cells using a PSA-NCAM antibody and the MACs magnetic sorting kit (Miltenyi Biotech). Briefly, dissociated cells were incubated with the PSA-NCAM antibody for 30mins at RT, washed with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and added to an equilibrated magnetic L column. Cells positive for antibodies bind to the column and negative cells are collected in the elute. The negatively sorted cells were pelleted at 300g for 10mins and supernatant removed. Negatively sorted samples were infected with CMV::GFP adenovirus (Vector Biolabs), which preferentially labels progenitors, at 37C for 15mins.

<title>Schematic of Human Cortex and Human Organoid Development</title>
<p id="P45"><bold>a)</bold> Schematic of normal brain developmental trajectories queried in this study and their comparison to organoid models. Normal cortical development requires the emergence of a diversity of progenitor cell types from a seemingly uniform neuroepithelium. Through a sequence of cell type specification and maturation, progenitor cells undergo neurogenesis and gliogenesis to generate the cellular diversity of the cortex. Areal identities are specified during this process and comprise a core property of developing neurons.</p>

Organoids from both protocols were stained with SOX2 to mark progenitors, HOPX to identify outer radial glia, and TBR2 to label intermediate progenitor cells. Cultures were also stained with CTIP2+ to mark deep layer neurons and SATB2+ to identify upper layer neurons. At week 5 all progenitor subtypes were present and by week 10 both deep and upper layer neurons were detected. <bold>b)</bold> Organoids from the H28126 iPSC line were differentiated using the least, directed and most directed protocols. All progenitor types marked by SOX2, HOPX and TBR2 and CTIP2+ and SATB2+ neuronal populations were present by week 5. Expression of all markers decreased by week 10.

<p id="P51"><bold>a)</bold> Composition of each organoid by cell type designation. FOXG1 expression across all organoid samples shown by feature plot on the right. <bold>b)</bold> Comparison of organoid subtype as determined by this study versus three control analyses. Graphically, the column indicates subtype correspondence and the error bar is standard deviation. The first was performed by halving the primary dataset randomly and without overlap and then comparing the subclusters from the two datasets. This age and method matched analysis shows that primary variation is significantly lower than the variation between organoids and primary cells, as indicated by the significantly higher subtype correlation between primary datasets (organoids: n=242,349 cells collected from 37 organoids from 4 biologically independent samples from 4 independent experiments; primary data: 189,409 cells from 5 biologically independent samples from 5 experiments,****p= 2.0e<sup>−24</sup>, two-sided Welch’s t-test). A similar analysis was performed comparing the primary data from this study to the data collected by microfluidic approaches from Nowakowski et al. Although the ages, capture method, and number of cells varied greatly, subtype correlation between the published primary data and the data in this study is significantly higher than the subtype similarity between organoids and primary samples (Nowakowski data: n= 4,261 cells from 48 biologically independent samples across more than 35 independent experiments, ****p=2.0e<sup>−5</sup>). We additionally performed this analysis between two published datasets in the adult human, comparing middle temporal gyrus (MTG, Hodge et al 2019, n= 15,928 cells) from an older adult with distinct brain regions from young adults in the control samples of an autism spectrum disorder study (ASD, Velmeshev et al 2019, n= 104, 559). Despite differences across ages and individuals, who could be expected to have unique cortical gene expression profiles based upon sensory experience, the distinct cortical regions isolated and the different capture methods, the subtype correlation between these two primary datasets is significantly higher than the correlation between organoid cells and primary cells (**p=0.0076). <bold>c)</bold> Subtype correlation as calculated and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> which is broken down by protocol and pluripotent line where the graph bars indicate subtype correlation and error bars are standard deviation. The least directed protocol was significantly better at recapitulating cell subtype than the most directed protocol (*p= 0.0483, two-sided Welch’s t-test) which is consistent with the recent findings from Velasco et al. We also observed that the iPSC line 1323_4 generated significantly more similar subtypes to primary samples than WTC10 or H1 (**p=0.0013, 0.0089 respectively). <bold>d)</bold> Clustering and subtype analysis was performed between all organoids and primary PFC samples and primary V1 individually. Subtype correlation did not change regardless of which area the organoids were compared to. “Overall” refers to the subtype correlation observed when comparing all organoids cells to all primary cells and is shown for comparison. Histogram bars show subtype correlation and error bars are standard deviation (n=242,349 cells from 37 organoids across 4 independent experiments). <bold>e)</bold> Subtype correlation analysis was performed across all organoid stages (n=week 3: 38,417 cells, week 5: 26,787 cells, week 8: 11,023 cells, week 10: 50,550 cells, week 15: 2,722 cells, week 24: 4,506 cells from 4 independent experiments) and all primary ages (n= GW6: 5,970 cells, GW10: 7,194 cells, GW14: 14,435 cells, GW18: 78,157 cells, GW22: 83,653 cells from 5 independent experiments). Histogram bars show subtype correlation and error bars are standard deviation. Week 3 organoids are more similar to younger primary stages, while week 15 organoids are most similar to older primary ages. Other ages correspond similarly well to the primary stages of peak neurogenesis (GW10-24), while all together, the organoids are most significantly similar to GW14 (**p= 0.0015, two-sided Welch’s t-test). “Overall” refers to the subtype correlation observed when comparing all organoids cells to all primary cells and is shown for comparison. The last histogram shows the average gene score of each sample and error bars are standard deviation. Younger primary samples and organoids have a relatively lower gene score related to their marker specificity; this specificity increases substantially over time in primary cells but less so in organoid cells.</p>

<title>Cell types in Cortical Primary and Organoid Samples</title>
<p id="P64"><bold>a)</bold> Single-cell sequencing of primary cortical cells identifies a number of cell types. These cell types are labeled in the tSNE plot on the left, and markers of cell type identity depict progenitors (SOX2), outer radial glia (HOPX), intermediate progenitor cells (EOMES), newborn neurons (NEUROD6), maturing neurons (SATB2) and inhibitory interneurons (DLX6-AS1). Single cell data can be explored at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://organoidreportcard.cells.ucsc.edu/">https://organoidreportcard.cells.ucsc.edu</ext-link>. <bold>b)</bold> Single-cell sequencing of cortical organoid cells generated from four different pluripotent stem cell lines and three protocols with varied levels of directed differentiation generates similar cell types to primary cortex, however the population proportions differ. The proportion of cells for each marker in each sample type are: SOX2+ (primary 15.4%, organoid 41.2%), HOPX+ (primary 7.6%, organoid 4.2%), EOMES+ (primary 4.1%, organoid 1.5%), NEUROD6+ (primary 51.9%, organoid 20.3%), SATB2+ (primary 32.5%, organoid 2.0%), DLX6-AS1+ (primary 17.1%, organoid 3.5%).</p>

<title>Molecular Comparisons of Cell Subtypes Between Primary and Organoid Samples</title>
<p id="P65"><bold>a)</bold> Each cluster was classified by marker genes for class, state, type and subtype (primary: n=5 individuals across independent experiments; organoids: n=37 organoids from 4 PSC lines across 4 independent experiments). Correlation between pairwise combinations of marker genes in heatmap (red intensity: Pearson’s correlation from −1 to 1). First histogram indicates cell subtypes in primary (orange) and organoid (blue) samples. Second histogram shows quantitative correlation from the best match for each category averaged across clusters (mean plus standard deviation; subtype vs type: **p= 0.0073, subtype vs state: ****p=0.00008, subtype vs class: ****p= 0.003, Welch’s two-sided t-test). <bold>b)</bold> Using VariancePartition, the genes defining metadata properties were evaluated for contribution to overall variance. Genes contributing &gt;25% variance by cell type were used in Venn diagram. Box and whisker (mean plus standard deviation) depicts level of specificity at class (****p=4.4e<sup>−14</sup>), state (****p=4.7e<sup>−18</sup>), type (****p= 1.02e<sup>−20</sup>) and subtype level (****p= 5.34e<sup>−38</sup>). For all comparisons Welch’s two-sided t-test was used (primary: n=5; organoids: n=37). The dot plot depicts discriminating genes between radial glia and neuron identity in primary samples. Each dot is a gene, shown as the average radial glia [x-axis] and neuron [y-axis] expression in primary (orange) or organoid (blue) cells. <bold>c)</bold> Differential expression (two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test) between clusters annotated as oRG cells in primary and organoid datasets generated log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) [x-axis] and −log<sub>10</sub>(adjusted p-value measurements) [y-axis] (primary: n=5; organoids: n=37). A pseudocount of 500 was assigned to comparisons with an adjusted p-value of 0. Many measurements were significant, including oRG identity gene, <italic>PTPRZ1</italic>. Week 8 organoids had minimal co-expression of PTPRZ1 and HOPX (top), while GW15 oSVZ contains extensive co-localization (repeated independently 3x).

<title>Maturation of Cortical Lamina and Radial Glia</title>
<p id="P66"><bold>a)</bold> Immunohistochemistry of SOX2+ progenitors, HOPX+ oRG cells, CTIP2+ deep layer neurons and TBR2+ IPCs in primary and organoid samples during neurogenesis. Primary samples express SOX2 and TBR2 in the VZ and CTIP2 in the cortical plate at GW13. By GW15 HOPX+ oRGs are born and reside in the oSVZ. The cortex expands dramatically over the next weeks with more HOPX+ oRG cells residing in the oSVZ providing a scaffold for neurons to migrate. Organoids express similar markers to GW13 samples by week five of differentiation with multiple VZ-like structures. oRG cells arise and increase between week eight and ten. The radial architecture expands and dissolves over this period. By week 15 a mix of cell types are present in the organoid. Organoids shown were differentiated using the ‘least directed’ differentiation protocol and staining validated independently three times (primary: n=4 biologically independent samples; organoid: n=3 biologically independent samples). Scale bar = 50 uM <bold>b)</bold> Pseudoage was calculated by identifying networks from a 10,000 cell subset of primary radial glia that highly correlated to age (either positively or negatively). These networks were then collapsed into a single “age network”. The module eigengene for this age network was then calculated on the remaining data and used for pseudoage. Pseduoage is indicated by the graph line and shading represents the geometric density standard error of the regression. The primary dataset (orange) has a high Pearson’s correlation and R-squared value, while the organoid dataset has no correlation to the pseudoage metric.</p>

<title>Analysis of Areal Identity in Organoid Excitatory Neurons</title>
<p id="P67"><bold>a)</bold> Each of seven cortical areas was used to generate a unique area gene signature by comparing expression to the other six areas. The unique signatures were considered networks, and module eigengenes across area networks were calculated for each primary and organoid cell. The area with the highest normalized eigengene (normalized to the highest score within each area for equal comparison) was designated as the areal identity of that cell. <bold>b)</bold> Areal identity was assigned for each cell within an organoid and the areal composition is shown for the 37 organoids in our dataset. Organoid samples are listed from earliest to latest stage collected (weeks 3-24). Within a timepoint, the organoid protocol used is ordered from least to most directed differentiation; each timepoint is comprised of multiple PSC lines. Every organoid has heterogeneous areal expression. <bold>c)</bold> The average module eigengene score for each primary (orange) and organoid (blue) cell designated (primary) or assigned (organoid) PFC or V1 identity (primary: n=5 independent samples across 5 experiments; organoid: n=37 organoids across 4 independent experiments). The average value for PFC was not significantly different between organoid and primary, while the V1 organoid cells had higher correlation to the V1 signature than primary cells, indicating areal identity in the organoid strongly resembles normal development (mean with standard deviation shown, two-sided Welch’s t-test, p= 0). <bold>d)</bold> Validation of intermixing of areal identities in organoid samples differentiated using the ‘least directed’ differentiation protocol. In the PFC, BCL11B (CTIP2) and SATB2 co-localize in the same cell, whereas in V1 cells they are mutually exclusive. Both patterns are in close proximity in the organoid. AUTS2 is a rostrally expressed transcription factor while NR2F1 is a caudally expressed factor, but are adjacent in the organoid. Scale bar = 50 uM, representative image shown (n = 3 replicates each).</p>

<title>Influence of Culture on Metabolic Stress and Cell Type</title>
<p id="P68"><bold>a)</bold> Primary samples were progenitor-enriched, GFP-labeled and transplanted into organoids. After 2.5 weeks, GFP+ cells were isolated via FACS and processed for scRNA-seq. <bold>b)</bold> Primary GFP+ cells integrate into organoids differentiated using the ‘least directed’ protocol. Scale bar = 50 uM. Pre-transplantation cells have similar profiles and cellular subtypes as primary data. After transplantation, there is a decrease in subtype correlation (n=7 biologically independent samples across 2 independent experiments). Mean subtype correlation indicated on graph, error bars show standard deviation (p= 2.8e<sup>−9</sup>, two-sided Welch’s t-test). <bold>c)</bold> After transplant, primary cells increase expression of stress genes, PGK1 (****p= 1.76e<sup>−87</sup>, two-sided student’s t-test) and GORASP2 (arrow; ****p= 9.60e<sup>−63</sup> two-sided student’s t-test) as indicated by width of colored domain in each respective violin plot (n=7 samples across 2 experiments). Scale bar = 50 uM. <bold>d)</bold> Organoids were dissociated, GFP labeled, and injected into the cortex of P4 mice. After 2-5 weeks, mouse brains were harvested for scRNA-seq and immunostaining. <bold>e</bold>) Human cells are visualized by GFP and human nuclear antigen expression (n=13 mice transplanted with 14 organoids derived from 2 iPSC lines across 2 independent experiments). Organoid cells express markers of progenitors (HOPX), neurons (CTIP2, SATB2) and astrocytes (GFAP). Mouse vascular cells (Laminin &amp; CD31) innervate the transplant. <bold>f</bold>) Post-transplant, organoid cells have reduced expression of stress genes. Scatter plots show decreased staining intensity in transplanted organoids (error bars: standard deviation) of PGK1 (****p= 9.64E-07), ARCN1 (****p=1.28E-05) and GORASP2 (****p=1.88E-06; n=19 sections from 6 transplanted mice across 2 experiments, each marker stained independently; all comparisons used the two-sided student’s t-test). Violin plots show a decrease in PGK1 (****p= 2.16e<sup>−17</sup>) and GORSASP2 (**p= 0.0019) expression in organoid cells post-transplant from single cell analysis (n= 1980 cells from 7 transplanted mice across 2 experiments, all groups were evaluated using the two-sided Welch’s t-test).</p>
