<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">The IGF2 mRNA-binding proteins (ZBP1/IMP1, IMP2, IMP3) are highly conserved post-transcriptional regulators of RNA stability, localization and translation. They play important roles in cell migration, neural development, metabolism and cancer cell survival. The knockout phenotypes of individual IMP proteins suggest that each family member regulates a unique pool of RNAs, yet evidence and an underlying mechanism for this is lacking. Here, we combine systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and NMR spectroscopy to demonstrate that the major RNA-binding domains of the two most distantly related IMPs (ZBP1 and IMP2) bind to different consensus sequences and regulate targets consistent with their knockout phenotypes and roles in disease. We find that the targeting specificity of each IMP is determined by few amino acids in their variable loops. As variable loops often differ amongst KH domain paralogs, we hypothesize that this is a general mechanism for evolving specificity and regulation of the transcriptome.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Post-transcriptional regulation of RNAs is accomplished through their interactions with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). With over 1000 RBPs expressed in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, their ability to regulate RNA is extensive. RBPs participate in all aspects of an RNA’s life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, many are deposited as soon as the RNA is transcribed and they contribute to control over export, localization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and decay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Progress has been made in studying RBPs on the atomic level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, with single cell resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, as well as on a genome wide level by profiling the RNAs that interact with individual RBPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Many families of RBPs are involved in the regulation of normal and pathological processes, but how this regulation occurs or how differences in regulation amongst family members have evolved is not appreciated. Some prominent RBP families that have been studied on both a structural and genome wide level, include Fragile X proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, NOVAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and IGF2BPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">The IGF2BP family (IMP) consists of highly conserved RBPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The founding member of the IMP family, ZBP1, was first characterized in chicken embryonic fibroblasts and then subsequently its paralogs were discovered and named CRD-BP, IMP1, IGF2BP1, and VICKZ1. While the naming convention varied according to the lab that discovered the protein, the functions of ZBP1 as well as amino acid sequence identity are highly conserved across species. In mammals, there are three IMP family members (ZBP1, IMP2, and IMP3). Each protein contains six canonical RNA-binding domains, two RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains and four hnRNP K homology (KH) domains. These RNA-binding domains are arranged into three pairs (RRM12, KH12, and KH34). In humans, IMP members share an overall sequence identity of 56%. The percentage increases to 70% when unstructured linker regions are excluded and the comparison is limited to the individual RNA-binding domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Though these proteins share similar amino acid sequences, each IMP family member regulates a different pool of cellular RNAs and knockouts (KO) of ZBP1, IMP2, and IMP3 have identifiable phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">It has been shown that ZBP1 binds to the 3′ UTR of ß-actin mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and in so doing, prevents its translation until it reaches its destination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, be it the leading edge of a fibroblast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> or a synaptic spine destined for remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. ZBP1KO mice are perinatal lethal, with gross developmental abnormalities, consistent with the observation that ZBP1 expression is maximal during the period of mid to late embryonic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. To identify targets of ZBP1, systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) followed by biochemical and structural characterization revealed two RNA elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The identity of RNA bases and the spacing between them was critical for recognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Genome-wide searches using these stringent binding criteria identified mRNA targets that are critical for cell growth, organization, and neural development, data that is consistent with the phenotype of the ZBP1KO mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. These studies provided a list of targets that are critical for ZBP1’s roles in fibroblast migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, cancer metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, and synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">Investigation of IMP2 has been less extensive than for ZBP1 and IMP3. ZBP1 and IMP3 share high-sequence identity (73% overall) and common temporal expression patterns (mid-to-late period of embryonic development, with little to no expression in the adult). Clinical studies have found their expression to be reactivated in a range of tumors, hinting at a potential role for ZBP1 and IMP3 in cancer pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. IMP2 shares less sequence homology with the other two family members and its expression persists throughout life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Recently, IMP2KO mice have been observed to have a metabolic phenotype that extends their lifespan and renders them resistant to high fat diet induced obesity and type-II diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Further corroborating the role for IMP2 in metabolism, studies have shown that IMP2 regulates the translation of subunits critical for oxidative phosphorylation in normal cells as well as in glioblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Moreover, both IMP2 and a splice variant (p62) appear to be harbingers of a poor prognosis in gastrointestinal, hepatocellular and breast carcinomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, possibly through its regulation of mitochondrial function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par7">Though much work has gone into studying individual family members of the IMP family, it is not clear if they recognize similar or different targets. While genome wide CLIP studies show a correlation between the total RNA pools targeted by each protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, we investigated individual targets and find, while some targets can bind to both ZBP1 and IMP2, others are specific for one or the other. The similarities and differences between the binding elements of ZBP1 and IMP2 reveal how RNAse digestion based techniques (such as CLIP) can digest away a necessary “GG” motif that is common to the consensus RNA-binding sequence of both proteins. Here, utilizing both crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy revealed how divergence in amino acid sequence can contribute to differences in RNA specificity. Targeted mutations in the amino acids of IMP2 allow the mutant to bind to ZBP1 targets. This represents how engineering of KH domains can provide insights into how this highly conserved family of RNA-binding proteins has evolved to express different genes post-transcriptionally within the cell.</p>

<title>Structural similarity of ZBP1 and IMP2 KH34 domains</title>
<p id="Par8">ZBP1 and IMP2 have high-sequence identity (&gt;70%) in their RNA-binding domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). In vivo functional studies as well as in vitro work suggested that KH34 domains are responsible for RNA recognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. To determine if there are differences in the overall topology of the KH34 domains, we first crystallized the KH34 domain of IMP2 and compared it to the previously determined structure of ZBP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>ZBP1 and IMP2 overview and crystal structures. <bold>a</bold> Overall domain structure and sequence conservation of the IMP family members above.

<p id="Par9">Similar to ZBP1KH34, we found that the individual KH3 and KH4 domains of IMP2 adopted the type 1 KH fold (βααββα) and were also arranged in an anti-parallel pseudo-dimer orientation. The overall structures of IMP2KH34 and ZBP1KH34 are almost identical (RMSD of 0.5 Å for all C<sub>α</sub> atoms) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). Because the anti-parallel pseudo-dimer of ZBP1KH34 recognizes a bipartite RNA element<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that IMP2KH34 may recognize a similar bipartite RNA topology. However, it is not known if the structural similarity of IMP2KH34 allows it to recognize the same RNA-binding element as ZBP1.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec4">
<title>IMP2 does not bind to the canonical RNA target of ZBP1</title>
<p id="Par10">To determine if IMP2KH34 could recognize the canonical RNA target of ZBP1KH34, we tested its binding affinity using quantitative electrophoretic gel shift assay (EMSA). We used the minimal ß-actin zipcode element as an in vitro RNA (C28 zipcode RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>). We observed that IMP2KH34 had lower affinity to the ß-actin C28 zipcode RNA (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 161 nM) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>) compared with ZBP1KH34 (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 15 nM) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). This result suggested that the KH34 domains of IMP2 and ZBP1 might recognize and bind different RNA targets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec5">
<title>SELEX identifies IMP2-specific RNAs</title>
<p id="Par11">To understand if the inability of IMP2KH34 to bind the ß-actin zipcode RNA was due to a specific sequence preference or a general RNA-binding defect in the KH34 domains of IMP2, we performed SELEX using IMP2KH34 as a protein bait. We generated an RNA library where 30 nucleotides were randomized at each position (N30). The N30 pool was passed over an amylose resin bound to a recombinant MBP-IMP2KH34 fusion protein. After nine rounds of selection, we found that the RNA library was bound to IMP2KH34 with an approximately 500-fold higher affinity compared with the initial randomized RNA library (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a, b</xref>). From the last round of selection, we identified a bipartite RNA element that included a 5′ CA element, CU-CA-C, followed by ten nucleotides and then a variable 3′ GG element, (A/U)-GG-(A/U). These CA and GG recognition elements exhibited similarity to the ZBP1KH34 consensus, C-GG-AC and (C/A)-CA-(C/U)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). This indicates that the SELEX procedure identified closely related sequences from two different members of the IMP family.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>SELEX discovers targets that are IMP2 specific. <bold>a</bold> The sequences of RNAs after nine rounds of SELEX are shown.

The four most abundant motifs were plotted in terms of their relative abundance in each of the sequenced SELEX rounds. Source data are provided as a source data file</p></caption><graphic id="d29e652" xlink:href="41467_2019_12193_Fig2_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par12">To demonstrate that the CA and GG elements found in the SELEX procedure were both necessary for binding to IMP2KH34, in vitro transcribed RNAs with either the CA or GG sequences mutated to CG or AA, respectively, were tested for binding by IMP2KH34. We observed that the mutation of either the CA or the GG element completely abolished binding of the RNA to IMP2KH34 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a, b</xref>). These results confirmed that the 5′ CA and 3′ GG elements were required for IMP2KH34 specific binding.</p>
<p id="Par13">We then tested representative sequences from the last round of selection. These RNAs showed consistently tight binding to IMP2KH34 and not to ZBP1KH34 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1c, d</xref>). These results suggested that the sequences conserved (the CA and GG elements and their spacing) across different RNAs mediated the IMP2KH34 specificity of the SELEX targets.</p>
<p id="Par14">To determine the evolution of specificity, the affinity of individual RNA pools to IMP2KH34 at each SELEX round was tested. As a control, the same pools of RNA were tested against ZBP1KH34 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d, e</xref>). We observed that after four rounds of selection, IMP2KH34 bound with higher affinity to the RNAs (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 2.4 nM) compared with ZBP1KH34 (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 8 nM) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a, b</xref>). The specificity of the library (defined as the ratio of the IMP2KH34 <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>/ZBP1KH34 <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) increased across the subsequent rounds of selection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c–e</xref>). This increase in specificity was due to an increase in pool’s affinity for IMP2 and a decrease of the pools ability to bind ZBP1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). This suggests that during early rounds in SELEX, sequences can bind to both IMP2KH34 and ZBP1KH34 but become enriched for sequences that favor the binding of IMP2KH34 relative to ZBP1KH34 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par15">Both CA and GG dinucleotides are necessary for binding to all the IMPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, and were enriched by SELEX in this study.

We found that RNAs containing the 5′ UCA and 3′ (A/U)-GG-(A/U) sequence were enriched; AGGU and UGGA motifs had the highest enrichment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>). In contrast, the GG element present in the ß-actin zipcode RNA must be CGGA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> in order to bind ZBP1. Therefore, the enrichment of AGGU and UGGA elements as IMP2 targets may provide an explanation for IMP2KH34 binding specificity.

<title>IMP2KH34 variable loop mutagenesis mimics ZBP1 binding</title>
<p id="Par17">Mutation of the GXXG motifs completely abolishes all nucleic acid binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that the highly conserved GXXG motifs mediate phosphate backbone interactions and that the variable loops functioned to recognize specific nucleobases. To determine if the variable loops mediate differences in RNA-binding between ZBP1KH34 and IMP2KH34 we generated a chimeric protein where amino acids present near both variable loops of IMP2KH34 were exchanged with the corresponding amino acids present in the same position on ZBP1KH34 variable loops (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>). We found that this exchange converted IMP2 into a ZBP1 like binding protein, which bound to the ß-actin zipcode, the ZBP1 RNA-binding element (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). This result indicates that the variable loops mediated the RNA-binding specificity of IMP2KH34. To further determine if both KH3 and KH4 variable loops were necessary and sufficient to mediate specific binding to RNA, we generated single variable loop mutants of either IMP2KH3 or IMP2KH4 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>). We observed that only four amino acid mutations in the KH3 domain were necessary to allow IMP2 to bind to the ß-actin zipcode with nearly equal affinity to ZBP1KH34 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b–d</xref>).

<title>IMP2 recognition element mutations reveal binding preference</title>
<p id="Par18">The KH3 mutant was sufficient to confer a gain of RNA-binding function for IMP2 binding to the ß-actin zipcode. As evidenced by NMR chemical shift perturbations of IMP2 and ZBP1, both proteins’ KH3 domains interact with a CA motif. We showed that the CA dinucleotide core of the IMP2 5′ RE is also present in the ß-actin zipcode (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a, b</xref> and ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>), therefore we determined if the two nucleotides adjacent to the CA in the ß-actin zipcode specifically inhibited IMP2 binding. We systematically mutated the individual nucleotides within and around the CA region of the ß-actin zipcode (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>) and determined if the mutated ß-actin zipcode was bound to IMP2KH34. We found that mutagenesis of the ß-actin zipcode at positions adjacent to the CA motif, specifically position 22A to U, increased the affinity of the ß-actin zipcode to IMP2KH34 by tenfold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a–c</xref>). When nucleotides adjacent to the GG motif of the ß-actin zipcode were mutated, binding for IMP2KH34 was not observed (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Concordant with the SELEX results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>), the strongest binding occurred when position 22C was mutated to U, leading to a 5′ RE of UCA for IMP2KH34 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>, left, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>). These results indicate that, unlike ZBP1, which can bind to both “(A/C)-CA”, IMP2 has a higher specificity for nucleotides in its 5′ RE, requiring the sequence UCA.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Mutations validate the sequence preference of individual IMP2 RNA recognition elements. <bold>a</bold>

<p id="Par19">To determine the binding specificity of the KH4 domains, a similar approach measured binding of the KH3 mutant to the ß-actin zipcode (by now allowing for binding to CCA element) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>, right, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>). The GG motif was crucial, and any mutation caused a complete loss of binding (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). The surrounding nucleotide preferences were different for ZBP1KH34 and the IMP2KH3MUT. ZBP1KH34 was intolerant to mutations surrounding the GG element, however, the IMP2KH3MUT was permissive to almost any nucleotide except for G (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). To determine if the variable loops were sufficient to dictate this specificity we also repeated the experiment on the IMP2KH34 mutant and found it resembled ZBP1’s CGGA specificity. This suggests that ZBP1 has stringent sequence specificity for its KH4 domain whereas IMP2 is flexible and could tolerate any nucleotide except for a third G (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b, d</xref>); and that the variable loops were sufficient to determine KH specificity.</p>

<p id="Par21">To define RNA targets further, we compared these transcripts to mRNA targets of ZBP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Pools of RNAs were ZBP1 or IMP2 specific, or potentially overlapping (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>). In H9ES cells, RNAs bound by both ZBP1 and IMP2 (as discovered by eCLIP) provided evidence of transcripts such as SEPT8 being bound in vivo by both proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par23">This work has shown that KH domains can confer sequence specific recognition of RNAs through their variable loop regions. We have shown that mutations within the variable loop regions are responsible for the divergence in consensus sequence between ZBP1 and IMP2. Mutating the variable loop amino acids as well as the nucleotides that they recognize has clarified differences in the sequence specificity between the most distant IMP family members.</p>
<p id="Par24">Recently structural studies have investigated the binding preferences for the remaining family member, IMP3, and found an analogous bipartite consensus sequence of CGGC—12–25—CA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Given that the amino acid sequence of IMP3 is closer to ZBP1 than IMP2, one may expect its consensus sequence to more closely resemble ZBP1’s CGG-(A/U) motif than IMP2’s (A/U)-GG-(A/U) motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This points towards a consistent evolutionary divergence amongst IMP family members for novel recognition sequences (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). Interestingly, in the study of IMP3, the authors found that KH12 required the same GG and CA consensus motifs as KH34. While other work has shown that KH34 are the major RNA-binding domains for each of the IMP family members<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, this brings up the possibility that their interactions with RNA targets may either be reinforced or modified by the presence of additional RNA-binding domains. Modification of binding preferences by additional domains may explain some of the discrepancies between highly specific in vitro binding and broad binding highly overlapping targets in vivo. This metabolic role for IMP2 as well as its divergence from ZBP1 was clear from mouse studies, however high throughput studies often find significant overlap in the target pools. Reconciling the specificity differences of these proteins when comparing top down vs bottom up approaches remains a challenge and could benefit from orthogonal techniques to validate in vivo binding.</p>
<p id="Par25">These studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> of the IMP family as well as the data presented here show the necessity of the GG motif for all IMP family members. This provides an important consideration when performing next generation sequencing of IMP family targets. A number of CLIP studies have relied on RNAse T1, leading to cleavage of RNA after G nucleotides and G depleting the final sequencing dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. As the “GG” sequence is required for binding to targets, RNAses other than T1 should be used for studies of the IMP family to avoid depletion of the diguanosine motif in the final dataset. This may explain why in a previous study of the IMP family, only the CA motif was found to be enriched, instead of both the CA and GG motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. It would be possible to avoid this bias with newer methods that avoid the RNAse digestion and multiple processing steps of CLIP.</p>
<p id="Par26">In addition to avoiding sequencing bias, analysis of high throughput methods often fails to recognize the bipartite consensus element necessary for binding. The single consensus elements that have previously been discovered for the IMP family do not contain much complexity, often did not bind to canonical targets and did not explain the binding preferences of each protein. Given that the IMP family, like most RNA-binding proteins rely on multiple RNA-binding domains where each domain has its specific sequence preference, it is necessary for motif searches to consider possible randomized linker regions between specific binding motifs. Alongside previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, this study incorporates randomized variable linker regions between different domain consensus sequences when performing in silico target searches. The increased flexibility between consensus sequence elements helps discover targets of the IMP family and may inform future genome wide searches of other RBP targets.</p>
<p id="Par27">In addition to discovering the consensus sequence of IMP2, this study validates the importance of the variable loop in determining specificity of closely related RNA KH domains. Studies have shown that the highly conserved GXXG loop is essential for binding to RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, and others have suggested that the variable region may be important for generating target specificity. There are several positively charged residues in the GXXG loops of the IMP family members and these regions may prefer to interact with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the RNA, and from our structural data this would point to the variable loops functioning as readers of nucleotide identity. In addition to mutating the GXXG loops, studies have been able to mutate residues in the linker between KH domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> or the KH domain variable loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> to decrease the affinity of RBPs to their targets. This study provides the first gain of RNA-binding function mutations for the IMP family and for KH domains. While these variable loop mutations may be an IMP family specific it would be interesting to see if other families of KH domain containing proteins, such as NOVA, follow similar rules for generating specificity.</p>
<p id="Par28">The SELEX experiments show that early on in selection, targets bound to both ZBP1KH34 and IMP2KH34 and contained a mix of nucleotides flanking the required “CA” and “GG” motifs. Further selection with IMP2KH34 caused the SELEX pool to become more IMP2 specific. This correlated with enrichment of IMP2 specific sequences that dominated the pool (AGGU and UGGA), sequences that have been previously shown to prevent RNAs from binding to ZBP1KH34. This specificity was mediated solely by specific variable loop amino acid mutations.</p>
<p id="Par29">It is likely that both the variable loops amino acids and target RNA sequences co-evolved when gene duplication of the IMP family occurred. Given that ZBP1 most resembles the ancestral family member and is essential for organism survival, the process of gene amplification of the IMP family members must strike a balance between loss of function and gain of function. During its evolution IMP2 has lost the ability to bind to the ß-actin zipcode and evolved away from a role in ß-actin localization to provide overall benefit to the organism by gain of function. Therefore, IMP2 has neo-functionalized with respect with ZBP1 to regulate transcripts involved in energy metabolism. Interestingly the IMP2KO mouse is resistant to diabetes through an increase in brown adipose tissue and increased thermogenesis. This phenotype is strikingly similar to the function of one of its evolutionarily conserved targets, GRB10 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). As the IMPs are noted to be translational repressors, it is possible that GRB10 is upregulated in the knockouts. Future studies may dissect how a combination of IMP2KO and GRB10 upregulation may lead to anti-diabetic phenotypes.</p>
<p id="Par30">When comparing our work with two other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> of the IMP family KH34 domains we see several evolutionary trends. Given that ZBP1 and IMP3 are more related to each other than IMP2 we find that they recognize a similar consensus sequence. Interestingly though, there appears to be a divergence where ZBP1 can recognize both the original and swapped orientations of its consensus but IMP2 and IMP3 bind to only one orientation, which represents the swapped orientation of the zipcode consensus.</p>
<p id="Par31">Like many other Type I KH domains, the overall structure of ZBP1KH34 and IMP2KH34 are very similar in the free state. As has been previously shown in the limited number structures containing of KH RNA complexes, the RNA bound state shows little change compared to the RNA free state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Co-crystals are extremely useful to determine the residues and bases involved in binding. When looking at these structures, proteins similar to the IMP family (poly C RNA-binding protein and NOVA2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>) show extensive interactions of RNA with the variable loops. However, to date, the few didomain co-crystals do not show a single RNA spanning an interaction with both domains but rather the structures have one RNA hairpin per domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. This is contrary to the biochemical evidence and points toward a limitation of crystallography.</p>
<p id="Par32">The IMP family members are selectively expressed during different developmental time points. While ZBP1 and IMP3 are largely limited to embryonic expression, IMP2 is broadly expressed and its expression persists throughout life. Immortalized cell lines as well as cancers selectively overexpress different IMP family members and their overexpression correlates with growth rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, invasive potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, and patient prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Work has also shown that IMP overexpression alone is sufficient to increase invasive potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> and that the IMP family are among the most up regulated RBPs across the TCGA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. What is still not understood is why these selective patterns of IMP expression provide benefit to the cells or tumors and the first step required to understand this is a faithful and unbiased profiling of RNA targets. The in vitro approach taken in this study is not limited by cell type and provides the framework necessary for follow up in vivo studies of the IMP family.</p>

<p id="Par941">IMP2KH34 (0.5 mM) was crystallized using sitting-drop vapor diffusion at 22 °C by mixing equal volumes of the protein and reservoir solution (23% PEG-3350, 200 mM ammonium sulfate, 100 mM Tris pH 8.0). Crystals were cryoprotected by soaking them in the reservoir solution supplemented with 25% glycerol before flash cooling in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected to 2.05 Å resolution from a single crystal at the Advanced Photon Source SGX-CAT beam line (Argonne, IL) at a wavelength of 0.9792 Å.

<title>Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure</title>
<p id="Par43">Selection of RNAs was performed by preparing an antisense degenerate library with the sequence 5′-<italic>TTTCGACGCACGCAACTATC</italic>-(N30)-<italic>GCTAAACTGCGTCGCTCTGCCC</italic>-3′ by chemical synthesis (Integrated DNA Technologies). Thirty nucleotides (N30) were randomized to 25%A, 25%T, 25%G, and 25%C. Constant sequence regions are italicized. The N30 library (200 pmol) was converted to dsDNA by reverse transcription following the manufacturer’s specifications (SuperScript<sup>™</sup> III Reverse Transcriptase; Invitrogen) using the IMP2N30 top strand primer 5′-GAtaatacgactcactataggGCAGAGCGACGCAGTTTAGC-3′. T7 promoter sequence in lowercase. Then, N30 RNA pool library used for selection was generated by in vitro T7 transcription (MEGAshortscript<sup>™</sup> T7 Transcription Kit; Ambion) of the dsDNA library and gel-purified. The stringency of selection was increased by progressively reducing the concentration of the purified MBP-IMP2KH34 in the binding reaction: in the first round of selection, MBP-IMP2KH34 (300 nM) was equilibrated with the library RNA pool (400 nM). In subsequent rounds of selection, the concentration of MBP-IMP2KH34 was reduced to 30 nM (rounds 2 and 3), 15 nM (round 4), 3 nM (round 5), and 1 nM (round 6–9), while RNA concentration was reduced to 300 nM (round 2–4), 90 nM (round 5), 30 nM (round 6) and 60 nM (round 7–9). After phenol/chloroform extraction, the RNA selected in every round was converted to cDNA by reverse transcription (SuperScript<sup>™</sup> III Reverse Transcriptase; Invitrogen) using the IMP2N30 bottom strand primer 5′-TTTCGACGCACGCAACTATC-3′. The resulting cDNA library was then amplified by PCR using the IMP2N30 top strand and IMP2N30 bottom strand primers and then in vitro transcribed into RNA for the next round of selection. Subsequent rounds of selection were performed similarly, except that a negative selection step was included by incubating the RNA pool with amylose resin in the absence of protein to remove any RNAs with nonspecific affinity for the amylose resin. N30 Random RNA pool library and RNA from rounds 4, 7, 8, and 9 were fluorescein-labeled, and their affinity for MBP-IMP2KH34 and MBP-ZBP1KH34 (control) was quantified by EMSA.</p>

UTRs were queried for the nucleotide sequence CUCAC-(N10-15)-(A/U)-GG-(A/U), where N represents any intervening nucleotide. Genes demonstrating conservation of this sequence motif between human and mouse genomes were identified as potential RNA ligands of IMP2. IPA Knowledge Base 9 (Ingenuity Systems) was used to determine diseases and functional category enrichment of these potential ligands. The <italic>P</italic>-value, based on a right-tailed Fisher’s exact test, considers the number of identified focus genes and the total number of molecules known to be associated with these categories in the IPA Knowledge Base.
