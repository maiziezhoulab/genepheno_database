<abstract>
<p>The CORL family of CNS-specific proteins share a Smad-binding region with mammalian SnoN and c-Ski protooncogenes. In this family Drosophila CORL has two mouse and two human relatives. Roles for the mouse and human CORL proteins are largely unknown. Based on genome-wide association studies linking the human CORL proteins <italic>Fussel15</italic> and <italic>Fussel18</italic> with ataxia, we tested the hypothesis that <italic>dCORL</italic> mutations will cause adult movement disorders. For our initial tests, we conducted side by side studies of adults with the small deletion <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> and eight control strains. We found that deletion mutants exhibit three types of behavioral plasticity. First, significant climbing defects attributable to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic> are eliminated by age. Second, significant phototaxis defects due to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic> are partially ameliorated by age and are not due to faulty photoreceptors. Third, <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> males raised in groups have a lower courtship index than males raised as singles though this defect is not due to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic>. Subsequent tests showed that the climbing and phototaxis defects were phenocpied by <italic>dCORL<sup>21B</sup></italic> and <italic>dCORL<sup>23C</sup></italic> two CRISPR generated mutations. Overall, the finding that adult movement defects due to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic> are subject to age-dependent plasticity suggests new hypotheses for CORL functions in flies and mammals.</p>

<body>
<p>Studies of a <italic>dCORL</italic> deletion (<italic>fussel</italic> in Flybase) revealed roles in TGF-β/Activin signaling during larval mushroom body development and in insulin expressing neurons in adults (Takaesu <italic>et al.</italic> 2102, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tran <italic>et al.</italic> 2018a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">b</xref>). dCORL has two mouse relatives mCORL1 (mSKOR1) and mCORL2 (mSKOR2). mCORL1 transcription in embryos is found only in dorsal interneurons of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Mizuhara <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), while mCORL2 is expressed only in Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum (Minaki <italic>et al.</italic> 2008). <italic>mCORL2</italic> knockout studies revealed a requirement for Purkinje cell differentiation via the inhibition of interneuron fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Miyata <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Nakatani <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). No <italic>mCORL1</italic> knockout has been reported. In adults <italic>mCORL1</italic> is primarily, though not exclusively, expressed in the cerebellum while <italic>mCORL2</italic> is restricted to the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Yue <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). In adults, the specific neurons expressing the <italic>mCORL</italic> genes are unknown. A recent study of <italic>mCORL</italic> transgenes in Drosophila demonstrated that mCORL2 and dCORL have a common function with mCORL1 fulfilling a distinct function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Stinchfield <italic>et al.</italic> 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>dCORL has two human relatives <italic>Fussel15</italic> (hSKOR1) and <italic>Fussel18</italic> (hSKOR2). RT-PCR studies report that the <italic>Fussel15</italic> expression pattern is the same as its homolog <italic>mCORL1</italic>, primarily though not exclusively in the adult cerebellum. The <italic>Fussel18</italic> expression pattern is the same as its homolog <italic>mCORL2</italic>, restricted to the adult cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fagerberg <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Genome-wide association studies have linked single nucleotide polymorphisms in <italic>Fussel15</italic> to three ataxias - Essential Tremor, Periodic Leg Movement and Restless Leg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kemlink <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Moore <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>). An association of <italic>Fussel18</italic> with ataxia has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Valence <italic>et al.</italic> 2019</xref>). Ataxias are movement disorders arising from dysfunction in the cerebellum, where <italic>Fussel15</italic> and <italic>Fussel18</italic> are expressed.</p>
<p>Taking cues from: 1) the study of the <italic>mCORL2</italic> knockout in Pukinje neurons of the cerebellum, 2) <italic>Fussel15</italic> and <italic>Fussel18</italic> associations with ataxia, 3) the demonstration that <italic>dCORL</italic> functions in adult brains and 4) the similarity of transgenic <italic>mCORL2</italic> and <italic>dCORL</italic> functions, we examined <italic>dCORL</italic> mutant adults for movement defects. Our hypothesis was that the association of <italic>Fussel15</italic> and <italic>Fussel18</italic> with ataxia will be conserved and visible in <italic>dCORL</italic> adult mutants as defects in one or more movement-based behaviors.</p>
<p>Here we report adult behavioral studies of the small deletion <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> and eight control strains. We found that <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies exhibit three types of behavioral plasticity. First, significant climbing defects attributable to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic> are eliminated by age. Second, significant phototaxis defects due to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic> are partially ameliorated by age and are not due to faulty photoreceptors. Third, <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> males raised in groups have a lower courtship index than males raised as singles though this defect is not due to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic>. Subsequent tests showed that the climbing and phototaxis defects were phenocpied by <italic>dCORL<sup>21B</sup></italic> and <italic>dCORL<sup>23C</sup></italic> two CRISPR generated mutations. Overall, the finding that adult movement defects due to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic> are subject to age-dependent plasticity suggests new hypotheses for CORL functions in flies and mammals.</p>

<p>Guide RNAs for <italic>dCORL</italic> were designed using the CRISPR Optimal Target Finder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://targetfinder.flycrispr.neuro.brown.edu/">http://targetfinder.flycrispr.neuro.brown.edu/</ext-link>) using the following parameters: guide length 20 base pairs, 5′GG only. Oligos to targets 1 and 4 were cloned into pU6 BbsI chi RNA resulting in two gRNAs that were co-injected by BestGene Inc. (Chino Hills, CA) into embryos carrying maternally expressed Cas9 (PBac{y[+mDint2]=vas-Cas9}VK00027; BDSC #51324). Thirty-nine G0 flies were mated to flies from a transheterozygous 4<sup>th</sup> chromosome stock (P{w[+mC]=ActGFP}unc-13[GJ]/In(4)ci[D]; BDSC #9549). After successful mating, G0 flies were screened for deletions by PCR analysis using the target 4 forward and target 1 reverse oligos that flank both targeted sites. Five G0 lines yielded additional fragments, suggestive of a deletion. From these lines, 8 single males carrying a putative dCORL deletion over ci<sup>D</sup> were crossed to parental females and rescreened by PCR for the presence of a deletion. Offspring from two of the five G0 founders yielded independent and deletions in the Sno homology domain of exon 3 (<italic>dCORL<sup>21B</sup></italic> and <italic>dCORL<sup>23C</sup></italic>). These were confirmed by sequencing homozygotes.

<title>Adult climbing:</title>
<p>20 males or 20 females at 5 or 10 days old were examined individually in 14 ml tubes with an interior coating of propylene that facilitates climbing (Falcon). Every fly was tested six times in two rounds of three trials at a temperature of 22° and humidity greater than 60%. The Falcon tubes were marked at 6cm from the bottom and the test was to estimate the climbing time for the 6cm distance. If a fly failed to complete the test within ten seconds, then that was considered a failure. From this experiment three parameters were estimated. 1) The average climbing time (average score) per genotype was estimated by finding the average time of each fly (average of six trials) and then calculating the overall average scores of all flies. 2) The average best score was calculated by averaging the best score (the shortest climbing time from six trials/fly) of all flies per genotype. 3) The average failure rate was calculated by the same methods as average time across all individuals of a given genotype.</p>

<sec id="s6">
<title>Adult phototaxis:</title>
<p>20-30 males or females at 5 or 10 days old were transferred into 25ml sterilized plastic pipettes with both sides blocked by cotton. The pipette was then placed vertically on the surface of the bench top causing the flies to be concentrated at the lower end. Then the pipette was placed horizontally and the end opposite to the flies was illuminated. After 30 sec the other end of the pipette was illuminated. This procedure was repeated fifteen times. The number of flies crossing the midline of the pipette within fifteen seconds by moving either toward or away from the light source was counted.</p>

<sec id="s7">
<title>Adult male courtship:</title>
<p>Five day old males were tested. In the “singles” assays, males were collected as late pupae and isolated in vials (one fly per vial) until the age of 5 days. Each individual was examined for courtship with a virgin female of same age and genotype (between 10 and 25 males were examined for each genotype). In the “group” assays, 10 to 25 males were collected as late pupae and placed together in the same vial. When the group reached 5 days old, each individual was examined for courtship with a virgin female of same age and genotype. All virgin females were stored in groups before testing (20 females per vial). The assay was conducted with one male and one virgin female in a courtship chamber (1.2cm diameter × 0.8cm high), which contained a layer of yeast media. Courtship index is the percentage of time that the male spent successfully courting the female during a 10 min period (<italic>e.g.</italic>, orientation, vibrating wings and attempting to copulate).</p>

<title>Larval crawling:</title>
<p>Five groups of ten early third instar larvae were collected, washed in dH<sub>2</sub>O and placed at the center of an agar-coated 10cm petri dish. One minute videos of spontaneous crawling activity were recorded and the average and best scores estimated from bouts of continuous crawling. There were a total of 50 videos for each genotype. A template at the bottom of the dish (2mm of increasing diameter for seven concentric circles) was used to facilitate measurements of the distance traveled. At the end of a minute a snapshot was taken and the distribution of the larvae quantitated via the concentric circles.</p>

Electrodes were created from filamented glass micropipettes (1.2 mm OD, 0.8 mm ID, WPI, Sarasota, FL) with an electrode-puller (P97 Flaming/Brown Micropipette Puller, Shutter Inst.). Electrodes were filled with a saline solution (0.7% w/v NaCl) and inserted into an electrode holder containing a chloridized silver wire. The electrode resistance was ∼10 MΩ. The recording electrode was inserted into the cornea, while the ground electrode, filled with 3M NaCl, was inserted into the proboscis. Signals were recorded with a DC amplifier (Axoclamp-2B, Molecular Devices). The signals were sampled at 10 kHz by a data acquisition device (Digidata 1200, Molecular Devices) and without filtering were analyzed and displayed with Clampex v8.1 software (Molecular Devices). A generic cool-white LED driven at a constant voltage delivered light flashes. The LED was positioned toward the eye, approximately 1 cm away, and every fly received three light flashes of 500 ms separated by 60 sec of dark adaptation. Means for each genotype were compared with an unpaired, two-tailed Student’s T-test.</p>

<title>Adult movement defects attributable to loss of dCORL show age-dependent plasticity</title>
<p>In two previous studies we employed six control strains to determine if a phenotype observed for <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> was attributable to the loss of <italic>dCORL</italic> and not one of the other three genes in the deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Takaesu <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tran <italic>et al.</italic> 2018b</xref>). Two of the six are the parental PiggyBac insertions employed to generate <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> and four lines carry mutations in the other three genes. Tested alleles for two of the genes were previously shown to be nulls: <italic>Glu-RA-null</italic> is a deletion resulting from an imprecise excision and <italic>spx<sup>720RW</sup></italic> is an engineered mutation disabling splicing. For the third gene, <italic>Pbac{RB}e02096</italic> is predicted to disrupt all transcripts of the eIF4E-Transporter and should also be a null (Fig. S1). We showed that <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> does not affect the adjacent <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/FB:FBgn0011725?doi=10.1534/g3.120.400648"><italic>twin</italic></ext-link><italic> of </italic><italic>eyeless</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Takaesu <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tran <italic>et al.</italic> 2018b</xref>). We employed these six strains, plus yw as a control for genetic background, in studies of <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> adult behavior (8 lines total).</p>
<p>The project began with a climbing assay in 5 day old adults of both sexes separately for <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> and the seven control lines. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> we show the average score (climbing time) and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> the average best score (fastest climbing time). <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> females require significantly longer time to complete the task than all other lines in both measures. <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> males require more time than all strains but are only significantly slower than 4 of them. We observed that <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies exhibit longer climbing times because they stop frequently and wander horizontally rather than climbing vertically. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> we show that <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies fail to complete the climbing test signficantly more often than all other flies of both sexes. The results of these assays suggest that the climbing defect of <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies is attributable to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic>. Numerical data are shown in Table S1.</p>

<p>To ascertain if there was any age-dependent plasticity in the <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> climbing phenotype we examined 10 day old males and females separately. It is easily visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref> that age significantly improved both climbing average score and average best score of <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies from those of 5 day old mutants. As none of the control strains showed any difference with age, both scores for 10 day old <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> now match all controls in both sexes. Age-dependent plasticity is also seen for the climbing failure rate of <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. There is improvement of roughly 10% in the failure rate strictly due to age. However, this remained significantly higher than in all the other lines, which did not show improvement. As a result, <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> did not catch up as they did in climbing time. The results demonstrate that the <italic>dCORL</italic> mediated climbing defects in speed and completion of <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies are subject to age-dependent plasticity. Numerical data are shown in Table S2.</p>
<p>Next we deployed phototaxis assays examining the sexes separately from the same eight strains. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows that <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies of both sexes were significantly impaired in their light response. The average number of photopositive <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies was roughly 10% the number in all other lines. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, for six of the fifteen trials no <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies moved toward the light. This was not seen in any other line in any trial. We observed that <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies initially react positively but then wander randomly reminiscent of their climbing phenotype. The results of these assays suggest that the light response defect of <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies is attributable to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic>. Numerical data are shown in Table S3.</p>

A) Phototaxis assay of 5 day and 10 day old males and females from 8 strains. Graphs report the percent of flies of each genotype that move toward light when given a binary choice. Numerical data in Table S3. Phototaxis assays reveal an effect of age on performance similar to that seen with climbing. 10 day old <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies are significantly improved compared to 5 day olds. For the other strains no obvious pattern is visible with some strains improved with age while others decreased. The distinction between <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> and all other strains at both ages was highly significant. B) Detailed results from the assay of 5 day old males. Of fifteen trials with <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic>, six had no <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies move toward the light.

<p>Examining 10 day old <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies for phototaxis defects again revealed age-dependent plasticity. <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> males and females consistently performed better than 5 day olds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As with climbing failures, even though the results for the other lines did not change <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> did not catch up. This line still contained significantly fewer photopostive flies. The results demonstrate that the <italic>dCORL</italic> mediated defects in light response of <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies are subject to age-dependent plasticity. Overall we observed in the climbing and phototaxis assays that <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies initiate normally but are unable to sustain either behavior due to the loss of <italic>dCORL</italic>. The climbing and phototaxis data for <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> displayed age-dependent plasticity with improvement in all 4 tests. Improvement was sufficient to erase the climing speed defects but not the completion or phototaxis defects.</p>
<p>To address the hypothesis that the phototaxis defect in <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies was due to a vision defect, rather than a motor defect, we compared electrinoretinograms of <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> 10 day old males with the same age males from one of the control lines. We chose the <italic>Glu-RA-control</italic> strain that contains a precise excision reverting to wild type at the sequence and phenotype levels. We found that photoreceptor potential (as measured in millivolts) in <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies is significantly more robust than in the <italic>Glu-RA-control</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Contrast between <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> and <italic>Glu-RA-control</italic> performance in the phototaxis assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> with <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> significantly worse than <italic>Glu-RA-control</italic>) and the retinogram assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> with <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> significantly better than <italic>Glu-RA-control</italic>) indicates that the phototaxis defect in <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies is not due to a vision deficit. Numerical data in Table S3. The data support our initial hypothesis that <italic>dCORL</italic> adult mutants will display movement-based defects.</p>

<title>Df(4)dCORL defects in male courtship are not attributable to loss of dCORL</title>
<p>We next turned to courtship assays to determine if <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> males displayed a phenotype attributable to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic> and if so, whether there was any behavioral plasticity. In this case we examined social context dependent plasticity in the courtship index (the percent of time spent in courtship leading to mating success within a ten minute period) for 5 day old virgin males with a virgin female of the same age and genotype. We added an additional control strain, the true wild type Canton-S. For males raised singly from eclosion to 5 days old, <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> was not different than Canton-S. There was a significant reduction in courtship in 2 strains compared to <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> top). For males raised and mated in groups, <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> was not different than Canton-S.

When looking within genotypes at the courtship of singles <italic>vs.</italic> group raised males, all strains including <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> showed significant reductions in group raised males but not Canton-S.

<p>Interestingly, the median for the courtship index of <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> males raised in groups was the highest of all strains in this test except for Canton-S. Males from the parental line <italic>Pbac{WH}f06253</italic> and from <italic>Pbac{RB}e02096</italic> were the worst at group courtship completion. Curiously <italic>Glu-RA-null</italic> males performed better than <italic>Glu-RA-control</italic> males. Taken together the: 1) insignificant difference of single and group raised male courtship for <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> and Canton-S, 2) strength between group raised male courtship for <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic>
<italic>vs.</italic> other mutant strains, 3) unexpectedly strong performance of group raised male courtship for <italic>Glu-RA-null</italic>
<italic>vs.</italic>
<italic>Glu-RA-control</italic> and 4) the poor performance of group raised male courtship for <italic>Pbac{WH}f06253</italic> and <italic>Pbac{RB}e02096</italic> suggest that the group raised male courtship defect in <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> was not due to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic>.</p>
<p>To determine if the reduction in courtship index for group raised males was due to failure to initiate or failure to complete courtship, the initial step of courtship (time to orientation) was evaluated for social context dependent plasticity. For males raised singly <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> was not different than Canton-S. There was a significant increase in time to orientation for 3 strains compared to <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> top). Males raised and mated in groups on average took an order of magnitude longer to orient than their single counterparts in all strains. <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> was not different than Canton-S. There was a significant increase in time to orientation for 3 strains compared to <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> middle). When looking within genotypes at the time to orientation of singles <italic>vs.</italic> group raised males, all strains (including Canton-S and <italic>Df(4)dCORL)</italic> showed significant increases with 2 exceptions. Six strains showed increases in time to orientation and reductions in courtship index when comparing males raised as singles to those raised in groups. We conclude that males when raised in groups fail to begin courtship normally resulting in a reduced courtship index. Numerical data in Table S5.</p>
<p>Overall, the effects of social context on <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> time to orientation or courtship index are not attributable to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic>. As courtship behavior is an innate motor behavior (like climbing and phototaxis), the data on courtship reveal that not all innate behavioral phenotypes of <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies are <italic>dCORL</italic> related</p>

<title>Df(4)dCORL larvae do not display defects in crawling speed or distance traveled</title>

We tested <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> and the six original control lines. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> we show the average score (average crawling speed) and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> the average best score (maximum crawling speed).

<p>To be sure that the climbing and phototaxis defect seen in <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> adults were due to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic> and not another gene in the deletion or a synergystic effect of the loss of multiple genes we generated mutations in <italic>dCORL</italic> by CRISPR.

In both the Zinc finger domain is lost while the APC recognition site that allows a protein to be marked by ubiquitylation for degradation is intact.

<p>Lastly, we checked the longevity of virgin and mated males and females from <italic>dCORL<sup>23C</sup></italic> and <italic>dCORL<sup>21B</sup></italic> and <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> against the CRISPR control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). While the lifespans of all tested strains are significantly shorter than <italic>dCORL<sup>4</sup></italic>, except <italic>dCORL<sup>21C</sup></italic> mated males, neither of the <italic>dCORL</italic> CRISPR mutations showed reductions of the magnitude of <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic>. Numerical data in Table S13. Quantification shows that the distinction in lifespan between <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> and the CRISPR mutants is one of degree. Thus, in virtually all assays the <italic>dCORL<sup>23C</sup></italic> and <italic>dCORL<sup>21</sup></italic><sup>B</sup> phenocopied <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> adding confidence to the association of <italic>dCORL</italic> loss with movement disorders displaying age-dependent plasticity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>How do the data impact our hypothesis that the association of <italic>Fussel15</italic> and <italic>Fussel18</italic> with ataxia will be conserved and visible in <italic>dCORL</italic> adult mutants as defects in movement-based behaviors? First, we are encouraged by the absence of a larval crawling phenotype for <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic>. Most ataxias are not pediatric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Orr 2010</xref>) and thus the absence of a developmental component to the <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> adult climbing defect is consistent with the hypothesis. Second, the absence of any courtship defect attributable to <italic>dCORL</italic> in <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> adult males is not inconsistent with the hypothesis. The complex nature of courtship that includes modalities that are not movement-based such as olfaction and singing provide other potetial causes for this defect. In addition, <italic>sphinx</italic> and <italic>Glu-RA</italic> that lie within <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> have already been implicated in courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dai <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Schoenfeld <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Third, the phototaxis defect attributable to <italic>dCORL</italic> is not caused by a photoreceptor defect and phototaxis is regulated by the same neurotransmitters that regulate movement - dopamine and octopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gorostiza <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). This result is also consistent with our hypothesis.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the direct evidence in support of the hypothesis, our identification of adult climbing defects in two independenly generated <italic>dCORL</italic> mutants and their age-dependent plasticity. The defects in climbing are attributable to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic> due to assays with <italic>dCORL<sup>23C</sup></italic> and <italic>dCORL<sup>21B</sup></italic> and supported by the absence of climbing defects in six control strains with mutations in the region. We conclude that the hypothesis is true, <italic>dCORL</italic> mutations cause deficits in adult movement-based behaviors.</p>
<p>Given this, are there implications for <italic>Fussel15</italic> and <italic>Fussel18</italic> in our data? First to clarify, data from transgene assays in flies showed that mCORL2/SKOR2 and dCORL are both capable of fully rescuing an endogenous function in <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> larvae while mCORL1/SKOR1 cannot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Stinchfield <italic>et al.</italic> 2019</xref>). This fly transgene data indicates that movement defects in <italic>dCORL</italic> mutants are most relevant to <italic>Fussel18/SKOR2</italic> associated ataxias. Second, it is important to consider our observations of “attention-deficit” as the cause of the climbing and phototaxis defects. We noted that initiation of both behaviors appeared normal but then <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies would wander randomly. Third, the age-dependent increases in climbing speed that erase the initial deficits in average score and average best score in males and females of all <italic>dCORL</italic> mutant genotypes could reflect “hyperactivation” of the locomotor circuitry underlying walking. The last piece to consider is that the inbred spontaneously hypertensive rat is the most widely studied rodent model of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and that these rats display both motor impairments and loss of Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bruchhage <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>). In the absence of a genetic model for ADHD, we propose that the <italic>mCORL2/SKOR2</italic> knockout mouse is a candidate. Further, the data suggest that polymorphisms in <italic>Fussel18/SKOR2</italic> be examined for association with ADHD in humans.</p>
<p>In an initial attempt to identify the mechanism behind the movement defects in <italic>dCORL</italic> mutants we pre-fed flies with yohimbine, an antagonist of tyramine receptors. In previous reports, yohimbine feeding rescued adult climbing and flight maintenance defects in a mutant characterized by low octopamine and high tyramine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Saraswati <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Schützler <italic>et al.</italic> 2019</xref>). Tyramine is a metabolic precursor and functional antagonist of octopamine, the fly counterpart to norepinephrine in mammals. In each of the three climbing assays, the combination of age and yohimbine improved the scores of <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> flies over age alone. How <italic>dCORL</italic> might interact with a tyramine/octopamine locomotion circuit awaits further experimentation</p>
<p>Thinking broadly, a new hypothesis derived from the preliminary yohimbine data are that treatment of <italic>Fussel18/SKOR2</italic> associated ataxia with a norepinephrine antagonist would be therapeutic. A first step would be to test this hypothesis in <italic>mCORL2/SKOR2</italic> knockout mice with an ungainly gait from birth to adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Rescue of the gait defect, analogous to the rescue of the climbing defects in <italic>dCORL</italic> mutants by age and yohimbine, is predicted if the hypothesis is true.</p>
<p>Overall, our data shows that <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> mutants exhibit three types of behavioral plasticity. First, significant climbing defects attributable to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic> are eliminated by age. Second, significant phototaxis defects due to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic> are partially ameliorated by age and are not due to faulty photoreceptors. Third, <italic>Df(4)dCORL</italic> males raised in groups have a lower courtship index than males raised as singles though this defect is not due to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic>. Subsequent tests showed that the climbing and phototaxis defects were phenocopied by <italic>dCORL<sup>21B</sup></italic> and <italic>dCORL<sup>23C</sup></italic> two CRISPR generated mutations. Overall, the finding that adult movement defects due to loss of <italic>dCORL</italic> are subject to age-dependent plasticity suggests new hypotheses for CORL functions in flies and mammals.</p>
