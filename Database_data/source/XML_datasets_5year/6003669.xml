<title>SUMMARY</title>
<p id="P2">Transcription factor programming of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) has emerged as an approach to generate human neurons for disease modeling. However, programming schemes produce a variety of cell types, and those neurons that are made often retain an immature phenotype, which limits their utility in modeling neuronal processes, including synaptic transmission. We report that combining <italic>NGN2</italic> programming with SMAD and WNT inhibition generates human patterned induced neurons (hpiNs). Single-cell analyses showed that hpiN cultures contained cells along a developmental continuum, ranging from poorly differentiated neuronal progenitors to well-differentiated, excitatory glutamatergic neurons. The most differentiated neurons could be identified using a <italic>CAMK2A::GFP</italic> reporter gene and exhibited greater functionality, including NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission. We conclude that utilizing single-cell and reporter gene approaches for selecting successfully programmed cells for study will greatly enhance the utility of hpiNs and other programmed neuronal populations in the modeling of nervous system disorders.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="P5">Progress toward producing more accurate <italic>in vitro</italic> models of human brain cell types continues to be made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Brennand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Paşca et al., 2015</xref>). Directed differentiation approaches aim to mimic embryonic development by stepwise specification of neuronal subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Espuny-Camacho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ho et al., 2015</xref>). In one such strategy, pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can be neuralized through the inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Maroof et al., 2013</xref>), regionally specified with morphogens, and then allowed to differentiate. While this approach enables cells to transit through cellular states normally observed during embryogenesis, differentiation unfolds slowly. Generation of early post-mitotic forebrain neurons can take as long as 5 weeks, while the production of astrocytes or oligodendrocytes requires even more extended times in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Tao and Zhang, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">In contrast, transcription factor-programming approaches rely on ectopic expression of lineage-specific transcription factor(s), in either somatic cells or PSCs, to achieve a rapid cell fate conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Son et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Mertens et al., 2016</xref>). It has been shown that Ascl1, Brn2, and Myt1l can convert mouse fibroblasts into induced neurons (iNs) in as little as 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Vierbuchen et al., 2010</xref>). More recently, expression of the neuralizing transcription factor NGN2 in human PSCs (hPSCs) was reported to induce an excitatory neuronal identity in a similar time frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). While these methods allow more rapid production of human neurons, insight into the heterogeneity of differentiated neurons remains limited. Indeed, using single-cell analysis, it was revealed that, in addition to producing iNs, <italic>ASCL1</italic>-mediated programming also generated muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Treutlein et al., 2016</xref>). Uncertainty surrounding the identity of iN populations raises concerns that programming methods might not produce cells with strong relevance for disease studies.</p>
<p id="P7">Cell types made by directed differentiation and programming also share the limitation that they display relatively immature transcriptional phenotypes. For instance, neurons produced by directed differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with schizophrenia most resembled human fetal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Brennand et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, stem cell-derived neurons also displayed immature physiological and synaptic phenotypes. For example, while AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic transmission was robust in <italic>NGN2</italic>-programmed iNs, only limited expression of N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (<italic>NMDARs</italic>), indicative of a more mature state, was detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Increased <italic>NMDAR</italic> expression has routinely been observed only at very late stages of differentiation (up to 145 days in culture) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Kirwan et al., 2015</xref>). Generation of stem cell-derived neurons with robust NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission would have specific translational value, as variants in and around the glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunits 2A and 2B (<italic>GRIN2A</italic> and <italic>GRIN2B</italic>) have been implicated in epilepsy, intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Epi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Sanders et al., 2015</xref>). Improved approaches for generating and identifying neurons with specific and more differentiated phenotypes from PSCs are therefore needed.</p>
<p id="P8">Here we tested the utility of combining aspects of directed differentiation and transcription factor reprogramming. We then performed population and single-cell RNA sequencing, as well as electrophysiological recordings, to understand the properties of the resulting cells. Adding extrinsic neuronal patterning to PSCs expressing <italic>NGN2</italic> led to more effective neutralization, resulting in cells that expressed transcription factors expressed in superficial levels of the cortex. Although these cultures were homogenously neuralized, cells existed in transcriptional states that ranged from early progenitor to well-differentiated excitatory neuron states. More differentiated cells expressing <italic>AMPAR</italic> and <italic>NMDAR</italic> subunits also expressed <italic>CAMK2A</italic>, allowing them to be identified using a <italic>CAMK2A::GFP</italic> reporter gene. This approach allowed the isolation of highly differentiated and synaptically active human patterned induced neurons (hpiNs), underscoring the potential utility of this approach for modeling diseases associated with glutamate receptor dysfunction, including schizophrenia, epilepsy, and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Yamamoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>Patterning of NGN2-Induced hPSCs with Dual SMAD and WNT Inhibition</title>
<p id="P9">Previously, it has been shown that forced expression of the NGN2 transcription factor in hPSCs can induce rapid differentiation into cells with excitable membranes and capable of synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). We set out to investigate whether the extrinsic influences of small molecules that inhibit BMP and TGF-β signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Maroof et al., 2013</xref>) could favorably synergize with the activities of NGN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). To this end, NGN2 expression was induced in TetO-NGN2-T2A-PURO/TetO-GFP lentivirally infected human stem cells by exposure to doxycycline (dox) 1 day after plating. To induce patterning toward a forebrain phenotype, cells were neuralized by inhibiting TGF-β and BMP signaling (treatment with SB431542 and LDN193189), and they were dorsalized by inhibiting Wnt signaling (treatment with XAV939, a tankyrase inhibitor) for 3 days. Puromycin was then applied to select for cells expressing NGN2. The differentiation scheme was performed on both hESC (human embryonic stem cell) and hiPSC lines generated from fibroblasts of healthy individuals (iPS1 and iPS2). At 4 days post-dox induction (day 4), cells were co-cultured with mouse astrocytes to promote neuronal maturation and synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Pfrieger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Eroglu and Barres, 2010</xref>). Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), changes in cell shape were evident by day 4, with PSCs becoming more polarized and eventually adopting a clear neuronal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">To examine genome-wide transcriptional changes occurring throughout the differentiation process, we performed population RNA sequencing from two individual hiPSC lines (nine time points, from undifferentiated stem cells until day 49 of induction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S5</xref>). Principal-component analysis (PCA) indicated that, overall, cells clustered along the two principal components according to the extent of time since dox induction, with one cluster comprising days 2–4 and a second cluster encompassing days 14–49. As demonstrated by the tight clustering of biological replicates, these findings were highly reproducible across runs of differentiation and cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistent with NGN2 programming generating predominately excitatory neurons, genes involved in glutamate receptor signaling increased in expression in the differentiated cells over time. This was particularly evident in the case of <italic>AMPAR</italic> subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">Inhibition of SMAD and WNT signaling is known to pattern cultured neurons toward a forebrain identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Maroof et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with previous findings, we failed to detect in the hpiNs expression of genes specific for other lineages, such as spinal motor neurons, hindbrain, MGE/inhibitory neurons, as well as hypothalamic, diencephalic, hippocampal, and dopaminergic markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">To further investigate the effect of small molecule patterning on the iNs, we compared the expression of pluripotency and neuronal progenitor genes by qPCR in day 4 cells that had been subjected to either no small molecule treatment, dual SMAD inhibition (the addition of SB431542 and LDN193189), or dual SMAD and WNT inhibition (the addition of SB431542, LDN193189, and XAV939) in conjunction with NGN2 overexpression. We found that combining dual SMAD and WNT inhibition with NGN2 induction significantly improved several aspects of differentiation relative to NGN2 expression alone. These included downregulation of the pluripotency gene <italic>OCT4</italic>, in addition to significant upregulation of genes expressed in forebrain progenitors, such as <italic>EMX1</italic>, <italic>OTX1</italic>, <italic>OTX2</italic>, <italic>FOXG1</italic>, and <italic>PAX6</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">We next compared the human BrainSpan dataset, where different human brain areas were transcriptionally profiled over a large developmental window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Brainspan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Miller et al., 2014</xref>), with our population RNA sequencing time course of hpiN differentiation. Pearson correlation between expression data from the brain samples and hpiNs revealed that most profiles of the <italic>in vitro</italic>-derived neurons correlated strongly with the prenatal cortex. Notably, at later stages of <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation, correlations with human postnatal and even adult stages began to emerge, most prominently in day 49 hpiNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Collectively, our initial findings suggest that NGN2 induction synergized well with dual SMAD and WNT inhibition to improve differentiation, resulting in a population of neurons expressing gene products commonly observed in excitatory neurons of the mouse and human cortices, but not factors selectively expressed in other notable brain regions. Furthermore, we found that hpiNs could differentiate sufficiently that at least some molecular features of the postnatal brain appeared to become present.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title>Single-Cell qRT-PCR of hpiN Differentiation</title>
<p id="P14">To better understand the heterogeneity of differentiating hpiNs, we next turned to single-cell methods for measuring gene expression. Initially, we designed a Fluidigm Biomark Chip for single-cell qRT-PCR with 96 gene-specific probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). Each human gene to be measured was selected by orthology with genes previously found to be expressed during discrete developmental epochs of mouse brain development or in select progenitor, glia, or post-mitotic cortical neuronal subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Miller et al., 2014</xref>). We rationalized that analyzing the combinatorial expression of these 96 genes in hpiNs would help us to identify the class-specific identity of each differentiating cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Arlotta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ip et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Saito et al., 2011</xref>). To this end, we performed single-cell sorting to harvest individual hpiNs into 96-well plates at several time points (days 0, 4, 14, and 21; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S5</xref>). The transcriptional signature of each cell was then determined using the 96 gene probes described above.</p>
<p id="P15">As an initial approach to characterizing the heterogeneity of gene expression among the cells analyzed, we performed PCA, and we found that the first principal component (PC1) accounted for approximately a third of the total variation (27%) in the dataset and could be best explained by the extent of cellular differentiation that had occurred in each cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). Less differentiated cells clustered together and separately from more differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). Subsequent hierarchical clustering of the population structure revealed four clusters that corresponded to three distinct differentiation states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1D</xref>). The first group of cells expressed genes uniquely active in hPSCs and was composed primarily of day 0 stem cells (n = 100 cells). The second group was composed of cells expressing gene products found in developing brain-progenitor populations, as well as lower abundances of transcripts expressed in many neuronal types. We found that this second cluster was mostly populated by day 4 cells, but also by a subset of cells at day 14 and day 21 of differentiation (n = 216 cells in total). The final group comprised more differentiated cells harvested at later time points (day 14 and day 21, n = 143 cells in total), and it contained a greater abundance of transcripts commonly found in differentiated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1C, and S1D</xref>). At day 21, the latest time point we initially analyzed, we found that 45% of hpiNs fell within the second cluster of apparent progenitors, while 55% of cells appeared to have become more differentiated neuronal cells (third cluster).</p>
<p id="P16">We next compared the expression of specific groups of genes between cells harvested at day 0 and day 21. Density plots showed a decrease of pluripotency and progenitor genes in day 21 hpiNs relative to day 0 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D and 1E</xref>). Conversely, pan-neuronal gene expression was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S3</xref>). In agreement with our population RNA sequencing data, transcripts expressed in mouse upper layer cortical projection neurons were increased in their abundance, while transcripts found in deep layer mouse cortical neurons were not enriched in day 21 hpiNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1F</xref>). Strikingly, <italic>DCX</italic>, <italic>MAP2</italic>, and <italic>NEUN</italic> expression significantly increased up through day 14, indicating that significant neuronal differentiation was already occurring between day 4 and day 14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F</xref>). Furthermore, hpiNs did not express significant levels of inhibitory neuron markers or glial markers at any time point during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D and 1E</xref>). These results were reproducible across an independent cell line (iPS2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2A and S2B</xref>; n = 660 cells). Finally, to validate the single-cell Fluidigm results at the protein level, we examined the expression of a subset of these gene products by immunostaining. We confirmed the expression of transcription factors expressed in upper layer cortical projection neurons of the mouse, such as CUX1, CUX2, and BRN2, but not markers expressed in the deep layers, such as CTIP2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1A and S1B</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested that the iNs were homogeneously patterned but were heterogenous with respect to the extent of their differentiation.</p>

<p id="P17">When we examined individual genes, we noted that a subset of progenitor markers remained expressed in day 21 hpiNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D, 1E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1F</xref>). Intrigued by the persistence of progenitor features as well as the emergence of mature features in the more differentiated neuronal population, we designed a second Fluidigm Biomark Chip (chip 2) with genes associated with cortical glutamatergic neurons, as well as neurochemical and synaptic markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). We then profiled single neurons differentiated for 14, 21, and 28 days (511 cells analyzed in total; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S5</xref>). PCA and hierarchical clustering of gene expression data confirmed that differentiation state was the main driver segregating the clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1F and 1G</xref>). In particular, cells segregated into two main clusters, which were classified as progenitor/early post-mitotic and differentiated based on the PC loadings. However, each cluster contained cells from each of the time points, suggesting that some progenitors did not transition toward a more differentiated state over time.</p>
<p id="P18">We next assessed the reproducibility of the hpiN differentiation scheme among three human iPSC lines (iPS1, iPS2, and iPS3) and one hECS line (ES1), as well as across biological replicates (n = 891 cells examined; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>), and we found highly similar patterning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2C and S2D</xref>). Furthermore, PCA indicated that, regardless of whether small molecule patterning was added to NGN2 programming or the length of time that dox induction was applied, a population of neuronal progenitors that seemed resistant to further differentiation remained present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2F–S2H</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">Using our Fluidigm datasets, we next performed differential gene expression analysis to identify candidate marker genes for the most molecularly differentiated neurons. The top differentially expressed genes between progenitors and more differentiated neurons were known pan-neuronal markers, such as <italic>MAP2</italic>, <italic>MAPT</italic>, and <italic>NEUN</italic>, or synaptic markers, including <italic>SYN1</italic>, <italic>DLG4</italic>, <italic>GPHN</italic>, and <italic>CAMK2A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). Upon closer examination, we found that <italic>GRIA1</italic>, <italic>GRIA4</italic>, <italic>NEUN</italic>, and <italic>CAMK2A</italic> expression appeared to be present in the differentiated cluster but nearly or completely absent in the progenitor cluster. Of these, NEUN is a commonly used neuronal marker, but, given that it is a nuclear protein, it did not meet our criteria as a marker with potential for isolation of differentiated neurons. After canvassing the literature for any known role in postnatal mouse brain and mature synaptic function for the candidates on our gene list, <italic>CAMK2A</italic> stood out because of its well-known expression at postnatal stages in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Lein et al., 2007</xref>). Camk2a-GFP mice have also been used to identify postnatal, post-mitotic glutamatergic neurons in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Lein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), as well as mature forebrain neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Shcheglovitov et al., 2013</xref>). Encouraged by these connections, we queried <italic>CAMK2A</italic> expression during human brain development in the BrainSpan dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Miller et al., 2014</xref>), and we found that its expression increased markedly after birth.</p>

<title>Single-Cell Molecular Analysis of CAMK2A-Expressing hpiNs</title>
<p id="P20">To investigate whether <italic>CAMK2A</italic> expression could serve as a useful marker for the more differentiated hpiNs, we transduced the cells with a lentivirus expressing GFP under the control of the <italic>CAMK2A</italic> promoter. We then assayed the expression of the Fluidigm chip 2 probe set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>) in day 28 hpiNs. Single cells were either sorted for <italic>CAMK2A::GFP</italic> expression (81 cells) or <italic>TetO-GFP</italic> (161 cells); the <italic>TetO-GFP</italic> cells were then computationally sorted for the expression of <italic>CAMK2A</italic> (242 cells analyzed in total; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S5</xref>). RNA sequencing at day 28 post-dox induction revealed that 52% of hpiNs expressed endogenous <italic>CAMK2A</italic> (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads [FPKM] &gt; 0), while 20%–30% of the counted cells expressed <italic>CAMK2A-GFP</italic>. Nearly all <italic>CAMK2A::GFP</italic>-sorted cells expressed endogenous <italic>CAMK2A</italic>, validating that the <italic>CAMK2A::GFP</italic> construct was accurately reporting on endogenous <italic>CAMK2A</italic> expression (92%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D</xref>). When we compared the molecular profile of these three categories of cells, PCA and differential gene expression analysis showed that the <italic>CAMK2A</italic>+ cells expressed higher levels of pan-neuronal and synaptic genes compared to the <italic>CAMK2A</italic>− cells. This was true both for cells sorted computationally based on their endogenous expression of <italic>CAMK2A</italic> (<italic>CAMK2A</italic>+) and cells isolated by flow cytometry using the <italic>CAMK2A::GFP</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B and 2C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P21">We next carried out single-cell RNA sequencing on the same populations following the Smart-seq2 protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Picelli et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">2014</xref>). Because of the implication of NMDAR in various disorders of the nervous system, we examined the expression of NMDAR subunits <italic>GRIN2A</italic> and <italic>GRIN2B</italic>, as well as the AMPAR subunits <italic>GRIA1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, and <italic>4</italic> in the iNs by single-cell qPCR (n = 242 cells) as well as single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (n = 93 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2D–2F</xref>). We found that <italic>GRIN2B</italic> was robustly expressed in most <italic>CAMK2A</italic>+ cells at day 28 (83% of the cells, with an FPKM &gt; 1). Conversely, <italic>GRIN2A</italic> was expressed in most cells at relatively low levels (95% of cells, with an FPKM &gt; 0), and it was expressed in only a subset of the cells at higher levels (22% of the cells, with an FPKM &gt; 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2D and 2E</xref>). We then compared these expression profiles to their developmental expression in the human cerebral cortex (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brainspan.org">http://www.brainspan.org</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Miller et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>), we found that <italic>GRIN2B</italic> expression was detected in the human cerebral cortex in prenatal stages, with some persisting expression into the postnatal stages. <italic>GRIN2A</italic>, on the other hand, was detected almost exclusively in postnatal stages.</p>
<p id="P22">Moreover, by comparing hpiNs with hpiNs produced without dual SMAD and WNT inhibition, we found that, in both hiPSC lines examined, the expression of the NMDAR subunit <italic>GRIN2B</italic> was significantly higher in neurons generated in the presence of patterning small molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2I</xref>). This suggests that patterning combined with NGN2 induction can synergize to promote expression of NMDAR subunits.</p>
<p id="P23">To gain a deeper understanding of how similar hpiNs are to <italic>in vivo</italic> cell types, we then compared their expression profiles to a publicly available dataset of single-cell RNA-seq of the developing cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Pollen et al., 2014</xref>). We found that, while unsorted hpiNs contributed to both neuronal and non-neuronal clusters (such as neural progenitor cells [NPCs]), <italic>CAMK2A</italic>+ hpiNs most closely resembled neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A and 3B</xref>). Next, we compared hpiN transcriptional profiles to a second reference dataset, which included RNA-seq of several cell types isolated from adults, in addition to embryonic cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Darmanis et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with our previous results, we found that unsorted hpiNs clustered closely with neurons and other cell types present in the brain. However, <italic>CAMK2A</italic>+ hpiNs clustered with both fetal and adult neurons in the reference dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3C and 3D</xref>). These analyses validated the utility of the <italic>CAMK2A::GFP</italic> reporter in demarcating the neuronal population, and the identification of more differentiated neurons.</p>

<title>Network Activity of hpiNs as a Function of Neuronal Differentiation</title>
<p id="P24">We next set out to comprehensively investigate the functional properties of hpiNs. We first used multielectrode arrays (MEAs) to monitor differentiation of stem cells into functional neurons at a population level and over time. To this end, we seeded hPSCs on 8 × 8 MEA grids, each with 64 microelectrodes, in the absence and presence of mouse glia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S5</xref>). The example raster plots, which provide a graphical representation of extracellular action potential trains, showed sparse spiking as early as day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The spike rate then continued to increase throughout the 42-day recording period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). Notably, co-culturing hpiNs with glia led to significantly higher spiking rates (day 10 onward; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A, 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A, and S4B</xref>) and the development of pronounced MEA-wide/global bursts that were indicative of neuronal connectivity, between days 14 and 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Overall, we found that half of the electrodes were functional by 12.5 when cultured with hpiNs and glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4D</xref>). Two additional cell lines (iPS2 and ES1) characterized in this study both matured at a comparable rate, illustrating the reproducibility of activity achieved with this method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4C and S4D</xref>).</p>

<sec id="S9">
<title>A Physiologically Functional Synaptic Network</title>
<p id="P25">Previous studies have suggested that much of the activity found in neurons produced with NGN2 expression is mediated through AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this notion, we observed that application of the AMPAR competitive antagonist NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione) attenuated spontaneous spiking rates and blocked the occurrence of network-wide bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4E</xref>) compared to the vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4E, and S4F</xref>). A complete blockade of the residual activity by tetrodotoxin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4H and S4I</xref>), a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker, confirmed that these spikes were extracellular action potentials dependent on the activity of sodium-gated calcium channels. The AMPAR-independent spikes were likely to be occurring due to spontaneous activity in a few residual neurons.</p>
<p id="P26">We next wondered whether network effects could also be NMDAR mediated. Indeed, application of the NMDAR-selective competitive antagonist D-AP5 significantly reduced spike rate and reduced the occurrence of network-wide bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4E, 4I</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4Eiv</xref>). Reduction of the spike rate by an NMDA antagonist is direct evidence for surface expression of functional NMDARs in the hpiNs and their contribution to the generation of spontaneous neuronal activity. Notably, while NMDAR antagonism reduced the spike rate and burst activity of the neurons, it had no significant effect on the number of spikes within the network bursts (data not shown). In contrast, application of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist picrotoxin did not significantly affect firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4Eii</xref>) or the occurrence of network-wide bursts. Thus, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated synaptic transmission did not contribute significantly to the synaptic transmission in the iNs. Taken together, these results confirmed our conclusions from transcriptional profiling, and they demonstrated that both AMPARs and NMDARs mediate excitatory synaptic transmission in hpiNs.</p>

<title>CAMK2A Expression Demarcates hpiNs with More Mature Electrophysiological Properties</title>
<p id="P27">To investigate whether the <italic>CAMK2A</italic> reporter gene could be used to identify more differentiated cells with additional functionalities, we subjected cells with or without expression of <italic>CAMK2A::GFP</italic> to whole-cell patch clamp at different time points (days 14, 21, and 28; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S5</xref>). Indeed, electrophysiological characterization of <italic>GFP</italic>+ neurons showed more mature membrane properties as compared to neighboring <italic>GFP</italic>− cells. <italic>GFP</italic>+ neurons showed significantly more negative resting membrane potential (RMP), compared to <italic>GFP</italic>− cells, and also significantly larger membrane capacitance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A, and S5B</xref>). We next quantified action potential (AP) firing properties by giving step current injection in current-clamp mode to elicit APs. We found that <italic>GFP</italic>+ cells at day 21 post-differentiation showed significantly more hyperpolarized AP threshold and a trend toward increased average spike numbers per pulse, suggesting more mature AP-firing properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5C</xref>). No significant changes were observed in the AP peak amplitude and AP half-width, most likely due to the intrinsic variability of the two AP parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5D</xref>). <italic>CAMK2A</italic>+ neurons reached a steady level of maturation at day 28 when APs exhibited mature and homogeneous firing patterns.</p>
<p id="P28">We further compared voltage-gated sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>v) channel and potassium (K<sup>+</sup>v) channel currents between <italic>GFP</italic>+ cells and <italic>GFP</italic>− cells. Consistent with the more mature AP-firing properties, <italic>CAMK2A</italic>+ cells showed larger voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> currents than those in <italic>GFP</italic>− cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>Membrane Properties and Synaptic Transmission in hpiNs</title>
<p id="P29">We next performed whole-cell patch-clamp recording at days 14, 21, 28, and 35. The resting membrane potential of <italic>GFP</italic>+ neurons became increasingly negative over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5E</xref>), reaching statistical significance between days 21 and 28. Moreover, when neurons were subjected to 10-mV step depolarization, we detected large peaks of the fast inward Na<sup>+</sup> current (confirmed by Na<sup>+</sup>v blocker 1 μM tetrodotoxin [TTX]), followed by long-lasting outward K+ currents (confirmed by K<sup>+</sup>v blocker 10 μM tetraethylammonium chloride [TEA]) at day 28. We further quantified AP-firing properties by giving step current injection of 20 pA in current-clamp mode to elicit APs. At the first 3 weeks after differentiation, neurons were not able to produce multiple APs in response to a prolonged depolarizing current step (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5F</xref>). However, by day 28 nearly 75% of the cells recorded were capable of producing multiple APs or AP trains. Analysis of AP-firing properties consistently showed time-dependent maturation, comparable to the temporal expression of Na<sup>+</sup>v and K<sup>+</sup>v (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5G</xref>). Thus, the hpiNs exhibited a steady ongoing process of membrane electrical property maturation, in which a pronounced shift in a range of electrophysiological parameters occurred between day 21 and day 28 post-differentiation. A reproducible electrical maturation pattern was observed across hPSC lines and across biological replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S4</xref>). Overall, the parameters of AP quantification along with RMP of hpiNs at day 28 to day 35 post-differentiation were comparable to rodent cortical neurons at an early postnatal development stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Spitzer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Oswald and Reyes, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Functionality of AMPAR and NMDAR in hpiNs</title>
<p id="P30">We next asked whether the synaptic properties of hpiNs reflected the complement of synaptic components whose transcription we had detected by RNA-seq. We investigated basal synaptic transmission; AMPAR mediated spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) that were AP dependent, and AMPAR mediated miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in the presence of TTX to block APs. Approximately 5% of cells displayed sEPSCs at day 14. We detected a dramatic increase in the percentage of cells showing sEPSCs (85%) at day 28, suggesting that the synaptic transmission level peaked between day 14 and day 28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Concordantly, the frequency and amplitude of sEPSCs were higher at day 28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5G and 5H</xref>). These spontaneous synaptic activities were blocked by AMPAR antagonist NBQX, as well as by TTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5D and 5E</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S13">
<title>NMDA Receptor-Mediated Currents in CAMK2A+ hpiNs</title>
<p id="P31">We next went on to perform pharmacological characterization of NMDA receptor-mediated currents in <italic>CAMK2A::GFP+</italic> neurons at days 14, 21, 28, and 35. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>, the evoked EPSCs were blocked by NBQX at both −70- and +40-mV holding potentials. This suggests that the synaptically evoked EPSCs are mainly contributed by the activation of AMPAR type, but not NMDA-type glutamate receptors, at day 28. However, when we implemented fast, exogenous application of 100 μM NMDA to the hpiNs by pressure injection with a Picospritzer, we found that approximately 20% of the cells recorded displayed NMDAR-mediated currents at day 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5J</xref>). NMDA receptors are found in both synaptic and extra-synaptic locations on neurons, and the best-characterized extra-synaptic NMDA receptors include GRIN1 and GRIN2B subunits. The saturating concentration of NMDA-induced current responses was largely blocked by 10 μM CP101, 606, a GRIN2B subunit-selective NMDA receptor antagonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5J</xref>). We again observed a large shift in electrophysiological properties between day 21 and day 28 neurons: about 70% of cells exhibited NMDAR-mediated current upon NMDA application at day 28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5K</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5L</xref>, the current density of NMDAR-mediated current was significantly enhanced as compared to day 21, suggesting that more functional GRIN2B-containing NMDARs were expressed in day 21 neurons (in agreement with the high expression level of <italic>GRIN2B</italic> at day 21 and day 28, with a subset of cells displaying <italic>GRIN2A</italic> expression at day 28; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Strikingly, these results suggest that <italic>CAMK2A</italic> expression can be used as a tool to isolate a more mature subset of hpiNs capable of NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission. Furthermore, our findings suggest that, while a subset of <italic>CAMK2A</italic>− progenitor cells may not further differentiate, the physiological properties of <italic>CAMK2A</italic>+ cells do continue to mature for some time.</p>

<title>Expression of Disease-Associated Synaptic Genes</title>
<p id="P32">Large-scale sequencing studies have shown that mutations in genes whose products function in excitatory synapses are enriched in patients with neurodevelopmental diseases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). For example, as evidenced by exome sequencing studies, mutations in NMDARs are enriched in patients with forms of epileptic encephalopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Epi, 2015</xref>). Similarly, a broader set of synaptic genes has been proposed to play a role in autism, again through exome sequencing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Sanders et al., 2015</xref>). Association studies have also implicated some of these factors in aspects of schizophrenia and intellectual disability (ID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014</xref>). To explore the potential of our hpiN-profiling dataset as a resource for disease-modeling studies, we determined the expression of disease-associated genes by total population RNA-seq and in single sorted day 28 CAMK2A-expressing hpiNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6B and 6C</xref>). We found that many disease-relevant genes were expressed in the hpiNs and that the expression of numerous genes (including AMPAR subunits <italic>GRIA1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, and <italic>3</italic> and NMDAR subunits <italic>GRIN1</italic> and <italic>GRIN2B</italic>) increased over differentiation time.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P33">We describe here a rapid and reproducible differentiation scheme that combines aspects of NGN2 programming in hPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) with developmental patterning through the inhibition of SMAD and WNT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Maroof et al., 2013</xref>). This approach generated a homogenously patterned population of cells differentiating toward a cortical excitatory identity. Their properties included robust expression of <italic>AMPARs</italic> and <italic>NMDARs</italic>, as well as mature synaptic function. We also provide an extensive minable dataset comprising single-cell and total population RNA-seq libraries. This comprehensive resource can be used to determine whether specific genes/disorders can be studied in hpiNs and which time point(s) would be most suitable for such studies.</p>
<p id="P34">We find that hpiNs express many of the genes associated with an upper layer cortical projection neuron identity in mouse and human brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Lake et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>). Comparing our population and single-cell transcriptomes with stages of human brain development, we find that the hpiN population overall is the most strongly correlated with the prenatal brain, with emerging postnatal and adult features in the <italic>CAMK2A</italic>-expressing hpiNs. These characteristics make hpiNs an attractive model system for modeling aspects of disorders such as autism or schizophrenia, where layer 3 pyramidal neurons in patients show reduced spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Lewis et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with previous reports that glial cells promote neuronal maturation and synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Pfrieger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Eroglu and Barres, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Tang et al., 2013</xref>), we found that co-culturing the stem cell-derived neurons with mouse glia resulted in an increase in firing, as well as in synchronous activity that was reminiscent of bursting activity. This increased activity coincided with an increase in expression of genes that are involved in neuronal activity and synaptic connectivity.</p>
<p id="P35">Heterogeneity of stem cell-derived cell types plagues most if not all differentiation or programming approaches reported to date, and it is a major impediment in their use for disease-related studies. Single-cell RNA-seq technologies are now providing important insight into the extent of this heterogeneity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Yao et al. (2017)</xref> performed clonal analysis in differentiating hESCs to map a lineage tree of <italic>in vitro</italic> brain development. Comparing clustered single-cell transcriptomes with mouse and human gene expression data, they found that a wide-ranging set of progenitor cells, as well as midbrain/hindbrain and cortical subtypes, was present in such cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). For direct reprogramming using the pioneer factor ASCL1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Treutlein et al., (2016)</xref> found that transgene silencing prevented a subset of fibroblasts from becoming reprogrammed and that a second population of fibroblasts unexpectedly activated a myocyte-like transcriptional program. These findings illustrate the strength of single-cell technologies to provide insight into the molecular heterogeneity of stem cell-derived populations, as well as the challenges associated with harnessing their translational utility.</p>
<p id="P36">We found that, although the hpiNs were homogeneously patterned, indicative of a similar neuronal identity, they were heterogeneous with respect to their extent of differentiation. Notably, we detected the expression of progenitor genes prior to neuronal genes, suggesting the presence of a progenitor population. We found that progenitor cells persisted at later time points, indicating that extending time in culture may be of limited use for eliminating them. The reason behind this heterogeneity is unclear but could be due to differences in NGN2 expression between cells. By designing a single-cell profiling approach aimed to resolve progenitor-like cells from more differentiated hpiNs, we were able to resolve much of this heterogeneity. We further identified <italic>CAMK2A</italic> expression as a marker for the more differentiated hpiNs, which we also found had more functional synaptic properties. This approach could be generalizable to resolve progenitor subsets from more differentiated derivatives with superior functional properties in other differentiation or direct reprogramming protocols. Most importantly, our molecular and functional analyses revealed robust expression of NMDAR subunits and NMDAR-mediated synaptic properties in day 28 hpiNs. NMDAR subunits have been implicated in many neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders through exome sequencing and association studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Epi, 2015</xref>). Being able to rapidly generate homogeneous populations of cortical neurons that robustly express these receptors will greatly facilitate the study of brain disorders.</p>

Day 3, N2 media, day 4, neurobasal media (Gibco) supplemented with B27 (50×, Gibco), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CTNF), and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (R&amp;D Systems 248-BD/CF, 257-NT/CF, and 212-GD/CF at 10 ng/mL). When co-cultured with glia, day 4 cells were dissociated with accutase and plated at a density of 40,000/cm<sup>2</sup> with mouse primary cortical glial cells (seeded at 70,000/cm<sup>2</sup> glia) on geltrex-coated plates. Primary glial preparations from post-natal day (P)0–P2 mouse pups were obtained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Di Giorgio et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Single-Cell Expression Profiling and Transcriptomics</title>
<p id="P38">Cells were dissociated using accutase supplemented with DNase (Worthington Biochemical, LK003170). A 100-μm nozzle was used for sorting. Cells were sorted by BD Facs Aria, 20 psi, 40–100 ev/s into 96-well plates (one cell per well) containing 5 μL lysis buffer. For Fluidigm Biomark, cells were single-cell sorted into 5 μL of 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM EDTA supplemented with SUPERase•In (0.1 U/μL final, Ambion, AM2696), and 0.5% NP40 (Thermo Scientific, PI-28324). For Smart-seq2 library prep, cells were single-cell sorted into 5 μL 1×TCL buffer (QIAGEN, 1031576). After sorting, plates were immediately sealed, spun down for 5 min at 550 × <italic>g</italic>, and flash frozen on dry ice. Sorted cells were then stored at −80°C.

<title>hpiNs Form Active Networks that Are Glutamate Receptor Dependent</title>
<p>Neuronal activity was routinely sampled on MEA plates for 42 days.</p>
<p>(A) Representative raster plots of spontaneous activity. Neurons were cultured in isolation (top, green) or with glia co-culture (bottom, orange). Top right insets (green background) show spikes detected on 16 electrodes with an expanded 1-s time base (the exploded region is both highlighted in and marked by a green arrowhead above the main figure).</p>
<p>(B–E) Network activity of hpiNs. (B) Spike count (mean number of spikes in a 10-s period). The activity of neurons derived in isolation (n = 15 cultures from 3 differentiations) is compared to those co-cultured with glia (n = 74 cultures from 6 differentiations). (C) Proportion of electrodes detecting spontaneous activity, against the number of days post-induction. For neurons cultured with glia, the data were well fit by a sigmoid function. (D) Summary of the A50 from the sigmoid curve fits. The neurons cultured in the absence of glia have not been curve fit. (E) Number of burst parameters across conditions; time, time base control group that did not receive vehicle or drug (n = 12 cultures from one differentiation).</p>
<p>(F–I) Contribution of ionotropic glutamate and GABA receptors to spontaneous activity (at day 42) for neurons cultured with glia. Electrode mean spike count (/10 s) recorded over 10 min is shown. The solid bar above the plots highlights the addition of vehicle (F, dd.H20, n = 16 cultures from 3 differentiations) or drug (G, picrotoxin, n = 7 cultures from 2 differentiations; H, NBQX, n = 7 cultures from 2 differentiations; I, AP5, n = 13 cultures from 3 differentiations). (F–Ii) Top significant p values are shown (p values &gt; 0.05 are in white, gray indicates that no statistical comparisons have been made). (F–Iii) Mean electrode spike counts per electrode recorded during the baseline control period (fourth minute) are plotted against the spike count recorded during the test period (ninth minute). The diagonal line of equality is plotted in black, and the orange filled circle (and bars) marks the median (and Q1–Q3). Plots are split into 4 quadrants; for paired spike counts ≤100 (gray data), the ordinate and abscissa are both plot on a linear scale, and when paired spike counts are both above 100 they are plot on log-log scale (yellow data). Otherwise data are plot on a mixed linear-log/log-linear scale (red and green, respectively). (F–Iiii) Effect of vehicle/antagonist application on the number of global bursts is shown. Bursts are analyzed for 2 min at the end of the baseline period and for 2 min after drug/vehicle application. Raw data are plotted in gray; *p value ≤ 0.05; ns, not significant.</p>
