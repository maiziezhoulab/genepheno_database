<title>Background &amp; Aims</title>
<p id="P1">This study compared gesture rate and purpose in participants with
Down syndrome (DS) and fragile X syndrome (FXS), and the impact of autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms on each syndrome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Methods</title>
<p id="P2">Twenty individuals with fragile X syndrome and 20 individuals with
Down syndrome between nine and 22 years of age participated in this study.
We coded gesture rate and purpose from an autism spectrum disorder
evaluation, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule – Second
Edition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Results</title>
<p id="P3">We did not find between-group differences (Down syndrome compared to
fragile X syndrome) in gesture rate or purpose. Notably, as autism spectrum
disorder symptoms increased, the group with Down syndrome produced a lower
rate of gestures, but used gestures for the same purpose. Gesture rate did
not change based on autism spectrum disorder symptoms in the participants
with fragile X syndrome, but as autism spectrum disorder symptoms increased,
the participants with fragile X syndrome produced a larger proportion of
gestures to regulate behavior and a smaller proportion for joint
attention/social interaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="P4">Overall, the amount or purpose of gestures did not differentiate
individuals with Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome. However, the presence
of autism spectrum disorder symptoms had a significant and unique impact on
these genetic disorders. In individuals with Down syndrome, the presence of
more autism spectrum disorder symptoms resulted in a reduction in the rate
of gesturing, but did not change the purpose. However, in fragile X
syndrome, the rate of gestures remained the same, but the purpose of those
gestures changed based on autism spectrum disorder symptoms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Implications</title>
<p id="P5">Autism spectrum disorder symptoms differentially impact gestures in
Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Individuals with Down syndrome and
more autism spectrum disorder symptoms are using gestures less frequently.
Therefore, clinicians may need to consider children with Down syndrome
demonstrating symptoms of autism spectrum disorder as distinctly different
from children with Down syndrome and few to no symptoms of autism spectrum
disorder when implementing interventions or therapy techniques. Severity of
autism spectrum disorder symptoms in fragile X syndrome affects qualitative
gesture use and motivation to communicate through social gestures, which may
be an appropriate goal to target in children with fragile X syndrome and
heightened autism spectrum disorder symptoms.</p>
