<abstract>
<p>Prader–Willi and Angelman syndromes are often referred to as a sister pair of
neurodevelopmental disorders, resulting from different genetic and epigenetic
alterations to the same chromosomal region, 15q11-q13. Some of the primary
phenotypes of the two syndromes have been suggested to be opposite to one
another, but this hypothesis has yet to be tested comprehensively, and it
remains unclear how opposite effects could be produced by changes to different
genes in one syndrome compared to the other. We evaluated the evidence for
opposite effects on sleep and eating phenotypes in Prader–Willi syndrome and
Angelman syndrome, and developed physiological–genetic models that represent
hypothesized causes of these differences. Sleep latency shows opposite
deviations from controls in Prader–Willi and Angelman syndromes, with shorter
latency in Prader–Willi syndrome by meta-analysis and longer latency in Angelman
syndrome from previous studies. These differences can be accounted for by the
effects of variable gene dosages of UBE3A and MAGEL2, interacting with clock
genes, and leading to acceleration (in Prader–Willi syndrome) or deceleration
(in Angelman syndrome) of circadian rhythms. Prader–Willi and Angelman syndromes
also show evidence of opposite alterations in hyperphagic food selectivity, with
more paternally biased subtypes of Angelman syndrome apparently involving
increased preference for complementary foods (“baby foods”); hedonic reward from
eating may also be increased in Angelman syndrome and decreased in Prader–Willi
syndrome. These differences can be explained in part under a model whereby
hyperphagia and food selectivity are mediated by the effects of the genes
SNORD-116, UBE3A and MAGEL2, with outcomes depending upon the genotypic cause of
Angelman syndrome. The diametric variation observed in sleep and eating
phenotypes in Prader–Willi and Angelman syndromes is consistent with predictions
from the kinship theory of imprinting, reflecting extremes of higher resource
demand in Angelman syndrome and lower demand in Prader–Willi syndrome, with a
special emphasis on social–attentional demands and attachment associated with
bedtime, and feeding demands associated with mother-provided complementary foods
compared to offspring-foraged family-type foods.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are often referred to as a
sister pair of genetic disorders, both resulting in cognitive and neurological
impairments, along with unique physiological and behavioral phenotypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2050312118823585">1</xref></sup> Similarly, both AS and PWS show some degree of comorbidity with autism
spectrum disorders (ASDs) as compared to the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2050312118823585">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2050312118823585"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2050312118823585"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2050312118823585">5</xref></sup> However, expression levels of
several traits related to early childhood development, such as birth weight,
interest toward suckling and somnolence have been suggested to be opposite between
the syndromes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2050312118823585">6</xref></sup> The behavioral phenotypes of the syndromes have also been noted to contrast
each other, as individuals with AS typically show a sociable disposition, with
constant smiling and laughter, while individual PWS tends to show considerable
negative affect, with frequent temper tantrums and obsessive–compulsive
behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2050312118823585">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2050312118823585">7</xref></sup>
While both syndromes are due to multiple types of different mutations in the
15q11-q13 chromosome region, the specific nature of each mutation is critical to the
epigenetic alterations involved in each syndrome as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2050312118823585">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2050312118823585">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2050312118823585">Table 1</xref>. AS is due to the absence of the
maternal copy of the 15q11-q13 chromosome region (the UBE3A gene in particular),
while PWS is due to the absence of the paternal copy of the same chromosome region.
The resulting genetic and epigenetic alterations lead to losses of expression for
separate sets of genes in each syndrome, which presents an apparent paradox. Are the
phenotypes of these syndromes truly opposite of each other and, if so, what
underlying factors could explain the opposite nature of the phenotypes despite the
different nature of the genetic alterations involved in each syndrome?</p>

<p>A schematic of the relevant genes in the 15q11-q13 chromosome region. The
paternally expressed genes involved in PWS are marked in blue, while the
maternally expressed genes involved in AS are marked in red. Genes marked in
gray are silenced by an imprinting mechanism, while the genes in green are
expressed from both parental copies. The arrow in blue shows the region
specific to a long, non-coding antisense transcript that contains a sequence
complimentary to UBE3A (UBE3A-ATS). This transcript is transcribed only from
the paternal allele and thought to regulate the silencing of the paternal
copy of UBE3A in neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2050312118823585">8</xref></sup></p>

<p>Illustration of the different genotypes involved in PWS and AS. In typical
development, paternally imprinted genes are expressed only from the
maternally derived chromosome and vice versa. In PWS and AS, de novo
mutations lead to a lack of expression for paternally or maternally
expressed genes in the 15q11q-q13 chromosome region. However, the dosage of
paternally and maternally expressed genes in the chromosome region varies
depending on the genotype as shown above.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Both PWS and AS involve a number of imprinted genes, which are expressed in a manner
dependent on their parental origin. According to the kinship theory, genomic
imprinting may evolve from intragenomic conflict when genes of different kin benefit
from different phenotypes of the same trait.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2050312118823585">11</xref></sup> In particular, genes that may increase the inclusive fitness of the mother by
exerting effects that lead to more equal distribution of resources among offspring
are expected to be expressed only when maternally inherited. In contrast, maternally
imprinted (paternally expressed) genes are expected to exert effects that lead to
increased demands imposed on the mother, increasing the fitness of the child’s
paternal genes. Consequently, the phenotype of PWS has been argued to reflect
extreme, pathological development of phenotypes associated with fitness benefits to
the mother.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2050312118823585">4</xref></sup> Thus, as children with PWS fail to express paternally derived genes, the
resulting phenotype displays low birth weight, sleepiness and low activity, poor
sucking ability and a failure to thrive,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2050312118823585">7</xref></sup> followed by gradual development of a voracious appetite, which coincides with
the timing of early adrenarche, around the age of 8–9 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2050312118823585">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2050312118823585">13</xref></sup> As maternally
and paternally derived genes tend to disagree over the allocation of maternal
resources, it has been further argued that sucking presents a cost to the mother’s
inclusive fitness through nutritional value and conversely the transition to family
and self-foraged foods after weaning presents comparably reduced maternal costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2050312118823585">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to PWS, subjects with AS fail to express maternally derived genes and
show comparatively high birth weight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2050312118823585">14</xref></sup> and have been argued to sleep less than their peers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2050312118823585">15</xref></sup> In the context of the kinship theory and parent–offspring conflict, the
behavioral phenotype of AS has been argued to reflect an extreme pathological
development of phenotypes related to affect signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2050312118823585">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2050312118823585">17</xref></sup> Smiling and laughter are
hypothesized as signals of positive affection, which have fitness benefits to the
child, sending the signal, and fitness costs to the mother, receiving the signal and
providing increased parental attention.</p>
<p>Based on the lines of evidence and theory described above, core phenotypes of PWS and
AS have been considered to result from disruptions of genetic conflict, where the
disappearance of one side of opposing developmental influences leads to an extreme
response disadvantageous to both the mother’s and the child’s inclusive fitness.
However, the opposite nature of the phenotypes of these two syndromes has never been
evaluated in any detail.</p>
<p>In this article, we focus on reviewing two aspects of the behavioral phenotypes of
PWS and AS, sleeping and eating behavior.</p>
<p>First, we provide relevant background on the genetic and epigenetic causes of PWS and
AS, focusing on the different dosages of paternally and maternally expressed genes
in each syndrome. Second, we use currently available research to determine the
degree to which the observed phenotypes of sleep and eating behavior in PWS and AS
are opposite to one another and in what respects. Third, we review current research
on mouse models of PWS and AS to assess the roles of imprinted genes in sleep and
behavior in the two syndromes and to develop genetic and physiological hypotheses to
explain how the different genetic alterations in the two syndromes could produce the
observed phenotypes. Finally, we evaluate whether the phenotypic patterns observed
in PWS compared to AS, and our hypotheses, are consistent with the kinship theory of
genomic imprinting.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Comprehensive searches of the literature were conducted for each aspect of the
review, with both review and research articles utilized. The search was conducted
with the Web of Science database using both term- and reference-based search
strategies. Search terms included Prader-Willi and Angelman, coupled with relevant
terms including gene names and general terms related to traits and characteristics
including obesity, hyperphagia, sleep, sleep pressure, duration, latency, REM,
apnea, daytime sleepiness, somnolence, circadian, melatonin, food-related behavior,
food preferences, food refusal, eating, feeding, homeostatic feeding hedonic
feeding, serotonin and dopamine.</p>

<title>Literature search for meta-analysis of sleep latency and duration in
PWS</title>
<p>We searched both PubMed and Web of Science databases for peer-reviewed scientific
articles up to May 2018. Search terms were “Sleep AND Prader-Willi,” which
brought up 208 articles at PubMed and 371 articles at Web of Science, which were
all screened manually. The search was further supplemented by manual searching
strategies such as articles cited in the literature relevant to PWS. Studies
were included in the meta-analysis based on the following criteria: (1) the
study included a measurement of sleep onset latency or sleep duration on PWS
individuals and a comparison to a control group of typically developing
individuals; (2) sufficient data were available for estimating mean and standard
deviation of the relevant sleep parameters. The application of these criteria
yielded a total of eight studies for sleep onset latency as well as seven
studies for sleep duration. The selection process is detailed in full with a

maternally imprinted genes as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2050312118823585">Figure 1</xref>. AS has been shown to be caused
by a lack of expression for the maternally derived copy of
<italic>UBE3A</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2050312118823585">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2050312118823585">20</xref></sup> More specifically, the
paternal copy of <italic>UBE3A</italic> is uniquely silenced in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2050312118823585">21</xref></sup> and so deletions or epigenetic alterations affecting the maternal copy of
the gene lead to a complete lack of <italic>UBE3A</italic> expression in
neurons. By contrast, no single mutation of a gene has been shown to display the
full phenotype of PWS, although lack of expression for the
<italic>SNORD116</italic> snoRNA has been shown to produce several central
aspects of the phenotype of PWS, indicating an important role in the development
of the disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2050312118823585">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>As both PWS and AS are ultimately due to de novo mutations of the same chromosome
region, it follows that deletions involve a loss of one parental copy of the
15q11-q13 region, while in uniparental disomy both chromosomes are derived from
the same parent. The imprinting mechanisms involved in both PWS and AS are
further controlled by the imprinting center of the 15q11-q13 chromosome region,
which is defined by the shortest mutations known to produce the full phenotype
of each syndrome. The paternal copy of the imprinting center is transcribed as a
part of a long, non-coding antisense transcript, which spans across the
imprinting center and the SNURF-SNRPN gene to the end of the opposite strand of
<italic>UBE3A</italic> and is thought to regulate the silencing of the
paternal copy of <italic>UBE3A</italic> in neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2050312118823585">8</xref></sup> In contrast, the maternal copy of the imprinting center is typically
methylated, preventing the expression of the antisense transcript.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2050312118823585">23</xref></sup> Thus, imprinting defects result from either microdeletions which span the
shortest region of overlap for each syndrome or varied epigenetic causes. These
genotypes demonstrate either a fully paternal or a fully maternal methylation
pattern despite the presence of both parental alleles, as is also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2050312118823585">Figure 2</xref>.</p>
<p>The different mechanisms behind the genotypes of the two syndromes lead to the
corresponding differences in dosage for the imprinted genes involved, as also
shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2050312118823585">Figure 2</xref> and
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2050312118823585">Table 1</xref>.
Maternal uniparental disomy (matUPD) in PWS involves two maternally expressed
copies of <italic>UBE3A</italic> and <italic>ATP10A</italic>, and conversely the
genotype of paternal uniparental disomy (patUPD) in AS involves two copies of
the paternally expressed genes in the locus. Deletions involve additional losses
of non-imprinted genes which may result in haploinsufficiency for a varying
number of genes depending on the size of the deletion (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2050312118823585">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Sleep phenotypes and the regulation of circadian rhythms</title>
<p>Sleep phenotypes are notably altered in both AS and PWS and have been well
studied in both.</p>
<p>By way of background, the sleep–wake cycle is regulated by two major
processes: first, homeostatic sleep pressure which is defined as the gradual
accumulation of sleep factors (i.e. peptides, hormones and
neurotransmitters) promoting sleep in the brain, which slowly inhibit the
function of wake-promoting neural pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2050312118823585">24</xref></sup> Second, circadian rhythms can be viewed as a network between the
internal time-keeping mechanisms based on the self-maintaining feedback loop
of the core time-keeping genes <italic>Per, Cry, CLOCK</italic> and
<italic>BMAL1</italic> and their target genes, which in turn mediate
circadian timing in physiological processes such as sleep, feeding and
energy balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2050312118823585">25</xref></sup> In vertebrates, circadian rhythms form a hierarchical network between
the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and a number of peripheral circadian
clocks in different tissues and cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2050312118823585">26</xref></sup> The secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland is controlled by a
projection from the SCN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2050312118823585">27</xref></sup> However, the circadian integration of sleep, activity and feeding
further depends on a reciprocal connection between the SCN and the arcuate
nucleus (ARC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2050312118823585">28</xref></sup> Recent work has also revealed that there may be a higher than
expected number of imprinted genes expressed in the hypothalamus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2050312118823585">29</xref></sup> Given the crucial role of the hypothalamus in the regulation of
sleep, it can be seen that imprinted genes similarly influence the
regulation of sleep via the hypothalamus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2050312118823585">30</xref></sup> Similarly, a number of these imprinted genes are also central to the
genotypes of the PWS and AS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2050312118823585">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2050312118823585">16</xref></sup> influencing the
specific sleep phenotypes typical to each syndrome.</p>
<p>The quality of sleep has been traditionally measured with subjective
observations, but a more precise study of the sleep phenotype and structure
can be conducted with a combination of electrophysiological recordings (i.e.
polysomnography). While research on sleep relies on the simultaneous
measurement of electrical brain activity (i.e. electroencephalography (EEG))
and physiological parameters such as heart rate and respiration, these are
only used as biomarkers for the underlying neural and physiological states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2050312118823585">31</xref></sup> The aforementioned states of sleep can be broadly divided into rapid
eye movement (REM) sleep, defined by a high degree of brain activity and its
counterpart, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, conversely defined by
a lack of such activity. NREM sleep is maintained by the neural circuitry
controlling homeostatic sleep pressure, while REM sleep is promoted by the
subdorsolateral nucleus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2050312118823585">24</xref></sup> Together, the two opposing processes produce the typical cycle of
NREM and REM sleep states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2050312118823585">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>A range of qualitative and quantitative sleep phenotypes are altered in both
PWS and AS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2050312118823585">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2050312118823585">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2050312118823585"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2050312118823585">34</xref></sup> In this section, we describe research on sleep
phenotypes that have been studied in both AS and PWS, to address whether or
not they exhibit opposite or similar features, and how these features are
associated with the genetic and epigenetic alterations that underlie the two
syndromes. In particular, we will discuss six main sleep phenotypes in the
context of both syndromes:</p>
<list id="list1-2050312118823585" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Sleep onset latency</italic> and <italic>difficulties with

regardless of the underlying cause.</p>

melatonin secretion from the pineal gland is controlled directly by

influencing their sleep phenotypes.</p>

</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2050312118823585">
<title>The overall features of sleep phenotypes in AS and PWS</title>
<p>Extreme sleep disturbances, abnormal sleep–wake cycles and diminished need
for sleep are typically described as features of the sleep phenotype in
AS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2050312118823585">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2050312118823585">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2050312118823585">36</xref></sup> The abnormal sleep–wake cycle refers to the common
observation that individuals with AS often have difficulties in initiating
and maintaining sleep and sleep less than their age-matched peers as a
result. The feature is especially prominent in childhood, but continues to
improve toward adulthood with a moderate prevalence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2050312118823585">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2050312118823585">36</xref></sup> While
the lack of sleep is often described to “not affect the alertness or
activity level of the subject or even their personal quality of life,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2050312118823585">15</xref></sup> daytime sleepiness has also been reported in a number of
studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2050312118823585">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2050312118823585"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2050312118823585"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2050312118823585">38</xref></sup>
However, a recent meta-analysis later inferred that the trait was not
significantly affected in AS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2050312118823585">32</xref></sup> Nevertheless, as the sleep phenotype of AS is highly disturbed, the
genotype of the syndrome may also be involved with the regulation of
sleep.</p>
<p>The sleep phenotype of PWS is characterized most broadly by excessive daytime
sleepiness (EDS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2050312118823585">33</xref></sup> apparent problems with organization of REM sleep patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2050312118823585">39</xref></sup> and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2050312118823585">40</xref></sup> While daytime sleepiness is often attributed to OSA, daytime
sleepiness in PWS is often described to be unrelated to the quantity and
quality of nocturnal sleep.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2050312118823585">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>As noted above, previous studies have shown that sleep phenotypes are
prominently altered in both PWS and AS. However, no study to date has
systematically compared these syndromes with regard to their sleep
phenotypes.</p>

<sec id="section10-2050312118823585">
<title>Sleep onset latency and difficulties with falling asleep</title>
<p>Extreme variation of sleep onset emerges as a prominent phenotype in numerous
studies concerning the sleep phenotypes of both AS and PWS. Several
questionnaire studies concerning sleep and sleep-related behaviors have
addressed difficulties with falling asleep and bedtime resistance
(behavioral avoidance of bedtime), while a number of physiological overnight
sleep studies (polysomnography) have further quantified the trait as sleep
onset latency, defined as the time spent between settling down in bed and
falling asleep, based on the detection of the first stage of sleep in the
subject’s electroencephalogram pattern.</p>
<p>The notion of prolonged sleep onset latency in AS is supported by a recent
meta-analysis of sleep studies, which showed a moderate but significant
effect size for difficulties with falling asleep across relevant
questionnaire studies concerning AS subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2050312118823585">32</xref></sup> In closer detail, all three questionnaire studies reviewed for the
meta-analysis state that about 50%–60% of AS subjects are reported to show
frequent difficulties with falling asleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2050312118823585">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2050312118823585"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2050312118823585">37</xref></sup> indicating that the
sleep phenotype of AS may involve increased sleep onset latency as compared
to typically developing individuals. Similarly, a recent meta-analysis of
relevant overnight sleep studies indicated that sleep onset latency is
significantly increased in AS across the relevant studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2050312118823585">32</xref></sup> In contrast, a study comparing sleep problems in groups of infants
with different neurogenetic disorders found that infants with AS showed
marginally shortened sleep onset latency, as compared to the control group
of typically developing infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2050312118823585">42</xref></sup> However, the authors mention that the AS group also showed atypically
longer night wakings as compared to the control group and showed a high
amount of variation for night waking frequency (a range of 0–10 awakenings
in a night) which suggests that problems with maintaining and initiating
sleep may emerge in early infancy in AS.</p>
<p>Numerous behavioral studies have characterized behaviors with further
connections to bedtime and falling asleep. First, behaviors indicating high
sensitivity to the sleep environment, characterized by regular complaints on
feeling uncomfortable in bed, were estimated as significantly more common
among AS subjects as compared to the control subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2050312118823585">32</xref></sup> Second, fear or anxiety regarding sleep has been shown to be higher
in AS than in matched controls, by meta-analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2050312118823585">32</xref></sup> Third, regular use of both medical and non-medical sleep aids (such
as light in bedroom or security objects) has also been estimated to be
significantly higher among AS subjects compared to typically developing controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2050312118823585">32</xref></sup> Finally, several studies note a particular tendency for bedtime
resistance and insistence on particular bedtime routines among individuals
with AS. A questionnaire study on sleep problems on individuals with AS
notes that reluctance to go to bed was reported in a significantly higher
proportion of AS subjects (approximately 60% of individuals under the age of
15 years) compared to typically developing controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2050312118823585">36</xref></sup> Insistence on particular bedtime routines has similarly been reported
in 63% of the subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2050312118823585">34</xref></sup> Furthermore, a small-scale trial study found that behavioral
treatment for children with AS, including regular sleep schedules and
adequate parent–child bedtime interactions, led to shortening of sleep onset
latency and the children also showed significant improvements in bedtime
behavior and were able to fall asleep independently, as opposed to baseline
results prior to treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2050312118823585">43</xref></sup> A questionnaire study on parental stress and the sleep habits of
children with AS found that the sleep time variability of the child was
positively correlated with parental stress. The children with AS also showed
a higher level of concerning sleep habits including bedtime resistance,
sleep anxiety, night waking and difficulties in falling asleep, compared to
a group of typically developing children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2050312118823585">44</xref></sup> In summary, the increased bedtime resistance, insistence of
particular bedtime routines and wide use of both medical and non-medical
sleeping aids suggest that the increased sleep onset latency of AS subjects
may be caused by their greater restlessness around bedtime.</p>
<p>In PWS, numerous sleep studies show opposite results in comparison to AS,
with questionnaire studies showing a lack of problems related to sleep
onset, while overnight sleep studies offer mixed support for shortened sleep
onset latency. In particular, an early questionnaire study on sleep and
behavioral problems in PWS found that none of the PWS subjects were reported
to suffer from regular sleep settling problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2050312118823585">45</xref></sup> Similarly, a later questionnaire study on sleep and behavioral
problems in PWS found that only 1 of the 79 subjects was reported to have a
regular sleep settling problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2050312118823585">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>As overnight sleep studies in PWS provide conflicting evidence on sleep onset
latency, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relevant studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2050312118823585">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2050312118823585">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2050312118823585">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2050312118823585"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2050312118823585"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2050312118823585"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2050312118823585"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2050312118823585">52</xref></sup> to further quantify
sleep onset latency in PWS, as compared to typically developing
individuals.</p>
<p>We chose a fixed-effect model for our approach, as a relatively small number
of studies fit with our inclusion criteria and fixed-effect models are known
to perform better when the number of studies included is low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2050312118823585">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, the measured trait was defined in a similar fashion
across the studies, and as all of the studies involve a comparison between
PWS individuals and age-matched controls, we would expect the true effect of
the condition on sleep onset latency to be rather similar across the
studies.</p>
<p>Our findings with the meta-analysis of sleep onset latency in PWS were
threefold. First, we found that sleep onset latency in PWS shows a small but
significant negative effect in comparison to typically developing
individuals, indicating evidence of reduced sleep onset latency in PWS.
Second, our analysis indicates that there is significant heterogeneity
across the studies. This finding mirrors the recent large-scale
meta-analysis on sleep traits in AS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2050312118823585">32</xref></sup> and likely reflect the variation across the relevant studies with
other factors potentially influencing sleep traits, such as age, and
medication and OSA. The scale of the effects shown in each study and the
overall effect across the studies is also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2050312118823585">Figure 3</xref>. Finally, we conducted an
analysis of publication bias by fitting the relevant studies into a funnel
plot and found no significant evidence of publication bias with respect to
sleep onset latency.</p>

</fig>
<p>In summary, there is a diametric pattern to sleep onset latency in AS
compared to PWS individuals. Both questionnaire studies and overnight sleep
studies offer support for the notion of increased sleep onset latency in AS.
In comparison, the opposite pattern is shown in PWS, as both questionnaire
studies and overnight sleep studies support the notion of reduced sleep
onset latency in relation to typically developing individuals.</p>

<title>Sleep duration in AS and PWS</title>
<p>Extreme phenotypes of sleep duration have been characterized in both AS and

significance compared to controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2050312118823585">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Questionnaire studies on sleep problems in AS have featured questions on
whether the caretaker felt that the child slept less than children of their
age, and this item has been endorsed consistently across studies with a
prevalence of about 40%–50% among AS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2050312118823585">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2050312118823585">37</xref></sup> Furthermore, a
questionnaire study on sleep problems in AS found that a significantly

typically developing children was reported to regularly sleep less than 8 h
in a day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2050312118823585">36</xref></sup> Similarly, a recent meta-analysis of currently available overnight

in AS individuals, as compared to controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2050312118823585">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sleep duration in PWS has been primarily with overnight sleep studies, while
questionnaires have focused mainly on sleep problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2050312118823585">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2050312118823585">46</xref></sup> A
recent sleep study by Ghergan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2050312118823585">53</xref></sup> found that approximately 58% of adult PWS subjects were reported to
sleep more than 9 h in day. While 8% of the participants were found to sleep
over 11 h in a 24-h sleep recording session, the mean sleep duration of PWS
subjects was below 8 h. As earlier overnight sleep studies have provided
similarly conflicting results on sleep duration, we conducted a
meta-analysis of all previous overnight sleep studies which featured a
comparison between PWS subjects and a typically developing control
group.</p>
<p>A total of seven studies fulfilled our criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2050312118823585">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2050312118823585">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2050312118823585"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2050312118823585"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2050312118823585"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2050312118823585"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2050312118823585">52</xref></sup> First, our analysis
with a fixed-effect model indicated that sleep duration in PWS subjects did
not show a significant effect in either direction as compared to typically
developing individuals. Second, our analysis indicated significant
heterogeneity across the studies. Finally, the funnel plot analysis did not
indicate a significant publication bias with respect to sleep duration.</p>
<p>In summary, relevant studies have shown support for significantly shortened
sleep duration in AS, but an opposite pattern of increased sleep duration
cannot be seen in studies with PWS. Our analysis of currently available
studies indicates that despite relatively high self-reported levels of
sleepiness and long sleep durations in PWS, sleep duration in PWS as a whole
does not differ significantly from typically developing subjects.</p>

<title>Sleep efficiency in AS and PWS</title>
<p>Sleep efficiency reflects the time spent awake during the night, which is
affected by both sleep latency and wakefulness after sleep onset and can be
induced by factors such as apnea or restlessness. In AS, four overnight
sleep studies have included measurement of sleep efficiency and were later
compiled into a meta-analysis, which showed that sleep efficiency is
significantly reduced in AS compared to control subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2050312118823585">32</xref></sup> A particular overnight sleep study also notes that AS subjects showed
higher wakefulness after sleep onset compared to patients with varied
intellectual disabilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2050312118823585">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>In PWS, sleep efficiency has been especially studied in connection to apnea.
OSA has been assessed as a co-occurring condition with PWS, with a
meta-analysis reporting an 80% prevalence among 224 patients from a total of
14 studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2050312118823585">40</xref></sup> Apnea in PWS has traditionally been associated with obesity and, in
support of this notion, the meta-analysis study also reported that greater
body mass index (BMI) was positively correlated with OSA. However, a later
collaborative study of a large cohort of PWS patients found no correlation
between obstructive apnea; high BMI and facial dysmorphic features or
hypotonia were instead suggested to play a role in the occurrence of OSA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2050312118823585">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>While OSA could be expected to affect the sleep efficiency significantly,
results from other overnight sleep studies in PWS are somewhat inconclusive.
Two overnight sleep studies have reported a reduced sleep efficiency as
compared to normative values,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2050312118823585">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2050312118823585">56</xref></sup> while three other
studies found no significant difference in sleep efficiency between the PWS
and control groups or normative values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2050312118823585">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2050312118823585">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2050312118823585">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, sleep efficiency is reduced in both PWS and AS; however, current
studies suggest that the underlying reasons are different. In AS, longer
sleep latency and wakefulness after sleep onset are likely to affect sleep
efficiency negatively, whereas the high prevalence of obstructive apnea is
likely to affect sleep efficiency in PWS. While obesity has been shown to
correlate positively with apnea, other factors may also affect sleep
efficiency in PWS.</p>

<title>Variation in sleep architecture</title>
<p>Several polysomnographic studies have noted differences in sleep structure in
AS and PWS patients. First, a significantly reduced overall amount of REM
sleep as compared to control subjects has been found in AS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2050312118823585">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2050312118823585">58</xref></sup>
Similarly, a meta-analysis of overnight sleep studies in PWS found that 55%
of PWS patients analyzed in a total of 20 sleep studies showed a reduced
percentage (REM% &lt; 20) of REM sleep.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2050312118823585">33</xref></sup> While two later sleep studies found that overall REM sleep percentage
did not differ significantly from normative values,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2050312118823585">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2050312118823585">57</xref></sup> an
overnight sleep study comparing PWS subjects and typically developing
individuals found that PWS subjects had a significantly reduced overall REM
sleep percentage as compared to controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2050312118823585">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second, an opposite pattern between PWS and AS is suggested with regard to
the timing of onset for REM sleep. Typically, the onset of REM sleep first
occurs approximately 90 min after the onset of sleep.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2050312118823585">31</xref></sup> However, AS patients show a considerably increased REM latency,
though a comparison with a control group only approached statistical
significance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2050312118823585">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2050312118823585">58</xref></sup> Conversely, in PWS REM
sleep is often present during sleep onset. A meta-analysis of sleep studies
in PWS found that 27% of PWS subjects showed the presence of REM during
sleep onset at night, while a further 34% showed an onset of REM during a
daytime nap. Similarly, a shortened REM latency (&gt;70 min) was reported in
17% of PWS subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2050312118823585">33</xref></sup> Intrusions of REM sleep during daytime naps have similarly been found
in later studies concerning PWS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2050312118823585">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2050312118823585">57</xref></sup> Fragmentation of sleep
architecture is also evident in PWS, as multiple sleep studies have reported
either a significant increase in sleep stage shifts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2050312118823585">49</xref></sup> or an increased amount of REM sleep periods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2050312118823585">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2050312118823585">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, reduced overall amount of REM sleep has been shown in both AS and
PWS, while an opposite pattern is suggested in REM latency, with reduced REM
latency in PWS and increased REM latency in AS. As the hypothalamus is known
to regulate sleep through both neural mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2050312118823585">31</xref></sup> and circadian rhythmicity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2050312118823585">27</xref></sup> the opposite dysregulations of REM onset could also be indicative of
disrupted regulation of sleep onset in PWS and AS.</p>

<sec id="section14-2050312118823585">
<title>Daytime sleepiness</title>
<p>EDS is a common concern with PWS and has been studied in both questionnaire
and overnight sleep studies, while several questionnaire studies have also
addressed the condition in AS.</p>
<p>First, daytime sleepiness among AS subjects has been reported in several
questionnaire studies. A recent meta-analysis of these studies showed a
small but significant effect size, indicating a higher prevalence of daytime
sleepiness in AS compared to controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2050312118823585">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second, two questionnaire studies have addressed daytime sleepiness in
connection to behavioral problems in PWS. A questionnaire study on sleep and
behavioral problems noted that daytime sleepiness was reported in PWS
subjects with significantly greater prevalence (about 35%) compared to a
control group, and that daytime sleepiness was correlated positively with
behavioral problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2050312118823585">45</xref></sup> A later questionnaire study similarly found that daytime sleepiness
is shown with about 35% of PWS subjects, but no significant correlations
between sleep problems and behavioral problems were found.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2050312118823585">46</xref></sup> A recent large-scale sleep study found that about 50% of PWS subjects
showed a questionnaire result indicative of daytime sleepiness, while about
65% of the subjects reported sleepiness as a problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2050312118823585">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several sleep studies have also quantified daytime sleepiness in PWS with
MSLTs. Commonly used as a quantitative measure of EDS and narcolepsy, MSLT
measures the onset of sleep during multiple 20-min daytime nap periods. A
mean sleep onset time lower than 5 min is usually considered to indicate
that the condition is affecting the patient’s daytime activities. A
meta-analysis on sleep studies in PWS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2050312118823585">33</xref></sup> lists a total population of 72 patients across eight different
studies, with 40% of the subjects showing an MSLT result indicative of being
severely affected.</p>
<p>Daytime sleepiness is commonly attributed to a deficiency of sleep due to
OSA, which is a common concern in PWS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2050312118823585">33</xref></sup> However, while apnea has been suggested as a co-occurring condition
in PWS and apnea has also been shown to correlate positively with the BMI
among PWS subjects, support for the causation between EDS and OSA in PWS is
not entirely conclusive. Several studies have indeed reported a positive
correlation between apnea or BMI and a measure of sleepiness with PWS
subjects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2050312118823585">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2050312118823585">46</xref></sup> but a number of conflicting studies found no
significant correlations between BMI or reports of apnea and sleepiness in
PWS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2050312118823585">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2050312118823585">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2050312118823585">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, daytime sleepiness shows a significantly increased prevalence as
compared to controls in both PWS and AS. In PWS, the trait may be partially
attributable to OSA, but the underlying causes are likely to be
multifactorial. In AS, the condition is likely to be connected to reduced
sleep duration and frequent waking at night.</p>

<title>Associations with melatonin secretion</title>
<p>Circadian rhythms regulate sleep patterns, and the secretion of melatonin is
directly regulated by the circadian period in the SCN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2050312118823585">27</xref></sup> As a disruption of sleep patterns is evident in both AS and PWS, an
imbalance in the secretion of melatonin may be affecting the sleep
phenotypes of the two syndromes.</p>
<p>Melatonin and its associations to sleep phenotype have been studied in AS
using sleep studies and treatment trials. A study on circadian rhythms and
sleep traits in AS reported that circadian sleep disorders were diagnosed
with a prevalence of about 50% among AS subjects, and they found that
nighttime serum levels of melatonin were significantly reduced in AS
subjects as compared to a control group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2050312118823585">59</xref></sup> A later overnight sleep study similarly found that AS subjects showed
a significant delay in the pattern of nighttime melatonin secretion as
compared to the control group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2050312118823585">60</xref></sup> Furthermore, treatment trials among AS subjects have shown that
treatment with melatonin improves sleep duration and reduces sleep

<p>While melatonin and its connection to sleep traits have not been studied as
extensively in PWS as in AS, a study on endocrinal traits found that
melatonin levels of PWS subjects did not differ significantly from typical controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2050312118823585">63</xref></sup> A later study on morning melatonin levels in PWS subjects similarly
reported that serum melatonin levels did not differ from the control group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2050312118823585">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, current evidence supports a reduction in nighttime melatonin
secretion in AS. However, an opposite pattern is not seen in PWS, as
melatonin secretion has not been shown to differ significantly from controls
in currently available studies.</p>

<title>Genetic bases of sleep phenotypes and circadian rhythms in PWS and

genes take part in the regulation of circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>Circadian clock mechanisms regulate the daily cycle of activity and rest
through a transcriptional feedback loop of the core clock genes, which in
turn coordinate the daily oscillation of thousands of diurnally regulated genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2050312118823585">66</xref></sup> Diurnally regulated genes also show periodic changes in methylation,
which further corresponds to rhythmic changes in expression patterns of
these genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2050312118823585">67</xref></sup> The transcriptional feedback loop of the core circadian clock is
composed of the activators <italic>Clock</italic> and <italic>BMAL1</italic>
(<italic>ARNTL in human</italic>), which act as transcription factors
for both other clock genes and diurnally regulated genes, and the
repressors, <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per1, Per2</italic> and
<italic>Per3</italic>) and <italic>Cryptochrome</italic> (<italic>Cry1,
Cry2</italic>), which regulate the activators, eventually suppressing
their own transcription. The expression of the core clock genes follows a
roughly 24-h circadian rhythm, which, by convention, is indicated as
circadian time (CT), where CT 0 stands for the beginning of the subjective
day and CT 12 stands for the beginning of the subjective night.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2050312118823585">25</xref></sup> The rhythmic expression of the core clock genes shows a 3- to 9-h

<italic>Bmal1</italic> starts to rise after the subjective midday (CT 8)
and peaks during the subjective evening (CT 12). The CLOCK and BMAL1
proteins accumulate in the nucleus and in turn activate the transcription of

of subjective night (CT 18), further reaching the relative peak of their

<title>Sleep and regulation of circadian rhythms in mouse models of AS</title>
<p>Several studies have highlighted the role of <italic>UBE3A</italic> in the
regulation of sleep and circadian rhythms, suggesting that epigenetic
mechanisms involving this gene could provide specific cues to the central
circadian clock in the SCN.</p>
<p>Circadian rhythmicity has been studied in the mouse models of AS with
somewhat conflicting results, due to the nature of the
<italic>Ube3a</italic> imprinting mechanism in the SCN. A mouse model
study by Ehlen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2050312118823585">69</xref></sup> found that <italic>Ube3a</italic> imprinting is uniquely relaxed in
the SCN, allowing the AS mouse model to largely maintain its circadian
rhythmicity. The model mice showed no significant differences in their
ability to maintain the circadian rhythms in constant darkness or aberrant
lighting in comparison to controls. However, the model mice would skip a
rest period typical to the wild-type mice, and they showed a blunted
response to sleep deprivation, with a significant decrease in the overall
amount of REM sleep during a 24-h period. The authors concluded that
<italic>Ube3a</italic> regulates the accumulation of sleep pressure, the
homeostatic mechanism in the regulation of sleep.</p>
<p>Contrary to these results, another mice model study by Shi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2050312118823585">70</xref></sup> found that maternal deletion of <italic>Ube3a</italic> lengthens the
circadian period. In similarity to Ehlen et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2050312118823585">69</xref></sup> circadian rhythmicity was measured with running wheel activity in
varied lighting and the AS model mice were found to show a significantly
longer circadian period in constant darkness compared to controls, while the
lengthened circadian period was even more pronounced in the mouse model with
a larger deletion spanning from <italic>Ube3a</italic> to
<italic>Gabrb3</italic>, which is similar to the Class 1 deletion of AS.
Since Bmal1 has been identified as a target protein of the UBE3A ubiquitin ligase,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2050312118823585">71</xref></sup> the authors further suggested that Ube3a may regulate the turnover of
Bmal1, and so the deficiency for expression of <italic>Ube3a</italic> would
in turn lead to an excess of activators in the nucleus as opposed to the
repressors. This imbalance would further lengthen the 24-h circadian period.
As the secretion of melatonin is controlled by the input of the SCN,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2050312118823585">27</xref></sup> lengthening of the circadian rhythm would offer a direct explanation
for the reduced melatonin levels and increased sleep onset latency in
AS.</p>
<p>Molecular studies of the expression of clock genes in AS model mice have
similarly produced contrasting results. Ehlen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2050312118823585">69</xref></sup> initially reported that the model mice showed no significant
differences in the expression levels of the clock genes or the protein
levels of Per2 in SCN tissues, as compared to controls. Similarly, Jones et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-2050312118823585">72</xref></sup> ascertained the expression of paternally derived
<italic>Ube3a</italic> in the SCN by comparing protein levels of Ube3a
in mice with maternal deletions, deletions of both copies and controls. As
opposed to mice with deletions of both copies, Ube3a was detected uniquely
in the SCN tissues of the AS model mice, implying that the imprinting of the
paternal copy must be relaxed in the SCN. In contrast, Shi et al.
ascertained the expression of the clock genes with a
<italic>Per2:LUC</italic> reporter gene and compared the rhythmicity of
<italic>Per2</italic> expression between SCN slices and spleen and lung
tissues. The lack of expression for <italic>Ube3a</italic> was found to
significantly increase the length of the luminescence period in SCN tissues
but not in the lung or spleen tissues, indicating that lack of expression
for <italic>Ube3a</italic> may alter feedback loops of core clock genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2050312118823585">70</xref></sup> Furthermore, treatment with topotecan, a topoisomerase inhibitor,
which may inhibit the gene silencing mechanisms, significantly shortened the
luminescence period of <italic>Per2</italic> in SCN slices of the model mice
but not in the controls or other tissues, indicating that
<italic>Ube3a</italic> expression from the paternal copy may have
shortened the circadian period in the treated SCN slices, while the
treatment leaves the circadian period unaltered in other tissues, where
<italic>Ube3a</italic> is expressed from both parental copies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2050312118823585">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>Current mouse model studies may thus indicate that circadian rhythmicity is
mosaic in AS: imprinting of the paternal copy is relaxed in the peripheral
tissues and the SCN, while other brain regions and neurons experience a
lengthened circadian period. While the secretion of melatonin depends on an
indirect projection from the SCN,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2050312118823585">27</xref></sup> the circadian integration of activity and rest further depends on a
reciprocal connection between the SCN and the ARC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2050312118823585">28</xref></sup> Reduced levels of melatonin secretion and a relatively high incidence

<title>Sleep in mouse models of PWS</title>
<p>Recent mouse model studies have also linked the genotype of PWS to circadian
rhythmicity. To date, two of the maternally imprinted genes affected in the
syndrome, <italic>MAGEL2</italic> and <italic>SNORD116</italic>, have been
shown to be involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>A study of a PWS mouse model found that <italic>Magel2</italic> shows a
pattern of circadian expression in the SCN and that loss of
<italic>Magel2</italic> expression confers a phenotype of fragmented
activity and rest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2050312118823585">73</xref></sup> The length of the circadian period in constant darkness did not
differ significantly from controls. However, the model mice showed
significantly less nighttime activity compared to controls and a
fragmentation for periods of activity and rest, evident as a significantly
greater number of bouts of activity and a significantly shortened average
bout duration. The expression of <italic>Magel2</italic> in the SCN was
shown to peak late in the day, with a marked decrease in levels of
expression during the subjective night. The fragmentation of activity and
rest and the circadian pattern of gene expression in the SCN thus indicate
that <italic>Magel2</italic> may be regulating the circadian clock mechanism
in the SCN.</p>
<p>Further molecular studies have shown that the expression of
<italic>Magel2</italic> may further regulate the transcriptional
feedback loop of the circadian clock mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2050312118823585">74</xref></sup> In a cell-based model, the co-expression of <italic>Magel2</italic>
with <italic>Clock</italic> and <italic>Bmal1</italic> was shown to repress
the transcription of <italic>Per2</italic>, as compared to the level of
expression with only <italic>Clock</italic> and <italic>Bmal1</italic>
present. The effect was intermediate in strength, compared to the more
repressive <italic>Cry</italic> which is known to regulate the negative
feedback loop of the circadian clock mechanism. Several possible mechanisms
for the repressing effect of <italic>Magel2</italic> were investigated, and
<italic>Magel2</italic> was shown to promote the cytoplasmic
accumulation of Clock. While <italic>Clock</italic> is expressed
continuously in the SCN, the subcellular localization of the Clock protein
shows circadian variation. Clock is primarily cytoplasmic by itself and
starts to accumulate in the nucleus only as the relative levels of gene
expression of <italic>Bmal1</italic> start to rise. Therefore,
<italic>Magel2</italic> may further regulate a programmed delay in the

the Clock protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2050312118823585">74</xref></sup> As the expression of diurnally regulated genes is regulated by the

the dysregulation of sleep and activity evident in PWS.</p>
<p>Loss of expression for <italic>Snord116</italic> has also been shown to alter
the expression of diurnally regulated genes. Powell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2050312118823585">75</xref></sup> identified dysregulation of about 6000 diurnally regulated genes in
the mouse cortex, including dysregulation of the pacemaker genes such as
<italic>Cry1, Clock, Per2</italic> and <italic>Mtor</italic> as well as
increased expression of <italic>Ube3a</italic>, which regulates the
oscillatory pattern of Bmal1 via ubiquitination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2050312118823585">71</xref></sup> Coulson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2050312118823585">76</xref></sup> further showed that loss of expression for <italic>Snord116</italic>
led to a pattern of shifted diurnal methylation characterized by losses
during the light phase and increased diurnal methylation during the dark
phase. The authors suggest that the gene expression of epigenetic and
circadian regulators is increased in the model mice during the light phase,
which may lead to prolonged accumulation of these proteins into the dark
phase, resulting in the shifted methylation pattern. As circadian rhythms
regulate the daily cycle of activity and rest by further regulating the gene
expression of thousands of diurnally regulated genes, the dysregulation of
these gene expression patterns through a shift in the diurnal methylation
cycle due to lack of expression for <italic>SNORD116</italic> could explain
the dysregulation of activity and rest which is evident in PWS.</p>

<title>Model for explaining opposite sleep phenotypes in PWS and AS</title>
<p>Since both AS and PWS show evidence of opposite phenotypes for sleep onset
latency, and relevant mouse model studies indicate that both the maternally
expressed <italic>UBE3A</italic> and the paternally expressed
<italic>MAGEL2</italic> and <italic>SNORD116</italic> may be involved in
the regulation of circadian rhythmicity in the SCN, we propose a
hypothetical model for explaining the opposite sleep phenotypes based on the
known interactions of these genes with the circadian clock mechanisms.
First, as a baseline, assuming that the gene expression pattern of the core
clock genes in peripheral tissues is delayed by approximately 6 h relative
to the circadian rhythm of the SCN,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2050312118823585">25</xref></sup> we estimate that the transcription of <italic>ARNTL</italic> would
reach its peak in the subjective morning, leading to nuclear accumulation of
CLOCK and ARNTL proteins during the day and transcription of the
<italic>Per</italic> and <italic>Cry</italic> genes reaching its peak
early in the evening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2050312118823585">68</xref></sup> As the PER and CRY proteins heterodimerize and accumulate to the
nucleus, the expression of <italic>PER</italic> and <italic>CRY</italic> is
suppressed completely by the midpoint of the subjective night.</p>
<p>Second, the maternally expressed <italic>UBE3A</italic>, as well as the
paternally expressed <italic>MAGEL2</italic> and <italic>SNORD116</italic>,
has been shown to interact with the clock genes in the SCN, which may alter
the length of the circadian period and the rhythmic expression of diurnally
regulated genes. The maternally expressed <italic>UBE3A</italic> regulates
the turnover of BMAL1 (ARNTL) via ubiquitination. As the duration of the
circadian period is determined by rhythmic variation of abundance of the
core clock proteins, lack of expression for <italic>UBE3A</italic> and the
reduced turnover of BMAL1 may lengthen the circadian period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2050312118823585">70</xref></sup> Our model shows that the imbalance in the protein levels of BMAL1
(ARNTL) may also alter the timing of sleep onset at the subjective evening
in AS. In contrast, the paternally expressed <italic>MAGEL2</italic> may
promote the cytoplasmic accumulation of CLOCK or regulate the expression of
<italic>PER</italic> in the SCN through other molecular interactions,
while SNORD116 has been shown to regulate the expression of
<italic>UBE3A</italic> and several circadian pacemaker genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2050312118823585">75</xref></sup> An overexpression of <italic>UBE3A</italic> would be expected to
accelerate the oscillatory pattern of BMAL1, while <italic>MAGEL2</italic>
may mediate a programmed delay in the feedback loop of the circadian
rhythm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2050312118823585">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2050312118823585">75</xref></sup> Thus, a lack of expression for
<italic>MAGEL2</italic> and <italic>SNORD116</italic> may lead to a
shortened circadian rhythm and dysregulation of diurnally regulated gene
expression as well as a further dysregulation of sleep and
activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2050312118823585">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2050312118823585">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2050312118823585">76</xref></sup> As also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2050312118823585">Figure 4</xref>, these interactions produce
opposite alterations to the circadian period in both syndromes due to the
variable dosages of paternally and maternally expressed genes. In AS, both
the expression of <italic>MAGEL2</italic> and lack of expression for
<italic>UBE3A</italic> may therefore contribute to a lengthened
circadian period, while in PWS both lack of expression for
<italic>MAGEL2</italic> and dysregulation in the expression of
<italic>UBE3A</italic> due to loss of expression for
<italic>SNORD116</italic> are expected to contribute toward a shortened
circadian rhythm and dysregulation of diurnally regulated gene
expression.</p>

</fig>
<p>These opposite alterations of the circadian rhythm may further explain
opposite alterations to the timing of sleep onset in both syndromes, as is
also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2050312118823585">Figure
4</xref>. AS involves a phenotype of increased sleep latency along with
reduced levels of melatonin secretion and increased bedtime resistance. As
secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland is directly dependant of input
from the SCN, a misaligned rhythm could explain the reduced levels of
melatonin secretion in AS. However, the imprinting of <italic>Ube3a</italic>
may be uniquely relaxed in the SCN and so it has been further argued that
the increased sleep onset latency in AS may alternatively be due to reduced
accumulation of sleep pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2050312118823585">69</xref></sup> In contrast to AS, our proposed model suggests that PWS may involve a
dysregulation of diurnal gene expression and a relatively shorter subjective
day due to the lack of programmed delay in the circadian period, which may
further regulate neural and physiological regulation of sleep and
wakefulness, which would similarly help explain the reduced sleep onset
latency and EDS in the phenotype of PWS.</p>
<p>The evolutionary significance of regulatory mechanisms for sleep and
wakefulness can be further understood in the context of human life histories
by considering bedtime interactions, which involve numerous soothing
routines and can be viewed to represent an important time for maternal
bonding. The timing of sleep onset and difficulties with falling asleep may
reflect the importance these interactions. Thus, maternal bonding and the
regulation of sleep and wakefulness may be subject to an evolutionary
tug-of-war between paternally and maternally imprinted genes. Paternally
expressed genes may have been selected to favor an innate tendency for
increased sleep onset latency and more frequent waking to solicit more
maternal resources, while the opposite may be true for maternally expressed
genes. Evidently, both AS and PWS involve extreme phenotypes in the
regulation of sleep and wakefulness as well as opposite imbalances in
dosages of paternally and maternally imprinted genes.</p>

<sec id="section22-2050312118823585">
<title>Feeding behavior and the development of hyperphagia</title>
<p>For our purposes, feeding behavior can be understood in two overlapping
contexts: (1) the evolutionary bases of feeding behavior and life history in
human childhood and (2) neural and endocrine mechanisms for the regulation
of appetite. Human life histories feature two major transitions of feeding
behavior: first, weaning from maternally provided breast milk involves the
gradual introduction of complementary foods approximately from the age of
6 months and onwards; the second major transition involves a further
nutritional shift from specially prepared complementary foods toward more
diverse family foods, coinciding with the development of adequate dentition
between ages of 6 and 8 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-2050312118823585">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2050312118823585">78</xref></sup> The age period of
complementary feeding coincides with a phase characterized by consistent
refusal of new foods (food neophobia),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-2050312118823585">79</xref></sup> and the tendency for refusal of new foods has also been shown to be
highly heritable among humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-2050312118823585">80</xref></sup> Modern practices of complementary feeding can be interpreted to
involve specially prepared “baby foods” such as porridge, purees and other
foods with constant, soft and smooth textures. Ethnographical records of
existing hunter–gatherer societies also indicate that ancestral
complementary foods may have consisted mainly of a diverse selection of
premasticated foods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-2050312118823585">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second, gradual transition toward an adult diet can also be viewed to
involve a reduced burden of maternal investment. In ancestral human
societies, children would begin to contribute to their own nutrition at the
ages of about 5–7 years by collecting edibles such as fruit or berries
(foraging), which coincides with the transition toward more diverse family
foods in modern societies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-2050312118823585">82</xref></sup> The relatively early weaning, as compared to ancestors and other
great apes, typical of human childhood, and the introduction of
complementary foods can be further interpreted as unique evolutionary
adaptations for shorter interbirth intervals in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2050312118823585">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>The regulation of feeding behaviors in the context of neural and genetic
mechanisms, which regulate food intake, is largely based on mouse model
studies. The neurocircuits that regulate feeding behavior are thought to be
disrupted in both hyperphagia and hypophagia. The neural circuits that
regulate feeding can be divided into homeostatic feeding mechanisms, which
maintain the energy balance of the body, and hedonic feeding mechanisms,
which are driven by neural signals of reward.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-2050312118823585">83</xref></sup> The regulation of homeostatic feeding is maintained by peripheral
short-term signals of satiety and hunger, as well as long-term signals of
energy balance, which are produced in the body and processed by the
hypothalamus. Short-term signals of satiety and hunger are produced in the
gut and include ghrelin, which stimulates hunger, and cholecystokinin (CCK),
glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY, which signal satiety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-2050312118823585">84</xref></sup> Long-term signals of energy balance, such as insulin and leptin, are
produced in proportion to the levels of adipose tissue in the body and enter
the brain through blood circulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-2050312118823585">85</xref></sup> The peripheral signals of satiety, hunger and energy balance converge
in the hypothalamus, which regulates food intake and energy expenditure
through two opposite neural mechanisms in the ARC. Neuropeptide Y
(NPY)-expressing neurons and agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing
neurons thus promote food intake, while neurons expressing peptides derived
from pro-opiomelanocortin (Pomc) limit food intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-2050312118823585">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-2050312118823585">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>The regulation of hedonic eating is based on the rewarding aspect of feeding,
as both the consumption and sensory representations of food induce responses
in the neural reward circuitry. The neural reward circuitry involves
reciprocal connections between monoaminergic, intermediate and ventricular
nuclei. Monoaminergic systems are driven by neurotransmitters including
serotonin and dopamine, which mediate the motivation for rewarding behaviors
such as feeding or mating. In the regulation of feeding, monoaminergic
nuclei further project to intermediate nuclei in the lateral hypothalamic
area and other brain regions similarly connected to the ARC, which in turn
governs feeding via the hypothalamus. The reciprocal connections of the
reward circuitry have been shown to promote feeding and to play a particular
role in the development of food preferences and increased consumption of
palatable foods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-2050312118823585">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>Genetic mouse models of PWS and AS show opposite alterations in both dopamine
and serotonin levels in the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-2050312118823585">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2050312118823585">87</xref></sup> Furthermore,
dysfunction of the hypothalamus is central to several physiological
phenotypes in PWS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2050312118823585">88</xref></sup> Thus, it can be hypothesized that the specific eating behaviors
related to these syndromes may involve opposite dysfunctions in the
regulation of hedonic feeding mechanisms.</p>

<title>A comparison of hyperphagia in PWS and AS</title>
<p>PWS involves a gradually developing condition of hyperphagia, manifested by
low birth weight and an early restriction of growth, followed by rapid
weight gain after weaning, and the development of hyperphagic behavior and
obesity, consistent across all genotypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2050312118823585">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2050312118823585">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-2050312118823585">89</xref></sup> The rapid weight gain
after weaning has been traditionally associated with overeating. However,
Miller et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2050312118823585">13</xref></sup> showed that the changes in weight gain precede the changes in
appetite, implying that the development of hyperphagic behavior is preceded
by metabolic changes. The authors reviewed complete growth and nutritional
records of 58 PWS subjects involved in a longitudinal study to characterize
the development of hyperphagia in PWS. The condition was found to follow a
gradual progression through several nutritional phases, distinguishable by
significant changes in weight gain and dietary intake, as compared to each
of the previous phases. The progression and phenotypical changes involved
with the nutritional phases can be summarized as follows.</p>
<p>First, infancy is characterized by low birth weight and significant growth
restrictions and accompanied by feeding difficulties and overall failure to
thrive. Similarly, the infants who did not receive tube feeding also showed
metabolic rates indicative of underfeeding. However, the first changes in
appetite and weight become apparent approximately at the age of 9 months. At
this point, the infant is taking adequate nutrition and the weight gain
follows a growth curve similar to typical development. It is notable that
the first changes in appetite occur around the age when complementary foods
are first introduced to an infant’s diet. Furthermore, the infants who began
to receive growth hormone treatment at early age also showed a significantly
faster development of appetite in infancy, compared to individuals who began
to receive growth hormone treatment later, implying a role for endocrine
changes in the development of appetite. Second, the rapid weight gain that
precedes the gradual rise of appetite and the development of hyperphagia
becomes apparent at approximately 2 years of age. This increase in weight
gain is also associated with a significant increase in the serum levels of
insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), implying a role for endocrine changes in
the development of hyperphagia. As PWS involves a hypothalamic dysfunction,
which has been further associated with the growth hormone deficiency typical
to the syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-2050312118823585">89</xref></sup> it can be further postulated that the metabolic changes involved in
the development of hyperphagia in PWS may be caused by the hypothalamic
dysfunction. Third, the gradual rise of interest toward food and further
changes in appetite can be recognized at approximately 4–5 years of age,
while the development of independent food-seeking behaviors and visible
hyperphagia become apparent at 8–9 years of age.</p>
<p>The concept of distinct nutritional phases has been criticized by Kotler et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2050312118823585">12</xref></sup> who performed a retrospective review of clinical records for 55
individuals with PWS and found that routinely collected clinical records
contained inadequate information for assigning an individual to one of the
nutritional phases defined earlier by Miller et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2050312118823585">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, the identification of the later nutritional phases
relies on changes in appetite and behavior, but as pointed out by Kotler et
al. the analyses applied by Miller and colleagues did not control for
changes in appetite with age, effects of psychiatric medication or any
restrictions in the availability of food. Kotler et al. note that PWS
involves incomplete pubertal development, but the progression of early
stages of puberty is accelerated, as compared to typical development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-2050312118823585">90</xref></sup> Thus, it can be postulated that the imprinted genes involved in the
development of PWS may affect the comparably earlier onset of adrenarche in
PWS, and that the onset of extreme hyperphagic behavior approximately at the
age of 8–9 years coincides with the beginning of this juvenile
phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2050312118823585">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2050312118823585">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>In comparison to PWS, few studies have characterized the development of
hyperphagic behavior in AS. Berry et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-2050312118823585">91</xref></sup> note that behaviors indicative of hyperphagia were reported in AS
individuals in significantly greater proportions compared to a control group
of children with intellectual disabilities. Approximately one third of the
AS individuals in the study were reported to steal or gorge on foods
regularly, indicating a tendency for hyperphagic behavior. However, no
significant differences in reported behaviors were found between different
genotypes. A comparative questionnaire study on food-related behaviors among
five genetic neurodevelopmental syndromes similarly found that their group
of AS subjects displayed a significantly higher degree of behaviors
indicating impaired satiety, compared to subjects with Cornelia de Lange
syndrome but also a significantly lower degree of impaired satiety compared
to PWS subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-2050312118823585">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to the results of Berry et al. and the development of hyperphagia
in PWS, phenotypes indicative of hyperphagic behavior in AS have been
strongly associated with imprinting defects and paternal disomy, which
involve increased dosage for the paternally expressed genes in the 15q11-q13
locus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-2050312118823585">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-2050312118823585">94</xref></sup> In particular, Mertz et al. found that AS
individuals with patUPD had significantly increased birth weights and also
showed a significant increase in BMI at approximately 3 years of age and
afterward, as compared to AS subjects with the deletion genotype or
<italic>UBE3A</italic> mutations. Similarly, a study on early childhood
development in AS also found that AS individuals with imprinting defects or
the patUPD genotypes developed a disproportionally high BMI within the first
4 years of age, in comparison to individuals with <italic>UBE3A</italic> mutations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-2050312118823585">94</xref></sup> In addition, Mertz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-2050312118823585">93</xref></sup> found that AS individuals with the patUPD genotype showed
significantly higher degrees of hyperphagic behavior, drive and severity,
compared to AS individuals with the deletion genotype. However, the study
design of Mertz et al. did not enable precise assessments on the age of
onset for the hyperphagic behaviors. Thus, it is not possible to estimate if
the hyperphagic behavior in AS develops at an early age, as suggested by the
early change in BMI, or if the condition involves a more gradual development
of appetite, similar to that of PWS.</p>
<p>In conclusion, PWS involves a gradually developing condition of hyperphagia
consistent across all genotypes. In comparison, hyperphagic behaviors are
reported with approximately one third of AS individuals, while rapid weight
gain at an early age and significantly increased degrees of hyperphagic
behavior are further associated with genotypes showing relatively more
paternal imprinted gene biases. Furthermore, while patUPD and imprinting
defects each account for approximately 2%–3% of all AS cases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2050312118823585">9</xref></sup> we note that relatively more paternal genotypes were
disproportionally represented (18% UPD, 6% imprinting defect, 5% abnormal
methylation) in the study of Berry et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2050312118823585">14</xref></sup> However, it is currently unclear if hyperphagic behaviors are
exclusively associated with relatively more paternal genotypes in AS.</p>

were described as “picky eaters” during their clinical visits. An avoidance
of meat and chunky or non-pureed foods was shown at an age of 1–3 years,
while preferences for starchy foods and avoidance of meat were common
throughout all age groups. However, as food neophobia is a consistent
feature of typical childhood development at early ages, it is difficult to
estimate if these food preferences are consistently narrower or broader
compared to typically developing individuals. While tendencies for
particular food preferences are present in PWS, two behavioral studies
further suggest that the amount of food available is consistently more
important compared to taste. Glover et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-2050312118823585">99</xref></sup> showed that PWS subjects would consistently choose a larger amount of
a less preferred food over a smaller amount of their favorite food, while
obese control subjects instead showed a tendency toward choosing their
preferred foods. Similarly, Joseph et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-2050312118823585">101</xref></sup> showed that adult PWS subjects consistently chose larger amounts of
food regardless of any preference in taste or any delay in presentation. In
addition, behavioral studies also suggest that PWS subjects are more likely
to accept contaminated or inappropriately placed foods. Dykens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-2050312118823585">102</xref></sup> used photos of food items to assess acceptance of different foods and
found that PWS subjects were significantly more likely to endorse
contaminated or highly unusual foods compared to both typically developing
controls and intelligent quotient (IQ)-matched controls with varied
intellectual disabilities. Similarly, Young et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-2050312118823585">103</xref></sup> found that both PWS subjects and children with varied intellectual
disabilities were significantly more likely to express acceptance of
inappropriately placed foods, such as on food the floor or in a trash can
compared to typically developing individuals, indicating a consistent
tendency for unselective eating. Furthermore, a group of three individuals
with a mean age of approximately 12 years was found to actively seek and
consume inappropriately placed food in an experimental setting, while older
individuals (mean age of approximately 20 years) did not show a similar
tendency.</p>
<p>In comparison to PWS, both narrow food preferences and marked interests for
certain types of foods have been reported in studies of AS. Clarke and
Marston conducted a caretaker questionnaire on problematic behaviors,
comparing a group of AS subjects aged 5–33 years to previously studied
groups with varied intellectual disabilities. The authors noted that a range
of varied food-related problem behaviors, including overeating or a narrow
range of food preferences, were reported in 64% of the participants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-2050312118823585">104</xref></sup> Similarly, according to Berry et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2050312118823585">14</xref></sup> narrow food preferences are reported with a prevalence between 33%
and 100% in the relevant literature concerning AS. Behaviors concerning
narrow food preferences were also reported in significantly greater
proportions among AS subjects (aged between 1 and 40 years, with a mean age
of 13.6 years), compared to a control group of children with intellectual
disabilities, with a prevalence of approximately 70% among the AS individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2050312118823585">14</xref></sup> Finally, AS has been noted to involve specific interests toward
certain foods. In particular, “marked preference for certain foods,
particularly those that do not require much chewing such as bread, pasta or
banana” has been noted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-2050312118823585">105</xref></sup> Hence, while the evidence is limited in nature, studies concerning AS
support the notion of a consistent tendency for relatively selective eating
in AS, along with an exaggerated interest in foods resembling specially
prepared complementary foods in texture.</p>
<p>Although relevant studies characterizing narrow or limited food preferences
are few in AS, behavioral tendencies for narrow food preferences are well
documented in subjects with ASDs (reviewed in Marí-Bauset et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-2050312118823585">106</xref></sup>). Given the relatively high degree of comorbidity between autism and
AS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2050312118823585">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2050312118823585"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2050312118823585">4</xref></sup> a
certain resemblance of feeding behavior patterns and food preferences
between the two conditions may be assumed. Children with ASDs display a
consistent tendency for significantly increased selectivity toward food, as
compared to typically developing children: Raiten and Massaro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-2050312118823585">107</xref></sup> compared food preferences among children with ASDs and typically
developing children with a 7-day food diary and a parental questionnaire and
found that children with ASDs showed a significantly higher degree of food
selectivity compared to typically developing children. Similar results have
been further shown in several behavioral studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-2050312118823585">108</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-2050312118823585"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-2050312118823585"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-2050312118823585"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-2050312118823585"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-2050312118823585"></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-2050312118823585"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-2050312118823585">115</xref></sup> While the
association of narrow food preferences and ASDs is consistently reported
across studies, it is less clear if the selectivity is based on taste,
difficulty in consumption or other aspects such as visual representation.
For example, Schreck et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-2050312118823585">108</xref></sup> found that children with ASDs were significantly more likely to
require specific utensils or particular presentation of food items, compared
to typically developing children, and that children with ASDs were also more
likely to accept foods with constant texture, such as purees or mashed
potatoes. Similarly, Hubbard et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-2050312118823585">116</xref></sup> noted that children with ASDs were significantly more likely to
refuse foods based on their texture, smell and taste compared to typically
developing children.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the evidence is limited, AS may involve a tendency for a
narrow range of preferred foods, which resemble complementary foods in
texture. In comparison, PWS subjects tend to choose larger amounts of food
over preferred foods and may endorse both contaminated and inappropriately
placed foods. These behaviors suggest a tendency for unselective eating,
which develops gradually along with the gradual rise in appetite at the age
of 4–5 years.</p>

<title>Food-seeking behaviors</title>
<p>The hyperphagic condition of PWS has been characterized to involve an
exaggerated preoccupation with food and the development of independent
food-seeking behaviors, including stealing or taking food without approval
as well as bargaining for food and snacks with their caretakers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2050312118823585">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-2050312118823585">117</xref></sup> As

should be assessed whether any quantifiable differences in hyperphagic
behavior can be found between AS and PWS.</p>
<p>Two large-scale questionnaire studies have documented a wide range of
hyperphagic behaviors in PWS. Russell and Oliver designed a questionnaire
for food-related behaviors based on structured interviews with parents and
caretakers, and derived subscales for behavioral traits to further
characterize preoccupation with food, impaired satiety and negative
food-related behaviors, which include taking or stealing food, eating
inappropriate items (pica) and reacting inappropriately when food is taken
away. The PWS subjects scored consistently higher in all subscales, compared
to a control group of children with intellectual disabilities living in a
similar community setting, indicating a consistent tendency for food-seeking
behaviors and an exaggerated preoccupation with food.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-2050312118823585">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dykens et al. assessed hyperphagic behaviors in PWS with a specifically
designed questionnaire. Hyperphagic behaviors were categorized into
different factors and a principal components analysis was performed to
further characterize which of the factors best explained the variance in the
results. While the drive for food (hyperphagic drive) was found to be
consistent across all age groups, extremely obese individuals with PWS
displayed significantly greater drive for food, compared to other over- or
normal-weight PWS subjects. In addition, PWS subjects above the age of 10
were found to show a significantly greater variety of hyperphagic behaviors
compared to younger children with PWS. Hyperphagic severity, indicating the
individual’s preoccupation with food, was found to be similar in all other
age groups, while the oldest age group (30 years and above) showed
significantly lower scores. In other words, hyperphagic problem behaviors
only become evident in late childhood, while the preoccupation with food
diminishes as the individual matures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2050312118823585">88</xref></sup> In contrast to the results of Mertz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-2050312118823585">93</xref></sup> concerning AS subjects, no significant correlations were found
between genotypes and any degree of hyperphagic behavior, drive or severity,
further indicating that the condition of hyperphagia is consistent across
all the genotypes in PWS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2050312118823585">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>Food-seeking behaviors have been described in three studies concerning
food-related behaviors in AS. As noted earlier, stealing food or overeating
has been reported in a significantly larger proportion of AS subjects
(approximately one third) compared to control subjects with intellectual disabilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2050312118823585">14</xref></sup> Furthermore, in a direct comparison of food-related problem behaviors
between five genetic neurodevelopmental syndromes, both AS and PWS
individuals were reported to show greater degrees of food-seeking behaviors,
compared to the groups of CdLs and 1p36 deletion syndrome individuals.
However, individuals with PWS also showed significantly greater
preoccupation with food compared to individuals with AS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-2050312118823585">92</xref></sup> Similarly, as noted earlier, the patUPD genotype has been
characterized to display a significantly greater degree of food-seeking
behaviors and a greater degree of hyperphagic drive and severity, compared
to AS subjects with the deletion genotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-2050312118823585">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, both AS and PWS show a significant tendency for food-seeking
behaviors, but while food-seeking behaviors are consistent across all
genotypes in PWS, in AS the patUPD genotype shows a higher degree of
food-seeking behaviors. In addition, behaviors indicating a preoccupation
with food are reported to a greater degree in PWS.</p>

<title>Human studies on the regulation of hunger and satiety in PWS</title>
<p>Several behavioral and physiological human studies have characterized the
hyperphagic condition of PWS as involving an impairment of satiety. First,
Holland et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-2050312118823585">118</xref></sup> showed that PWS subjects consumed significantly higher amounts of
calories during a meal session, compared to typical control subjects. As
expected, the blood levels of CCK, associated with regulation of satiety,
were also significantly higher in the PWS subjects compared to controls. The
increase in blood CCK levels during the meal session thus indicates that the
hyperphagic behavior is not associated with a failure in the release of
peripheral satiety signals. Similarly, physiological studies have indicated
that two other peripheral signals of satiety, leptin and peptide YY, are
also significantly elevated in PWS subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-2050312118823585">119</xref></sup> While significantly elevated levels of circulating ghrelin, a peptide
involved in the peripheral signaling of hunger, have been noted in several
studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-2050312118823585">120</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-2050312118823585">121</xref></sup> it is unlikely that hyperghrelinemia would be
causal to the hyperphagia in PWS, as the levels of fasting ghrelin are also
elevated in infants and children in early nutritional phases before the
onset of hyperphagic behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-2050312118823585">122</xref></sup> As the elevated levels of peripheral signals of satiety would be
expected to regulate meal size, these results suggest that the apparent
dysregulation of food intake may instead be connected to the hypothalamic
dysfunction central to PWS.</p>
<p>Neuroimaging studies have provided evidence that impaired satiety in PWS is
connected to a hypothalamic dysfunction and a failure in neural recognition
of peripheral satiety signals. Hinton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-2050312118823585">100</xref></sup> measured neural activation in response to an overnight fast followed
by a high-energy breakfast and found that the PWS subjects showed a
comparable lack of neural activation in brain regions previously associated
with satiety after meal consumption, indicating a dysfunction in neural
regulation of food intake.</p>
<p>Recently, a post-mortem transcriptional analysis of brain tissues in PWS
subjects has confirmed that PWS subjects display an imbalance in the
expression of hypothalamic neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of
hunger and satiety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-2050312118823585">123</xref></sup> Comparing gene expression, some ~3600 genes were found to be
differentially expressed in the hypothalamic tissues of PWS subjects, as
compared to controls with comparable BMI. Furthermore, the expression of
<italic>AgRp</italic> and other genes predominantly expressed in
AgRp-expressing neurons was found to be significantly upregulated in PWS
subjects, while the expression of <italic>Pomc</italic> and other genes
predominantly expressed in Pomc-expressing neurons was found to be
significantly downregulated. Comparisons with the gene expression profiles
of fasted animals indicated that the genes upregulated in PWS subjects also
represented genes commonly upregulated in response to hunger. In addition, a
dysregulation of genes involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis and
adipocyte tissues is also implied. Finally, using a targeted deletion of
<italic>SNORD116</italic> in a human cell model and analysis of
predicted splicing targets for the <italic>SNORD116 SnoRNA</italic>, the
researchers showed that lack of expression for <italic>SNORD116</italic> may
lead to marked neurodegeneration and reduced neuronal differentiation
through dysregulation of alternative splicing of several genes previously
implied in neuron development and synaptic plasticity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-2050312118823585">123</xref></sup> Taken together, these results indicate that the pleiotropic effects
of neuronal loss and reduced neuronal differentiation may also lead to a
dysregulation of hunger and satiety in the hypothalamus in PWS.</p>
<p>The complex nature of the genetic mechanism for hyperphagia and obesity in
PWS is further highlighted in studies of Schaaf–Yang syndrome. Schaaf–Yang
syndrome is caused by truncating mutations or deletions of the paternally
derived copy of the <italic>MAGEL2</italic> gene, and so the genotype of
Schaaf–Yang syndrome has partial overlap with the genotypes of PWS. While
both Schaaf–Yang syndrome and PWS involve intellectual disability, hypotonia
and feeding problems during infancy, hyperphagia is described in only 35% of
subjects with Schaaf–Yang syndrome, whereas excessive weight gain has been
reported in 47% of the subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-2050312118823585">124</xref></sup> In a partially overlapping study, McCarthy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-2050312118823585">125</xref></sup> reported that all nine subjects with Schaaf–Yang syndrome showed
elevated levels of fasting ghrelin, while hyperphagia had not been reported
in any of the patients involved in the study. The consistent features
between the phenotypes of PWS and Schaaf–Yang syndrome indicate that the
lack of expression for <italic>MAGEL2</italic> may play a role in the
development of early feeding restrictions and the later development of
obesity. However, the partial penetrance of hyperphagia in Schaaf–Yang
syndrome indicates that other paternally expressed genes of the 15q11-q13
locus further affect the phenotype of hyperphagia in PWS.</p>

<title>Genetic mouse model studies of the regulation of hunger and satiety in
PWS</title>
<p>Several mouse model studies have investigated the genetic mechanisms for the
central features in the phenotype of PWS: an early growth restriction
followed by the subsequent development of hyperphagia and obesity.</p>
<p>Bischof et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-2050312118823585">126</xref></sup> showed that mice with two inactivated copies of
<italic>Magel2</italic> exhibited an early growth deficit from the first
week after birth until weaning, which was followed by rapid weight gain and
obesity after weaning. However, the mutant mice showed a ~10% reduction in
food intake and were also less active compared to controls. These results
resemble the phenotype of PWS closely, which may not only indicate a central
role for <italic>Magel2</italic> in the development of both early growth
restrictions and later changes in weight gain but also indicate that losses
of expression for other paternally expressed may be responsible for the
development of hyperphagia in PWS.</p>
<p>The role of <italic>MAGEL2</italic> in the development of obesity has been
shown to involve interactions with leptin in the hypothalamus: Mercer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-2050312118823585">127</xref></sup> showed that model mice with deletions of the <italic>Magel2</italic>
gene lack the anorexigenic response to leptin, which induced restrictions in
food intake in the control mice. Based on the observations of genetic
markers for neural activation, it was shown that leptin fails to activate
the Pomc-expressing neurons in the cells of <italic>MAGEL2</italic>-null
mice, indicating a neural dysregulation of food intake. As also shown in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2050312118823585">Figure 5</xref>, leptin
regulates food intake via the hypothalamus. Thus, the authors hypothesized
that <italic>Magel2</italic> may have a role in regulating intracellular
leptin responses in hypothalamic neurons. Recently, another mouse model
study confirmed that <italic>Magel2</italic> interacts with
<italic>necdin</italic> and three ubiquitin pathway proteins (Rnf41,
Usp8 and Stam1) to regulate the lysosomal degradation of the leptin receptor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-2050312118823585">128</xref></sup> As <italic>Magel2</italic> was found to regulate the stability of
Rnf41 and Usp8, the authors postulated that <italic>Magel2</italic> may
regulate the abundance of leptin receptors in the hypothalamus indirectly
through ubiquitination pathways. Together, these results indicate that
<italic>MAGEL2</italic> may regulate long-term energy homeostasis via
its interactions with leptin, and lack of expression for
<italic>MAGEL2</italic> may be the central mechanism for the obesity
characteristic to the phenotype of PWS.</p>

<p>The dysregulation of the homeostatic feeding mechanism in PWS. Neural
stimulation of neuropeptide Y (NPY)- and Agouti-like peptide
(AgRP)-expressing neurons promotes feeding in response to peripheral
signals of hunger, while neural stimulation of neurons expressing
pro-opiomelanocortin (Pomc) inhibits feeding in response to
peripheral signals of satiety. Long-term signals of energy balance
such as leptin induce a fasting response and limit food intake when
energy balance is favorable, preventing obesity. In PWS, lack of
expression for SNORD116 may lead to neuronal degeneration and
imbalance in the expression of AgRP and Pomc in the hypothalamus
leading to increase in feeding. Similarly, MAGEL2 has been shown to
be required for the leptin-mediated activation of Pomc-expressing
neurons as MAGEL2 regulates the abundance of leptin receptors
through ubiquitination pathways. Hence, both regulation of hunger
and satiety and long-term regulation of energy balance are disrupted
in Prader–Willi syndrome, leading to the impaired satiety and
obesity typical of the syndrome.</p>

<p>Several mouse model studies have suggested that the mechanism for the early
growth restrictions and late development of hyperphagia in PWS may be
dependent on the lack of expression for <italic>SNORD116 snoRNA.</italic>
Ding et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-2050312118823585">129</xref></sup> showed that mice with paternally inherited deletions of
<italic>Snord116</italic> develop normally in prenatal stages but show a
growth reduction at early ages, followed by the development of hyperphagia
at a later age. However, the model mice did not replicate the phenotype of
PWS in full; despite their hyperphagic condition, the model mice would stay
lean and showed altered metabolism, with higher rates of oxygen consumption
compared to control mice.</p>
<p>Several mouse model studies have addressed the role of
<italic>SNORD116</italic> in the development of hyperphagia in PWS with
partly contradicting results, but none of the mouse models have replicated
the full phenotype of hyperphagia and obesity in PWS. Qi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-2050312118823585">130</xref></sup> showed that lack of expression for <italic>Snord116</italic> may
alter the regulation of food intake via the NPY-expressing neurons in the
hypothalamus. Model mice with a selective deletion of
<italic>Snord116</italic> in the NPY-expressing neurons replicated the
phenotype of early growth restriction and late development of hyperphagia
closely. Thus, <italic>Snord116</italic> may be critical for regulating the
expression of <italic>Pomc</italic> and <italic>NPY</italic>, as the model
mice also showed a significant upregulation of both <italic>NPY</italic> and
<italic>Pomc</italic> mRNA in the hypothalamus. In particular, the
anorexigenic response of <italic>Pomc</italic>-expressing neurons was
hypothesized to play a role in the growth reductions at an early age, while
the drive for increased food intake induced by the NPY-expressing neurons
would take hold later in life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-2050312118823585">130</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, another recent mouse model study by Polex-Wolf et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-2050312118823585">131</xref></sup> contradicted the results of previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-2050312118823585">129</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-2050312118823585">130</xref></sup> as
the authors found that a mouse model with a paternal deletion of
<italic>Snord116</italic> did not develop hyperphagia at a later age.
However, mice with a selective deletion of <italic>Snord116</italic> in the
mediobasal hypothalamus induced at adult age showed the development of
hyperphagia 10 weeks after the procedure. The model mice also showed a
significantly greater weight gain in comparison to controls, though only a
small subset (5 out of 21) of the mice would develop significant obesity and
increased fat mass. However, the expression of <italic>Pomc, NPY</italic>
and leptin receptor mRNAs during a fast was not shown to be significantly
different from controls. Similarly, the expression of prohormone convertase
1 (<italic>Pcsk1</italic>) and its upstream regulator did not differ
significantly from controls, indicating that the increase in food intake
could not be explained by an imbalance in the homeostatic regulation of
feeding and that an alternative explanation for the mechanism of hyperphagia
would be required.</p>
<p>Although mouse model studies have implied that the lack of expression for
both <italic>SNORD116</italic> and <italic>MAGEL2</italic> may play roles in
the development of hyperphagia and obesity in PWS, the analysis of these
studies is complicated by a recent study which notes the paradoxical
leanness of model mice with a deletion of the PWS imprinting center. The
model mice showed an early reduction of growth and failure to thrive in
infancy, with later development of food hoarding behaviors. However,
significantly increased food intake as compared to controls would only
develop with model mice on high-fat diets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-2050312118823585">132</xref></sup> As shown in the results of Ding et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-2050312118823585">129</xref></sup> and Qi et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-2050312118823585">130</xref></sup> the model mice also showed a significant reduction in body weight and
fat mass. In further investigation, the model mice did not show an elevation
of white fat mass in a thermoneutral environment, indicating that increased
energy usage in maintaining body temperature is unlikely to cause the
leanness of PWS model mice. As the model mice similarly failed to gain
weight on a high-fat diet, the authors postulated that the leanness of the
model mice may result from a failure of lipid accumulation in white
adipocytes, which may further indicate that the model mice failed to model
the phenotype of PWS due to metabolic differences between humans and
mice.</p>
<p>In summary, mouse model studies have shown that the lack of expression for
<italic>MAGEL2</italic> may be connected to the development of obesity
due to dysregulation of leptin-induced anorexigenic responses in the
hypothalamus. Furthermore, while all of the currently reviewed mouse model
and human studies indicate that the development of hyperphagia in PWS is
associated with lack of expression for <italic>SNORD116</italic> in the

<title>A model for hypothalamic dysregulation of homeostatic feeding in
PWS</title>
<p>Currently available studies on both humans and mouse models suggest that the
hyperphagia typical to PWS results from a dysregulation of homeostatic
feeding in the hypothalamus. Based on these findings, we have developed a
model for the dysregulation of homeostatic feeding mechanisms in PWS. By
this model, peripheral signals of satiety and long-term energy balance are
produced at elevated levels, but the processing of these signals in the
hypothalamus is disrupted due to an imbalance in hypothalamic
neurotransmitters, ultimately due to the lack of expression for the
paternally expressed genes <italic>MAGEL2</italic> and
<italic>SNORD116</italic>.</p>
<p>First, we note that the regulation of long-term energy balance in the
hypothalamus is dependent on the anorexigenic response induced by leptin.
However, lack of expression for <italic>Magel2</italic> leads to
dysregulation in the ubiquitination of leptin receptors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-2050312118823585">129</xref></sup> so leptin fails to induce the fasting response in the hypothalamus
due to an accelerated turnover of leptin receptors at
<italic>Pomc</italic>-expressing neurons, contributing to both increase in
food intake and the development of obesity.</p>
<p>Second, <italic>SNORD116</italic> has been shown to be involved in the
regulation of food intake via the hypothalamus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-2050312118823585">130</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-2050312118823585">131</xref></sup> and transcriptional
analysis of hypothalamic tissues of PWS subjects suggests that the lack of
expression for <italic>SNORD116</italic> may alter the regulation of
neuronal development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-2050312118823585">123</xref></sup> leading to an imbalance in the regulation of the hypothalamic feeding
mechanism. The expression of <italic>AGRP</italic>, previously implied in
the regulation of hunger, is significantly upregulated in the hypothalamus,
while the expression of <italic>POMC</italic>, previously implied in the
regulation of satiety, is significantly downregulated. Thus, the impaired
satiety central to phenotype of eating behaviors in PWS may be induced by
continuous signaling of hunger and diminished signaling of satiety in the
hypothalamus.</p>
<p>As PWS involves a gradual transition from poor feeding in infancy to the
development of hyperphagia in late childhood, further research is necessary
to understand how a lack of expression for paternally expressed genes would
gradually alter the regulation of food intake from infancy to early
childhood and further from childhood to the juvenile phase. As the
development of hyperphagia coincides with early adrenarche, it has been
suggested that the changes in appetite may reflect changes in the expression
of adrenal androgens during childhood development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2050312118823585">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Mouse models on the role of palatability in food intake</title>
<p>In addition to the homeostatic mechanisms regulated by hunger and satiety,
appetite can also be driven by the reward circuitry of the brain. While
mouse model studies of PWS have focused primarily on the development of
hyperphagia and the mechanism of homeostatic feeding, the role of
palatability in the regulation of feeding behavior has been highlighted in a
number of mouse model studies.</p>
<p>Exploring the role of hedonic eating in PWS, Davies et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-2050312118823585">133</xref></sup> characterized the feeding behavior in a mouse model with a paternally
inherited deletion corresponding to the imprinting center of the PWS–AS
locus. The model mice showed significantly increased food consumption after
an overnight fast as compared to wild-type controls, with both regular chow
and high-sugar content food. In order to dissociate the impact of nutrition
and taste, the researchers studied the licking behavior. The mice were
accustomed and given limited access to a lick-measuring device which would
dispense sugared water or alternatively a solution with saccharin, an
artificial sweetener with no nutritional value. With sucrose, no significant
differences between the model mice and wild-type controls were found in
comparisons of repeated licking behavior. However, with saccharin, the model
mice showed a significant reduction in the number of total licks as compared
to wild-type controls. In addition, when trained with a treat-dispensing
device, the model mice again matched the behavior of the wild-type controls
with a sugar-based treat but showed a significant reduction in the number of
responses when rewarded with a saccharin-based treat instead. The authors
concluded that the PWS model mice appeared to be particularly sensitive to
the calorific content of palatable food, rather than taste, thus resembling
the lack of satiety and the tendency for unselective eating among PWS
subjects.</p>
<p>The role of dopamine in the development of food preferences has been shown in
a multitude of studies. For example, Cooper and Al-Naser<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-2050312118823585">134</xref></sup> found that dopamine may influence the development of preference for
palatable foods. Food intake of fasted rats was measured in experimental
settings, with comparisons based on the palatability of the food offered.
While highly palatable food was consistently consumed in greater amounts
compared to regular food pellets, treatment with a selective D1 dopamine
receptor agonist significantly increased the consumption of the palatable
food as compared to the control, while treatment with a selective D2/D3
dopamine receptor agonist significantly decreased the consumption of the
highly palatable food and increased the consumption of regular chow. Hence,
preference for highly palatable foods is at least partly driven by the
dopamine reward system.</p>
<p>The consumption of palatable foods thus shows a definite connection to the
dopamine reward system. Furthermore, opposite alterations to both dopamine
and serotonin neurochemistry have been shown in mouse models of both AS and
PWS. Farook et al. studied mice models with either duplications or deletions
of <italic>Ube3a</italic>. Mice with a maternally inherited deletion of
<italic>Ube3a</italic> resembling the genotype of AS had elevated levels
of dopamine in the striatum and frontal cortex and elevated levels of
serotonin in the striatum and cortex, as compared to controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-2050312118823585">86</xref></sup> Conversely, mice with a maternal duplication of
<italic>Ube3a</italic>, resembling the matUPD genotype of PWS, had
elevated levels of dopamine in the midbrain and the striatum. However,
Mercer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2050312118823585">87</xref></sup> showed that <italic>Magel2</italic>-null mice had significantly
decreased levels of serotonin in the cortex, prefrontal cortex and
hypothalamus as well as significantly decreased levels of dopamine in the
hypothalamus. Thus, studies of mice models indicate that AS may involve
highly elevated levels of dopamine in brain regions critical to feeding. In
contrast, PWS may involve decreased levels of dopamine in multiple brain
regions critical to feeding.</p>

<sec id="section32-2050312118823585">
<title>A model for the development of hyperphagia and food preferences in AS and
PWS</title>
<p>Considering the existing evidence from both empirical studies in AS and PWS
and findings from relevant mouse model studies, we have developed a model to
explain the development of hyperphagia and food preferences in both AS and
PWS. First, we assume that the hyperphagic condition of PWS is caused by
impaired satiety due to a disruption of the homeostatic feeding mechanism,
as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2050312118823585">Figure
5</xref>. Furthermore, we predict that PWS confers a consistent tendency for
unselective eating, as suggested by the mouse model study of Davies et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-2050312118823585">133</xref></sup> as well as the observation that PWS patients consistently choose
larger amounts of food regardless of preference in taste or delay in
presentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-2050312118823585">100</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-2050312118823585">101</xref></sup> Second, both
increased selectivity toward food and marked preferences for certain foods,
in particular foods with consistent and soft texture, are prominent in AS.
Thus, we have hypothesized that the hyperphagic phenotype of AS is connected
to an increased interest toward complementary foods. In contrast to the
unselective eating in PWS, this behavior can be hypothesized to be driven by
an influence of paternally expressed genes, as the hyperphagic phenotype of
AS is strongly associated to the patUPD genotype, which confers a higher
dosage of the paternally expressed genes in the 15q11-q13 chromosome region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2050312118823585">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>It can be predicted that complementary foods, which differ from adult diets
and could be more difficult to obtain and prepare, may involve increased
maternal costs. Paternally expressed genes may thus have been selected to
favor an increased preference for complementary foods and prolonged parental
care in juvenile stages, so a disruption of the genetic conflict could
further result in extreme behaviors such as overeating and limited
preferences for specific foods, as seen with the phenotypes of both AS and
autism.</p>
<p>To illustrate our hypothesis, we have developed a framework around hedonic
feeding mechanisms and the known alterations of dopamine neurochemistry in
AS and PWS, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-2050312118823585">Figure 6</xref>. First, food selectivity similar to ASD may contribute
to increased selectivity toward food across all genotypes. Second, both a
lack of expression for <italic>UBE3A</italic> and an increased dosage of
paternally expressed genes such as <italic>MAGEL2</italic> are expected to
contribute toward elevated levels of dopamine in the brain, so the more
paternal patUPD and imprinting defect genotypes of AS are expected to show
both elevated hedonic value of food and tendency for the development of
hyperphagia with selective eating. In contrast, all genotypes of PWS lack
expression of <italic>MAGEL2</italic>, so asymmetrical alterations to
hedonic feeding can be expected between AS and PWS, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-2050312118823585">Figure 6</xref>. However, the
exact mechanism of hyperphagia in AS does not need to depend on hedonic
feeding mechanisms to fulfill our initial expectations on the influence of
paternally expressed genes in the development of hyperphagia and selective
eating.</p>

<p>Currently available evidence on the timing of the development of hyperphagic
behavior in PWS indicates that the development of hyperphagia coincides
approximately with the timing of early adrenarche, as well as the
development of adult dentition and simultaneous transition toward an adult
diet of diverse family foods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-2050312118823585">77</xref></sup> While exact information on the timing of the development of
hyperphagia in AS is currently lacking, the rapid increase of BMI between 2
and 5 years of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-2050312118823585">93</xref></sup> suggests that the development of hyperphagic behavior in AS may
coincide with the usual period of dependence on complementary foods, which
are the primary source of nutrition for the child after weaning until the
development of mature dentition at the age of 6–8 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2050312118823585">78</xref></sup> Thus, we have further complemented our model with predictions on the
timing of the development of hyperphagia and food preferences in both AS and
PWS. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-2050312118823585">Figure

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, we have compared sleeping and eating behavior phenotypes of PWS and
AS and evaluated, for the phenotypes with sufficient data, which phenotypes are
opposite to one another and which are not. Furthermore, we have assessed these
behavioral phenotypes in the context of relevant mouse model studies and developed
genetic and physiological models for sleeping and eating behavior to help explain
how the different genetic alterations of these syndromes could produce opposite
phenotypes, especially from alterations to dosages of different imprinted genes.
Finally, we have evaluated our findings in the context of human childhood
development and the kinship theory of imprinting. Our main findings are as
follows:</p>
<p>First, relevant articles and our meta-analysis showed evidence of opposite phenotypes
for sleep onset latency between AS and PWS, and partially opposite phenotypes for
sleep duration, while other traits of interest showed relatively similar phenotypes
in both syndromes. As relevant mouse model studies have indicated that both
paternally and maternally expressed genes may regulate circadian rhythms and sleep,
we suggested a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2050312118823585">Figure
4</xref>) to explain how variable dosages of paternally and maternally expressed
genes inherent to each syndrome could produce opposite phenotypes of sleep onset
latency in AS and PWS. Thus, in PWS, both the increased expression of
<italic>UBE3A</italic> due to lack of expression for <italic>SNORD116</italic>
and a lack of expression for <italic>MAGEL2</italic> may contribute to a lack of
programmed delay and acceleration of the circadian period. In contrast, both a lack
of expression for <italic>UBE3A</italic> and the expression of
<italic>MAGEL2</italic> are expected to contribute to a deceleration of the
circadian period in AS. These opposite alterations to the circadian rhythm and
diurnally regulated gene expression patterns may lead to opposite alterations to the
timing of sleep onset as also shown in the results of the relevant studies reviewed
here. In AS, a lengthened circadian period may lead to a phase delay in the 24-h
circadian rhythm and a longer subjective day and increased sleep onset latency. In
PWS, the opposite pattern is shown, with a lack of programmed delay leading to a
shorter subjective day and reduced sleep latency.</p>
<p>Second, we describe evidence that that AS and PWS show a shared tendency for
overeating and food-seeking behaviors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2050312118823585">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2050312118823585">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-2050312118823585">93</xref></sup> but apparent opposite
tendencies for selective and unselective eating preferences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2050312118823585">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-2050312118823585">100</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-2050312118823585"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-2050312118823585">102</xref></sup> However, while the
hyperphagic phenotype of PWS is consistent across all genotypes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2050312118823585">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2050312118823585">88</xref></sup> in AS
hyperphagic phenotypes are strongly associated with the patUPD and imprinting defect
genotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-2050312118823585">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-2050312118823585">94</xref></sup> which are further characterized by increased dosages of
paternally expressed genes as also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2050312118823585">Figure 2</xref>. Since relevant human and mouse
model studies indicate that PWS may involve both a hypothalamic dysregulation of the
homeostatic feeding mechanism and diminished hedonic value of food due to lack of
expression for maternally imprinted genes, we have also suggested a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-2050312118823585">Figure 6</xref>) to explain how
selective versus unselective food preferences in AS and PWS, as well as the
association of hyperphagia with relatively “more paternal” genotypes in AS, may be
explained by opposite alterations to dopamine reward circuitry and hedonic feeding
mechanisms.</p>
<p>As human life history can be interpreted to involve a unique evolutionary adaptation
to shortened birth intervals with early weaning and the introduction of
complementary feeding with specially prepared “baby foods,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-2050312118823585">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2050312118823585">78</xref></sup> we hypothesize
that the development of hyperphagia and food selectivity in both AS and PWS may
reflect nutritional shifts in human childhood as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-2050312118823585">Figure 7</xref>. In AS, increased selectivity toward
foods may result from a prolonged interest in mother-provided complementary foods,
while hyperphagic behavior is driven by a further exaggeration of this interest.
Conversely, as described previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2050312118823585">12</xref></sup> PWS involves a gradual rise in interest toward food, leading to the
development of hyperphagia around the age of adrenarche, which coincides with a
transition from the mother-provided complementary foods to diverse family foods.
This hypothesis is readily testable, as it further predicts that the timing and
development of both selective food preferences and hyperphagia in AS should coincide
with the period of complementary feeding in early childhood.</p>
<p>Third, we have assessed how varying dosages of the paternally expressed
<italic>MAGEL2</italic> and <italic>SNORD116</italic> as well as the maternally
expressed <italic>UBE3A</italic> may affect phenotypes of both sleep and eating
behavior. Due to the wide-reaching roles of <italic>MAGEL2</italic> and
<italic>UBE3A</italic> in regulating numerous gene networks through
ubiquitination pathways,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-2050312118823585">135</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-2050312118823585">136</xref></sup> both <italic>UBE3A</italic> and <italic>MAGEL2</italic> may
affect several behavioral phenotypes including both the regulation of circadian
rhythms and the regulation of long-term energy balance and feeding through a variety
of different molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, <italic>UBE3A</italic> and
<italic>MAGEL2</italic> as well as <italic>SNORD116</italic> are expressed in
the same brain region, the hypothalamus. Numerous studies have indeed shown that the
hypothalamus plays a dual role in both sleep–wake regulation and the regulation of
feeding. For example, lesions of the NPY-expressing neurons in the mediobasal
hypothalamus have been shown to cause hyperphagia and a lack of circadian variation
for the distribution of non-REM sleep in mouse model studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-2050312118823585">137</xref></sup> and orexin neuropeptides expressed by neurons in the lateral hypothalamic
area play a role in the regulation of both sleep and eating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-2050312118823585">138</xref></sup> Lack of expression for <italic>SNORD116</italic> in the mediobasal
hypothalamus is also involved in the development of hyperphagia in PWS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-2050312118823585">129</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-2050312118823585"></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-2050312118823585">131</xref></sup> while a lack of expression
for <italic>Magel2</italic> has been connected to reduced levels of orexin and
orexin-expressing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, along with fragmentation in
circadian regulation of activity and rest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2050312118823585">73</xref></sup> as well as reductions in growth followed by later development of
obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-2050312118823585">126</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-2050312118823585">127</xref></sup></p>
<p>The role of the hypothalamus in the development of AS is currently understudied. As
alterations to the expression levels of <italic>MAGEL2, SNORD116</italic> and
<italic>UBE3A</italic> may affect the phenotypes of both eating and sleeping via
the hypothalamus, our hypothesis predicts that other human neurogenetic syndromes
that resemble AS or PWS phenotypically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-2050312118823585">139</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-2050312118823585">140</xref></sup> or result from alterations
to the same genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-2050312118823585">124</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-2050312118823585">136</xref></sup> may also exhibit joint effects on sleeping, eating and other
hypothalamus-mediated phenotypes.</p>
<p>The opposite alterations to sleep onset latency described here can be interpreted to
follow from extreme manifestations of paternally and maternally expressed genes, as
also previously discussed by Kotler and Haig.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2050312118823585">78</xref></sup> Since settling to sleep often involves separation of the mother and the
infant, bedtime can be seen as an important time for maternal bonding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-2050312118823585">141</xref></sup> Furthermore, as the behavioral phenotype of AS has been argued to reflect an
extreme development of phenotypes related to affect signaling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2050312118823585">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2050312118823585">17</xref></sup> paternally
expressed genes may have been selected to favor increased bedtime resistance and
more frequent waking in solicitation of both nutrition and social interaction from
the mother, which may also lead to increased sleep onset latency and difficulties in
falling asleep later in life. In contrast, maternally expressed genes may have been
selected to favor reduced bedtime resistance and less frequent waking to reduce
maternal stress during early infancy, which may further lead to a consistent
tendency for reduced sleep onset latency and excessive sleepiness in later life.</p>
