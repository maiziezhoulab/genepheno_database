<abstract>
<p>Mutations in the genes encoding for voltage-gated sodium channels cause profound sensory disturbances and other symptoms dependent on the distribution of a particular channel subtype in different organs. Humans with the gain-of-function mutation <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Leu811Pro</italic> in <italic>SCN11A</italic> (encoding for the voltage-gated Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 channel) exhibit congenital insensitivity to pain, pruritus, self-inflicted injuries, slow healing wounds, muscle weakness, Charcot-like arthropathies, and intestinal dysmotility. As already shown, knock-in mice (<italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup>) carrying the orthologous mutation <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Leu799Pro</italic> replicate reduced pain sensitivity and show frequent tissue lesions. In the present study we explored whether <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice develop also pruritus, muscle weakness, and changes in gastrointestinal transit time. Furthermore, we analyzed morphological and functional differences in nerves, skeletal muscle, joints and small intestine from <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> and <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> wild type mice. Compared to <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice, <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice showed enhanced scratching bouts before skin lesions developed, indicating pruritus. <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice exhibited reduced grip strength, but no disturbances in motor coordination. Skeletal muscle fiber types and joint architecture were unaltered in <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice. Their gastrointestinal transit time was unaltered. The small intestine from <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> showed a small shift towards less frequent peristaltic movements. Similar proportions of lumbar dorsal root ganglion neurons from <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> and <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice were calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP-) positive, but isolated sciatic nerves from <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice exhibited a significant reduction of the capsaicin-evoked release of CGRP indicating reduced neurogenic inflammation. These data indicate important Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 channel functions in several organs in both humans and mice. They support the pathophysiological relevance of increased basal activity of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 channels for sensory abnormalities (pain and itch) and suggest resulting malfunctions of the motor system and of the gastrointestinal tract. <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice are suitable to investigate the role of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9, and to explore the pathophysiological changes and mechanisms which develop as a consequence of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 hyperactivity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Essential body functions depend on ion channels such as voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC). VGSC produce action potentials in neurons, and regulate neuronal excitability. Since there are several VGSC isoforms (Na<sub>V</sub>1.1-Na<sub>V</sub>1.9) the functional significance of each isoform needs to be established. Important contributions to the understanding of VGSC functions are provided by the detection of genetic variants of VGSC and their related dysfunctions in humans (channelopathies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref002">2</xref>]. Leipold et al. and Woods et al. identified in three young individuals a gain-of-function mutation (<italic>p</italic>.<italic>Leu811Pro</italic>) in <italic>SCN11A</italic>, the gene that encodes for Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref004">4</xref>]. A corresponding case was reported by Salvatierra et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref005">5</xref>]. Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 is preferentially expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (including functionally identified nociceptors), trigeminal neurons and intrinsic myenteric neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref006">6</xref>]. Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 has also been reported in hair cells of the auditory and vestibular system, in the retina and in layer V of the medial prefrontal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref007">7</xref>]. In general, Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 acts as a threshold channel by contributing a sodium conductance that regulates resting potentials and prolongs the depolarizing response to subthreshold stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Humans with the gain-of-function mutation <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Leu811Pro</italic> in <italic>SCN11A</italic> (detected by Leipold et al. and Woods et al. in unrelated patients, 8–13 years old) show congenital insensitivity to pain, pruritus, self-inflicted injuries, slow healing wounds, intestinal dysmotility, mild muscle weakness, Charcot-like arthropathies and further disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref004">4</xref>] suggesting that Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 is functionally important in several organs. The patient reported by Salvatierra et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref005">5</xref>] displayed similar symptoms, in particular severe pruritus, a partial loss-of pain sensation, fractures with little trauma, constipation and intermittent diarrhea, heterotrophic ossification, and some others. The gain-of-function mutation <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Leu811Pro</italic> in <italic>SCN11A</italic> was observed in female and male patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref005">5</xref>]. In order to characterize the biophysics of this channelopathy, knock-in mice (<italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup>) carrying the orthologous mutation <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Leu799Pro</italic> were generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref005">5</xref>]. Such mice also allow to investigate the importance of Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 in different body functions and to explore whether Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 is similarly involved across different species. In biophysical experiments it was shown that the <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Leu811Pro</italic> alteration increases the basal activity of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 channels, causing an excess sodium ion influx at rest and subsequent cell depolarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref003">3</xref>]. As a consequence, other voltage-gated sodium channels such as Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 and voltage-gated calcium ion channels (they form the main constituents of the action potential in DRG neurons) may undergo progressive inactivation, resulting in impaired generation of action potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice frequently show tissue lesions, and in tail-flick experiments they exhibit a significantly higher threshold for noxious heat stimuli than wild-type littermates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref003">3</xref>]. Under basal conditions, the withdrawal threshold for plantar mechanical and thermal stimulation did not differ between genotypes, but after zymosan-induced inflammation <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice showed a smaller reduction in the withdrawal threshold and less protective behavior (guarding), indicating less thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref003">3</xref>]. Since the excess sodium ion influx at rest and subsequent cell depolarization may cause progressive inactivation (see above), impaired generation of action potentials may explain why pain perception is impaired although the activation of the normal Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 channel is rather involved in increased pain perception (hyperexcitability) during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The present study had several aims. First, we explored whether <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice exhibit pruritus, changes in motor performance, changes in skeletal muscles and joints, and disturbances in intestinal dysmotility. Such symptoms would indicate an involvement of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 in organic functions in mice similar as in humans, and they would indicate that excess sodium ion influx through Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 is pathophysiologically relevant in different tissues. Second we studied whether nerves from <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice exhibit abnormalities in their secretory function. We quantified the proportion of calcitonin gene-related peptide- (CGRP-) positive DRG neurons, and measured the release of CGRP from peripheral nerves upon stimulation with capsaicin because CGRP was implicated in injury, neurogenic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref008">8</xref>], wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref011">11</xref>], pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref012">12</xref>], and itch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref013">13</xref>]. We found that <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice exhibit similar functional disturbances as humans with the <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Leu799Pro</italic> mutation suggesting comparable functional importance of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 across species. Furthermore, we found a significant deficit of the sciatic nerve to release CGRP suggesting that the reduction of CGRP release may be involved in the pathophysiological consequences of the mutation.</p>

<p>Mice were age-matched for each experiment but within the age group mice were not selected regarding sex. All tests were performed and analyzed with the experimenter blinded to genotype. All animals were bred and maintained under the same specific pathogen-free conditions by the Animal Facility of the University Hospital Jena. All experiments on animals were performed according to the Tierschutzgesetz der Bundesrepublik Deutschland and were approved by the Thuringian Government (Thüringer Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz).

<title>Quantitative analysis of scratching and grooming behavior</title>
<p>Both hindlimb scratching bouts and forelimb grooming chains were counted between 9 am and 3 pm as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref015">15</xref>]. Briefly, mice free of skin lesions were placed separately in the observation tubes (diameter: 9 cm; height: 20 cm) on a grid to get acclimatized for 20 min. Then, mice were video-recorded from a front view for 30 min. Afterwards the total number of scratching bouts and grooming chains were counted. A bout of scratching was defined as a continuous fast scratching, not wiping or stroking, movement of a hind paw directed toward the neck area. A bout ended when the mouse either licked its hind paw or placed it back on the grid. Single bouts are identified by a break of at least 5 sec. A grooming chain consists of 4 phases of wiping, stroking and body licking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref015">15</xref>] and was counted respectively. Each mouse was tested three times. The first testing was performed in order to render the mouse familiar with the testing situation. After three and five days the mouse was tested again and the values were taken for analysis.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemical labeling for CGRP in DRG sections</title>
<p>Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from segments L1-5 from both sides were excised separately, fixed at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 μm sections which were dewaxed and autoclaved for 15 min (120°C, 1 bar). For CGRP labeling we applied overnight at 4°C a mouse reactive anti-CGRP antibody (1:100; polyclonal against a synthetic rat Tyr-CGRP(23–37) conjugated to gamma globulin developed in goat; Cat.No BP022, Acris antibodies, Herford, Germany; RRID:AB_973533). Sections were incubated for 2 hours in biotinylated rabbit anti-goat antibody (1:200; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), then the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (Vectastatin-Elite ABC Kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, USA) was applied for 40 min. Sections were developed with Jenchrom px blue (JenLab, Jena, Germany). The immunohistochemical labeling was evaluated as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref016">16</xref>]. In each second section the proportion of neuronal profiles with CGRP-like immunoreactivity (IR) was determined using a light microscope coupled to an image analyzing system (AxioVision, Zeiss).

The epi-perineurium was widened under a binocular microscope, and then the nerves were washed separately in 1 ml carbogen-gassed (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) synthetic interstitial fluid (SIF, in mM: 107.8 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 0.7 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 26.2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.7 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 9.6 sodium gluconate, 5.6 glucose, 7.6 sucrose; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref018">18</xref>]), pH 7.4 at 32 °C, for 30 min. Thereafter the nerves were incubated for 5 min in 150 μl SIF in the first test tube to obtain a baseline, and then they were forwarded to the second test tube and so forth (all steps with a volume of 150 μl SIF at 32 °C). For stimulation we used capsaicin (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), dissolved in ethanol and freshly diluted with SIF to 1 μM, 0.1 μM and 0.01 μM respectively. The samples were supplemented with 5-fold concentrated CGRP ELISA buffer (bertin pharma, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France) and immediately stored at -20 °C.

<p>Spontaneous mechanical activity of the intestine was measured in isolated segments of the intestine of freshly sacrificed mice as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref020">20</xref>]. Briefly, after decapitation, the duodenum from adult mice was immediately removed and placed in Krebs buffer composed of (in mM): 120 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>x7H<sub>2</sub>O, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>x2H<sub>2</sub>O, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 D-Glucose; gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4. Short pieces (2–3 cm) of the intestine were prepared and transferred to an interface recording chamber and perfused with oxygenated Krebs solution (2–3 ml/min) at 34°C. Extracellular field potentials were recorded using glass microelectrodes (impedance 2–3 MΩ) from the Tunica muscularis. Electrodes were filled with Krebs solution. Data of field potential recordings were collected with an extracellular amplifier (EXT-02, NPI electronic, Tamm, Germany), low pass filtered at 4 kHz and digitally stored with a sample frequency of 10 kHz. Analysis of field potential recordings was performed using the software “Signal” (Cambridge Electronic Design, UK).</p>

<title>Quantitative gait analysis</title>
<p>Initially, mice were trained to walk on a horizontal plastic beam (1000 mm long, 38 mm broad) leading to their home cage. After the learning phase one beam-walking trial was digital video-recorded from a rear view for each animal. The video sequences were analyzed to select single frames in which the mice were seen in phases of the gait cycle, meeting the criteria for measurements as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref021">21</xref>]. Measurements of the foot-base-angle at toe-off positions of the hind-paws were performed with the ImageJ 1.50b program (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, USA).

<p>Evaluation of skilled walking, indicating quantitative evaluation of complex motor behavior, was performed by the ladder-climbing test as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref022">22</xref>]. The ladder (length: 100 cm; rung distance: 2 cm; rung thickness: 2 mm; rung width: 6 cm) was fixed in an inclined position (45°) and each single mouse was placed at the bottom rungs of the ladder. Climbing was video recorded from a front view. The numbers of correct steps (correct placing of the hind paw and sustained position until the next forward move) and of missteps from two trials were counted, evaluated qualitatively and the mean was displayed.

The weights are 2.8, 9.2, 15.4, 19, 34.2, 42.5, 50, 60.4, 73, 86.5 and 103 g. Each mouse is held by the middle of the tail and lowered to allow it to grasp the first weight which is lying on the laboratory bench with its forepaws. As it grasps the weight the mouse is raised until the weight is clear of the bench. If the mouse holds the weight two times for three seconds the next heaviest weight will be applied after a break of at least 15 min. If the mouse fails the trial is terminated and the maximum weight is documented. Each mouse was tested at two different days and the mean value of two testings was obtained from each mouse.</p>

<p>Gastrointestinal transit time (GITT) was monitored over a time span of 24 h after force-feeding with an inert transit marker (spores of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>). Feces were collected after 3, 6, 9, 15 and 24 h and GITT was calculated for each time point. We did neither observe significant differences in GITT at individual time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237101.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), nor in the mean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237101.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) between both genotypes of mature mice (4–7 months old). Because <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice showed a slight decrease in the mean GITT we also analyzed intestinal peristaltic ex vivo. Representative field potential recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237101.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) and power spectra of field potential recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237101.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) of isolated segments of the Tunica muscularis of the small intestine indicate a slight shift towards less frequent spontaneous peristaltic events in <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice.</p>

<title>Quantification of grip strength and muscle fiber composition</title>
<p>Maximum forelimb grip strength was quantified with single weights in a range between 2.8 and 103 g. We found a significant decrease in grip strength (by ~38%) in middle aged (9–10 months) <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice compared to <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237101.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

Notably both groups of mice did not differ in their physical constitution shown on the basis of the body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237101.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). To analyze whether this decrease in grip strength of middle aged <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice is reflected in an alteration of muscle fiber composition we stained slow (type 1) muscle fibers in cross sections of the forelimb and in the separated Musculus tibialis cranialis. Muscle fiber typing was performed 5 weeks after quantification of grip strength and revealed no significant differences in the content of slow muscle fibers between both genotypes for Musculus tibialis cranialis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237101.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237101.g004">Fig 4D–4G</xref> show representative images of fiber staining of muscle fibers with an antibody for slow skeletal myosin heavy chain in which few muscle fibers are labeled. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237101.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref> display areas from the forelimb (for whole section see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237101.s003">S1 Fig</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237101.g004">Fig 4F and 4G</xref> show areas of the Musculus tibialis cranialis.</p>

<p>To evaluate motor function two tests were performed.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study yielded several salient findings. First, similar as humans with the rare gain-of-function mutation <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Leu811Pro</italic> in <italic>SCN11A</italic>, <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice show significant changes in several organs with similar manifestations. These findings indicate important Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 channel functions in several organs across different species. Second, the data strongly support the pathophysiological relevance of increased basal activity of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 channels for (altered) sensory experiences (pain and itch) as well as for some malfunctions of the motor system and of the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>The previous analysis of pain behavior of <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice had already shown that Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 channels with increased basal activity decrease pain sensitivity which may correspond to congenital insensitivity to pain in the human <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Leu811Pro</italic> mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref003">3</xref>]. Since the <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice developed with time also enhanced scratching we conclude that they began to experience pruritus, reminiscent of pruritus in patients with the <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Leu811Pro</italic> mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref003">3</xref>]. It is noteworthy that this sensory abnormality was not observed in younger, adult mice but only in mice at the middle age (9–12 months). Importantly, scratching was observed before skin lesions became visible, suggesting that skin lesions may develop as a consequence of enhanced scratching (possibly also favored by pain insensitivity). Scratching does not seem to be the expression of a general neurologic disorder because grooming behavior was normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Our data support that Na<sub>v</sub> channels are involved in itch sensation. Paroxysmal itch was found in a gain-of-function mutation in <italic>SCN9A</italic> (coding for Na<sub>v</sub>1.7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref028">28</xref>], and in a gain-of-function Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 mutation in <italic>SCN10A</italic> (coding for Na<sub>v</sub>1.8) in painful neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref029">29</xref>]. In Na<sub>V</sub>1.9<sup>-/-</sup> mice Salvatierra et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref005">5</xref>] showed a strong reduction in acute scratching to the pruritogens histamine, CQ (a MrgprA3 activator) and BAM8-22 (MrgprC11 activator). Furthermore, their <italic>Na</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub><italic>1</italic>.<italic>9</italic><sup><italic>L799P/WT</italic></sup> mice generated by using a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to introduce the mutation into a N-terminal sfGFP (superfolder green fluorescent protein)-tagged Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 mouse line, showed increased spontaneous scratching which was attributed to a hyperexcitability of MrgprA3<sup>+</sup> neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>The most interesting observation of enhanced scratching in the <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice is that it is combined with impaired pain perception. Leipold et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref003">3</xref>] explained the impaired pain perception in <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice as the consequence of a process in which increased activation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 channels causes a progressive inactivation of neurons. If one assumes that the processing of pain- and itch-evoking stimuli in sensory neurons is similar, it is difficult to understand why hyperactivity of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 channels and progressive neuronal inactivation causes a reduction of pain perception but an increase of itch perception. In line with Leipold et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref003">3</xref>], Salvatierra et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref005">5</xref>] found that most MrgprA3 neurons from <italic>Na</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub><italic>1</italic>.<italic>9</italic><sup><italic>L77P/WT</italic></sup> mice were unable to fire action potentials even in response to large current injections. But a subset of MrgprA3<sup>+</sup> neurons with depolarized resting membrane potentials could still fire action potentials in response to small current injections, and they suggested that this small subset of neurons may contribute to spontaneous itch seen in <italic>Na</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub><italic>1</italic>.<italic>9</italic><sup><italic>L77P/WT</italic></sup> mice and human patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref005">5</xref>]. It seems to be necessary to investigate the encoding of both noxious and pruritogenic stimuli in sensory neurons of <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice in suitable preparations such as a skin-nerve preparation in order to find out whether both reduced pain perception and enhanced itch sensation can be explained by the functional Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 abnormality in primary afferents or whether complex interactions between different sensory neurons and between sensory neurons and circuits in the central nervous system must be considered important. Compared to wild-type <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> littermates, <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice do not exhibit obvious morphological alterations of sensory nerves, and they show a regular innervation of the epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref003">3</xref>]. Here we show in addition that the proportion of CGRP-positive DRG neurons was not different in <italic>Scn11</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice. Their size distribution and grey intensity was similar in both genotypes.</p>
<p>A second salient finding of our study is that nerves from <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice showed a significant reduction of the capsaicin-evoked release of CGRP although the proportion of CGRP-positive DRG neurons was unaltered in <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice. CGRP which is released from peptidergic unmyelinated and thinly myelinated sensory neurons upon stimulation, has been implicated in injury, neurogenic inflammation, pain, and itch. CGRP is a potent vasodilator, it is involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells and synergizes with substance P for mast cell degranulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref008">8</xref>]. CGRP enhances wound healing by direct stimulation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref010">10</xref>]. Furthermore CGRP knock-out mice exhibited deficient wound closure compared to wild-type controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref020">20</xref>]. CGRP also contributes to activation of sensory neurons. E.g. CGRP enhances TTX-resistant sodium currents in cultured rat dorsal ganglion neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref012">12</xref>]. CGRP has been implicated in itch because ablation of CGRP-expressing sensory neurons reduced pruritogen-evoked itch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref013">13</xref>]. Chronic itch can also occur in the context of neurogenic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref030">30</xref>]. The reduction of the release of CGRP may be strongly involved in some abnormalities observed in <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice, e.g. slow-healing wounds and reduced pain sensitivity, but it is unlikely, that CGRP is directly involved in the generation of itch because then the CGRP release should be increased. An insufficient activation of calcium ion channels in <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> neurons may be the reason for reduced CGRP release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Na<sub>v</sub> channels are also important in the motor system. Most prominent in skeletal muscle is Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 which carries almost all of the inward Na<sup>+</sup> currents of action potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref031">31</xref>]. Both Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 are expressed in sensory neurons mediating the exercise pressor reflex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref033">33</xref>]. In spinal cord motoneurons Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 activity was linked to axon growth and axonal regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref034">34</xref>]. The present study shows that <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice exhibit a significant decrease in grip strength. Compared to <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice, the <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice did not exhibit alterations in muscle fiber composition suggesting that reduction of grip strength is neuronally mediated. Interestingly, the fiber composition of skeletal muscle in mice is substantially different to those in humans. Mouse forelimb muscles are predominantly composed of the fast (type 2) myosin heavy chain isoforms and the slow (type 1) isoform only constitutes &lt;6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref035">35</xref>]. This may preclude direct comparison to humans carrying the gain-of-function mutation <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Leu811Pro</italic> but reduced grip strength may correspond to mild muscle weakness complained by the humans with the Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 variant <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Leu811Pro</italic>. From our histological examination of joints it is unlikely that structural joint abnormalities (observed as Charcot-like arthropathies in humans) contribute to the changes of motor performance.</p>
<p>Finally, we studied gastrointestinal motility because Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 is expressed in myenteric sensory neurons and in neurons of the colonic migrating motor complex (CMMC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref036">36</xref>]. The CMMC is a major pattern of spontaneous contractile activity and Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 null mice exhibit a higher frequency but shorter duration of CMMCs compared to wild-type controls. This phenotype of Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 null mice is connected to an increased excitability of myenteric neurons since Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 regulates cellular depolarization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0237101.ref036">36</xref>]. We did not find significant differences of gastrointestinal transit time (GITT) between <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice but measurement of peristalsis in vitro revealed a slight shift towards less frequent spontaneous peristaltic events in <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice. This may correspond to intestinal dysmotility observed in humans with the Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 variant <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Leu799Pro</italic>.</p>
<p>In summary, <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice show significant changes similar to those in the rare human <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Leu811Pro</italic> mutation, indicating important Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 channel functions in several organs across different species. The data support the pathophysiological relevance of increased basal activity of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 channels for sensory abnormalities (pain and itch) and suggest resulting malfunctions of the motor system and of the gastrointestinal tract. <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice are suitable to investigate the role of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9, and to explore the pathophysiological changes and mechanisms which develop as a consequence of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 hyperactivity in man.</p>
<p>The present study has several limitations. First, female mice were underrepresented in some experimental groups so that sex differences may have been unrecognized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237101.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Since the gain-of-function mutation <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Leu811Pro</italic> in <italic>SCN11A</italic> was observed in male and female patients and since previous studies on the mice with the orthologous mutation <italic>p</italic>.<italic>Leu799Pro</italic> did not separately analyse male and female mice, we did neither plan for sex-specific analysis throughout the study nor select mice regarding sex. Second, not all measurements were performed in middle aged mice. Only during the ongoing study it turned out that some differences develop later in life. This was unexpected since the human mutation shows its phenotype at the young age and since the pain phenotype of <italic>Scn11a</italic><sup><italic>+/L799P</italic></sup> mice is also present at a young age. For ethical reasons the observation time had to be limited to the life span before severe skin lesions developed.</p>
