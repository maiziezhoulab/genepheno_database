<p>Mutations within the <italic>Shank3</italic> gene, which encodes a key postsynaptic density (PSD) protein at glutamatergic synapses, contribute to the genetic etiology of defined autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), including Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) and intellectual disabilities (ID). Although there are a series of genetic mouse models to study <italic>Shank3</italic> gene in ASDs, there are few rat models with species-specific advantages. In this study, we established and characterized a novel rat model with a deletion spanning exons 11–21 of <italic>Shank3</italic>, leading to a complete loss of the major SHANK3 isoforms. Synaptic function and plasticity of <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats were impaired detected by biochemical and electrophysiological analyses. <italic>Shank3</italic>-depleted rats showed impaired social memory but not impaired social interaction behaviors. In addition, impaired learning and memory, increased anxiety-like behavior, increased mechanical pain threshold and decreased thermal sensation were observed in <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats. It is worth to note that <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats had nearly normal levels of the endogenous social neurohormones oxytocin (OXT) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP). This new rat model will help to further investigate the etiology and assess potential therapeutic target and strategy for <italic>Shank3</italic>-related neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The <italic>Shank3</italic> gene is a member of the <italic>Shank</italic> gene family and encodes the SHANK3 protein, a key postsynaptic density (PSD) molecule at glutamatergic synapses (Naisbitt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">1999</xref>). SHANK3 is a scaffolding protein that interacts directly or indirectly with multiple glutamate receptors and the actin cytoskeleton critical for normal synaptic function and contains several specific protein domains, including an ANK (ankyrin repeats) domain, a SH3 (Src homology 3) domain, a PDZ (PSD95/Discs large/zona-occludens-1) domain, a proline-rich domain containing Homer binding regions and a SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain (Boeckers et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">1999</xref>; Baron et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2006</xref>; Boeckers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2006</xref>; Grabrucker et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Mutations within the <italic>Shank3</italic> gene are known to cause autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), which are characterized by impaired social interaction, communication skills and repetitive or restricted interests and behaviors. Haploinsufficiency of <italic>Shank3</italic> caused by a deletion or mutation accounts for up to 0.69% of autistic patients (Leblond et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2014</xref>). A specific form of a <italic>Shank3</italic>-dependent developmental disorder is Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), which is also known as 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, with a deletion or single mutation in one copy of the <italic>Shank3</italic> gene (Wilson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2003</xref>). PMS is characterized by intellectual disability (ID), developmental delays, absent or delayed speech, neonatal hypotonia and motor impairments, and autism or autistic-like behaviors are present in more than 80% of PMS patients (Soorya et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2013</xref>). Notably, many forms of ASDs present comorbidities, including ID (Polyak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2015</xref>), attention deficits, hyperactivity (ADHD), anxiety (Croen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2015</xref>), sensory-perceptual anomalies, pain insensitivity or self-injurious behaviors (Allely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2013</xref>). In this respect, <italic>Shank3</italic> mutations play a key role in ID and cognitive impairments; for example, 1.7% of Chinese unexplained ID patients have 22q13 deletions (Gong et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2012</xref>). To further understand the etiology, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms and potential novel therapeutics, <italic>Shank3</italic>-related animal models need to be established and characterized.</p>
<p>Because of available and convenient genetic technologies, genetically modified mouse models are widely used despite several limitations of the species. To date, a series of mouse strains with <italic>Shank3</italic> deletions of different exons (Δe4–7, Δe4–9, Δe13–16, Δe9, Δe11, and Δe21) and a <italic>Shank3</italic> complete knockout mouse model have been established (Bozdagi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2010</xref>; Bangash et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2011</xref>; Peca et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2011</xref>; Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2016</xref>; Schmeisser et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2012</xref>; Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2012</xref>; Kouser et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2013</xref>; Duffney et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2015</xref>; Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2015</xref>). As expected, the <italic>Shank3</italic> mutation has been proven to affect synaptic proteins, synaptic morphology and related function in these <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient mouse models. Most of these mice have been shown to have autistic-like behaviors, including impaired social and communication behaviors, increased repetitive behavior, and other phenotypes related to comorbidities, including anxiety behavior, deficits in learning and memory, impaired motor coordination ability and so on (Bozdagi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2010</xref>; Bangash et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2011</xref>; Peca et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2011</xref>; Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2011</xref>; Schmeisser et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2012</xref>; Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2012</xref>; Kouser et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2013</xref>; Duffney et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2015</xref>; Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2015</xref>; Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2016</xref>). With some species-specific advantages compared to mouse models, genetically modified rat models make it possible to perform more complex and broader behavioral tests and to investigate related mechanisms in more precise brain regions of the larger brain. In addition, for pharmacological investigations and drug testing, rats are the prototypical animal model. However, to the best of our knowledge, only one <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rat model has been reported with impaired social memory and deficits in attention (Harony-Nicolas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2017</xref>). In this study, a deletion was introduced in exon 6, which led to the disruption of the isoform-specific expression of SHANK3 (Harony-Nicolas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2017</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rat model showed normal social interaction and self-grooming behaviors, which is different from those of <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient mouse models. Therefore, more <italic>Shank3</italic> genetically modified rat models carrying different mutations need to be established and characterized, which may help to more comprehensively understand <italic>Shank3</italic> function, species-specific phenotype differences and the phenotypical diversity of clinical manifestations observed by clinicians and researchers; additionally, an animal model with a complete <italic>Shank3</italic> deletion can mimic the majority of patients carrying deletions of the entire <italic>Shank3</italic> gene in PMS (Soorya et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Oxytocin (OXT) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) are two neuropeptides synthesized in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and are related to social interaction, social memory and anxiety in mammals (Harony and Wagner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2010</xref>). Acute OXT treatment could improve impaired long-term social memory and nonsocial attention deficits in the <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rat model (Harony-Nicolas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2017</xref>). Similar to the impact of OXT on this <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats, the facilitation effect of OXT and AVP on social behavior has been observed in normal mice and rats (Lukas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2011</xref>), low socially interacting rats (Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2015</xref>) and some genetic animal models (Jin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2007</xref>; Gigliucci et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2014</xref>; Penagarikano et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2015</xref>). Interestingly, an impaired OXT/AVP system has been reported in autistic patients (Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">2016</xref>) and some autistic animal models (Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">2017</xref>); however, thus far, we know little about the endogenous OXT/AVP system in <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient animal models.</p>
<p>In our present study, we established and characterized a novel rat model with a complete <italic>Shank3</italic> deletion, which adds to the existing <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rat model and can be compared with other <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient animal models. It can also further help to understand the etiology and assess potential therapeutics of related neurodevelopmental disorders based on rat-specific advantages.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="s2-1">
<title>Generation of <italic>Shank3</italic> Knockout Rats</title>
<p>The <italic>Shank3</italic> knockout rat, in which the <italic>Shank3</italic> gene has been deleted from exon 11 to exon 21, was generated by the introduction of two sgRNAs with Cas9 to induce repair of the resultant two DSBs by NHEJ with a deletion of the intervening DNA sequence (Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">2013</xref>). Briefly, two sgRNAs were designed to target a region upstream of exon 11 or downstream of exon 21 of <italic>Shank3</italic>. For each targeting site, candidate guide RNAs were designed by the CRISPR design tool<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0001"><sup>1</sup></xref> and screened for on-target activity. Then, the Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAs were transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> using the MEGAshortscript T7 Transcription kit (AM1354, Invitrogen) and purified using the MEGAclear Transcription Clean-Up kit (AM1908, Invitrogen). Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat strains were used as embryo donors and pseudopregnant foster mothers. Superovulated female SD rats mated with SD stud males, and fertilized embryos were collected from the ampullae of the superovulated female SD rats. Different concentrations of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAs were mixed and coinjected into the cytoplasm of one-cell stage fertilized eggs. After injection, surviving zygotes were transferred into oviducts of SD females to generate chimeras. Finally, positive SD founder rats mated to produce F1 heterozygous breeder pairs carrying approximately 26 kb deletions with the removal of the <italic>Shank3</italic> exon 11–21. The generation of <italic>Shank3</italic> knockout rats was conducted by Beijing Biocytogen Co. Ltd., Beijing, China.</p>
<p>Genotypes were determined by PCR of rat tail DNA using the primers F1 (CTGTTGGCTGAGCCTGGCATAGAG) and R1 (GCTGGAAAGAAACAACGAGAGCCAG) for the WT allele (559 base pairs) and the primers F2 (TTGTGCACTGCCTATGTTGACCACT) and R2 (TAGGCGAGAGAAGATGGTGTGATTTCC) for the mutant allele (688 base pairs).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-2">
<title>Animal Husbandry and Care</title>
<p>Male SD rats from heterozygous breeder pairs were used in all experiments. The rats were housed 3–5 per cage and maintained on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle (light on at 07:00 AM) with free access to food and water. All animal experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Peking University (ethics approval ID, LA2015204) and in accordance with the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-3">
<title>Behavior Test</title>
<p>For all behavior tests, all genotypes were tested on the same day in a randomized order. Five- to six-week-old male rats were used for behavior testing unless otherwise stated. To minimize the impacts of repeated testing and handling, no more than four behavioral tests were performed in each cohort of rats.</p>
<sec id="s2-3-1">
<title>Developmental Milestones</title>
<p>The rats were tested for developmental milestones from postnatal day (PND) 2 to 21. The parameters of physical developmental milestones included body weight, pinna detachment, incisor eruption and eye-opening. For each genotype, the number of pups that achieved these developmental goals were recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-3-2">
<title>Pup Separation-Induced Ultrasonic Vocalizations Test</title>
<p>A pup separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) test was performed on PND7 as previously described (Xu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2015</xref>). Briefly, a pup was randomly chosen and was gently removed from the home cage and then transported to a clear plastic chamber (39 cm × 25 cm × 20 cm) on a heating pad (37°C) in a separate room. For each pup, the USVs were collected for 5 min by a condenser microphone (CM16/CMPA, Avisoft Bioacoustics, Germany) suspended approximately 25 cm above the base of the chamber with an amplifier (AUSG-116H, Avisoft Bioacoustics, Germany) set at a sampling rate of 250 kHz. After recording, the sound files were transferred to the sound analysis software SASLab Pro (Avisoft Bioacoustics, Germany) for fast Fourier transform with a 125 kHz low-pass filter. The classification algorithm of USVs was set as previously described (Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2011</xref>). The number and duration of each type of USVs were analyzed.</p>

<title>Juvenile Reciprocal Social Interaction Test</title>
<p>A juvenile reciprocal social interaction test was performed on PND 24–26 during the dark period of the light cycle under dim red illumination. Juvenile rats were habituated to the test arena (39 cm × 25 cm × 20 cm) for 15 min, and then an unfamiliar, age-matched, same-sex partner was introduced. The subject rat and the partner were allowed to move freely and videotaped for 10 min. The amount of time of total interactions was analyzed by a highly trained observer blinded to the genotype according to the parameters of social behaviors as previously described (Vanderschuren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">1995a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">b</xref>).</p>

<title>Three-Chamber Test</title>
<p>A three-chamber test was performed on PND 35–42 during the dark period under dim red illumination. The apparatus using for testing was a rectangular, Plexiglas box divided into three chambers (40 cm × 34 cm × 24 cm), with the side chambers each connected to the middle chamber by a corridor (10 cm × 10 cm × 15 cm). The test consisted of three phases, named the adaptive phase, phase 1 and phase 2, according to previous studies with minor modifications (Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2015</xref>). During the adaptive phase, the subject rat was allowed to explore the entire apparatus freely for 5 min. During phase 1, an age- and sex-matched unfamiliar model rat was locked in a small cage made of stainless-steel wires as a social stimulus and then placed in one of the side chambers, and an identical but empty cage was placed in the other side chamber. The subject rat was allowed to explore the entire apparatus with the corridor opened and interact with the model rat for 10 min. During phase 2, another age- and sex-matched unfamiliar model rat was introduced to the empty cage as a novel social stimulus. The subject rat was also allowed to explore the entire apparatus and interact with the familiar and novel model rats for 10 min. The entire apparatus was cleaned with 75% ethanol after each trial concluded to eliminate the impact of residual rat odors. The amount of time spent in each of the three chambers was recorded automatically, and the rats were videotaped. The amount of time spent sniffing the wire cage was analyzed by a highly trained observer blinded to the genotype as closely social interaction time.</p>

<title>Olfactory Habituation/Dishabituation Test</title>
<p>Responses to nonsocial and social odors were analyzed by an olfactory habituation/dishabituation test (OHDT) during the dark period under dim red illumination as previously described with some modifications (Janssen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2001</xref>; Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2015</xref>). The experiment was conducted in an acrylic cage (31 cm × 19 cm × 13 cm) with fresh bedding and a square metal gauze top. The test began with a 5 min familiarization followed by 15 sequential 2 min odor presentations with 1 min intervals. The odors consisted of three nonsocial odors, including water, almond (1:10 dilution, DJ-2372, Zhejiang Dahaojia Co., Ltd., Zhejiang, China) and vanilla (1:10 dilution, DJ-2301, Zhejiang Dahaojia Co., Ltd., Zhejiang, China) and two social odors, including social odor 1 (collected in the home cage consisting of three adult male rats without bedding) and social odor 2 (collected from adult female rats). Each odor, which was pipetted on a filter paper (70 mm diameter) placed on top of the gauze, was presented continuously three times. Sequences of three identical odor presentations evaluated habituation to the same smell. Switching to different odor presentations evaluated dishabituation to a new odor. The amount of time spent sniffing the odorized filter was quantitated by an observer blinded to the genotype.</p>

<title>Open Field Test</title>
<p>Anxiety behavior and spontaneous activity were evaluated in an acrylic box (100 cm × 100 cm × 40 cm) and videotaped by an overhead camera. Subject rats were initially placed in the center of the test arena and allowed to explore the arena freely for 10 min. Videos from each rat were processed using SMART software (v2.5.21, Panlab Harvard Apparatus). The amount of time spent in the peripheral zones of the open field was recorded as indices of anxiety-like behaviors. The total distances traveled in the open field were analyzed as indices of spontaneous activity.</p>

<title>Novel Object Recognition Test</title>
<p>Learning and memory were assessed by a novel object recognition test during the dark period under dim red illumination as performed in previous studies with some modifications (Ishikawa et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2014</xref>; Pyndt Jørgensen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2015</xref>). Two days before the test, a subject rat was placed in the test arena (60 cm × 40 cm × 40 cm) for 10 min of habituation. During the training phase on the 3rd day, the rat was allowed to explore two identical objects in the arena for 20 min. After 1 h, during the test phase, in which one of the two objects was replaced by a new object (with a similar size but with different colors and shapes), the rat was introduced into the arena once again, allowed to explore freely for 10 min and videotaped. Then, the time spent exploring each of the two objects was measured by an observer blinded to the genotype. Object exploration behavior was defined as the nose of the rat touching the object or being oriented toward the object within 2 cm of it as previously described (Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Von Frey Test</title>
<p>A von Frey test was used to assess the mechanical pain threshold of rats. Briefly, rats were restrained in transparent Lucite cubicles on an elevated metal mesh floor for 30 min to acclimate and then tested for the paw withdrawal threshold with calibrated von Frey filaments (bending forces ranging from 0.4 to 15 g) using the Dixon up-down method. The left hindpaw of a rat was stimulated perpendicularly to the central plantar surface, and withdrawal was determined if the rat lifted its paw. Finally, the withdrawal threshold was calculated and regarded as the index of the mechanical pain threshold.</p>

<sec id="s2-3-10">
<title>Hot Plate Test</title>
<p>A hot plate test was used to detect the thermal pain threshold of rats. The apparatus consisted of a solid aluminum plate, which was heated and maintained at a constant temperature, confined by a transparent and removable Perspex cylinder. The temperature of the hot plate was set 53 ± 0.5°C. After a rat was placed on the hot plate surface, the amount of time for the rat to lick or lift its paw or jump off of the hot plate was defined as the paw withdrawal latency reflecting the temperature sensation. A cutoff time of 40 s was set to avoid tissue damage. The subject rat was tested three times with 15 min intervals and the mean of three recordings was reported as the final withdrawal latency.</p>

<title>Rotarod Test</title>
<p>Motor ability was analyzed by a rotarod test. Two days before the test, a subject rat was introduced into the apparatus for habituation (4 rpm). On the third day, during the test phase, the rat was introduced into the apparatus (4-40 rpm over 5 min) and was subjected to three trials with 15 min intervals. The latency to fall was recorded as the index of motor coordination and balance. The mean of three recordings was reported.</p>

<title>Golgi Staining</title>
<p>Golgi staining was conducted in 5-week-old rats using a Hito Golgi-Cox OptimStainTM kit (HTKNS1125, Hitobiotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the brain was removed and transferred into a mixture of impregnation solution containing equal volumes of solution 1 and solution 2 at room temperature for 2 weeks in the dark. Then, brain tissue was transferred into solution 3 at 4°C for 24–72 h in the dark. Coronal sections (150 μm) were prepared with a freezing microtome (Leica-1950, Germany). The sections were stained using solutions 4 and 5 after mounting the sections onto the slides. Finally, the stained sections were imaged using a microscope (Olympus BX43, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 100× oil immersion lens. A researcher blinded to the genotype analyzed the spine density in the hippocampus using ImageJ (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). For each rat, nine different neurons were quantified from three slides. The spine density from three segments (70 μm) was averaged to provide a single value for each neuron.</p>

Briefly, the rat brain was quickly removed and placed in ice-cold dissection solution (10 mM glucose, 213 mM sucrose, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM KCl and 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 7.4). Transverse slices were cut in ice-cold dissection solution on a vibrating blade microtome (Leica VT-1,200s, Wetzlar, Germany). The slices were moved to a chamber containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; 10 mM glucose, 2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 125 mM NaCl, 2.6 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM KCl, and 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 7.4, gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature before recording.</p>

<title>Slice Electrophysiology</title>
<p>During recordings, slices were mounted on the stage of an upright microscope (Olympus BX51WI, Tokyo, Japan) and constantly perfused with ACSF using a gravity-driven perfusion system with a speed of 2 mL/min. The internal solution contained 145 mM KCl, 5 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 4 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 10 mM Hepes and 5 mM QX314 with the pH adjusted to 7.2 and an osmolarity of 305. Whole-cell recordings were conducted by adding 100 μM PTX (1128, Tocris) to ACSF (for the recording of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) mediated by AMPARs). The stimulus was delivered to Schaffer collaterals through a concentric bipolar electrode (CBBEB75, FHC, Bowdoin, ME, USA). For the recording of evoked EPSCs mediated by NMDARs, 100 μM PTX (1128, Tocris) and 10 μM CNQX (C127, Sigma) were added to ACSF, and the recordings were performed by holding the membrane potential at +40 mV. The stimulation intensity was 100 μA in evoked EPSCs recordings. Microelectrodes filled with ACSF (3–5 MΩ) were used to record field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) from the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region. The stimulation intensity in fEPSPs recordings was defined as 60% of the maximum response. An EPC10 Patch Clamp Amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) was used to record the fEPSPs, and the values were calculated by measuring the onset (a 30–70% rising phase) slope of the fEPSP. For LTP recordings, we recorded a 20 min baseline followed by performing theta-burst stimulation [TBS; five episodes of stimulation delivered at 0.1 Hz, where each episode contained 10 stimuli trains of five pulses (100 Hz) delivered at 5 Hz] to induce LTP. Synaptic responses were collected every 15 s, and the data were analyzed by averaging four responses.</p>

<title>Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>The total protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay using a Detergent Compatible Bradford Protein Assay kit (P0006C, Beyotime) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For western blot analysis, equal amounts of 5–15 μg total homogenate (abbreviated to H<sub>0</sub>) and the PSD fraction (abbreviated to PSD) were loaded on the gels, transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk powder blocking solution using standard protocols. The membranes were subsequently incubated with primary antibodies on a horizontal shaker at 4°C overnight. After incubation, the membranes were further incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies on a horizontal shaker for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the signals were visualized using an ECL Plus kit (PE0010, Solarbio). For quantification, the gray value of each band was analyzed by Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Irvine, CA, USA) and normalized to the gray value of β-actin. For SHANK proteins, different isoforms were all involved in the quantification. The following antibodies were used for western blot analysis: anti-SHANK1 (1:1,000 dilution, NB300–166, Neuromab), anti-SHANK2 (1:1,000 dilution, homemade from The Boeckers Lab, against amino acids 826–1259 of rat ProSAP1/SHANK2), anti-C-term SHANK3 (1:2,500 dilution, homemade from The Boeckers Lab, against both amino acids 781–1009 and amino acids 1260–1392 of rat ProSAP2/SHANK3), anti-N-term SHANK3 (1:500 dilution, homemade from The Boeckers Lab, against the first 120 N-terminal amino acids of rat SHANK3), anti-PSD-95 (1:500 dilution, AB2723, Abcam), anti-Homer1b/c (1:1,000 dilution, 160022, sysy), anti-GluR1 (1:1,000 dilution, AB1504, Millipore), anti-GluR2 (1:1,000 dilution, MAB397, Millipore), anti-NR1 (1:1,000 dilution, 556308BD, Biosciences), anti-NR2A (1:2,000 dilution, 07–632, Millipore), and anti-β-actin (1:1,000 dilution, TA-09, ZSGB-BIO).</p>

<title>Normal Social Interaction Behavior but Impaired Social Memory and Impaired Learning and Memory in <italic>Shank3</italic>-Deficient Rats</title>
<p>A series of behavioral tests were performed to determine the phenotype of <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats. To determine whether the <italic>Shank3</italic> mutation impacts basic developmental processes in rats, developmental milestones were evaluated, including body weight, pinna detachment, incisor eruption and eye-opening. There were no significant genotype differences in the above-mentioned measures or general health (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). We also observed no genotype differences in pup separation-induced USVs on PND7 (data not shown) and reciprocal social interaction behaviors (data not shown).</p>
<p>Social interaction behaviors and social memory were examined by a three-chamber test. In phase 1 of the three chamber test, when the subject rat was exposed to a social stimulus and a nonsocial stimulus simultaneously, <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient and wild-type rats both spent more time in the compartment containing the social stimulus (data not shown) or in close interaction with the social partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), which showed normal social interaction behaviors and social preferences in <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats. In phase 2 of the three chamber test, a novel social partner was introduced, when the subject rat was exposed to a social and a novel social stimulus simultaneously. Wild-type rats showed a preference for the novel social partner, which was indicated by the increase in the amount of time spent in the compartment containing the novel social stimulus (data not shown) and the amount of time spent in close interaction with the novel social partner (69.42 ± 5.134 s spent in close interaction with the familiar social partner and 122.1 ± 9.124 s spent in close interaction with the novel social partner, <italic>n</italic> = 19, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).

<p>Since olfactory ability is important for the social memory of rodents (Wacker and Ludwig, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2012</xref>), olfactory habituation/dishabituation was tested in three genotype groups. For nonsocial and social odor cues, both <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient and wild-type rats showed olfactory habituation and dishabituation, as indicated by the decreased amount of time spent in sniffing the three sequences of the same odors and increased amount of time spent in sniffing the different odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Therefore, the deficits in social novelty recognition of <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats may not be due to olfactory ability.</p>
<p>Cognitive performance was examined by a novel object recognition test.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>Shank3</italic> mutations contribute to the genetic etiology of ASDs and <italic>Shank3</italic> is the major causative gene in the heterozygous deletion of the long arm of chromosome 22q, called PMS. In our present study, we established and thoroughly characterized a novel rat model with a complete <italic>Shank3</italic> deletion. Since alternative splicing of the <italic>Shank3</italic> gene has been reported (Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2011</xref>), we confirmed that the full-length SHANK3 protein and major SHANK3 isoforms were disrupted completely in knockout rats using different SHANK3 antibodies, which is in contrast with other isoform-specific mutant mouse models and the rat model with a local deletion of exon 6 (Bozdagi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2010</xref>; Peca et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2011</xref>; Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2011</xref>; Schmeisser et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2012</xref>; Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2015</xref>). This novel rat model with a complete <italic>Shank3</italic> deletion can likely better mimic the majority of patients carrying deletions of the entire <italic>Shank3</italic> gene in PMS (Soorya et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2013</xref>).</p>
<p>A series of biochemical analyses were also performed to examine whether SHANK family proteins and SHANK3-interacting proteins are altered in <italic>Shank3</italic> knockout rats. We did not find changes in other SHANK family proteins, which suggests that there no potential compensatory mechanisms related to other SHANK family proteins. The expression levels of other scaffolding proteins and glutamatergic receptors, including PSD-95, Homer, GluR1 and NR1, were altered, especially in the striatum. The striatum, which mediates components of rodent social behaviors and is related to parts of cognitive and sensorimotor abilities (Brielmaier et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2012</xref>), has previously been identified as one of the dysfunctional brain regions implicated in autism. In particular, it has been confirmed that the striatum is involved in repetitive behaviors in both autistic patients and animal models (Peca et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2011</xref>; Langen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2014</xref>; Rothwell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2014</xref>). Moreover, SHANK3 is the most abundant SHANK family member expressed in the striatum but not in other brain regions (Peca et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2011</xref>), which might explain why <italic>Shank3</italic> deficiency has a greater impact on the striatum. The altered molecular composition of <italic>Shank3</italic> knockout synapses confirmed the important role of SHANK3 as a scaffolding protein at PSDs. Compared to other <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient animal models carrying different mutations, changes in protein expression levels in PSDs showed not only brain region-specific but also mutation-specific alterations, indicating complex biochemical mechanisms underlying individual <italic>Shank3</italic> mutations. Notably, we observed significant alterations of PSD95 and NMDAR1 subunits in <italic>Shank3</italic> heterozygous rats. This result could indicate that any alteration of <italic>Shank3</italic> levels (50% reduction in this study) might modulate the composition of PSDs. This is especially intriguing since human <italic>Shank3</italic> mutations are solely heterozygous disease entities. However, the molecular mechanism explaining these changes is far from being fully understood.</p>
<p>At glutamatergic synapses, SHANK3 interacts with multiple glutamate receptor subunits and the actin-based cytoskeleton as a scaffolding protein, and it is therefore critical for synaptic morphology and synaptic transmission. Normal dendritic spines contribute significantly to regular synaptic function and efficient neural circuit wiring, while altered dendritic spines often occur in individuals with autism-related disorders (Hutsler and Zhang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2010</xref>; Tang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2014</xref>), and in experimental mouse models, including some <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient mouse strains (Peca et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2011</xref>; Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2017</xref>). In the present study, we also observed decreased spine density in <italic>Shank3</italic> knockout rats, suggesting impaired spine formation, which may lead to impaired synaptic function and plasticity eventually. To this end, we analyzed synaptic function and plasticity, especially in the hippocampus. Basal synaptic transmission and LTP were both reduced in <italic>Shank3</italic> knockout rats. Therefore, we confirmed the effect of the <italic>Shank3</italic> mutation on glutamatergic synaptic function and plasticity. Impaired learning and memory formation, as well as impaired social memory, might also be consistent with dysfunctions in synaptic function and plasticity in the hippocampal formation.</p>
<p>Prompted by the crucial role of <italic>Shank3</italic> in synaptic function and the genetic etiology of ASDs and PMS, many <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient mouse models carrying different mutations have been established. A spectrum of behavioral phenotypes, including impaired social behaviors and increased repetitive behavior, which are regarded as core symptoms of ASDs, have been described. Moreover, impaired learning and memory formation as well as increased anxiety behavior as comorbidities, have been identified (Bozdagi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2010</xref>; Bangash et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2011</xref>; Peca et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2011</xref>; Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2011</xref>; Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2012</xref>; Kouser et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2013</xref>; Duffney et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2015</xref>). Subsequently, a rat model with a local deletion of exon 6 of <italic>Shank3</italic> was established, and normal social behavior but impaired social memory and attention were observed (Harony-Nicolas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2017</xref>). Another <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient nonhuman primate model with altered neurogenesis has also been reported (Zhao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">2017</xref>). In our present study, we did not find aberrant social interaction behaviors in <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats, which have been identified in a majority of <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient mouse models. These discrepancies may be attributed to species-specific differences, different genetic backgrounds, different targeting sites in the <italic>Shank3</italic> gene, different ages of animals used in behavioral tests and different paradigms of behavioral tests. Heterogeneity in clinical symptoms among patients with PMS and ASD and normal social behaviors performed by some of the patients with PMS should also be considered (Scheeren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2012</xref>; Soorya et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2013</xref>). The normal levels of OXT and AVP in the hypothalamus and the normal levels of OXTR and V1aR in the amygdala might be one of the reasons for normal social behavior. To the best of our knowledge, the endogenous OXT/AVP system was explored for the first time in a <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient animal model. Nevertheless, similar to different behavioral defects in <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient animal models, we speculated that changes in the OXT/AVP system can also vary among different models and contribute to phenotypes related to social interaction. These results also suggest that there are independent pathways responding to social novelty recognition and social interaction ability, even in the same gene knockout condition.</p>
<p>In this genetically modified rat model, we observed impaired social memory indicated by deficits in social novelty recognition. Olfaction plays an important role in social recognition in rodents (Wacker and Ludwig, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2012</xref>), and social recognition tests make use of the natural tendency of animals toward the olfactory investigation of novel conspecifics (Bielsky and Young, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2004</xref>). Typically, OHDTs are performed as a control task. Impaired social behavior with normal olfactory ability has also been reported in <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient mice with a deletion of exons 4 through 9 (Bozdagi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2010</xref>). In this study, normal olfactory ability suggested that dysfunctions in other complex and elaborate mechanisms of processing social stimuli and memory led to impaired social memory in <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats. OXT and AVP also play an important role in social memory, which can act on a variety of brain regions to facilitate social recognition and modulate subsequent behavioral responses (Wacker and Ludwig, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2012</xref>). Among these, the LS is thought to be crucial for the mediation of social recognition (van der Kooij and Sandi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2012</xref>). However, analysis of OXTR and V1aR expression levels in the LS showed increased mRNA expression levels of OXTR even with normal synthetic levels of OXT. Currently, we cannot explain exactly the impaired social memory and the divergent changes of the OXT/AVP system. The involvement of acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin and estrogen in social memory has also been reported (van der Kooij and Sandi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2012</xref>; Ervin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2015</xref>). In addition, secretin can increase the acquisition of social recognition in an OXTR-dependent manner (Takayanagi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2017</xref>). Therefore, we doubt that there are any cross-mediating mechanisms. The various neurotransmitter systems committed to social memory and the interactions between other neurotransmitters and the OXT/AVP system should be further analyzed. Notably, the facilitatory effect of OXT administration on a variety of social behaviors has been reported not only in humans (Domes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2007</xref>; Guastella et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2008</xref>; Hurlemann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2010</xref>) but also in rodents (Lukas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2011</xref>). In particular, the improved effect of OXT treatment on social memory and attention has been observed in a <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rat model with a deletion in exon 6 (Harony-Nicolas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2017</xref>). Combining these results from studies of humans and animals with normal or impaired social behavior, we can infer that there is an ameliorative effect of OXT on social memory even with a normal OXT/AVP system. Therefore, whether the OXT treatment can improve the defective behaviors in this <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rat should also be further studied.</p>
<p>Cognitive disabilities, anxiety, sensory-perceptual anomalies and pain insensitivity are common comorbidities in patients with ASD and PMS (Allely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2013</xref>; Soorya et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2013</xref>; Croen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2015</xref>; Polyak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2015</xref>). Analogously, we observed impaired learning and memory, increased anxiety behavior, an increased baseline mechanical pain threshold and reduced temperature sensation in <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats. Impaired learning and memory and increased anxiety behavior have often been reported in a majority of <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient mouse models (Bozdagi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2010</xref>; Bangash et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2011</xref>; Peca et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2011</xref>; Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2011</xref>; Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2012</xref>; Kouser et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2013</xref>; Duffney et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2015</xref>). Impaired heat hyperalgesia in inflammatory and neuropathic pain and the interaction between SHANK3 and transient receptor potential subtype V1 (TRPV1) have been reported in <italic>Shank3</italic> knockout mice with a deletion of exons 4–22, however, there was no change in the baseline thermal and mechanical sensitivity in this mouse model as we observed (Han et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2016</xref>). Incorporating these findings, <italic>Shank3</italic> mutation may underlie pain deficits in <italic>Shank3</italic>-related ASD and PMS through some mechanisms that include the interaction with TRPV1 but are not limited to.</p>
<p>Notably, to understand the results of the behavioral tests in our present study, limitations of some behavioral tests for rats should also be considered. In particular, the detection of muscle and motor function using other methods and the observation of self-grooming behavior in home cages should be further performed.</p>
<p>Overall, the <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rat model established in this study showed impaired synaptic function as expected, and a spectrum of behavioral phenotypes related to comorbidities in PMS and ASDs, which make it possible to assess potential therapeutics for PMS, ASDs and other developmental disorders using this model.</p>
