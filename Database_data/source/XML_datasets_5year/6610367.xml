channels, cause epilepsy with ataxia in humans. Whereas the deletion of
Cacna1a in γ-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) interneurons (INs)
derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) impairs cortical
inhibition and causes generalized seizures in Nkx2.1Cre;Cacna1ac/c mice,
the targeted deletion of Cacna1a in somatostatin-expressing INs
(SOM-INs), a subset of MGE-derived INs, does not result in seizures,
indicating a crucial role of parvalbumin-expressing (PV) INs. Here, we
identify the cellular and network consequences of Cacna1a deletion
specifically in PV-INs. Methods: We generated PVCre;Cacna1ac/c mutant
mice carrying a conditional Cacna1a deletion in PV neurons and evaluated
the cortical cellular and network outcomes of this mutation by combining
immunohistochemical assays, in vitro electrophysiology, 2-photon
imaging, and in vivo video-electroencephalographic recordings. Results:
PVCre;Cacna1ac/c mice display reduced cortical perisomatic inhibition
and frequent absences, but only rare motor seizures. Compared to
Nkx2.1Cre;Cacna1ac/c mice, PVCre;Cacna1ac/c mice have a net increase in
cortical inhibition, with a gain of dendritic inhibition through
sprouting of SOM-IN axons, largely preventing motor seizures. This
beneficial compensatory remodeling of cortical GABAergic innervation is
mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent, and its
inhibition with rapamycin leads to a striking increase in motor
seizures. Furthermore, we show that a direct chemogenic activation of
cortical SOM-INs prevents motor seizures in a model of kainate-induced
seizures. Interpretation: Our findings provide novel evidence suggesting
that the remodeling of cortical inhibition, with an mTOR-dependent gain
of dendritic inhibition, determines the seizure phenotype in generalized
epilepsy and that mTOR inhibition can be detrimental in epilepsies not
primarily due to mTOR hyperactivation.</p></boxed-text>

<title>Commentary</title>
<p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway regulates neuronal plasticity,
increases cell metabolism, and promotes neuronal growth. Mutations that increase
mTOR signaling can cause tumor formation, but are also associated with a range of
neurological disorders including autism, cortical dysplasia, and epilepsy. Increased
mTOR pathway activation has also been observed in tissue collected from patients
with temporal lobe epilepsy, but without identified mTOR pathway mutations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1535759718822033">1</xref></sup> consistent with animal research indicating that mTOR signaling is enhanced in
acquired epilepsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1535759718822033">2</xref></sup> Research in the mTOR field was originally driven by the chance discovery of
the bacterial metabolite rapamycin in a soil sample from Easter Island, located in
the South Pacific Ocean. Rapamycin is a powerful inhibitor of the mTOR pathway and
has served as a useful pharmacologic tool. Clinical trials with rapamycin analogues
have achieved promising results in controlling seizures and central nervous system
tumor formation in tuberous sclerosis complex, a disease caused by inactivating
mutations in the mTOR pathway suppressors TSC1 and TSC2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1535759718822033">3</xref></sup> Preclinical studies in animal models of acquired epilepsy—predicated on the
observation that epileptogenic brain insults increase mTOR pathway activation—have
also achieved promising results, often producing dramatic reductions in severe
frequency. Intriguingly, however, a number of well-designed studies found no effect
of rapamycin in several common seizure models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1535759718822033">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Work by Jiang and colleagues has unexpectedly led to a potential explanation for
these discrepant effects of mTOR antagonism. They examined epilepsy-causing
mutations in the gene encoding the α1 subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels
CaV2.1. Prior work from the group demonstrated that CaV2.1 loss from interneurons
(INs) was sufficient to reproduce an epileptic phenotype in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1535759718822033">5</xref></sup> In the present study, they sought to identify which specific IN populations
were critical. Mutations affecting both parvalbumin (PV)-expressing and somatostatin
(SOM)-expressing γ-aminobutyric acidergic INs led to epilepsy in the animals, while
mutations affecting just PV-expressing INs produced a milder epilepsy phenotype.
Mutations affecting just SOM-expressing INs didn’t produce seizures at all.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1535759718822033">5</xref></sup> Loss of CaV2.1 from PV INs impaired their synaptic efficiency, leading to a
net reduction in inhibitory control of their targets: excitatory pyramidal cells. It
makes sense, therefore, that loss of CaV2.1 from PV INs would be proconvulsant.
Somatostatin-expressing INs, on the other hand, primarily target other INs, so it
also makes sense that mutations targeted to just this population would not produce
seizures. More curious, however, is why targeting the mutation to both PV- or
SOM-expressing INs would produce a more severe epilepsy that targeting PV alone.</p>
<p>To begin to resolve this paradox, the group conducted electrophysiological studies in
PV-targeted CaV2.1 mutants. These studies revealed that while synaptic efficiency at
PV &gt;&gt; pyramidal cell synapses was reduced in PV-targeted mutants, overall
inhibitory input to pyramidal cells was <italic>increased</italic>. Through a
combination of elegant electrophysiological and anatomical work, the investigators
discovered that in PV-targeted mutants, unaffected SOM-expressing INs undergo
sprouting, providing compensatory inhibitory input to pyramidal cells. In animals in
which both PV- and SOM-expressing INs are mutated, compensatory changes among the
latter neurons are presumably blocked. Having observed that SOM neurons sprout in
PV-targeted mutants, the investigators queried whether this growth was mediated by
mTOR. Rapamycin treatment of PV-targeted mutants prevented SOM-expressing IN
sprouting and greatly exacerbated the seizure phenotype in the animals. Rather than
being antiepileptogenic in this model of epilepsy, mTOR inhibition blocked an
anticonvulsant sprouting response.</p>
<p>The study by Jiang and colleagues highlights a key challenge for the epilepsy field,
in which proconvulsant manipulations can be flipped to anticonvulsant manipulations
based on the cellular and network properties of the affected neuronal populations.
While this now appears clear in the CaV2.1 model, it may well be true for other
models. The pilocarpine model of epilepsy—which has been used for decades in
epilepsy research—provides a good example. Somatostatin neurons exhibit robust
sprouting in pilocarpine-treated mice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1535759718822033">6</xref></sup> and rapamycin treatment of the animals is ineffective at controlling seizures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1535759718822033">7</xref></sup> Although a causal relationship has yet to be confirmed, rapamycin treatment
blocks SOM neuron sprouting in this model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1535759718822033">8</xref></sup> suggesting that the treatment may be preventing a similar compensatory change
to that observed by Jiang and colleagues, and therefore, obscuring any positive
effects of the drug. Sprouting of SOM neurons has been described in other animal
models of epilepsy and in humans with the disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1535759718822033">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1535759718822033">10</xref></sup> suggesting that this is a common phenomenon. Notably, in children with
tuberous sclerosis treated with the mTOR antagonist everolimus, seizure frequency
was reduced in 13 of 20 patients, but increased in 3 patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1535759718822033">3</xref></sup> Blockade of compensatory neuronal growth could contribute to the negative
outcomes.</p>
<p>Taken together, the data suggest that mTOR signaling may mediate both
proepileptogenic changes and compensatory inhibitory changes. If true, the utility
of mTOR antagonism as a therapeutic strategy for epilepsy could be limited to a
smaller number of epileptic conditions in which mTOR-mediated pathologic changes are
dominant. Alternatively, it may be possible to further refine the use of these drugs
to enhance their utility. Jiang and colleagues observed that SOM neuron sprouting
was absent in 3-week-old mice and was blocked by rapamycin treatment given between
weeks 3 to 6. Although additional studies are needed, if mTOR-mediated
proepileptogenic effects are temporally dissociated from mTOR-mediated compensatory
changes, it may be possible to develop a timed treatment regimen that could still be
effective in epilepsy conditions in which mTOR plays both sides. Inhibition of mTOR
signaling among only select neuronal populations—possibly using viral delivery
strategies—might also be effective. Targeting only excitatory neurons for mTOR
inhibition, for example, would allow compensatory changes among inhibitory neurons
to proceed.</p>
<p>The work by Jiang and colleagues provides several take-home messages for thinking
about epileptogenesis. Firstly, it demonstrates the key importance of cellular
specificity. Depending on the cell population targeted, the same mutation or therapy
can produce both pro- and antiepileptogenic effects. Secondly, the temporal dynamics
of epileptogenesis is critical, with agents likely producing different effects when
applied during different disease stages. Finally, the study clearly demonstrates a
phenomenon that has long been suspected in the epilepsy field: that proepileptogenic
changes can occur concurrently with anticonvulsant compensatory changes. Optimal
therapeutic strategies for epilepsy, therefore, will require an understanding of
both processes and the development of strategies to limit the former, while
facilitating the latter.</p>
