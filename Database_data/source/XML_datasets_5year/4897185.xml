<abstract>
<p>The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Latin America coincided with a marked increase in microcephaly in newborns. However, the causal link between maternal ZIKV infection and malformation of the fetal brain has not been firmly established. Here we show a vertical transmission of ZIKV in mice and a marked effect on fetal brain development. We found that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a contemporary ZIKV strain in pregnant mice led to the infection of radial glia cells (RGs) of dorsal ventricular zone of the fetuses, the primary neural progenitors responsible for cortex development, and caused a marked reduction of these cortex founder cells in the fetuses. Interestingly, the infected fetal mice exhibited a reduced cavity of lateral ventricles and a discernable decrease in surface areas of the cortex. This study thus supports the conclusion that vertically transmitted ZIKV affects fetal brain development and provides a valuable animal model for the evaluation of potential therapeutic or preventative strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Zika virus (ZIKV), a positive single-strand RNA flavivirus spread by infected mosquitoes, is usually considered to cause asymptomatic infections or only mild symptoms, including fever, malaise, rash and conjunctivits, and in rare cases Guillain-Barre syndrome mediated by immune reactions damaging the peripheral nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup>. The recent outbreak of ZIKV infection in the Americas, in particular Brazil, is accompanied by a marked increase in cases of microcephaly of newborns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup>, and several case reports have shown the presence of ZIKV particles in the microcephalic fetal brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup>. On the basis of the potential threat of ZIKV infection on central nervous system development of infants, the World Health Organization declared in February 2016, the danger of ZIKV on pregnancy as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Although epidemiologic retrospective studies indicate correlation between reports of suspected microcephaly with ZIKV incidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup>, causal link has been debated because complex chemical or other environmental factors may also cause similar defects. Recently, three independent studies have determined the effects of ZIKV on cultured human neural progenitors or 3D organoids, which were derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, and found that ZIKV specifically infected these <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured neural progenitors and inhibited their proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup>. Another report using single-cell gene expression analysis suggested the expression of a candidate ZIKV receptor in diverse cell types, including radial glial (RG) cells, in developing nervous system of various species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup>. Although these lines of evidence are consistent with observed microcephaly in infected fetuses, there is an urgent need for the development of an animal model to firmly establish the link between vertical ZIKV infection and malformation of the fetal brain.</p>
<p>Here we show that maternally infected ZIKV can cross the mouse placental barrier, infect radial glial cells of the fetal brain, and cause either directly or indirectly a reduction in the proliferative pool of cortical neural progenitors, leading to a discernable brain developmental defect in offspring mice. This work establishes the causal link between maternal ZIKV infection and malformation of the fetal brain in a mouse model.</p>

<title>Vertically transmitted ZIKV targets radial glial cells of fetal mice</title>
<p>ZIKV can be classified into African and Asian genotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup>. The widespread ZIKV epidemic from 2015 to present in Latin America is caused by the Asian type strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup>. In this study, we used a contemporary Asian ZIKV strain SZ01 (GenBank accession no: KU866423) isolated from the acute phase serum of a Chinese male patient returning from Samoa in 2016<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup>, where ZIKV transmission was reported in 2015<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup>. To determine whether ZIKV infects mouse neural progenitors, we injected the virus into the lateral ventricle of fetal mice at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) and analyzed the distribution of viruses on E17.5 and postnatal day 1 (P1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the cells in the ventricular zone (VZ) of dorsal telencephalon exhibited strong virus signals, detected by immunostaining with the patient's convalescent phase serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, middle row, left two images). We also observed virus signals in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, middle row, right two images).</p>
<p>Because ZIKV is suspected to be able to cross the human fetal-placental barrier and infect the developing fetal brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup>, we aimed to set up a vertical transmission model of ZIKV infection in immunocompetent mice. We injected ZIKV intraperitoneally (i.p.) into pregnant mice at E13.5 and determined the distribution of viruses in the offspring mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that upon i.p. inoculation, ZIKV could efficiently establish a transient viremia on day 1 post infection in pregnant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In particular, ZIKV-specific RNA was detected in 5 out of 9 placentas on day 3 post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that the ZIKV signals were specifically distributed in the dorsal VZ of the fetal brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom row, left two images), but not in other brain regions including striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom row, right two images). These results suggest that ZIKV can efficiently cross the mouse fetal-placental barrier and that the cortical neural progenitors of fetal mice are the specific target of vertically transmitted ZIKV. In line with this conclusion, most ZIKV signals were colocalized with BLBP, a marker of radial glia (RG) cells, the major cortical neural progenitors localized in the VZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1F</xref>). Thus, RG cells are the primary targets of ZIKV in infected fetal mouse brains. In line with this conclusion, ZIKV signals were usually distributed as granular patterns in cytoplasmic regions of cells postively labeled by Pax6, another marker of RG cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Figure S1</xref>), or Sox2, a transcription factor essential for maintaining cell stemness potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>ZIKV infection abolishes proliferative pool of cortical neural progenitors in fetal mice</title>
<p>We next determined effects of ZIKV infection on cortical neural progenitors of the fetal brain. We first stained fetal brain slices with Ki67, a marker for mitotic cells, and found that ZIKV infection markedly reduced the number of Ki67-positive cells in VZ/subventricular zone (SVZ) and intermediate zone (IZ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). This result suggests an inhibitory effect of ZIKV on proliferation of cortical neural progenitors. We also observed a marked decrease in the intensity and band thickness of cells positively-labeled by BLBP or Sox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-2E</xref>), suggesting the reduction of cortical neural progenitor pool upon ZIKV infection. These results are in agreement with the findings that ZIKV induces cell death and inhibits cell cycle progression in cultured human cortical neural progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In the mouse SVZ, the intermediate progenitors (IPs) marked by Tbr2 constitute another type of cortical progenitor, which undergoes terminal cell division to become neurons or glia. We found that both the intensity and band thickness of Tbr2-positive IPs were also markedly reduced in the ZIKV-infected fetal brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F-2H</xref>). Taken together, maternal ZIKV infection caused a marked reduction of the cortical neural progenitors in the fetal mice.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Effects of ZIKV infection on expression of microcephaly or cell cycle-related genes</title>
<p>Genetic analysis has led to identification of a number of gene mutations associated with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH), and most of these genes directly regulate cell cycle progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup>. Does ZIKV infection have any effect on the expression of these MCPH-associated genes? Notably, quantitative gene expression analysis using real-time PCR showed that mRNA levels of <italic>Microcephalin</italic>, <italic>CDK5RAP2</italic>, <italic>CASC5</italic>, <italic>ASPM</italic>, <italic>CENPJ</italic>, <italic>STIL</italic>, <italic>CEP135</italic>, <italic>STIL</italic>, as well as a cell cycle-related gene <italic>CDK6</italic>, were downregulated to varying degrees in ZIKV-infected fetal brain samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). It is known that some viral infections during pregnancy are correlated with malfunction of the brain in the offspring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup>. Recently, a provocative study showed that immune activation in pregnant mice can affect the cortex development of the offspring through the interleukin-17a (IL17a) pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we found a marked increase in the expression of IL17Ra, the receptor of IL17a in ZIKV-infected fetal brain samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These results suggest a complex mechanism underlying the effects of ZIKV infection on mouse brain development. To further understand the impact of ZIKV infection on gene transcription network, we compared global transcriptome profiles between ZIKV-infected and mock-infected fetal mouse brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S2</xref>). We found that many genes involved in regulating immune responses, including innate immune reactions, and cell death program were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Table S1</xref>), whereas genes critical for cell proliferation and negative regulators of apoptotic process were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary information, Table S2</xref>). These changes in gene expression are similar to what was observed in cultured human neural progenitors infected by ZIKV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup>, suggesting the mechanisms for ZIKV's effects on neural progenitors may be conserved among different species.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>ZIKV infection causes malformation of the fetal brain</title>
<p>We further determined whether this maternal ZIKV infection could cause any defects in the cortical development of fetal mice. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows serial coronal sections of fetal brains in various anterior-posterior positions stained with DAPI. We found that outer perimeters of the cortex of ZIKV-infected fetal mice were significantly shorter than that of mock-injected control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>). Interestingly, ZIKV-infected fetal mice exhibited a markedly reduced cavity of lateral ventricles accompanied by decreased ventricular surfaces compared with control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>). These morphological alterations might be due to diminished ZIKV-infected RGs and the consequent reduction in proliferative neural progenitor pools along the VZ surface. Notably, we did not observe apparent changes in relative thickness of individual cortical layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F</xref>). We predict that the remaining ZIKV-resistant RG cells, if any, may maintain normal mode of division, radial migration and maturation, which give rise to normal lamination of fetal brains.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ZIKV is neurotropic for the adult mouse brain, infecting neurons and astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup>, thus causing neurological symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup>. Interestingly, a historical ZIKV strain isolated prior to the 2015 epidemic can infect induced human neural progenitors with high efficiency but infect differentiated young neurons with only low efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup>. Here we show that a contemporary ZIKV strain isolated from the 2015 epidemic area can be vertically transmitted from the infected pregnant mice to their fetuses, where it specifically infects the cortical neural progenitors in the brain. The vertical transmission model of ZIKV infection in mice supports well the human ZIKV cases and provides a useful platform for testing potential antiviral drugs. It is necessary to systemically analyze whether variations in different strains can affect the infection efficiency in different cell types. These analyses may provide further insights into the varying frequencies of microcephaly in different Zika virus epidemics.</p>
<p>Humans are different from rodents in several aspects of the cortex development, such as longer cell cycle length, longer duration of cortical neurogenesis, bigger brain surface area, and complex gyrencephalic instead of lissencephalic configuration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup>. The recently observed outer or basal radial glia cells in the massively expanded outer SVZ in primates have been considered to be associated with cortex expansion and evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup>. Notably, mice with gene mutations associated with human microcephaly often exhibit milder phenotypes in cortex development than human patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the reduction of the lateral ventricles in vertically infected offspring mice is in contradiction with the phenotype of ventriculomegaly found in newborn ZIKV patients with microcephaly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup>. This discrepancy is likely due to a species difference between humans and mice.</p>
<p>In this study, ZIKV was i.p. injected into the pregnant mice at E13.5, a stage when the most prominent cortical neurogenesis occurs. We could not rule out the possibility that injection at an earlier stage or a higher dosage might cause a stronger phenotype. The quick decline in viremia (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) probably mediated by the immune responses in the mother may partly account for the mild phenotype. Indeed, mice lacking components of the antiviral response have been shown to sustain higher viral loads than immunocompetent mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup>; they may serve as a more ideal model for investigating the effect of ZIKV on fetal brain development.</p>
<p>In summary, we show that maternal infected ZIKV can cross the mouse placental barrier and infect RG cells in the fetal brain, causing either directly or indirectly a reduction in the proliferative pool of cortical neural progenitors, and leading to a discernable brain developmental defect in the offspring. This study thus provides a useful animal model for the screening and evaluation of therapeutic or preventive drugs and vaccines that can combat ZIKV infection.</p>

<title>Zika virus preparation and mouse infection</title>
<p>Zika virus used in this study was isolated from an imported Chinese patient returning from Samoa in February 2016<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup>. Virus stocks were prepared in mosquito C6/36 cell and stored in aliquots at â80 Â°C. The titer of ZIKV was determined by standard plaque forming assay on Vero cells. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to quantify viral RNA with the following primers (5â²-GGTCAGCGTCCTCTCTAATAAACG-3â² and 5â²-GCACCCTAGTGTCCACTTTTTCC-3â²) and a fluorogenic probes (5â²-FAM-AGCCATGACCGACACCACACCGT-BQ1-3â²).</p>
<p>Approximately 10-week-old pregnant C57 mice at E13.5 were used as recipients for ZIKV infection through either i.p. injection with 300 Î¼l virus (3 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> PFU/ml) or in utero injection with 1.5 Î¼l virus into the lateral ventricles (LV) of the fetal brain. To carry out this latter procedure, C57 pregnant mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, the embryos in uterus were exposed, and 1.5 Î¼l virus mixed with Fast Green was injected into the lateral ventricle of embryonic brain. An equal amount of vehicle DMEM was used for mock infection. Blood samples were collected for viremia analysis at 1, 2 and 3 days post infection. At 3 days post inoculation, the placentas of each embryo was dissected to determine viral RNA replication. Injected mice were raised until E17.5 or P1 for fetal brain examination. Mice injection was approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted in biological safety protection laboratory.</p>

<sec>
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>The brains of E17.5 or P1 offspring mice were perfused and then post-fixed for 72 h with 4% PFA (pH7.4). The fixed mouse brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution and sectioned using a cryostat microtome at the thickness of 30 Î¼m. The brain slices were washed with PBS and then incubated in 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. After blocking with 10% goat serum, the slices were incubated in primary antibodies at 4 Â°C overnight. The used primary antibodies were: mouse anti-BLBP (Abcam, 1:500), rat anti-Ctip2 (Abcam, 1:500), rabbit anti-Ki67 (Abcam, 1:500), rabbit anti-Pax6 (Covance, 1:1 000), mouse anti-Satb2 (Abcam, 1:1 000), rabbit anti-Sox2 (Millipore, 1:1 000), rabbit anti-Tbr2 (Abcam, 1:500), convalescent phase serum from the ZIKV patient (1:700). In the next day, the slices were incubated with Alexa Fluor 555/488/647 conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature. DAPI was obtained from Beyotime Biotechnology. Images were acquired using a Nikon A1 Plus confocal microscope with a 20Ã or 40Ã objective lens.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>RNA extraction and real-time PCR</title>
<p>The dissociated mouse brains were ground in DMEM medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), and total RNA was extracted using PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays were used to detect the changes in expression of candidate genes following ZIKV infection. Real-time PCR was performed in 96-well plates using a Roche LightCycler 480 instrument. GAPDH was used as the reference gene for internal control. The specific primers were as follows: STIL (forward: 5â²-CCTTGTGAGAGTAGGACGCC-3â², reverse: 5â²-TGGGAGGATCTCTTCACTGGA-3â²), CDK5RAP2 (forward: 5â²-CAGCAAGATGGCAGCAAATG-3â², reverse: 5â²-GTCACAGGAGAGCGAGTCAA-3â²), IL17Ra (forward: 5-AATACCACAGTTCCCAAGCCAG-3â², reverse: 5â²-CAGGTCTGCTACGGGCAAG-3â²), PHC1 (forward: 5â²-CCATCGGGGTCAAGAGGAC-3â², reverse: 5â²-TGATGCCCTGTAACTCTGGC-3â²), CDK6 (forward: 5â²-ACGTGGTCAGGTTGTTTGATG-3â², reverse: 5â²-CGGGCTCTGGAACTTTATCC-3â²), ASPM (forward: 5â²-CCGTACAGCTTGCTCCTTGT-3â², reverse: 5â²-GGCGTTGTCCAATATCTTTCCA-3â²), Microcephalin (forward: 5â²-AAGAAGAAAAGCCAACGAGAACA-3â², reverse: 5â²-CTCGGGTGCGAATGAAAAGC-3â²), CASC5 (forward: 5-TCGCTGAAGTGGAAACAGAAAC-3â², reverse: 5â²-TATCTGAGCAAGGGTCTGCG-3â²), CENPJ (forward: 5â²-TGGATGCCTGGAAGAGAGCA-3â², reverse: 5â²-TAGATAGATTTCCTTGTGCTGGC-3â²), CEP135 (forward: 5â²-CCAAAGCCGAGAAACCTCCA-3, reverse: 5â²-ATTGCTCGCTCTCGTTCGTA-3â²), ZNF335 (forward: 5â²-GCCAACCGCAGATTCAAGTG-3â², reverse: 5â²-GAAGGTGCGGTAGGGACAAA-3â²), GAPDH (forward: 5â²-GTGAAGCAGGCATCTGAGGG-3â², reverse: 5â²-GCCGTATTCATTGTCATACCAGG-3â²).</p>

<title>RNA-seq and transcriptome analysis</title>
<p>Whole ZIKV-infected E17.5 fetal brains or mock control at E13.5 were subject to RNA-seq and transcriptome analysis. Briefly, total RNA was extracted using PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, quantified using NanoDrop ND-2000, and checked for RNA integrity by an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). RNA libraries were generated using TruSeq Stranded RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) following manufacturer's protocol, quantified with Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen), examined for dot distribution with Agilent 2100, and subjected to sequencing using Illumina Hiseq 2000. Acquired data were processed to obtain raw reads, which were then extracted for genome mapping with TopHat (version 2.0.9)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup>. Genes with differential expression levels were identified using edgeR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup>, with GO enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses.</p>

<p>Effects of ZIKV infection on gene expression. <bold>(A)</bold> Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the mRNA levels of cell cycle-related and microcephaly-related genes in ZIKV-injected E17.5 fetal brains. GAPDH was used as the internal control. Data are mean Â± SEM from 3 experiments (<sup>*</sup><italic>P</italic>&lt; 0.05, <sup>**</sup><italic>P</italic>&lt; 0.01, <sup>***</sup><italic>P</italic>&lt; 0.001, NS, no significant difference, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test). <bold>(B</bold>, <bold>C)</bold> RNA-seq and GO analyses reveal pathways that are significantly up-regulated <bold>(B)</bold> and significantly down-regulated <bold>(C)</bold> in ZIKV-injected E17.5 fetal brains compared with control samples. Bar plots show the âlog10 <italic>P</italic> values of each term of genes.</p>

<p>Effect of ZIKV infection on brain development of fetal mice. <bold>(A)</bold> Serial coronal brain sections as illustrated (left) were stained with DAPI (right). Numbers indicate selected corresponding sections. Scale bar, 500 Î¼m. <bold>(B</bold>-<bold>D)</bold> Quantification of the length of outer cortical surface <bold>(B)</bold>, the lateral ventricle area <bold>(C)</bold>, and the perimeter lining the ventricular surface <bold>(D)</bold> in indicated sections. Data are shown as mean Â± SEM from three offspring mice (<sup>*</sup><italic>P</italic>&lt; 0.05, <sup>**</sup><italic>P</italic>&lt; 0.01, <sup>***</sup><italic>P</italic>&lt; 0.001, NS, no significant difference, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test). <bold>(E)</bold> E17.5 brain slices in corresponding position from mock or ZIKV-infected group were stained with antibodies against superfical layer marker Satb2 or deep layer marker Ctip2, respectively. Scale bar, 100 Î¼m. <bold>(F)</bold> Quantification of the relative thickness of Satb2 or Ctip2 positive layers relative to the total cortex expressed as a percentage with the thickness of the entire cortex being 100%. There is no significant difference between two groups in each layer.</p>
