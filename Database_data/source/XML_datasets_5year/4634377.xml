<abstract>
<p>ATP6AP2, an essential accessory component of the vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase), has been associated with intellectual disability (ID) and Parkinsonism. ATP6AP2 has been implicated in several signalling pathways; however, little is known regarding its role in the nervous system. To decipher its function in behaviour and cognition, we generated and characterized conditional knockdowns of <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> in the nervous system of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse models. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> knockdown induced defective phototaxis and vacuolated photoreceptor neurons and pigment cells when depleted in eyes and altered short- and long-term memory when depleted in the mushroom body. In mouse, conditional <italic>Atp6ap2</italic> deletion in glutamatergic neurons (<italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> mice) caused increased spontaneous locomotor activity and altered fear memory. Both <italic>Drosophila ATP6AP2</italic> knockdown and <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> mice presented with presynaptic transmission defects, and with an abnormal number and morphology of synapses. In addition, <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> mice showed autophagy defects that led to axonal and neuronal degeneration in the cortex and hippocampus. Surprisingly, axon myelination was affected in our mutant mice, and axonal transport alterations were observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In accordance with the identified phenotypes across species, genome-wide transcriptome profiling of <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> mouse hippocampi revealed dysregulation of genes involved in myelination, action potential, membrane-bound vesicles and motor behaviour. In summary, <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> disruption in mouse and fly leads to cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration, mimicking aspects of the neuropathology associated with <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> mutations in humans. Our results identify <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> as an essential gene for the nervous system.</p>

<body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>ATP6AP2</italic> has been associated with cognitive disorders based on a mutation identified in one family with seven affected males presenting with mild-to-moderate intellectual disabilities, delayed motor milestones and speech acquisition, and generalised tonic-clonic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C2">2</xref>). However, the implication of <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> in intellectual disabilities has been questioned after an <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> mutation was identified in a single male within a cohort of 6500 sequenced control exomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C3">3</xref>). More recently, another family with Parkinsonian features and variably penetrant spasticity was reported to have an <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C5">5</xref>). The mutations identified in these two families are different splicing mutations that give rise to skipping of exon 4 of the <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> gene in both cases.</p><p>ATP6AP2 was described as a receptor for renin and prorenin ((P)RR). The binding of renin or (P)RR to the ATP6AP2 extracellular domain activates the renin–angiotensin system, leading to the production of angiotensin II and also to activation of other pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C6">6</xref>). However, ATP6AP2 is also found in invertebrates such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, which do not possess the renin–angiotensin system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C7">7</xref>), suggesting alternative functions for ATP6AP2. Indeed, this protein was also isolated as an accessory component of the vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C8">8</xref>). V-ATPase is a multisubunit proton pump that consists of a V0 proton-translocation domain, a V1 pump domain and two associated proteins, Ac45 and ATP6AP2. This pump is responsible for the acidification of intracellular and some extracellular compartments and thus is crucial for many fundamental processes that require an intact membrane-trafficking system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C9">9</xref>), including endocytosis, protein and signalling molecule processing, protein sorting and trafficking, and lysosomal and autophagosomal enzyme activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C10">10</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with its fundamental role, several studies regarding ATP6AP2 in mouse, zebrafish, frog and <italic>Drosophila</italic> have shown that its full deletion is lethal (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C11">11</xref>). Moreover, the tissue-specific deletion of <italic>Atp6ap2</italic> in mouse cardiomyocytes and podocytes also leads to lethality, as both conditional knockout mice died between 2 and 3 weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C14">14</xref>). Concomitantly, multivesicular bodies and autophagic vacuoles accumulated in the tissues with deleted <italic>Atp6ap2</italic> owing to autophagic flux alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C14">14</xref>). Recent work in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc epithelium has demonstrated that ATP6AP2 (VhaM8.9/VhaPRR) is required for V-ATPase function in vesicular acidification, endosomal sorting and protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C15">15</xref>). In addition, ATP6AP2 was shown to be essential for both of the Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling pathways in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C18">18</xref>). Whereas Cruciat and collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C17">17</xref>) identified <italic>Xenopus</italic> ATP6AP2/(P)RR as an adaptor between V-ATPase and the Wnt complex, Hermle and collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C18">18</xref>) found that its function in proper trafficking of the planar cell polarity molecular core machinery in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc is independent of V-ATPase.</p><p>Surprisingly little is known regarding the function of ATP6AP2 in the nervous system, the tissue type most prominently affected in humans with <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> mutations. In zebrafish, the absence of ATP6AP2/(P)RR induces necrosis in the central nervous system, eventually resulting in embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C19">19</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, ATP6AP2/(P)RR is required for mediating Wnt signalling during early CNS development, including neural patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C20">20</xref>). In mouse, Atp6ap2 regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis via Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/PCP signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C21">21</xref>). Whether ATP6AP2 executes specific roles in postmitotic neurons that can directly underlie impaired cognitive and motor functions in individuals with <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> mutations is unclear; however, this question is important in the light of the unclear causative role of this gene in intellectual disabilities (ID) and Parkinsonism with spasticity. To decipher the function of <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> in behaviour and cognition, we generated and characterized conditional <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> knockouts in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse nervous system models.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>Drosophila ATP6AP2</italic> knockdown in the eye causes defective phototaxis and ultrastructural defects, and knockdown in the mushroom body causes defects in short- and long-term memory</title><p>First, we investigated the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of the ID candidate gene <italic>ATP6AP2</italic>, also termed <italic>VhaM8.9/VhaPRR</italic> and from here on referred to as <italic>ATP6AP2</italic>, in a combination of <italic>Drosophila</italic> phototactic behaviour and morphological studies on the fly eye as primary readouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C22">22</xref>). We used the UAS-Gal4 system and two independent conditional RNAi constructs, <italic>UAS-ATP6AP2<sup>RNAi1</sup></italic> and <italic>UAS-ATP6AP2<sup>RNAi2</sup></italic>, to induce <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> knockdown in the developing eye with the <italic>GMR-Gal4; UAS-Dicer-2</italic> driver. The potency of both lines to induce knockdown was confirmed by qPCR (see Materials and Methods). Both lines were effective, with <italic>UAS-ATP6AP2<sup>RNAi1</sup></italic> inducing slightly stronger knockdown compared with <italic>UAS-ATP6AP2<sup>RNAi2</sup></italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv380/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>A). <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> eye-specific knockdown did not result in external eye morphology phenotypes (data not shown) but dramatically affected performance in the phototaxis assay. Whereas the genetic background control animals were strongly attracted by light [phototaxis index (PI) = 5.2], the majority of <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> eye-specific knockdown animals remained in the first vial, resulting in PIs of merely 2.3 for both RNAi conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F1">1</xref>A and data not shown). This finding suggested potential dysfunction of <italic>ATP6AP2</italic>-deficient photoreceptor (PR) neurons. To obtain further insights into the cellular basis of these defects, we analysed the structural integrity of PRs by histological semi- and ultrathin sectioning. While <italic>ATP6AP2</italic>-deficient ommatidia and PRs showed overall intact organization, PR-surrounding pigment cells were highly vacuolated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F1">1</xref>B, asterisk). Electron microscopy of PRs revealed a large number of accumulated vesicular structures in PR cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F1">1</xref>C, arrowheads). Interestingly, identical phenotypes, low PI, vacuolated pigment cells and large vesicular structures in PRs were observed upon knockdown of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> V-ATPase subunit Vha100-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F1">1</xref>A–C, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv380/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>A, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C22">22</xref>), whose homologue, ATP6V0A2, is also implicated in ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C23">23</xref>).

Then, to determine which cell types express Atp6ap2, we performed colocalization studies. In the cortex and the hippocampus, we did not detect Atp6ap2 expression in astrocytes (GFAP marker, data not shown); however, considering the limited sensitivity of immunohistochemistry, we cannot exclude that Atp6ap2 is expressed at low level. We observed Atp6ap2 expression in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons as revealed by its colocalization with Camk2a-positive cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F2">2</xref>C and F) and GAD67-positive cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F2">2</xref>E and H), respectively. All Atp6ap2-positive cells were either positive for Camk2a or GAD67, suggesting that Atp6ap2 is expressed primarily in neurons in the cortex and hippocampus.

Indeed, <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> mice exhibit pronounced deficits in freezing behaviour when re-exposed to a context in which they received electric footshock previously (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F4">4</xref>E). Recently, we demonstrated that efficacy at hippocampal projections to the basolateral amygdala is of crucial importance for the aversive conditioned response in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C28">28</xref>). We defined some experimental conditions that allow the functional isolation of Hip-BLA projections using opsin-based strategies combined with genetic deletion of <italic>Atp6ap2</italic> in the presynaptic compartment. Specifically, co-injections of AAV-Cre and AAV-ChR2-GFP viruses were performed in the caudal hippocampus, and after a delay allowing both opsin expression and Atp6ap2 removal, electrophysiological recordings were performed in BLA principal neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F5">5</xref>B and C). To verify that the AAV-Cre strategy efficiently depleted endogenous Atp6ap2 proteins, we performed immunodetection of Atp6ap2 at the infection site by visualizing GFP expression associated with AAV-ChR2 infection. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F5">5</xref>B, there is a clear absence of Atp6ap2 labelling in the GFP-expressing area. Next we compared synaptic transmission between groups of mice in which AAV-ChR2-GFP was used solely (wt-pre) or together with AAV-Cre (KO-pre) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F5">5</xref>D–F). First, to assess for global changes in synaptic efficacy, we applied single, short, 460-nm light flashes of increasing amplitude while recording BLA principal cells at −70 mV in the voltage-clamp mode, thereby building so-called input/output (I/O) curves. We did not observe any difference between the two recording groups (data not shown), suggesting that the presence of Atp6ap2 within the pre-synapse is not essential for basal neurotransmission. Next, to investigate whether Atp6ap2 would affect short-term plasticity, we tested responses to paired stimulations applied at short (50 ms) time intervals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F5">5</xref>D). A very pronounced paired pulse depression (PPD) was observed in the control group (wt-pre) (wt-pre: Peak 2: 0.11 ± 0.02% of Peak 1, <italic>n</italic> = 33, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F5">5</xref>D–F).

The <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ), which is a well-established model system for mammalian central excitatory/glutamatergic synapses, has already provided major insights into synapse biology underlying ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C30">30</xref>). The NMJ synaptic terminal is organized into synaptic boutons that resemble pearls on a string, each containing numerous chemical synapses for vesicle release, so-called active zones (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv380/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S6</ext-link>). We knocked down <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> presynaptically using the pan-neuronal elav-Gal4 driver and examined NMJ morphology. Computer-assisted quantification of immunolabelling with the postsynaptic marker DLG, highlighting the overall morphology of the synaptic terminal, and with the key presynaptic scaffold protein BRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C31">31</xref>), an integral component of active zones, revealed undergrowth of the synaptic terminal in both <italic>ATP6AP2<sup>RNAi1</sup></italic> and <italic>ATP6AP2<sup>RNAi2</sup></italic> conditions and a reduced number of active zones in the stronger knockdown condition (<italic>ATP6AP2<sup>RNAi1</sup></italic>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F6">6</xref>A and B). Furthermore, we noticed a high number of so-called satellite boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C32">32</xref>), small immature extra-boutons splitting off from the primary synaptic terminal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F6">6</xref>C). Because satellite boutons, to our surprise, seemed more frequent in the otherwise weaker <italic>ATP6AP2<sup>RNAi2</sup></italic>-induced knockdown condition, we followed up with a second presynaptic marker, synaptotagmin (anti-Syt), which highlights bouton organization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F6">6</xref>D). Anti-Syt staining revealed a striking increase in satellite boutons also in the <italic>ATP6AP2<sup>RNAi1</sup></italic> knockdown synapses. Frequently, satellites remain extremely small in this severe condition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F6">6</xref>D, arrowheads). Bouton organization of the primary synaptic terminal was also affected consistently in both <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> knockdown conditions, with boutons not being properly separated and spaced but fused, with some fused to the degree that individual boutons were no longer quantifiable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F6">6</xref>D). Ultrastructural analysis of <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> knockdown synapses revealed the presence of large multivesicular body-like organelles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F6">6</xref>E, asterisk). The ultrastructure of T-bars at active zones was also perturbed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F6">6</xref>F). We conclude that the loss of ATP6AP2 impairs the growth of synaptic terminals, promotes satellite bouton formation and affects bouton, subsynaptic and ultrastructural organization.

Several alterations were observed in the <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> mice. First, we revealed the presence of an important number of degenerating neurons in both the cortex and hippocampus of the <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> mice but not in the wt mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F7">7</xref>A–D); the hippocampus seemed to be more affected than the cortex. The process of neuronal death was not apoptosis, as determined by the lack of cleaved caspase 3 signal in the cortex and the hippocampus of <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> mice (data not shown). Rather, cells die from necrosis as suggested in electron microscopy images showing features of necrotic cells: absence of fragmented nuclei, presence of empty cytoplasm and dilatation of mitochondria and of the rough ER (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F7">7</xref>B and D). In addition, we showed that neuronal degeneration is accompanied by the degeneration of axons, particularly myelinated axons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F7">7</xref>E–L). We also observed reductions in myelin thickness in both degenerating and non-degenerating axons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F7">7</xref>F, H, J and L). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F7">7</xref>F and 7H, the reduced myelin thickness is due to a decreased number of myelin wraps around axons. Some axons also had disturbed microtubules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F7">7</xref>F). Finally, we observed the presence of an increased number of vacuoles in the neurons of mutant mice (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F7">7</xref>Q–T). Because several publications reported the involvement of the autophagy pathway in the phenotype induced by <italic>Atp6ap2</italic> deletion in podocytes and cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C14">14</xref>) and because we observed an increased number of vacuoles in neurons in the <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> cortex and hippocampus, we tested whether autophagy would be perturbed in our mouse model. We used immunohistochemistry to examine the protein levels of p62 and UBQLN2, two autophagy substrates reflecting autophagy activity, in brain sections from <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> and wt mice. We observed increased p62 and UBQLN2 staining in the cortex and hippocampus of mutant mice in comparison with the wt mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F8">8</xref>). The most affected area was the CA3 area of the hippocampus, with massive increases in p62 and UBQLN2 staining, which corresponded to an increased number of dying neurons in this region, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F8">8</xref>D and L. The dentate gyrus was also highly affected, and the CA1 area and cortex seemed to be less affected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDV380F8">8</xref>).

The fear conditioning defect observed in the mouse model could be attributed to the defective hippocampal-to-basolateral amygdala transmission. Indeed, the efficiency at hippocampal projections to the basolateral amygdala was shown to be of crucial importance for the aversive conditioned response in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C28">28</xref>).</p><p>At the cellular level, <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> appears to play a crucial and pleiotropic role at various membrane compartments. In neurons, it localized primarily to the ER and to a lesser extent to lysosomes and autophagosomes. Its deletion in mouse glutamatergic neurons induced an increase in the number vacuoles in cortical and hippocampal neurons. Similarly, its knockdown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye led to vacuolated photoreceptor-surrounding pigment cells and induced ectopic multivesicular body-like membrane compartments in photoreceptor neurons. In addition, we observed strong accumulation of two autophagy substrates, p62 and UBQLN2, in the cortex and hippocampus of <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> mice. These results suggest a defect in lysosome-mediated protein degradation and, thus, autophagic activity. Interestingly, this defect corresponds to the situation observed in the Parkinsonism and spasticity (XPDS) patient brains where Korvatska and collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C5">5</xref>) observed a massive accumulation of p62/SQSTM1. Autophagy defects have also been observed in cardiomyocyte and podocyte conditional <italic>Atp6ap2</italic> mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C14">14</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Hermle and collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C15">15</xref>) also suggested a role for ATP6AP2/(P)RR in protein degradation. We propose that one primary function of ATP6AP2 in neurons is to regulate autolysosomal material digestion. This hypothesis is supported by the tight physical and functional association of ATP6AP2 with V-ATPase and by the identification of V-ATPase V0 subunit A1 among the down-regulated genes in <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> hippocampi. Indeed, the V-ATPase complex is a major element of lysosomes and autolysosomes, where it acidifies the vesicle lumen. Vesicle acidification is required for the activation of lysosomal enzymes. The absence of Atp6ap2 in glutamatergic neurons may induce a perturbation of V-ATPase function in lysosomes, resulting in defective lysosome acidification and, thus, defective activation of lysosomal enzymes and defective digestion of lysosomal substrates. We suggest that this deregulated autophagy induces the axonal and neuronal degeneration observed in the cortex and hippocampus of <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> mice. Indeed, neurons, particularly axons, are well known to be highly sensible to autophagy dysregulation, resulting in degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C35">35</xref>).</p><p>One unexpected finding of this study is the consequence of <italic>Atp6ap2</italic> neuronal inactivation on myelin. Indeed, <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> mice showed decreased amount of myelin layers and reduction in the total thickness of myelin sheath in the cortex and hippocampus. In addition, we identified the enrichment of dysregulated genes expressed predominantly in oligodendrocytes and implicated in regulating myelination. Nevertheless, the decreased thickness of the myelin sheath in <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> mice seems to be a secondary effect of <italic>Atp6ap2</italic> loss in glutamatergic neurons, and the up-regulation of oligodendrocyte myelination genes may be a compensatory effect of oligodendrocytes to counteract decreased myelination. Myelin deficits or defective glial/neuronal interactions have already been found in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C36">36</xref>) and Rett syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C37">37</xref>) and in adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C38">38</xref>).</p><p>At the synapse level, we demonstrated both morphological and functional aberrations in mouse and <italic>Drosophila</italic> models. In mouse, we observed reduced synapse width in the cortex and hippocampus of <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> mice with synapse splitting. Similarly, pan-neuronal <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> knockdown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> led to a reduction in presynaptic terminal size, with abnormal organization of boutons and an increased number of satellite boutons. We also observed defects in subsynaptic organization, including the presence of atypically elongated vesicles in the mouse cortical and hippocampal presynaptic compartments and abnormal active zones in presynaptic terminals of <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs. These converging data suggest a role for ATP6AP2 in synaptic vesicle homeostasis, which is in agreement with a close functional relationship of ATP6AP2 with V-ATPase and its role in synaptic vesicle acidification. V-ATPase is required for synaptic vesicles loading with neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C39">39</xref>). In addition, the V0 domain of V-ATPase is part of a complex involved in the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane and thus participates in the regulation of neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C40">40</xref>). Poea-Guyon and collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C41">41</xref>) also proposed that V-ATPase, as a sensor of intravesicular pH, informs the exocytosis machinery of the contents of synaptic vesicles to avoid exocytosis of unloaded vesicles. The absence of ATP6AP2 could perturb V-ATPase function in synaptic vesicles and thus disturb synaptic vesicle loading and/or fusion. In addition to morphological alteration, we also provided evidence for defective synaptic transmission. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> knockdown in photoreceptor neurons caused synaptic transmission defects. In mouse, we showed a decreased release probability of excitatory synapses at the hippocampal to basolateral amygdala connections. However, the reduced presynaptic release probability could also be partly explained by the reduced number of excited fibres owing to axonal degeneration. Altogether, our results confirm an important role for ATP6AP2 in regulating synaptic size, connections and synaptic vesicles, with consequences for presynaptic transmission.</p><p>One family with <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> mutation was reported to have epilepsy, hence, we tested the mouse model for epilepsy susceptibility. We did not observed spontaneous epilepsy in <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> mice and mutant mice even had reduced susceptibility to epilepsy induced by PTZ administration. In our mouse model, <italic>Atp6ap2</italic> is deleted only in Camk2a-positive neurons, i.e. excitatory neurons, but not in inhibitory neurons. Thus, considering the important role of inhibitory neurons in preventing epilepsy, we cannot exclude that the absence of epilepsy could be due to the absence of <italic>Atp6ap2</italic> deletion in the inhibitory neurons.</p><p>Transcriptome analysis of <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> hippocampi revealed up-regulated genes related to myelination, motor behaviour and action potential regulation and down-regulated genes implicated in membrane-bound vesicles, showing a striking correlation with the behavioural and physiological phenotypes observed in mouse and fly. This finding suggests that some of the observed phenotypes could be linked to aberrant signalling converging onto transcription. The effects of <italic>Atp6ap2</italic> deletion on transcription regulation may be direct or indirect. <italic>Atp6ap2</italic> deletion could have indirect effect on gene transcription as suggested for the transcriptional changes observed in genes implicated in myelination mainly expressed in oligodendrocyte; however, this deletion could also affect transcriptional responses directly, e.g. via the Wnt signalling pathway or the MAP kinases ERK1/2 pathway. Indeed, several studies have implicated ATP6AP2 in Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C21">21</xref>). Notably, with its smaller synaptic terminals and many satellite boutons, <italic>Drosophila ATP6AP2</italic> knockdown synapses showed striking similarities to mutants defective in Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C44">44</xref>). In addition, <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> mice showed partially overlapping behavioural phenotypes with Wnt/β-catenin mouse models because down- or up-regulation of the Wnt pathway (with injection of the Wnt antagonist Dkkk-1 or Wnt1 peptide) affected contextual and cued fear memory, spatial memory in the Morris water maze and novel object recognition but did not affect baseline locomotor activity and anxiety behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C45">45</xref>). ATP6AP2, also known as (pro)renin receptor, is also involved in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Activation of ATP6AP2 by (pro)renin binding could trigger the activation of two independent pathways, one resulting in the generation of angiotensin at the cell surface and the activation of its receptors and signalling pathways (including the MAP kinases ERK1/2 pathway) and another resulting in direct activation of the MAP kinases ERK1/2 pathway and the promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger transcription factor (PLZF) by activated ATP6AP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C49">49</xref>). It has been shown that the RAS plays an important role in brain physiological processes such as learning, memory and cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C50">50</xref>). Moreover, several members of MAP kinases ERK1/2 pathway have been implicated in ID, including <italic>RSK2</italic>, which is responsible for the Coffin Lowry syndrome. Further studying the role of ATP6AP2 in transcription regulation and, specifically, to what extent the synaptic and behavioural phenotypes observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse models result from abnormal Wnt and/or MAP kinases ERK1/2 signalling will be extremely interesting.</p><p>We demonstrated that <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> depletion in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse induced behavioural, neuronal and synaptic phenotypes that lead to cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration, which greatly recapitulates the phenotypes associated with <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> mutations in human. The two <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> mutations identified in humans so far are splicing mutations, both leading to the skipping of the exon 4 of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C5">5</xref>). This results in significant overexpression (∼50%) of a 150-bp minor splice isoform, which produces a protein with an internal deletion of 32 amino acids, and concomitant reduction of the major full size transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C5">5</xref>). Contrepas and collaborators suggested that ATP6AP2 protein lacking exon 4 (Δ4 ATP6AP2) would act as a dominant negative through dimerization with ATP6AP2 wild-type proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C51">51</xref>). In XPDS patients, a reduction of the total amount of ATP6AP2 proteins was observed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C5">5</xref>). In contradiction, another <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> mutation was identified in a male within a cohort of 6500 sequenced control exomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C3">3</xref>). This mutation is also a splicing mutation affecting the last exon of the gene; however, it has never been validated and the consequences of the mutation remain unclear. As we demonstrated that <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> deletion in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse has drastic consequences on neurons, supporting its involvement as a causative gene for ID and Parkinsonism, we suggest that <italic>ATP6AP2</italic> should be considered when screening patients with X-linked intellectual disabilities with epilepsy and/or Parkinsonism with spasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDV380C5">5</xref>).

After training, the males were isolated for 1 h (short-term memory, STM) or 24 h (long-term memory, LTM), transferred to a 1-cm diameter chamber and filmed for 10 min in the presence of a new pre-mated female. The courtship behaviour of male flies towards females was quantified using Actual FlyTrack software (Actual Analytics Ltd). The mean courtship indexes (CI, the percentage of time spent on courtship during a 10-min interval) of trained males and of socially naïve males were used to calculate the learning index (LI), which is defined as the per cent reduction in mean courtship activity in trained males compared with naïve males; LI = (CI<sub>naive</sub>–CI<sub>trained</sub>)/CI<sub>naive</sub>.

The results are expressed per 1-h period.</p><p>The open-field test: mice were tested in automated open fields (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain); each field was divided virtually into central and peripheral regions. The open fields were placed in a room homogeneously illuminated at 70 Lux. Each mouse was placed in the periphery of the open field and allowed to explore the apparatus freely for 30 min with the experimenter out of the animal's sight. The distance travelled, the number of rears and time spent in the central and peripheral regions were recorded over the test session. The number of entries and the percentage of time spent in centre area are used as indexes of emotionality/anxiety.</p><p>Social recognition test: this task is used to evaluate the preference of a mouse for a congener compared with an object placed in an opposite compartment. The apparatus is a transparent runway composed of a central starting box and two goal boxes delimited by a sliding grid at each extremity of the runway. Testing was performed for two consecutive days. On the first day, fresh bedding was placed in the goal boxes. The mouse was placed in the start box for 30 s and then allowed to explore the apparatus freely for 10 min to attenuate their emotionality and to evaluate any potential preference between the two compartments. On the second day, a B6N congener of the same gender was placed in one goal box, and an object (dice for example) was placed in the opposite goal box. The mouse was placed in the start box for 30 s and then allowed to explore the apparatus freely for 10 min. The position of the congener and object boxes was counterbalanced to avoid any potential spatial preference. The duration of exploration of each goal box (when the mouse is sniffing the grid delimiting the goal box) was measured, and the percentage of time the mouse took to explore the congener was used as an index of social preference (recognition preference). The number of entries, the time spent in each goal arm and the vertical activity in each arm were also measured.

The open fields were placed in a room homogeneously illuminated at 70 Lux at the level of each open field. The objects to be discriminated were a glass marble (2.5 cm diameter) and a plastic dice (2 cm). The animals were first habituated to the open field for 30 min.

The time the animal took to explore Object A (when the animal's snout was directed towards the object at a distance of ≤1 cm) was recorded manually. A 10 min retention trial was performed 3 h later.

A loudspeaker and a bright light constituted the sources of the cues during conditioning and cue testing. The general activity of the animals was recorded through the infrared cell placed at the ceiling of the chambers and was recorded directly on a PC computer using Graphic State (Coulbourn). For conditioning, the mice were allowed to acclimate for 4 min, and then a light/tone (10 kHz) CS was presented for 20 s and co-terminated by a mild (1 s, 0.4 mA) footshock (US). The mice were returned to their home cages 2 min later. Testing was performed 24 h following the conditioning session. Testing for the context was performed in the morning. The mouse was placed back into the same chamber that was used for the conditioning and allowed to explore for 6 min without presentation of the light/auditory CS. Testing for the cue was performed in the afternoon (∼5 h after the context testing). The contextual environment of the chambers was changed (wall colour, odour and floor texture). The mouse was placed in the new chamber, allowed to habituate for 2 min, and then presented with light/auditory cues for 2 min. This sequence was repeated once again.

The positions of bregma and lambda points were defined and adjusted to the same horizontal level. Injection coordinates for the caudal hippocampus were [AP] −3.1–3.3 mm, [ML] ±3.2–3.4 mm and [DV] −4.0 mm.</p><p>Acute slice preparations: AAV-infected mice were used to prepare coronal basolateral amygdala (BLA)-containing acute slices. Owing to animal age (3 months old at the time of dissection), we used the ‘protective recovery method’ described at <uri xlink:href="http://www.brainslicemethods.com">http://www.brainslicemethods.com</uri>. Briefly, mice were anesthetised with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine (100 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and cardiac-perfused with ice-cold, oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) cutting solution (NMDG) containing 93 m<sc>m</sc> NMDG, 93 m<sc>m</sc> HCl, 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> KCl, 1.2 m<sc>m</sc> NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 30 m<sc>m</sc> NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 m<sc>m</sc> glucose, 10 m<sc>m</sc> MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 m<sc>m</sc> sodium ascorbate, 3 m<sc>m</sc> sodium pyruvate, 2 m<sc>m</sc> thiourea and 12 m<sc>m</sc> N-acetyl-<sc>l</sc>-cysteine (pH 7.3–7.4, with osmolarity of 300–310 mOsm). The brains were removed rapidly and placed in the ice-cold and oxygenated NMDG cutting solution described earlier. Coronal slices (300 μm) were prepared using a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica Microsystems, USA) and transferred to a 32°C incubation chamber containing the same NMDG cutting solution. After the slides were incubated, they were maintained at room temperature in oxygenated modified ACSF containing 92 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> KCl, 1.2 m<sc>m</sc> NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 30 m<sc>m</sc> NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES, 25 m<sc>m</sc> glucose, 2 m<sc>m</sc> MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 m<sc>m</sc> CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 m<sc>m</sc> sodium ascorbate, 3 m<sc>m</sc> sodium pyruvate, 2 m<sc>m</sc> thiourea and 12 m<sc>m</sc>

Bellen). Type 1b NMJs of muscle 4 were analysed after dissection of wandering L3 larvae and fixation in 3.7% PFA for 30 min. Preparations were rinsed with PBS, blocked and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) supplemented with 5% normal goat serum (NGS) for 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBST with 1% NGS and incubated with the preparations overnight at 4°C. Alexa Fluor 488 and 568 secondary antibodies (1:1000; Invitrogen Molecular Probes) were incubated with the preparations for 2 h at room temperature. Then, the preparations were extensively washed and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs). Co-labelling with anti-DLG and anti-BRP, both monoclonal antibodies, was performed by direct conjugation of the primary antibody to Alexa 568 using a Zenon Kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence images were acquired using a ZEISS bright-field multi-colour epifluorescence microscope. At least 10 synaptic terminals were analysed per genotype and quantified in ImageJ.</p><p>Drosophila brains: adult brains were dissected in HL3 dissection buffer on ice and immediately fixed in cold 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were then rinsed with PBS containing 1% Tween (PBSTween) and blocked and permeabilized in 0.3% PBSTween with 10% NGS for 2 h at room temperature. For primary antibody treatment, samples were incubated in 0.3% PBTween5% NGS and the anti-Ref(2)p (1:5000, rabbit, G. Juhasz) for 48 h at room temperature. Secondary antibody Cy3 (1:400, Invitrogen Molecular Probes) was incubated for 24 h at room temperature in 0.3% PBTween with 5% NGS. Brains were then mounted in Vectashield<sup>®</sup> (Vector Labs) for 24 h at −20°C before confocal scanning. Image stacks of specimens were imaged on a Leica TCS SP8X confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) using a 20× glycerol objective for whole brain imaging. Images were quantified using Fiji software (Fiji.sc/Fiji). Briefly, confocal stacks were merged into a single plane by using the maximum projection function. Subsequently, region of central brain was manually selected (using the free hand tool) and fluorescence intensity (arbitrary units) was measured and normalized to the area of the central brain for each brain. Non-parametric test and means comparison were made using Mann–Whitney test.</p><p>Mouse: after the behavioural pipeline, 34-week-old <italic>Atp6ap2<sup>Camk2aCre/0</sup></italic> and wt males (four of each genotype) were deeply anesthetised with pentobarbital and perfused intracardially with 30 ml of PBS, followed by perfusion with 30 ml of 4% PFA in PBS. The brains were dissected, postfixed for at least 48 h in 4% formalin solution and washed in 70% ethanol. After the brains were embedded in paraffin, they were cut into 5-µm thick frontal sections. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a standard protocol. Briefly, antigen retrieval was performed by heating the slides in citric acid buffer (10 m<sc>m</sc> citric acid, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0) or Tris/EDTA buffer (10 m<sc>m</sc> Tris Base, 1 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 9.0) for 45 min in a 94°C water bath. Then, the sections were blocked with 10% normal horse serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with the appropriate primary antibody (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv380/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>). The primary antibodies were detected by incubating the sections with Alexa Fluor 488- or 555-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500; Invitrogen Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the sections were mounted with Mowiol mounting medium [0.1 <sc>m</sc> Tris (pH 8.5), 25% glycerol, 10% w/v Mowiol 4–88 (Citifluor)] containing DAPI (5 μg/ml), and images were acquired using a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer 2.0 (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan) and a Leica DMRXA2 epifluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Drosophila eye: <italic>UAS-ATP6AP2<sup>RNAi1</sup></italic>, <italic>UAS-ATP6AP2<sup>RNAi2</sup></italic> and <italic>UAS-Vha100-1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> with their corresponding genetic background control lines were crossed with <italic>GMR-Gal4</italic> virgins and raised at 25°C.

The larvae were postfixed on ice in the dark with 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> in 0.8% KFeCN, washed with NaCac buffer for 1 h and stained with 1% uranyl acetate (UAc). Subsequently, the preparations were dehydrated in ethanol and propylene oxide and embedded in a single drop of Epon. Muscle 4 of abdominal segments 2 to 5 was dissected, and multiple muscles were stacked and embedded in an Epon block, which was heated overnight at 60°C for polymerization. Ultrathin sections (50–70 nm) were prepared using a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome (Leica), mounted on copper electron microscopy grids and counter stained using UAc and lead citrate. The sections were examined at varying nominal magnifications using a 100 kV Philips CM100 microscope equipped with a F114 Fastscan CCD camera (TVIPS) or using a 120 kV Tecnai Spirit microscope equipped with a 2 k Eagle CCD camera (FEI).</p><p>Mice: 12- to 14-week-old mice (three of each genotype) were deeply anesthetised with pentobarbital and perfused intracardially with 30 ml of PBS, followed by perfusion with 30 ml of 4% PFA in PBS. The brain was dissected and put in 4% PFA solution in PBS at 4°C. Then, one portion of the cortex and hippocampus was processed for morphological analysis by immersion in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2.5% paraformaldehyde in cacodylate buffer (0.1 <sc>m</sc>, pH 7.4), postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 <sc>m</sc> cacodylate buffer for 1 h at 4°C and dehydrated through graded ethanol (50, 70, 90 and 100%) and propylene oxide for 30 min each. The samples were embedded in Epon 812. Semi-thin sections were cut at 2 µm with an ultramicrotome (Leica Ultracut UCT), stained with toluidine blue and analysed histologically by light microscopy. Ultrathin sections were cut at 70 nm, contrast strained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined at 70 kv using a Morgagni 268D electron microscope. Images were captured digitally using a Mega View III camera (Soft Imaging System). The other portion of the cortex and hippocampus was processed for immunogold experiment by fixation for 1 h in 2% PFA—0.2% glutaraldehyde solution in PBS. Then, the brains were blocked in a solution of 0.1% NaBH<sub>4</sub> in PBS and in a second solution composed of 5% BSA, 0.1% CWFSkin gelatin and 1% NGS (Aurion). Next, the brains were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with ATP6ap2 antibody (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddv380/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>), which was diluted in 1% NGS in PBS and then incubated with secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody, which was coupled to gold ultra-small particles (Aurion) and diluted in 1% NGS in PBS, for 2 h 30 min at room temperature. After the brains were washed, they were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde solution in PBS. Silver enhancement of gold ultra-small particles was performed using R-Gent SE-EM (Aurion).

Then total RNA was treated with DNase (Qiagen, 79254) and purified using an RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, 74204). In total, 2000 ng of total RNA was treated with a Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (human/mouse/rat; Illumina MRZH11124). The depleted RNA was precipitated for 1 h at −80°C in three volumes of ethanol plus 1 µg of glycogen. Then, the RNA was washed and resuspended in 36 µl of RNase-free water. RNA fragmentation buffer (NEBNext<sup>®</sup> Magnesium RNA Fragmentation Module, E6150S) was added to the solution, and the RNA was fragmented by incubation at 95°C for 3 min. For reverse transcription, cDNA first-strand synthesis was performed with random hexamer primers. cDNA second-strand synthesis was performed with dNTPs to ensure strand specificity. The RNA-seq library was synthesized using a KAPA Hyper prep kit (KK8504), and a treatment with USER enzyme (NEB, M5505L) was added to digest the non-specific strand. The libraries were pooled (4/lane), sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq and yielded ∼40 million single-end reads per sample. The complete data set and the processed data were submitted to Geo (GSE 67541). The RNA-seq libraries were mapped using GSNAP, the gene expression counts were calculated with a custom C++ script and DEseq2 was used to call the dysregulated genes.
