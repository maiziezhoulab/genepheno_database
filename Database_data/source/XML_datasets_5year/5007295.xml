<abstract>
<p>Microglia are the immune cells of the central nervous system that play important roles in brain pathologies. Microglia also help shape neuronal circuits during development, via phagocytosing weak synapses and regulating neurogenesis. Using <italic>in vivo</italic> multiphoton imaging of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the developing somatosensory cortex, we demonstrate here that microglial contact with dendrites directly induces filopodia formation. This filopodia formation occurs only around postnatal day 8–10, a period of intense synaptogenesis and when microglia have an activated phenotype. Filopodia formation is preceded by contact-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and actin accumulation. Inhibition of microglia by genetic ablation decreases subsequent spine density, functional excitatory synapses and reduces the relative connectivity from layer 4 neurons. Our data provide the direct demonstration of microglial-induced spine formation and provide further insights into immune system regulation of neuronal circuit development, with potential implications for developmental disorders of immune and brain dysfunction.</p>

<p>Increasing evidences point to the important influence immune status and immune molecules have on brain development and function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Maternal infection is a considerable risk factor for the neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Microglia are important components of such immune–brain interactions and defects in microglial genes or signalling molecules are associated with disorders of neuronal circuits and brain behaviour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. As the immune cells of the central nervous system, microglia respond to various brain pathologies, adopt an activated phenotype and secrete a range of cytokines and neuro-trophic factors to modify disease progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. However, microglia also play important roles for normal brain physiology, both in development and in the mature nervous system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In the developing brain, they actively participate in sculpting neuronal circuits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. This includes promoting neuronal apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, regulating neurogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> and eliminating less active synapse structures identified for phagocytosis via expression of traditional immune complement molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. More recent studies have suggested microglia have bidirectional effects on synapses and neuronal circuits by promoting synapse formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Parkhurst <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> demonstrated that selective ablation of microglia reduced spine formation as observed by time-lapse imaging <italic>in vivo</italic>, both during later development and in response to different learning tasks. Selective depletion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from microglia could largely replicate this observation. A role for microglia in enhancing spine density has also been suggested from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. Addition of microglial cells to hippocampal neuronal cultures could increase the number of dendritic spines via release of interleukin-10 (IL-10)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, whereas the effect of estradiol to promote increased spine density in cultured pre-optic neurons depends on the presence and function of microglia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Release of cytokines such as IL-10 by microglia is typically associated with an activated microglia phenotype, such as occurs when microglia begin to populate the cortex during early postnatal development. However, (1) how microglia may contribute to functional synapse formation; (2) whether this is a direct result of microglia–neuron interactions; and (3) the functional significance of putative microglia-induced spine formation in development is all unclear. To address these questions, we undertook in this study <italic>in vivo</italic> two-photon time-lapse imaging of neurons and microglia in the developing somatosensory cortex. We observed that microglia directly contacted dendrites and initiated filopodia formation. This effect of microglia was restricted to the period of intense spinogenesis that occurs in the first two postnatal weeks, a time when microglia have an activated morphological phenotype. We propose that filopodia formation by microglia promotes the maturation of specific neuronal circuit connections through the formation of functional mature synapses.</p>

<title>Microglia promote filopodia formation during development</title>
<p>To visualize microglia–dendrite interactions, we performed <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation of embryonic day (E)14–E15 Iba1-EGFP mice with red fluorescent protein (RFP) (tdTomato). This enabled us to successfully image layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons (tdTomato, red) alongside microglia (enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), green; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Subsequent time-lapse imaging in postnatal day (P) 8–P10 pups detected microglia–neuron contacts, as we and others had observed in more mature cortex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. However, in the developing somatosensory cortex, microglia–dendrite contacts were frequently followed by the formation of new dendritic filopodia. Typically, filopodia formation occurred within 10 min following microglia contact, with a median latency of 3 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). Filopodia also developed from dendrites without apparent microglial contacts, but the incidence of new filopodia formation in a dendrite was significantly greater at the microglia contact points (45±4.5%), as compared with non-contact regions at dendritic locations 10 μm (6.3±2.9%) and 20 μm (8.9±3.4%) adjacent to the contact point, and as compared with formation rates in the total dendrite, excluding the contact zone (6.9±1.9%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>; one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), <italic>post-hoc</italic> Bonfferoni test, error bars are mean ±s.e.m.; exact <italic>P</italic>-value is <italic>P</italic>=0.0000002, exact F-value is F(3, 77)=20.2; <italic>n</italic>=8 animals). The typical duration of microglia–dendrite contacts was about 9 min and this contact duration was the same whether contact was followed by filopodia formation (duration of contact 9.0±1.6 min) or was not followed by filopodia formation (9.0±1.4 min; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, exact <italic>P</italic>-value is <italic>P</italic>=0.995, exact <italic>t</italic>-value is <italic>t</italic>(50)=0.007, <italic>n</italic>=26 animals). Newly formed filopodia are highly labile<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and we observed ∼75% of filopodia disappearing within 60 min, for both filopodia initiated by microglia contact or for those arising independent of contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>; two-way ANOVA, <italic>post-hoc</italic> Bonfferoni test, exact <italic>P</italic>-value is <italic>P</italic>=0.11, exact F-value is F(3, 77)=20.2; <italic>n</italic>=25 dendrites from 9 animals). Microglia contact-induced filopodia was only observed at P8–P10, when microglia have an activated phenotype and when the total number of spines in L2/3 somatosensory cortex is rapidly increasing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. At P12–P14 and P26–P30, microglia still contacted dendrites with a similar frequency, but the rate of subsequent filopodia formation (12.2±7.1 and 13.5±5.5%, respectively) was not significantly different from that at adjacent non-contacted points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>; paired <italic>t</italic>-test, exact <italic>P</italic>-values are <italic>P</italic>=0.0003 (P8–P10), <italic>P</italic>=0.37 (P12–P14) and <italic>P</italic>=0.41 (P26–P30); exact <italic>t</italic>-values are <italic>t</italic>(7)=6.61 (P8–P10), <italic>t</italic>(12)=0.92 (P12–P14) and <italic>t</italic>(10)=0.85 (P26–P30); P8–P10: see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>; P12–P14: <italic>n</italic>=7 animals; P26–P30: <italic>n</italic>=6 animals).</p>

<title>Signalling events underlying microglial-induced filopodia</title>
<p>Filopodia formation on dendrites is known to be triggered by synaptic activity, subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation and activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enzymes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. We therefore hypothesized that microglia contacts may trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, as have been previously seen in dendrites surrounded by microglia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. To test this possibility, we <italic>in utero</italic> electroporated the genetically encoded green calcium indicator (GCaMP6m), along with tdTomato, into L2/3 neurons in Iba1-EGFP mice. Subsequent <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging in awake P8–P10 mice detected local neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in dendrites following microglial contacts that were frequently followed by filopodia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a–c</xref>). Such local Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were not detected at these contact sites before the microglia contact and typically disappeared following the contact. Local Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were also not observed at dendritic locations 20 μm adjacent to the contact point during the same imaging periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>; 20 μm <italic>n</italic>=3, before contact <italic>n</italic>=4, during contact <italic>n</italic>=11 and after contact <italic>n</italic>=7 dendrites in 8 mice). The fliopodia formation rate was significantly higher in dendrites in which a contact-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>; 86.1±8.4% versus 16.0±7.1% in dendrites without a Ca<sup>2+</sup> response; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, exact <italic>P</italic>-value is <italic>P</italic>=0.00006; exact <italic>t</italic>-value is <italic>t</italic>(7)=4.03; with Ca<sup>2+</sup>: <italic>n</italic>=7 animals, without Ca<sup>2+</sup>: <italic>n</italic>=16 animals). The lifetime of filopodia formed on dendrite in which a microglia-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>; 20.7±2.7 min, awake mice) was longer than filopodia formed on dendrites without a Ca<sup>2+</sup> response (7.1±3.6 min, awake mice) or in dendrites in anaesthetized mice (7.9±1.2 min; one-way ANOVA, <italic>post-hoc</italic> Bonfferoni test, exact <italic>P</italic>-values are <italic>P</italic>=0.002 (awake Ca<sup>2+</sup>, awake no Ca<sup>2+</sup>), <italic>P</italic>=0.0003 (awake Ca<sup>2+</sup>, anaesthesia), <italic>P</italic>=1 (awake no Ca<sup>2+</sup>, anaesthesia), exact F-value is F(2, 25)=12; awake Ca<sup>2+</sup>: <italic>n</italic>=7 dendrites, awake no Ca<sup>2+</sup>: <italic>n</italic>=5 dendrites, anaesthesia: <italic>n</italic>=16 dendrites). To further probe the signalling mechanisms linking microglia contact and dendritic filopodia formation, we transfected cortical slice cultures from Iba1-EGFP mice with lifeact-mCherry. Microglia contact was followed by accumulation of F-actin in dendrites and subsequent filopodia formation, consistent with the known role of actin in filopodia formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g,h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 2</xref>). The relative fluorescent intensity at microglia contact sites (1.4±0.04) was significantly greater than the basal intensity at dendritic regions adjacent (by 10 μm) to the contact site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2i</xref>; 1.1±0.01; paired <italic>t</italic>-test, exact <italic>P</italic>-value is <italic>P</italic>=0.0003; exact <italic>t</italic>-value is <italic>t</italic>(5)=8.87; <italic>n</italic>=6 sites). Together, this data suggests that microglia initiates filopodia formation via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced actin accumulation, with microglial contact-induced filopodia being more stable.</p>

<title>Minocycline reduces the filopodia formation rate</title>
<p>Microglia at P8–P10 have a more activated phenotype as compared with P12–P14 mice and adult mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, as we also confirmed by morphological criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) and relative ionized Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) messenger RNA expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>; one-way ANOVA, <italic>post-hoc</italic> Bonfferoni test, error bars are mean ±s.e.; exact <italic>P</italic>-values are <italic>P</italic>=0.032(P9, P14) <italic>P</italic>=0.037(P9, P30), exact F-value is F(2,6)=8.6; P9 <italic>n</italic>=3 animals, P14 <italic>n</italic>=3 animals, P30 <italic>n</italic>=3 animals). Daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of minocycline (Mino; 75 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) from P5 through to the imaging day (P8–P10) reduced activation of microglia as indicated by a decreased Iba1 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, exact <italic>P</italic>-value is <italic>P</italic>=0.019, exact <italic>t</italic>-value is <italic>t</italic>(6)=2.63; saline <italic>n</italic>=4 animals, Mino <italic>n</italic>=4 animals) and significantly reduced the contact-induced filopodia formation rate, from 54±7.0% with saline treatment to 30±5.6% with Mino treatment. In Mino-treated mice, the filopodia formation rate at contact sites and non-contact sites on dendrites was not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>; one-way ANOVA, <italic>post-hoc</italic> Tukey's test; exact <italic>P</italic>-values are <italic>P</italic>=0.016 (Mino, Saline), <italic>P</italic>=0.96147 (Mino contact, Mino 10 μm), <italic>P</italic>=0.84726 (Mino contact, Mino 20 μm), <italic>P</italic>=0.57751 (Mino contact, Mino no contact), exact F-value is F(4, 44)=7.79; saline <italic>n</italic>=13 animals, Mino <italic>n</italic>=10 animals). The decrease in filopodia formation rates in Mino-treated mice was not due to a change in contact frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test; exact <italic>P</italic>-value is <italic>P</italic>=0.86, exact <italic>T</italic>-value is <italic>t</italic>(21)=0.18; saline <italic>n</italic>=13 animals, Mino <italic>n</italic>=10 animals). Together, this suggests that microglia activation is a crucial factor for microglia-induced filopodia formation. The mean spine density at P11 in Mino-treated mice was smaller than in saline-treated control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), but this was not significantly different (unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test; exact <italic>P</italic>-value is <italic>P</italic>=0.054; exact <italic>T</italic>-value is <italic>T</italic>(17)=2.07; saline <italic>n</italic>=9 mice, Mino <italic>n</italic>=10 mice).</p>

<title>Microglia ablation reduces the number of functional synapses</title>
<p>To further evaluate the functional consequences of microglia on spinogenesis, we used a genetic strategy to ablate microglia <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We cross-bred Iba1-tetracycline transactivator (Iba1-tTA) mice with tetracycline operator-diphtheria toxin A (tetO-DTA) mice. Transiently withdrawing doxycycline (Dox) from the maternal diet between P5 and P11 reduced the number of microglia at P8 by ∼50%, with microglial numbers recovering to control levels by P15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, P8: exact <italic>P</italic>-value is <italic>P</italic>=9.3E−5, exact <italic>t</italic>-value is <italic>t</italic>(12)=−5.7; P15: exact <italic>P</italic>-value is <italic>P</italic>=0.15, exact <italic>t</italic>-value is <italic>t</italic>(6)=1.64; P22: exact <italic>P</italic>-value is <italic>P</italic>=0.27, exact <italic>t</italic>-value is <italic>t</italic>(6)=−1.2; and P30: exact <italic>P</italic>-value is <italic>P</italic>=0.33, exact <italic>t</italic>-value is <italic>t</italic>(6)=1.06; P8: (control <italic>n</italic>=6 animals, ablated <italic>n</italic>=8 animals), P15: (control <italic>n</italic>=4 animals, ablated <italic>n</italic>=4 animals), P22: (control <italic>n</italic>=4 animals, ablated <italic>n</italic>=4 animals) and P30: (control <italic>n</italic>=4 animals, ablated <italic>n</italic>=4 animals)). This transient partial ablation of microglia reduced the density of spines when we quantified this in P11 mice (from 0.72±0.04 to 0.41±0.03 spines per μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, error bars are mean ±s.e.m.; exact <italic>P</italic>-value is <italic>P</italic>=6.26E−5, exact <italic>t</italic>-value is <italic>t</italic>(11)=6.2; control <italic>n</italic>=7 animals, ablated <italic>n</italic>=6 animals).

The reduction of the spine density in microglia-ablated mice was also associated with a significant and selective decrease in the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in L2/3 neurons in brain slices isolated from P12 mice, from 1.7±0.2 to 0.8±0.1 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d,e</xref>; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, exact <italic>P</italic>-value is <italic>P</italic>=0.0012, exact <italic>t</italic>-values are <italic>t</italic>(17)=−3.88(F); control <italic>n</italic>=10 neurons from 5 animals, ablated <italic>n</italic>=9 neurons from 3 animals).

<title>Microglia ablation selectively reduces synapses from L4</title>
<p>In a final set of experiments, we probed the possible functional consequences of microglia contact-induced filopodia formation, hypothesizing that filopodia formed by microglia may predominantly contribute to the formation of specific connections during this developmental period. To test this hypothesis, we recorded monosynaptic EPSCs from L2/3 pyramidal cells above a cortical barrel using whole-cell patch clamp recordings in brain slices from control (Iba1-tTA) and microglia ablated (Iba1-tTA::tetO-DTA) P23–P25 mice, by which time barrel cortical circuits have matured. EPSCs were evoked by glutamate uncaging with laser scanning photostimulation across L2–L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Such photostimulation-evoked EPSCs are largely due to single action potentials in individual presynaptic neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and thus can be used to quantify synaptic inputs originating from the different cortical layer neurons. In both control and microglia ablated mouse slices, L2/3 neurons received inputs from L2–L5. In control mice, L2/3 neurons received stronger inputs from L4 compared with other layers, consistent with previous data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test between corresponding locations in control and DTA mice; exact <italic>P</italic>-value is <italic>P</italic>=0.031 or <italic>P</italic>=0.044; control <italic>n</italic>=9 from 4 animals, DTA <italic>n</italic>=5 from 3 animals). However, in slices from microglia-ablated DTA mice, the largest synaptic response did not arise from L4, resulting in an averaged spatial distribution of synaptic inputs that was relatively uniform across the cortical layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>). The averaged strength of synaptic inputs originating from L4 was significantly lower in DTA mice, compared with control mice, whereas inputs from L2/3 or L5 were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>; versus control rats; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test; exact <italic>P</italic>-value is <italic>P</italic>=0.032). The averaged amplitude of spontaneous synaptic currents was also not different in DTA and control mice. These results indicate that microglia ablation selectively reduced excitatory synaptic connections from L4 to L2/3, suggesting that microglia-induced filopodia formation specifically promotes the establishment of feedforward synaptic connections from L4 to L2/3.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Establishing appropriate synaptic connections during development is generally achieved by the balance between synaptogenesis and experience-dependent synapse pruning and maturation. In the mouse somatosensory cortex, an intense period of synaptogenesis (with a rapid ≈7-fold increase in synapses) begins around P8, with synapse numbers peaking around P32, before declining (by≈20%) to adult levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Synapses develop from filopodia, labile, postsynaptic protrusions that may stabilize and develop into mature spines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> when they connect onto presynaptic terminals. Microglia contribute to a number of aspects of neural circuit development, including to help define the neuronal population via regulation of apoptosis and neurogenesis and by phagocytosing excess synapses during synaptic pruning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Our studies demonstrate a new physiological role for microglia in promoting synapses during a transient period of brain development, as contacts between microglial processes and dendritic shafts could trigger filopodia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Consistent with known mechanisms of filopodia formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, microglial contacts could also trigger localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and recruitment of actin. Although filopodia formation also occurred in the absence of microglia contact, the filopodia formation rate at microglia contact sites on a dendrite was greater than that observed at non-contact sites. At least some of these microglia-induced filopodia appeared to develop into functional excitatory synapses, as ablating microglia reduced the subsequent functional spine density and frequency of excitatory synaptic transmission. Microglia may potentially be attracted to dendritic locations where the early stages of filopodia formation are already in place, or may initiate <italic>de novo</italic> filopodia formation. The sequence of events where Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients only occur during contacts and are directly followed by actin accumulation and filopodia formation seem to favour the latter hypothesis. Some of the filopodia induced by microglia exhibited an increased stability, which may also contribute to the microglia-dependent increase in mature spines and functional synapses, and this was particularly evident in awake mice when the microglia–dendrite contact was followed by a localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient. Interestingly, the lifetime of microglia-induced filopodia in anaesthetized mice was similar to the lifetime of non-contact filopodia. Anaesthetics are known to affect filopodia formation and stability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, and may have occluded potential differences in filopodia lifetime in this set of experiments.</p>
<p>A striking observation in our study was the transient nature of the microglia-induced filopodia formation. During early development, microglia populate the brain in an activated, amoeboid phenotype before adopting the more mature ramified surveying morphology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Microglia proliferate into the barrel cortex from P5 in the amoeboid state and gradually change their phenotype to a more ramified state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. We similarly observed a morphological change between P8 and adults, as well as clear transitions in both cell soma size and Iba1 mRNA expression patterns between P8–P10 and P12–P14 microglia. The microglia contact-induced filopodia formation was only observed in P8–P10 mice, corresponding to the amoeboid, activated state. Consistently, inhibition of microglial activation with Mino abolished microglia-induced filopodia formation. The effects of Mino may be mediated through a change in activation phenotype, which could also include a decrease in the release of various soluble factors such as IL-10, tumour necrosis factor-α or BDNF. Activated microglia directly opposed to, or in contact with, dendrites may physically or via surface receptors promote functional spine formation. Regardless, this novel facet of microglia-induced neuronal plasticity we observe here is restricted to the activated, amoeboid phenotype. Phagocytosis of surplus synapses in developing lateral geniculate circuits also occurs early in development (around the first postnatal week) by the amoeboid microglia phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Experience-dependent pruning of synapses in visual cortex is evident at 4 weeks postnatal, when microglia have a mature ramified phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Microglial BDNF-dependent spine formation following motor learning occurs in the healthy adult rodent motor cortex when microglia are also of the quiescent, ramified morphology. Clearly, the precise functional consequences of microglia–neuron contacts on circuit plasticity—and whether this tends towards synapse elimination, synapse surveillance or spine formation—are likely to depend on the particular brain region and the specific activity or developmental pattern of synaptic plasticity occurring at that time. Our data emphasize the repertoire of actions microglia can participate in across the developmental time scales.</p>
<p>The different synaptic inputs to the cortex arrive during different developmental time windows and display corresponding different critical periods of activity or experience-dependent synaptic plasticity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Thalamic inputs to L4/L5 neurons arise initially into the somatosensory barrel cortex (around P0) and establish the columnar or barrel organization. Local cortical inputs to L2/3 neurons subsequently arise from recurrent connections from other L2/3 neurons and from feedforward projections from L4 neurons. Although there is some overlap, the L4 connections and the corresponding critical periods of plasticity occur earlier (around P10–P14) than those from L2/3 projections (P13–P16)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. By extension, filopodia that appear around P8–P10 may preferentially mature into L4-derived synapses, whereas filopodia at later stages will preferentially mature into L2/3-derived synapses. Consistent with this proposal, genetic and transient ablation of approximately half the microglial population around P8 to inhibit microglia-induced filopodia formation selectively weakened synaptic inputs to L2/3 neurons from L4 stimulation. It appears that the cortical circuits use the capacity of amoeboid microglia at this specific developmental stage to increase particular synapses being formed at that time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Additional cellular mechanisms may exist to facilitate synapse formation from other inputs at other specific developmental time points.</p>
<p>It is unclear at this stage which signalling mechanisms may trigger the spatially restricted increase in filopodia formation rate induced by microglial contact. Numerous mechanisms and molecules have been identified to promote spine formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. For example, microglia may increase neuronal activity and/or NMDA (<italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>D</sc>-aspartate)-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients by directly releasing glutamate or via enhanced release of glutamate from approaching presynaptic neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Receptor-mediated direct physical coupling between microglia and dendrites may be involved, similar to that proposed for synapse elimination. In the developing lateral geniculate nucleus, microglia phagocytosis of synapses involves interactions between immune complement receptor molecules C3 and C3R<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, whose expression depends on neuronal activity. In the hippocampus, fractalkine receptor–ligand interactions contributed to synapse phagocytosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Other complementary molecules such as telencephalin, nectin, IL-1 receptor accessory protein-like 1 and C1q family have been reported to be involved in synapse formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM2) is expressed in both neurons and microglia, and could trigger intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation that may subsequently recruit actin and elicit filopodia formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Microglia secrete a variety of soluble factors, including cytokines, neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitters, with this pattern changing dependent on different phenotypes from quiescent to challenged<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. For motor learning-induced spine formation, release of BDNF by microglia is critical<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, whereas microglial release of IL-10 enhanced spine formation in cultured neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Microglia can also release tumour necrosis factor-α, which can signal via various receptors and pathways to increase expression of N-cadherin to increase spine density<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Our characterization of the precise time course and transient nature of microglia-induced filopodia formation should assist experiments aimed at identifying the underlying signalling pathways.</p>
<p>A number of psychiatric brain disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism, involve disruptions in synapse number, morphology or function, with a pathogenesis that is believed to initiate with synapse development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. In autism spectrum disorders in particular, there is a surplus of spines in the cortex during early development in both human and mouse models, and dysfunction in the turnover rates of cortical spines is a common feature in a number of mouse models of autism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Given the association between maternal infection and autism and schizophrenia incidence, microglia are possible pathogenic candidates. Our studies here provide an additional aspect of microglia–neuron interactions—developmental spine formation and specific neuronal circuit connections—and further investigations into the underlying mechanisms of microglia–neuron interactions may shed light on the pathophysiology of brain diseases and provide potential strategies for restoring synapse function.</p>

<title>Animals and microglia inhibition</title>
<p>To visualize microglia, we used the Iba1-EGFP transgenic mouse, which expresses EGFP under the control of the Iba1 promoter, which is specific for microglia and macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. For microglia ablation experiments, double transgenic mice were generated by crossing Iba1-tTA mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref> and tetO-DTA mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Withdrawal of Dox in the feed of these mice leads to selective expression of the DTA in microglia. All transgenic mice were derived from the C57BL/6J strain. Transgene induction was inhibited by rearing mice with standard chow containing Dox 0.1 g kg<sup>−1</sup>. For transgene induction, Dox-laced chow was replaced with Dox-free standard chow from P5 through to P11 (for analysis of spine density). Both male and female mice were used for all experiments. Mice (single mothers and their litter) were housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Mino hydrochloride (M9511-1G, Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo, Japan) was used to pharmacologically inhibit microglia and injected daily (i.p., 75 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) from P5 through to the experimental day (P8–P10, for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of microglia–dendrite contacts; P11 for analysis of spine density).

<title><italic>In utero</italic> electroporation to visualize neurons</title>
<p>To visualize L2/3 pyramidal neurons, we performed <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation of embryos at embryonic days (E) 14 or E15 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). At this age, intraventricular injection and electroporation only transfects neurons migrating into the cortex. Under anaesthesia (1.7% isoflurane), the uterus was exposed and ∼1.5 μl of plasmid solution was injected into the lateral ventricle of each embryo using a glass pipette (tip diameter: 50–100 μm). The head of a single embryo was then placed between tweezer-type electrodes with 5 mm tip diameters (CUY650-P5; NEPA Gene, Chiba, Japan) and square electric pulses (35 V; 50 ms) were applied to the electrodes 5 times, at 950 ms intervals, using an electroporator (CUY21E; NEPA Gene). Each embryo was quickly returned to the abdomen following the electrical stimulus and once all embryos were electroporated the peritoneal membrane was sutured back together. The mother's skin was bound by clips (12032-07, Muromachi Kikai, Tokyo, Japan) to avoid reopening the surgical wound.</p>
<p>We used a plasmid, which contained floxed RFP (pCALNL-tdTomato; at 0.4 μg μl<sup>−1</sup>), for dendritic spine imaging, and floxed green calcium indicator (pCALNL-GCaMP6m; at 0.8 μg μl<sup>−1</sup>) for dendritic calcium imaging, which was co-injected with a plasmid carrying Cre recombinase (pCAG-Cre (Addgene), 0.01 μg μl<sup>−1</sup>). To evaluate whether the injection location was successful, Fast Green FCF 0.25 μg μl<sup>−1</sup> (F7258-25G, Sigma-Aldrich) was included in the plasmid solution.</p>

<p>Electroporated Iba1-EGFP mice (P8-P10) were anaesthetized with urethane (1.7 g per kg body weight, i.p. and atropine, 0.4 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, i.p.). Surgery and imaging were performed on a warming plate. After removal of the scalp, a cranial window (1.6 mm in diameter) was made over the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (1 mm posterior from bregma and 2.5 mm lateral from the midline). A cover glass was placed over the cranial window and fixed with adhesive glue (Aron Alpha, Konishi, Osaka, Japan) and dental cement (Quick Resin, SHOFU, Kyoto, Japan). A custom-made imaging chamber surrounded the cranial window and was perfused with warm water (32–34 °C) during imaging.</p>
<p>Two-photon imaging was performed with a Ti:sapphire laser (Mai Tai HP, Spectra-Physics, Tokyo, Japan) operating at 960 nm wavelength. A laser scanning system (Olympus FLUOVIEW, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and an upright microscope (BX61WI, Olympus) with a water-immersion objective ( × 25, 1.05 numerical aperture (NA); Olympus) was used for image acquisition. Fluorescence was separated by a 570 nm dichroic mirror with 495–550 nm (green channel: for EGFP fluorescence detection) and 570–630 nm (red channel: for DsRed-express or tdTomato fluorescence detection) emission filters, and detected by photomultipliers. For time-lapse imaging, <italic>Z</italic>-stack images (512 × 512 pixels, 0.099 μm per pixel, 0.5 μm <italic>Z</italic>-steps) were taken every 5 min for between 30 min and 2 h at a depth of 45–250 μm from the cortical surface. For short interval imaging, XYt images were taken once every 1.6 s, or once per minute, for 27 min.</p>
<p>For dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in awake mice, cranial window (1.5 mm) surgery was performed under isoflurane anaesthesia (1.5% isoflurane in pure O<sub>2</sub>). After an hour recovery, calcium imaging was performed in the awake state. XYt images were taken at 8 Hz for 30 min (256 × 128 pixels, 0.25 μm per pixel). Two-photon imaging was performed with a Ti:sapphire laser (Mai Tai HP, Spectra-Physics) operating at 940 nm wavelength. To detect calcium transients, we defined a small region of interest (ROI) (2 × 2 μm) along the dendritic shaft and calculated an average basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence. A significant Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation response was defined if the peak amplitude of Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic> was greater than three times the s.d. of the basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> level. A localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> response was defined as one that was restricted to just a small portion of the dendrite (&lt;12 μm), in contrast to transients associated with back-propagating action potentials.</p>

<title>Analysis of <italic>in vivo</italic> microglia and neuron interactions</title>
<p>Image stacks were visually inspected in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, USA), to determine regions of co-localization of GFP-labelled microglia and RFP-labelled dendrites, and then subsequently further examined in greater detail across all image time points and <italic>Z</italic>-sections using ImageJ, to confirm real contacts. To reduce noise, images were filtered with a 3 × 3 pixel median filter after background subtraction. Contacts were determined by overlap between the red (dendrite) and the green (microglia) channel, after independently determining the baseline thresholds for each channel independently. Identified overlaps were defined as contacts only if the red and the green channel had overlapping pixels in at least two <italic>Z</italic>-sections and if the overlap extended beyond twice the spatial resolution.</p>
<p>Dendrites that retracted during time-lapse imaging were excluded from analysis. Dendritic spines or filopodia were identified as protrusions that were &gt;0.4 μm from the dendrite border. A spine was defined as a protrusion with a head structure, whereas filopodia lacked head structures. This categorization included stubby structures as filopodia. This is appropriate as these types of ‘spines' are unstable during development and frequently disappear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Contact-induced filopodia formation rates were defined as the incidence in which a filopodia was formed at a microglia contact region. The contact region on a dendrite was defined as a 2 μm zone (±1 μm from the estimated centre of the microglia–dendrite contact) and a protrusions had to appear within 10 min of the onset of the microglia–dendrite contact to be counted as being formed by microglia (it is noteworthy that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> includes all protrusions that appeared within 20 min after microglia contact for comparison). Between 1 and 27 microglia–dendrite contacts were observed in different dendrites in each animal and the incidence of a contact-induced filopodia were averaged to give a single formation rate for each animal. The formation rate of protrusions at dendritic regions 10 μm (±1 μm) and 20 μm (±1 μm) adjacent to the microglia contact region were calculated as a measure of the control (or putative non-contact) filopodia formation rates. This analysis counted the incidence of a protrusion forming at these non-contact regions along the same dendrites at any time during the same imaging period over which contact-induced formation rates were measured. To quantify the formation rate across a single dendrite, the number of any protrusions appearing along the whole region of a dendrite during the imaging was counted (excluding those at the contact region) and normalized by the dendritic length. Dendrite length was expressed in multiples of 2 μm blocks (for example, 10 μm=5), to compare with the 2 μm length unit used to define contact and non-contact regions. It should be noted that formation ‘rate' as used in the study is related to the incidence of filopodia formation per unit length, rather than over a given time period.</p>

Microglia contact was defined as overlap of green fluorescence intensity within a (red) dendritic region, whereas segregation of lifeact-mCherry was defined as an increase of red fluorescence intensity within the microglia contact region in the dendrite. Filopodia formation was defined as the red fluorescence intensity protruding from pre-contact border of the dendrite. The background intensity of the image regions of interest in the absence of neuronal or microglia structures was subtracted from the intensity of the microglia and filopodia regions. The intensity of an adjacent region of the same dendrite, but without microglia contact or the presence of a filopodia or spines, was used as background for the dendritic aggregation of the lifeact-mCherry fluorescence signal. Fluorescence values were normalized to the maximum intensity of each signal. Fluorescent intensity was normalized using a value of 25% of the maximum intensity as baseline (<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>). To quantify contact induced actin aggregation, the relative intensity (<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>) was averaged between 5–10 min after the onset of microglia–dendrite contact and the <italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> at the contact region compared with that at a 10 μm adjacent region</p>

<title>Quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR for mRNA analysis</title>
<p>Mice were deeply anaesthetized with ketamine (0.13 mg g<sup>−1</sup>, i.p.) and xylazine (0.01 mg g<sup>−1</sup>, i.p.), transcardially perfused with 0.1 M PBS, which contained 5 mM EDTA and brains were then dissected. Total RNA was extracted from neocortical tissue samples using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (74134, Qiagen), then reverse transcription was performed by Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (04896866001, Roche). Real-time PCR was performed using FastStart Essential DNA Green Master (06402712001, Roche Applied Science) on LightCycler 96 (05815916001, Roche Applied Science) with Iba1 exon primers (5′-TCCCAAATACAGCAATGATGAG-3′, 5′-GCATTCGCTTCAAGGACATAAT-3′) and GAPDH primers (5′-AATGCATCCTGCACCACCAAC-3′, 5′-TGGATGCAGGGATGATGTTCTG-3′). Fold change was calculated using the ΔΔCt method and normalized by the values obtained with saline-injected mice or P9 mice.</p>

<title>Measurements of spontaneous synaptic currents</title>
<p>Acute brain slices were prepared from Iba1-tTA::tetO-DTA or Iba1-tTA mice at P12 following anaesthesia with ketamine (0.13 mg g<sup>−1</sup>, i.p.) and xylazine (0.01 mg g<sup>−1</sup>, i.p.), and transcardial perfusion with oxygenated (95%O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub>) slicing solution containing (in mM): 230 sucrose, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 glucose. Mice were decapitated and the brains were rapidly removed, and 350 μm thick coronal cortical slices were cut in cold slicing solution. Slices were stored in oxygenated ACSF (as described above for slice culture imaging) at 34 °C for at least 45 min before being transferred to the recording chamber on the stage of an upright microscope and viewed with a × 40 water-immersion objective. Slices were continuously perfused with oxygenated recording ACSF and recordings were obtained at room temperature (around 25 °C). Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings (at a holding potential of −70 mV) were made from the somata of visually identified barrel cortex L2/3 pyramidal neurons. Patch pipettes (5–8 MΩ) were constructed from borosilicate glass capillaries and filled with an internal solution containing (mM): 9 CsCl, 130 CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>Cs, 2 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP and 0.4 Na-GTP, pH adjusted to 7.3 with Tris. To isolate mEPSCs, 0.3 μM tetrodotoxin and 10 μM SR95531 were continuously perfused once a stable recording was obtained. Only cells with <italic>R</italic><sub>series</sub>≦25 MΩ and <italic>R</italic><sub>input</sub>≧200 MΩ were included for analysis. No corrections for liquid junction potentials were applied and no series resistance compensation was used.</p>

<title>Laser uncaging photostimulation evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents</title>
<p>Coronal slices of barrel cortex (300 μm thick) were prepared from P23–P25 mice under deep anaesthesia with isoflurane and kept in normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 126 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2.4 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 10 glucose at 33 °C, as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. For whole-cell recording, patch pipettes (4–6 MΩ) were filled with a solution containing (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 8 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.6 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 3 MgATP, 0.5 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP and 10 Na-phosphocreatine (pH 7.3 with KOH). For analysis, we selected cells with a high seal resistance (&gt;1 GΩ) and a series resistance &lt;25 MΩ. The recording of photostimulation-evoked EPSCs and analysis of the EPSCs was conducted as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Photostimulation was achieved by focal photolysis of Rubi-caged glutamate with 5 ms flashes of blue light (440 nm) from a diode laser. The light was focused on the slices through a × 4, 0.16 NA microscope objective. Laser power was set to 5 mW at the specimen plane. This resulted in the generation of action potentials in neurons with cell bodies mostly within ∼100 μm of the centre of the illuminated spot. Photostimulation-evoked EPSCs were recorded from L2/3 pyramidal neurons within a single L4 barrel. Usually, the photostimulations were applied once every 5 s to each of 16 × 20 sites surrounding the recorded cells in a quasi-random sequence. The maps of photostimulation sites were aligned to laminar borders in fixed and stained tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), and each site was assigned a laminar identity. We measured the peak amplitude of all of the EPSCs occurring within 150 ms after the stimulation and constructed colour-coded, linearly interpolated maps using the total amplitude of the EPSCs at each stimulation site. To quantify laminar input strength, we also calculated the normalized strength of the excitatory inputs from each layer by the summed values from all the layers examined. The data were analysed using custom software written in Matlab.</p>
