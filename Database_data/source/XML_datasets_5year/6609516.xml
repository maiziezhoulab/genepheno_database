<p id="P1">Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a common mood disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression. Both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in BD etiology, but the biological underpinnings remain elusive. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of neuropsychiatric disorders have identified a risk locus for BD containing the <italic>SYNE1</italic> gene, a large gene encoding multiple proteins. The BD association signal spans, almost exclusively, the part of <italic>SYNE1</italic> encoding CPG2, a brain-specific protein localized to excitatory postsynaptic sites, where it regulates glutamate receptor internalization. Here we show that CPG2 protein levels are significantly decreased in postmortem brain tissue from BD patients, as compared to control subjects, as well as schizophrenia and depression patients. We identify genetic variants within the postmortem brains that map to the <italic>CPG2</italic> promoter region, and show that they negatively affect gene expression. We also identify missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <italic>CPG2</italic> coding regions that affect CPG2 expression, localization, and synaptic function. Our findings link genetic variation in the <italic>CPG2</italic> region of <italic>SYNE1</italic> with a mechanism for glutamatergic synapse dysfunction that could underlie susceptibility to BD in some individuals. Few GWAS hits in human genetics for neuropsychiatric disorders to date have afforded such mechanistic clues. Further, the potential for genetic distinction of susceptibility to BD from other neuropsychiatric disorders with overlapping clinical traits holds promise for improved diagnostics and treatment of this devastating illness.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="P2">Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common, chronic mood disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression. The lifetime prevalence is estimated at 1–3% of the population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and high mortality rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, mainly caused by suicide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, makes BD a major public health problem. Treatment for BD is limited, consisting mainly of pharmaceutical mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and antipsychotic drugs discovered decades ago. Their efficacy in only a subset of BD patients highlights the need for development of new drugs based on a molecular understanding of disease etiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">The neuropsychiatric disorders BD, schizophrenia and major depression, as well as other neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), substantially overlap in clinical traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. For example, many BD patients suffer from cognitive deficits and psychotic symptoms qualitatively resembling those of schizophrenia patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, and from depressed mood states resembling those of major depression patients. For this reason, precise diagnosing often requires extensive psychiatric evaluation based on clusters of symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, and in some cases even erroneous pharmacological treatment attempts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Although there is a wide consensus for differential brain structural and connectivity impairments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, there is little specific evidence describing neuronal substrates and mechanisms differentiating neuropsychiatric disorders at the cellular level. Consequently, in the absence of more conclusive biological markers, diagnosing is almost exclusively based on psychiatric evaluation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">Despite robust evidence of genetic susceptibility to BD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, with heritability estimated as high as 70–80% based on twin studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, only a few genetic susceptibility factors have been identified over decades of research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, with little evidence for BD-specific risk genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Joint genome-wide association studies (GWAS) show substantial commonalities in risk loci for the major psychiatric disorders, especially between BD and schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, suggesting they overlap not only in clinical symptoms but also in their contributing genetic factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. A handful of common genetic variants, identified by GWASs as robustly associated with BD and replicated across independent studies, are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes <italic>CACNA1C, ANK3, ODZ4, SYNE1,</italic> and <italic>TRANK1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Some of the identified loci show penetrance for two or more of the neuropsychiatric disorders, underlining a shared genetic etiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. The largest GWAS to date for identifying risk loci for neuropsychiatric disorders including BD, schizophrenia, and major depression, identified the region encompassing <italic>SYNE1</italic> as the strongest BD association locus in the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Meta-analyses included in the study identified SNPs in <italic>SYNE1</italic> with genome-wide statistically significant association to BD at <italic>P</italic>=4.27×10<sup>−9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">Increasing evidence, mainly from genetic and pharmacological studies, has implicated abnormal glutamatergic neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in the etiology of BD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Notably, SNPs in <italic>GRIA2</italic>, which encodes the GluA2 subunit of AMPARs, have been associated with time to recurrence of mood episodes in BD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Studies have also shown differences in glutamate levels as well as glutamate receptor expression or function between individuals with mood disorders and control subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P6"><italic>SYNE1</italic> has thus far drawn less attention in relation to neuropsychiatric disorders compared to e.g. <italic>CACNA1C</italic>, which encodes voltage-gated calcium channels well-known to play a role in synaptic functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Human <italic>SYNE1</italic> is a large gene comprising 145 exons with multiple transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. The most described gene products of <italic>SYNE1</italic>, the nesprins, are mainly related to muscle function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, and are unlikely to explain how this locus influences susceptibility to BD. Interestingly, the BD association signal in <italic>SYNE1</italic> maps near the transcription start site for candidate plasticity gene 2 (<italic>CPG2</italic>). CPGs are activity-regulated genes identified as potential mediators of synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. <italic>CPG2</italic> is a brain-specific transcript of the <italic>SYNE1</italic> gene. We recently reported the existence of two human <italic>CPG2</italic> transcripts expressed in neocortex, hippocampus, and striatum, encoding proteins that localize to the postsynaptic endocytic zone of excitatory synapses in dendritic spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Here they facilitate glutamate receptor cycling, consistent with a role in synaptic plasticity. The identification of <italic>CPG2</italic> as a risk locus for BD and CPG2’s known function in regulating glutamate receptor internalization, suggest that variation in CPG2 function may affect glutamate receptor cycling in a way that would influence susceptibility to BD.</p>
<p id="P7">Here, we combine multiple strategies to identify genetic variations within the <italic>CPG2</italic> locus of <italic>SYNE1</italic> that influence expression or function of the CPG2 protein. Linking BD associated variation with an underlying cellular dysfunction is an opportunity afforded by only a few GWAS hits in human genetics for neuropsychiatric disorders to date. We show that CPG2 protein levels are significantly decreased in postmortem brain tissue of BD patients as compared to schizophrenia and depression patients, as well as control subjects. By deep-sequencing the <italic>CPG2</italic> region of <italic>SYNE1</italic> from the same human subjects, we identified genetic variants within promoter and enhancer regions that negatively affect gene expression. We further show that certain genetic variants in the CPG2 coding region identified by exome sequencing affect CPG2 expression, subcellular localization, and synaptic function.</p>

<title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Human brain tissue</title>
<p id="P8">Fresh frozen human brain tissue samples from BA9/10 and hippocampus were kindly provided by the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center, the Stanley Medical Research Institute Neuropathology Consortium collection, Mount Sinai NIH Brain and Tissue Repository (schizophrenia patients), University of Maryland Brain and Tissue Bank (controls), and Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (controls). Information on age, postmortem index (PMI), gender, partial information on medication history, and relative CPG2, Arc and PSD95 protein expression levels is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">supplementary table ST1</xref>. Informed consent was obtained from all tissue donors or legal signatories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Western blotting</title>
<p id="P9">Protein extraction and Western blotting were performed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Blots were incubated with guinea pig polyclonal anti-CPG2 (1:1000, A002396; np913, NEO Peptide), mouse anti-Arc (1:1000; Synaptic Systems), mouse anti-PSD95 (1:20,000; UC Davis) or mouse anti-β-actin (1:2000; SIGMA) antibodies and visualized using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR). Western blot signal intensities were quantified using a FIJI (ImageJ) gel lane plot profile tool and groups were compared using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test for multiple comparisons or t-tests (two groups). Sample lysates were loaded in a randomized manner and quantified blind to sample identity. For SMRI samples, subject identifying information was revealed to the experimenter only after submission of the final dataset to the SMRI consortium. One sample was below detection level and excluded from the protein level analyses. The Western blots for CPG2 showed two bands that were quantified in combination due to insufficient signal segregation and apparent co-regulation.</p>

<title>Targeted region deep-sequencing and variant calling</title>
<p id="P10">Genomic DNA was extracted from human brain tissue using a ChargeSwitch gDNA Mini Tissue Kit (Invitrogen) and purified by ethanol precipitation. High-quality gDNA samples were deep-sequenced in the extended <italic>CPG2</italic> region of <italic>SYNE1</italic> (NM_182961: exon 8–70 incl. introns) by CD Genomics (sequencing depth: 30–100x).</p>
<p id="P11">The raw sequencing data was mapped to human genome assembly GRCh37 using BWA aligner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. The BAM-files were indexed and the mapped reads within the <italic>SYNE1</italic> gene locus (chr6:152740704–152831506) were selected using the SAMtools view module<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. The generated <italic>SYNE1</italic> BAM-files were piled up using SAMtools mpileup module for union genotype calling using BCFtools with –mv and –Oz options<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Variant annotation was performed using ANNOVAR tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Human brain region-specific chromatin states were collected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> and visualized using the web-based NeuVar tool <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfo5pilm46.mit.edu:318/neuvar">http://bioinfo5pilm46.mit.edu:318/neuvar</ext-link>. Statistical correlation of genetic variants with CPG2 protein expression was tested using Mann-Whitney binary tests.</p>

<title>Molecular cloning</title>
<p id="P12">Putative promoter DNA regions from purified control or patient gDNA samples were amplified using LongAmp Taq polymerase and proofreading Q5 polymerase (NEB). PCR products from promoter regions were separated on agarose gels, excised, purified and cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) in front of the Firefly Luciferase (Luc<sup>+</sup>) gene using KpnI and XhoI restriction sites.</p>
<p id="P13">For rescue experiments in the absence or presence of CPG2 coding variants, full-length human <italic>CPG2</italic> (<italic>hCPG2</italic>) was cloned into a lentiviral transfer vector for rat <italic>Cpg2</italic> KD (pFUGW-<italic>Cpg2</italic>-shRNA), in which the stop codon after GFP was removed and <italic>hCPG2</italic> inserted using EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites yielding a GFP-hCPG2 fusion protein (pFUGW-<italic>GFP-hCPG2</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Human CPG2 coding variants were introduced into pFUGW-<italic>GFP-hCPG2</italic> by site-directed mutagenesis. All constructs were validated by Sanger sequencing.</p>

<sec id="S8">
<title>Luciferase assay</title>
<p id="P15">At 8 DIV, cortical neurons were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation for 1 hour with 1µg of various Firefly Luciferase plasmids and 1.2µg of the normalization control pRL-TK Renilla Luciferase (RLuc) vector plasmid (Promega)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. At 14 DIV, neurons were lysed and assessed using a Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Plates were read on an EnSpire® Multimode Plate Reader (PerkinElmer). Where indicated, neurons were activated with KCl stimulation solution (170mM KCl, 2mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10mM HEPES (pH 8.3)) diluted in culture media 1:6 for final concentrations of 28mM KCl and 50µM picrotoxin for 6 hours before cells were lysed and assayed. Relative Luciferase activity was statistically compared using one-way or two-way (KCl+PcTx) ANOVAs and Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> tests for multiple comparisons.</p>

<sec id="S9">
<title>Spine localization assay</title>
<p id="P16">At 8 DIV, neurons were infected with lentivirus for KD of rat <italic>Cpg2</italic> (pFUGW-<italic>Cpg2</italic>-shRNA) or at 15 DIV with lentivirus for replacement of the endogenous rat CPG2 with the GFP-hCPG2 fusion reference protein (pFUGW-<italic>GFP-hCPG2</italic>) or mutated variants. At 21 DIV cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min and then permeabilized for 25 min with 0.2% saponin in PBS with 10% goat serum. Cells were then incubated for 3 h with primary antibodies; mouse anti-CPG2 (1:500; Nedivi lab) and rabbit anti-GFP (1:3000; Abcam), followed by 1 h incubation with secondary antibodies; goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 555 (1:500) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500; Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech) and imaged using a Nikon Eclipse E600 upright microscope with a 40×/1.40 Plan Apo oil immersion objective (Nikon).</p>
<p id="P17">Quantification of immunocytochemistry was conducted using ImageJ software to obtain pixel intensity values in a linear range within regions of interest (ROI). ROIs were positioned over spine heads and dendritic regions based on GFP-stained neuronal morphology and the corresponding staining intensity was measured. Spine localization of GFP-hCPG2 or mutated variants was quantified as the ratio between fluorescence intensity in spine heads and adjacent dendritic shafts. For quantification of spine size, a threshold was applied to make the fluorescence signal binary, and signal areas were quantified and calibrated to the 40X objective specific pixel size (µm<sup>2</sup>). All quantifications were done blind to sample identity. Statistical difference from controls was tested using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test.</p>

<title>General statistics and data analysis</title>
<p id="P19">All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software (version 7). The data is graphed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Appropriate statistical tests were chosen based on the experimental conditions (see assay specific methods). Gaussian distribution of non-normalized data was assumed in all but the genetic variant analyses. Here, non-parametric tests were used as described. Brown-Forsythe and Bartlett’s tests were included in the ANOVAs assuring similar variance between statistically compared groups. Statistical significance was defined as *p ≤ 0.05.

<title>Low CPG2 protein expression in brains of postmortem BD patients.</title>
<p id="P20">To investigate if the <italic>CPG2</italic> region of <italic>SYNE1</italic> could play a role in susceptibility for BD, we first asked whether CPG2 protein expression was compromised in BD patients. To this purpose, we isolated synaptic protein fractions from postmortem human brain tissue of control subjects, as well as BD, schizophrenia, and major depression patients (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">supplementary table ST1</xref> for source information). Since fMRI and postmortem studies have implicated the prefrontal cortex in BD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, we ran Western blots on tissue from Brodmann Area 9/10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), and compared CPG2 protein levels in the three patient groups with that of control subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We found CPG2 protein levels to be significantly lower in the BD group as compared to control subjects (One-way ANOVA: F(3,95)=2.74, *p=0.047; Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic>: control vs. BD *p=0.032, n=102 subjects) but not in other patient groups tested (Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic>: control vs. depression p=0.96, control vs. schizophrenia p=0.76) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The Western blots for CPG2 show two bands, which we speculate could represent protein products from different <italic>CPG2</italic> transcripts, or could be a result of, as yet, unidentified posttranslational modifications. Both bands are expressed in the synaptic protein fraction, and their relative signal intensity is constant independent of patient group or other variables, suggesting that expression of the two protein products is regulated by the same mechanism either at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, or posttranslational level.</p>
<p id="P21">Neuropsychiatric disorders are generally associated with lower activity in the prefrontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. To confirm that low levels of CPG2 were not secondary to reduced neural activity and a resulting reduction in levels of this activity-regulated transcript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, we tested for levels of another activity-regulated gene product, Arc, a protein that like CPG2 is localized to glutamatergic synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. We observed a positive correlation of CPG2 and Arc levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>; linear reg.: F(1,95)=52.4, p&lt;0.0001 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). However, unlike CPG2, which was reduced exclusively in the BD population, Arc was significantly decreased also in other patient groups (One-way ANOVA: F(3,94)=4.13, **p=0.0085; Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic>: control vs. BD *p=0.020, control vs. schizophrenia *p=0.022, control vs. depression p=0.14, n=102 subjects) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Levels of the postsynaptic density protein PSD95, a marker of glutamatergic synapses, was similar among the patient groups and as compared to control subjects (One-way ANOVA: F(3,95)=0.55, p=0.65, n=102 subjects). The correlation between CPG2 and PSD95 levels was slight enough (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>; linear reg.: F(1,96)=16.2, p=0.0001) to indicate that reduced CPG2 or Arc expression is not merely caused by synaptic loss in BD and/or Schizophrenia patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>; One-way ANOVA: F(3,95)=4.51, **p=0.0083; Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic>: control vs. BD **p=0.0027, n=102 subjects).

Further, we found no statistically significant correlation between CPG2, Arc, or PSD95 protein expression and variation in patient age (linear reg.: F(1,97)=0.64, p=0.43; F(1,97)=0.16, p=0.69; F(1,97)=2.0, p=0.16, respectively), postmortem index (PMI) (linear reg.: F(1,97)=0.023, p=0.88; F(1,97)=1.2, p=0.28; F(1,97)=3.2, p=0.079, respectively) or gender (t-tests: t(97)=1.7, p=0.094; t(97)=1.8, p=0.073 and t(97)=0.52, p=0.61, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2</xref>). Thus, our findings show a specific correlation between low CPG2 levels and incidence of BD that is not shared with schizophrenia or major depression patients.</p>
<p id="P22">To test if low CPG2 protein expression in BD patients was specific to prefrontal cortex, we also isolated synaptic protein fractions from postmortem hippocampal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Western blotting showed significantly lower CPG2 protein levels in hippocampal tissue from BD patients compared to controls (t-test: t(21)=2.5, *p=0.021, n=22 subjects) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G-H</xref>), with no change in level of either of the two control proteins, PSD95 (t-test: t(21)=1.1, p=0.29), or the loading control β-actin (t-test: t(20)=0.15, p=0.88) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I-J</xref>). Cortical and hippocampal CPG2 protein levels were well correlated between tissue samples from the same individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>).

<title>Low CPG2 protein expression correlates with the presence of common genetic variants in <italic>CPG2</italic> regulatory regions</title>
<p id="P23">Low CPG2 protein levels in the BD patient group could derive from several factors, including reduced <italic>CPG2</italic> gene expression. We hypothesized that genetic variation associated with BD might affect regulatory elements of the gene that are important for transcription, such as promoter/enhancer regions, transcription factor binding sites, or in the <italic>CPG2</italic> untranslated regions (UTRs). To test this hypothesis, we purified gDNA from all samples and performed targeted deep-sequencing in the <italic>SYNE1</italic> region (NM_182961: exon 8–70 incl. introns) encompassing the <italic>CPG2</italic> locus. Our sequencing data yielded hundreds of genetic variants within the <italic>CPG2</italic> locus (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">supplementary information, ST5</xref>), most of which were common variants also represented in population databases (1000 genomes, HapMap). Of all the identified variants, five SNPs were previously shown to be BD associated (rs4523096<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>, rs7747960<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>, rs9371601<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, rs214972<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, and rs215006<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">supplementary table ST2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P24">Active promoter and enhancer elements within the <italic>CPG2</italic> gene region were mapped based on histone methylation states seen in ChIP-seq data from human cultured neurons and from human prefrontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Interestingly, three of the BD associated SNPs (rs4523096, rs7747960 and rs9371601) map in or near the proposed <italic>CPG2</italic> promoter region. The two other SNPs (rs214972 and rs215006) map near the 3’UTR of a short <italic>CPG2</italic> isoform and near the 3’UTR end of a long <italic>CPG2</italic> isoform, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P25">To quantify whether the identified BD associated SNPs correlate with low CPG2 expression, we defined mean CPG2 expression in the BD group as the threshold between high and low expression subjects. Within our limited sample set, we did not find statistically significant overrepresentation of any single SNP allele in the low CPG2 expression subjects when compared to the high CPG2 expression subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, the BD associated alleles of the two SNPs (rs4523096[T] and rs7747960[T]) closest to the <italic>CPG2</italic> transcription start site (TSS) trended towards higher frequency in the low, as compared to high, CPG2 expression subjects. This prompted us to focus on the locus encompassing the <italic>CPG2</italic> TSS region. From our sequence data, we identified ~25 genetic variants within this region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">supplementary table S3</xref>). Based on allele frequencies from the 1000 Genomes database, we found that six SNPs (rs9478332, rs12055686, rs4343926, rs4318888, rs7771568, and rs6908747) within the <italic>CPG2</italic> TSS flanking region were in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with BD associated SNPs (D’=~1, r<sup>2</sup>=&gt;0.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">supplementary table ST2</xref>). One of the six SNPs, rs9478332 was also found in the UCSC database of annotated transcription factor binding sites based on ENCODE ChIP-seq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, and mapped within a HFH-1 consensus motif upstream of the annotated <italic>CPG2</italic> TSS.</p>
<p id="P26">We then tested whether any of the six <italic>CPG2</italic> TSS flanking region SNPs in LD with the BD associated SNPs had alleles overrepresented in our low CPG2 expression subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Two of the non-reference alleles, rs9478332[T] and rs4343926[C]), trended towards higher frequency within our limited pool of low CPG2 expression subjects, when compared to high CPG2 expression subjects. When considering all four non-reference allele SNPs with higher frequency in low versus high CPG2 expression subjects, (rs4523096[T], rs7747960[T], rs9478332[T] and rs4343926[C]), we found a trend for low CPG2 expression subjects to have at least one, or more, of the four alleles (Mann-Whitney test: U=942, p=0.058, n=60 (any of the four alleles) of 102 subjects) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Furthermore, ~75% of the low CPG2 expression BD subjects had at least one of the identified alleles, as compared to ~50% of subjects in the control group (Mann-Whitney test: U=195, p=0.068, n=36 (any of the four alleles) of 50 subjects)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P27">The representation of the non-reference alleles with higher frequency in low CPG2 expression subjects is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref> for all patient groups. Here, CPG2 protein expression for individual subjects in the different patient groups is displayed on a continuum ranging from low to high expression, where each colored bar represents CPG2 levels in a single subject. Grey bars illustrate the presence of each of the four selected alleles in individual subjects. The dashed line demarcates the threshold between low and high CPG2 expression (as defined above, mean CPG2 expression level for the BD group). Our data suggests that no single allele is associated with the low CPG2 protein expression found in the BD patient subjects. Nonetheless, the presence of a handful of common alleles in or near the proposed <italic>CPG2</italic> promoter region might correlate with low CPG2 protein expression in a larger sample set and could potentially mark BD susceptibility loci within the gene.</p>

<p id="P29">Of the SNP alleles with higher prevalence in the low CPG2 population, SNP allele rs4523096[T] mapped within the i16 promoter region.

Because <italic>CPG2</italic> is an activity-regulated gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, we used a protocol with mild depolarizing KCl in the presence of the GABA receptor inhibitor picrotoxin (KCl+PcTX) to stimulate activity in the cultures.

In our limited sample set, we could not use statistical methods to identify rare variants.

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P40">Recently, large consortium GWAS studies have shed new light on the genetics of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, genetic variants identified so far account for only a fraction of disease liability, a phenomenon generally characteristic of complex genetic traits. Purely genomic approaches such as GWAS and linkage studies are only the first step in elucidating the complex neurobiology of BD. They need to be followed and complemented with molecular and cellular studies of defective neuronal function to obtain a more complete understanding of disease etiology.</p>
<p id="P41">Identification of risk loci for BD has firmly implicated dysregulated excitatory neurotransmission as a key component of BD etiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Given the role of CPG2, a <italic>SYNE1</italic> gene product, in facilitating glutamate receptor internalization and regulating excitatory synaptic strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, this gene might be an important player in the neurobiological underpinnings of BD. Here, we show that low levels of the CPG2 protein are more prevalent in BD patients as compared to controls and other patient groups, and use multiple strategies to identify genetic variants within CPG2 regulatory or protein-coding regions that negatively affect gene expression or disrupt protein function, respectively.</p>
<p id="P42">Our finding that CPG2 protein levels are significantly lower in postmortem prefrontal cortex from BD patients as compared to control subjects, a phenomenon not shared with schizophrenia or major depression patients, supports specificity of <italic>CPG2</italic> perturbation in BD. This is consistent with GWAS findings that genetic variation in <italic>SYNE1</italic> is more closely associated with risk for BD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Low CPG2 levels across brain regions of BD patients suggests it is likely to derive from genetic causes. The clustering of common genetic variants in <italic>CPG2</italic> regulatory regions identified in the low CPG2 expression BD subjects further supports this notion, although we cannot exclude additional causes such as brain region-specific reduced activity in BD disease state.</p>
<p id="P43">It is often noted that common risk variants identified by GWAS overwhelmingly reside in large introns and in sequences immediately upstream of the implicated genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. This suggests that disease-associated variation may derive not mainly from disrupted protein function, but from dysregulated gene expression. For example, the largest number of disease associations found by GWAS in schizophrenia are in regulatory regions, such as promoter or enhancer sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Studies of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in human tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup> also show that disease implicated genetic variants tend to associate with quantitative differences in expression levels of the same genes, especially when gene expression is measured in the tissue relevant to the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, we were not able to find eQTL data for the <italic>CPG2</italic> gene region in public databases (GTEx, ExSNP). Progress in the genome-scale analysis of chromatin states now reveals hundreds of thousands of sites across the genome that contain dynamic chromatin marks suggestive of tissue-specific promoter or enhancer activity, with the ability to regulate the expression of nearby genes in specific tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. The regulatory elements mainly found in introns are often less conserved between humans and rodents, as well as across all of evolution. Interestingly, the CPG2 promoter region is highly conserved among mammalian species as compared to other intronic regions within the gene (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">supplementary table ST4</xref> and sequence alignment for quantification), suggesting that this region has a conserved activity-dependent regulatory function in mammalian brains.</p>
<p id="P44">Our data suggest that no single genetic variation is associated with the low CPG2 protein expression found in BD patient subjects. This is in accordance with the pleiotropic and polygenic nature of BD, and other neuropsychiatric disorders, where many genetic risk factors each contributing a small effect cumulatively add up to a larger disease susceptibility. Common regulatory variants can also result in milder phenotypes that reflect tissue- or cell type specific gene expression. For example, a common variant in a <italic>CACNA1C</italic> regulatory region associated with approximately 15% increased risk of schizophrenia and BD, has no apparent association to cardiac or immune phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. By analogy, common regulatory variants influencing expression of brain-specific <italic>CPG2</italic> transcripts from the <italic>SYNE1</italic> gene would confer increased risk for developing BD, without significant impact on muscular phenotypes associated with other <italic>SYNE1</italic> transcripts.</p>
<p id="P45">GWAS and genetic linkage studies, with the intrinsic requirement for very large sample sizes, are best suited to identify relatively common genetic risk variants. We found that when tested alone, the common BD associated i16 SNP allele (rs4523096[T])<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> had no apparent effect on gene expression. A suggested explanation for some of the ‘missing heritability’, not yet accounted for in the genetics of complex diseases, is that common disease-associated SNPs act as sentinels for other genetic risk factors adjacent within the same region with more penetrant effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. From our deep sequencing data of patient gDNA, we identified several genetic variants within the putative <italic>CPG2</italic> promoter and enhancer regions. One SNP allele (rs4530871[T]), situated within a mammalian conserved sequence of the 5’UTR <italic>CPG2</italic> promoter region significantly attenuated activity-induced gene expression when tested alone. Interestingly, (rs4523096[T] and rs4530871[T]) in combination, reduced basal gene expression. Likewise, another SNP allele, rs924872285[G] identified in a putative <italic>CPG2</italic> enhancer, also reduced basal gene expression when combined with rs4523096[T]. This exemplifies the common notion for complex genetic diseases that cumulative effects of low penetrant variants can combine to a greater effect size. Further, the differential effect of specific SNP alleles on basal versus activity-dependent gene expression suggests that within the general population, there are low frequency but relatively common genetic variants in the <italic>CPG2</italic> promoter region that influence neuronal activity-dependent gene expression without apparent effect on basal level gene expression. The activity-dependent requirement for gene expression could potentially provide one explanation for the influence of environmental ‘stressors’ on development of BD associated psychiatric symptoms.</p>
<p id="P46">While low CPG2 levels have already been shown to disrupt synaptic glutamate receptor internalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, synapse dysregulation could also derive from CPG2 protein variants with reduced function. Thus, some patients with apparently normal CPG2 levels might suffer from risk for BD due to coding region mutations. In a recent report, six nonsynonymous SNPs were identified in the <italic>CPG2</italic> region of <italic>SYNE1</italic> using high-resolution melt analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>, but only predicted effects were described. The four most common of the missense SNPs overlap with our findings, namely rs34610829[T] (R359C), rs17082709[G] (L401V), rs148346599[A] (E515K), and rs214976[C] (V551A), of which the former two are not conserved across evolution and were therefore not tested here. The two latter were predicted by Polyphen and SIFT analyses to be tolerated in other <italic>SYNE1</italic> products and likely damaging to CPG2, and benign to both gene products, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. This agrees with our findings that E515K had an apparent effect on CPG2 expression or stability, and V551A had a small effect on CPG2 spine localization with no apparent effect on glutamate receptor internalization. We found three additional SNPs with significant negative effects on glutamate receptor internalization, rs76646638[A] (R477Q), rs116939102[T] (T691I), and rs34028822[T] (R904W), of which the latter also affected spine localization. The R904W variant is situated at the C-terminal of CPG2 in between two reported protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation sites important for CPG2 spine localization and protein function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. We speculate that the bulky tryptophan in the minor allele variant might interfere with PKA binding and CPG2 phosphorylation, and thereby disrupt CPG2 protein function. The two other functionally disruptive variants R477Q and T691I do not have apparent effects on spine localization. They are situated far from the CPG2 C-terminal f-actin binding site important for spine localization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup> but might affect functional protein domains in ways that allows normal spine localization but disrupt binding to the endocytic machinery, which facilitates receptor internalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P47">In this study, we present protein functional data from a statistically significant and replicated BD associated risk locus. We show that levels of the brain-specific <italic>SYNE1</italic> product CPG2 are lower specifically in BD patients as compared to controls as well as schizophrenia and depression patients. We identify genetic variants in the <italic>CPG2</italic> promoter region with negative effects on gene expression, as well as low frequency coding variants in <italic>CPG2</italic> that significantly affect CPG2 protein function. Taken together, our data fit a genetic architecture of BD, likely involving clusters of both regulatory and protein-coding variants, whose combined contribution to phenotype is an important piece of a puzzle containing other risk and protective factors influencing BD susceptibility. The ultimate goal is to allow a more scientifically informed, evidence-based approach to measure, differentiate and treat neuropsychiatric disorders, preferably with the aid of genetic and other non-invasive biomarkers.</p>

<title>CPG2 protein levels are reduced in postmortem brain tissue from BD patients.</title>
<p id="P51">A) Synaptic protein fractions were extracted from a total of 102 postmortem human brain tissue samples from Brodmann Area 9/10 (image adapted from commons.wikimedia.org). For SDS-PAGE, 20µg of total protein was loaded. B) Representative Western blots comparing CPG2, Arc, and PSD95 protein expression in controls, depression, schizophrenia, and BD patients. Arc is another glutamatergic synaptic protein that like CPG2 is the product of an activity-regulated gene, and the synaptic protein PSD95 serves as a positive marker of glutamatergic synapse presence. C-E) Quantification of CPG2, Arc, and PSD95 protein levels, respectively, shows that CPG2 levels are significantly lower in the BD patient population as compared to control subjects, whereas Arc is decreased in both schizophrenia and BD groups. Comparable PSD95 levels in all groups indicates that reduced CPG2 or Arc expression does not reflect synaptic loss. (*p&lt;0.05, One-way ANOVAs, Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> tests). F) Synaptic protein fractions were extracted from a total of 22 postmortem human brain tissue samples from hippocampus (image adapted from commons.wikimedia.org). G) Representative Western blots showing CPG2 protein expression in controls and BD patients. The synaptic marker protein PSD95 and β-actin serve as controls. H) Quantification of CPG2 protein expression. I) Quantification of PSD95 protein expression. J) Quantification of β-actin protein expression. K) Direct comparison of CPG2 protein expression in cortical and hippocampal tissue samples from individual subjects (black dots represent controls and red dots represent BD patients). As in neocortex, CPG2 protein expression is significantly decreased in hippocampal tissue from BD patients. (*p&lt;0.05, Student’s t-tests).</p>

<p id="P52">Brain tissue gDNA was extracted from all patient and control subjects, and deep-sequenced in the <italic>CPG2</italic> locus to identify genetic variants. Common BD associated variants identified from GWASs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> were statistically tested for correlation with CPG2 protein expression levels. A) The genomic position (GRCh37 assembly) of five SNPs identified as BD associated by GWAS mapped onto the <italic>CPG2</italic> region of <italic>SYNE1</italic> (dark blue vertical bars represent exons) shown in the context of previously published ChIP-sequencing data from human neurons identifying active promoter (green) and enhancer (purple) regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. The five SNPs are rs4523096 (green*), rs7747960 (red*), rs9371601 (blue*), rs214972 (yellow*) and rs215006 (grey*). B) The allele frequencies of the five BD associated SNPs were quantified for high and low CPG2 expression subjects. C) Six LD proxies (rs9478332, rs12055686, rs4343926, rs4318888, rs7771568, and rs6908747) for the five BD SNPs map to the <italic>CPG2</italic> TSS flanking region (color-matched to origin SNPs). D) The LD allele frequencies of the six SNP proxies were quantified for high and low CPG2 expression subjects. Four alleles (rs4523096[T], rs7747960[T], rs9478332[T] and rs4343926[C]) were trending towards higher allele frequency in low expressing subjects. E) The frequency of having at least one of the four non-reference alleles was compared between high and low CPG2 expression subjects, and F) between BD patients with low CPG2 and control subjects (Mann-Whitney binary tests). Note: rs4523096[T] and rs4343926[C] have high allele frequencies (&gt;0.4) and were quantified for homozygous subjects in E, F and G. G) CPG2 protein expression levels (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>) are displayed on a continuum from low (red) to high (blue) expression, where each colored bar represents one subject and each of the four identified variants enriched in the low CPG2 population shown as dark grey bars. The threshold between high and low CPG2 expression (dashed red line) was defined at the mean CPG2 protein expression level of the BD group as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>.</p>
