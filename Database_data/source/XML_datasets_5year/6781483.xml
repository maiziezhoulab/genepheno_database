<p>Enhanced carbonyl stress results in neurodevelopmental deficits by affecting microtubule function through the formation of irreversible dysfunctional multimer of carbonylated CRMP2.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Enhanced carbonyl stress underlies a subset of schizophrenia, but its causal effects remain elusive. Here, we elucidated the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of carbonyl stress in iPS cells in which the gene encoding zinc metalloenzyme glyoxalase I (<italic>GLO1</italic>), a crucial enzyme for the clearance of carbonyl stress, was disrupted. The iPS cells exhibited significant cellular and developmental deficits, and hyper-carbonylation of collapsing response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2). Structural and biochemical analyses revealed an array of multiple carbonylation sites in the functional motifs of CRMP2, particularly D-hook (for dimerization) and T-site (for tetramerization), which are critical for the activity of the CRMP2 tetramer. Interestingly, carbonylated CRMP2 was stacked in the multimer conformation by irreversible cross-linking, resulting in loss of its unique function to bundle microtubules. Thus, the present study revealed that the enhanced carbonyl stress stemmed from the genetic aberrations results in neurodevelopmental deficits through the formation of irreversible dysfunctional multimer of carbonylated CRMP2.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Schizophrenia is one of the most serious psychiatric disorders, with a prevalence of ∼1% worldwide. Impairments in neurodevelopmental process are thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (“neurodevelopmental theory of schizophrenia”) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stefansson et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Insel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">van Os et al, 2010</xref>). To date, oxidative stress and redox dysregulation have been identified as cogent pathophysiological factors for schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schulz et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Young et al, 2007</xref>) and, thus, investigating the molecular mechanism underlying these events should identify advanced strategies for the development of innovative treatments and drugs.</p>
<p>Oxidative stress, which has been suggested to be crucial for the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, mainly causes oxidative damage to the lipids, proteins, and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bitanihirwe &amp; Woo, 2011</xref>). It also forms one of the central hub systems, which when perturbed affects the integrity of parvalbumin interneurons and oligodendrocytes, a characteristic feature observed in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Steullet et al, 2016</xref>). Oxidative stress leverages the formation of advanced glycation end (AGE) products, which is also called “carbonyl stress.” In cells, reactive carbonyl compounds (RCCs) are formed from sugars, lipids, and amino acids. The α-oxoaldehydes methylglyoxal, glyoxal, and 3-deoxyglucosone are typical toxic RCCs, and their accumulation results in the production of AGEs, such as pentosidine (PEN). In contrast, pyridoxamine, an active form of vitamin B6 against carbonyl stress, is known to detoxify RCCs via carbonyl-amine chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Itokawa et al, 2014</xref>). The activity of zinc metalloenzyme glyoxalase I (GLO1) plays an enzymatically central role in the removal of AGEs. Recent studies have reported that elevated carbonyl stress is relevant for the pathophysiologies of not only systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Perkins et al, 2012</xref>) but also neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, mood disorder, autism, and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Junaid et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LoPachin et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Itokawa et al, 2014</xref>). In fact, 20% of schizophrenia patients reportedly exhibit increased blood levels of PEN and lowered levels of vitamin B6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arai et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miyashita et al, 2013</xref>) and share clinical features of treatment-resistance, a higher proportion of inpatients, a low educational status, longer durations of hospitalization, and higher doses of antipsychotic medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miyashita et al, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2014</xref>). Furthermore, the administration of pyridoxamine to patients with schizophrenia under enhanced carbonyl stress can effectively ameliorate their symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arai et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Itokawa et al, 2018</xref>). Moreover, the offspring from diabetic mothers, who should be afflicted with elevated carbonyl stress, showed a sevenfold increased risk for schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Lieshout &amp; Voruganti, 2008</xref>), which suggested that carbonyl stress during brain development could predispose an individual to disease manifestation with a substantial effect size. Importantly, elevated carbonyl stress was observed even in postmortem brains from a subset of schizophrenia patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ohnishi et al, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>In cells, microtubules (MTs) are highly dynamic 25-nm tubule-like polymers composed of α, β-tubulin heterodimers and serve as the cytoskeletal structures for cell morphogenesis and the rails for intracellular transport by motor proteins, including kinesin superfamily motor proteins (KIFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirokawa, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirokawa et al, 2009</xref>). Therefore, MTs are fundamental structures for cells, and their dynamics are strictly controlled via MT-associated proteins and MT-depolymerizing proteins. Collapsing response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2 and DPYSL2) is known to be a member of the CRMP family. CRMP2 reportedly functions to regulate synaptic transmission, control MT dynamics, and modulate vesicle trafficking in cells and the developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inagaki et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Charrier et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cole et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Quach et al, 2004</xref>). In particular, CRMP2 has been implicated in crucial functions for neurite outgrowth, neuronal polarity with axon/dendrite specification and KIF-dependent vesicle transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arimura et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cole et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Quach et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kawano et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brittain et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hensley et al, 2011</xref>). To date, the mechanisms underlying the function of CRMP2, particularly its activity in the regulation of MT polymerization and stabilization have been widely investigated. The CRMP2–tubulin interaction reportedly promotes MT polymerization through its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity and results in neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fukata et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chae et al, 2009</xref>). Post-translational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation and glycosylation, have also been reported to regulate CRMP2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang &amp; Koch, 2017</xref>). CRMP2 was recently reported to promote MT bundling through its carboxy terminus, and its phosphorylation decreases its bundling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>CRMP2, encoded by the <italic>DPYSL2</italic> gene, maps to the chromosome 8p21.2, which has been identified as schizophrenia susceptibility loci in genome-wide linkage studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ng et al, 2008</xref>). Subsequently, genetic association studies in different ethnicities have consistently shown the role of <italic>DPYSL2</italic> in schizophrenia susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakata et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fallin et al, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hong et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al, 2015</xref>). Notably, CRMP2 was also found to be differentially expressed across different regions in the postmortem brain samples from schizophrenia patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edgar et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnston-Wilson et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Prabakaran et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beasley et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clark et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sivagnanasundaram et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martins-de-Souza et al, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martins-de-Souza et al, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martins-de-Souza et al, 2010</xref>). Dysregulation of the CRMP2 was also consistent in pharmacological and behavioral rodent models of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paulson et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwazaki et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the brain-specific CRMP2-deficient mice displayed phenotypes reminiscent of schizophrenia patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al, 2016</xref>). These lines of evidence, thus, underscore the role of CRMP2 in etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Because human-induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell technologies have enabled an in vitro recapitulation of the neuropsychiatric disease pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balan et al, 2018</xref>), we set out to analyze iPS cells with <italic>GLO1</italic> disruption as a cellular model to uncover the missing link between enhanced carbonyl stress and the development of schizophrenia, at a very early developmental stage. To this end, we analyzed the effects of hyper-carbonyl (AGE) modification in iPS cells from a schizophrenia patient through multiple biological approaches. Our biochemical analysis identified CRMP2 as an important molecular target of AGE modification in iPS cells with enhanced carbonyl stress. X-ray crystallography and biochemical analyses revealed that the D-hook (dynamic binding surface for dimerization) and T-site (tacking surface for tetramerization) of CRMP2, which are functionally critical for the reversible conformation required for CRMP2 activity, contribute to the transformative tetrameric complex of CRMP2. Strikingly, we also revealed that carbonylated CRMP2 (AGE-CRMP2) was stacked in the irreversibly formed multimer via AGE modifications at D-hook, T-site, and the outer surface of the CRMP2 complex, resulting in loss of the unique function of CRMP2 to bundle MTs. Collectively, the results obtained in the present study provide direct evidence showing the dysfunction of CRMP2 under enhanced carbonyl stress at the molecular and atomic levels and explains the cellular developmental deficits of iPS cells with GLO1 deficiency.</p>

<title>iPS cells from a patient with schizophrenia carrying mutated <italic>GLO1</italic> and <italic>GLO1</italic>-knockout iPS cells exhibited impaired neurosphere growth under enhanced carbonyl stress</title>
<p>We previously reported that a <italic>GLO1</italic> frameshift mutation in a schizophrenia patient result in enhanced carbonyl stress with high plasma PEN levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Toyosima et al, 2011</xref>). To uncover the fundamental link between <italic>GLO1</italic> mutation and schizophrenia pathogenesis under enhanced carbonyl stress, iPS cells derived from schizophrenia patients were precisely analyzed at the cellular and molecular levels. First, iPS cells derived from a schizophrenia patient with <italic>GLO1</italic> (fs) (SZ with <italic>GLO1</italic> frameshift mutation +/fs), iPS cells from a schizophrenia patient with normal <italic>GLO1</italic> (SZ with <italic>GLO1</italic> (+/+)), and iPS cells from a healthy control subject (control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig S1</xref>) were cultured to induce the formation of neurospheres, which was observed 5 d after passage. Our neurospheres consisted almost entirely of neural stem or progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matsui et al, 2012</xref>). The number of neurospheres from SZ with <italic>GLO1</italic> (fs) iPS cells was 50% lower compared with those from control and SZ iPS cells (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A and B</xref>). To test whether enhanced carbonyl stress contributes to the observed growth deficit, the cells were treated with pyridoxamine, an RCC scavenger. Pyridoxamine treatment significantly increased the numbers of neurospheres from SZ with <italic>GLO</italic>1 (fs) iPS cells (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1A and B</xref>). To corroborate the effects of defects in <italic>GLO1</italic>, we introduced GLO1-deficient human iPS cells (<italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells) that were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ohnishi et al, 2019</xref>). We confirmed that <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells did not produce GLO1 protein in both neurospheres and differentiated neuronal cells by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1C</xref>). The number of neurospheres from <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells was 20% lower compared with that from <italic>GLO1</italic> (+/+) iPS cells (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1D and E</xref>). The mean size of the neurospheres from <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells (112 ± 31 μm) was reduced by 30% compared with that from <italic>GLO1</italic> (+/+) iPS cells (150 ± 41 μm) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1F</xref>). Pyridoxamine treatment significantly increased the number (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and size (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) of neurospheres from <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1E and F</xref>). We subsequently examined the neuronal cells that differentiated from <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells. The <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) neuronal cells displayed significantly shortened neurites (38 ± 17 μm) when compared with the <italic>GLO1</italic> (+/+) neuronal cells (62 ± 13 μm) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1G and H</xref>). Similarly to the neurosphere-based findings, pyridoxamine treatment recovered the shortened neurite phenotype of <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1H</xref>). We reasoned that the pronounced deficits in cellular phenotypes, observed in schizophrenia patient-derived iPS cells with <italic>GLO1</italic> frameshift mutation might be contributed by the additional schizophrenia-associated genetic risk factors in the subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Toyosima et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balan et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Toyoshima et al, 2016</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the GLO1 loss of function (<italic>GLO1</italic> (fs) mutation derived from the schizophrenia patient and the engineered <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) mutation) impaired the cellular development of iPS cells because of the enhanced carbonyl stress.</p>

<title>CRMP2 is a major target of AGE modification under enhanced carbonyl stress in <italic>GLO1</italic> (fs) iPS cells derived from schizophrenia patients</title>
<p>Enhanced carbonyl stress leaves irreversible AGE footprints on proteins in cells, which often leads to loss of protein functions and could be a component of multiple cellular deficits and diseases. Therefore, we subsequently sought to identify the key target of the AGE modification in <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells. The AGE-modified proteins in <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells were immunoblotted using various types of anti-AGE antibodies that detect N-ε-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML), N-ε-(carboxyethyl) lysine (CEL), methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone (MG-H1), argpyrimidine (ARP), and PEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1B</xref>). Notably, a strong band corresponding to ∼60 kD was identified in <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells using CML antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1I</xref>). This increased CML modification was also observed in the <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) neurospheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig S1B</xref>). The CML modification of the ∼60-kD band was reduced by the pyridoxamine treatment in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1J and K</xref>), which indicated that the ∼60-kD proteins are the major AGE-modified components under enhanced carbonyl stress and could be suppressed by pyridoxamine treatment.</p>
<p>To identify the major AGE-modified proteins under enhanced carbonyl stress, the AGE-modified proteins were enriched from cultured <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells by anion-exchange chromatography (Mono Q; GE Healthcare), and the fraction containing the highly CML-modified 60-kD proteins was identified by immunoblotting with anti-CML antibody. After the fraction was developed on a conventional SDS–PAGE gel, the major band at 60 kD was analyzed using an liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and identified as CRMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig S1C and D</xref>). To confirm the result, CRMP2 was immunoprecipitated by anti-CRMP2 antibody and detected as the exact CML-modified protein in the <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) and <italic>GLO1</italic> (fs) iPS cells using anti-CML antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig 1L</xref>). Considering the essential role of CRMP2 in regulating the cytoskeletal dynamics in relation to the neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arimura et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cole et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Quach et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kawano et al, 2005</xref>), we revealed that the impaired cellular and developmental phenotypes manifested in the neural cells derived from GLO1-deficient iPS cells were stemmed mainly from the carbonylation (CML) of CRMP2. However, the role of other carbonylated proteins contributing to these observed phenotypes in a synergistic manner can also not be excluded. Because the role of CRMP2 in schizophrenia has been evidenced from the patient studies, we reasoned that the AGE modification of the CRMP2, resulting from schizophrenia-associated genetic aberrations, in neural progenitor cells can contribute to the downstream neurodevelopmental deficits relevant for the schizophrenia pathogenesis, at least in a subset of patients.</p>

<sec id="s5">
<title>Sites of AGE modification are widely distributed in the functional motifs of CRMP2</title>
<p>Because several functional regions and numerous PTMs of CRMP2 reportedly contribute to its function and regulation, we then sought to determine the exact position of carbonylation sites (AGE sites) and investigate the effects of AGE modification on CRMP2 function. To identify the AGE sites of CRMP2, CRMP2 purified from <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells and recombinant AGE-CRMP2 proteins were precisely analyzed through advanced mass spectrometric approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A</xref>). CRMP2 and AGE-modified proteins enriched from <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells by anion-exchange chromatography were further purified by high-resolution size-exclusion chromatography (HiRes-SEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ogawa &amp; Hirokawa, 2018</xref>), and the eluate containing CRMP2 was confirmed using anti-CRMP2 antibody. Recombinant human CRMP2 (C532, residue 1–532) was bacterially expressed, purified, and incubated for in vitro carbonylation in the presence of glyoxal as RCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig S1E</xref>). The identification of AGE sites at the peptide level is generally challenging because the loss of positive charges by AGE modification reduces the ionization of peptides to be detected by mass spectrometry. In addition, aldehyde groups might react with primary amines during the sample preparation process, which hampers the subsequent analysis. Therefore, we performed chemical derivatization to ensure AGE sites intact, before the peptide mapping using mass spectrometry. The AGE sites were derivatized with Girard’s Reagent T (GRT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al, 2014</xref>) to induce the formation of hydrazone products in which the Schiff base was subsequently reduced by NaBH<sub>4</sub>. The derivatized protein was digested and analyzed using an LC-MS/MS system. Using our strategy, mass analyses covered 96.68% of endogenous CRMP2 in <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells and 100% of recombinant CRMP2 (C532) in terms of protein sequence coverage, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2A</xref>).</p>

<p>29 sites overlapped between the 50 sites in CRMP2 from the <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells and 62 sites in in vitro expressed CRMP2 (7 Arg, 11 Lys, 5 Pro, and 6 Thr), and 12 and 14 other sites in the former and latter proteins, respectively, were very closely localized to each other within ±5 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2B</xref>), which suggest that the in vitro glyoxal-treated CRMP2 highly resembles the in vivo AGE-modified CRMP2 in terms of the distribution of AGE sites and thereby is appropriate to be used for further in vitro analysis. In particular, the AGE site on K390 was determined with high accuracy by the MS/MS spectrum in CRMP2 from both systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2B</xref>). The AGE sites were widely distributed on the outer surface around conventional domains that were previously reported to regulate MT assembly: GAP activity (6 sites), inhibition of GAP activity (19 sites), promotion of MT assembly (10 sites), and interaction with MTs (21 sites) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A and C</xref>). Because the surface potential of a protein is essential for its activity, we subsequently simulated the mechanism underlying the effects of AGE modification on surface charges by mutating the determined AGE-modified Lys/Arg residues to their derivative form, CML/GOARG, on the CRMP2 structure in silico (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2C</xref>). Compared with the wild-type protein, simulated AGE-CRMP2 suffers drastic changes in terms of its electrostatic distribution and exhibits a great loss of positive charges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2D</xref>, in blue) and an apparent increase in negative charges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2D</xref>, in red) because of the AGE modification that converts positively charged Arg and Lys to uncharged and negatively charged derivatives. This AGE-induced reorganization of electrostatic surface would affect the function of CRMP2.</p>

<sec id="s6">
<title>AGE sites are located in D-hook and T-site, which are central interfaces for the functional tetramer complex</title>
<p>In addition to the wide distribution of functional motifs, 42 AGE sites were found to be involved in the protein assembly interface of CRMP2, which is critical for the organization of the active functional unit of the tetramer CRMP2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al, 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2B</xref>). To facilitate our understanding of the functional link between the structure and AGE modification of CRMP2, we focused on two structural interfaces: the D-hook (dynamic binding surface for dimerization) and the T-site (tacking surface for tetramerization). Our structural analysis of AGE-CRMP2 by X-ray crystallography revealed that D-hook has an extended conformation composed of a basal N-terminal β8 sheet, an intermediate region from β11 to H14 and a flexible C-terminal loop from A489 to the end. The T-site is composed of three structural interfaces: rigid N-terminal β1–β2 sheets, an intermediate surface from H8 helix to β15 sheet and a C-terminal H18 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs 2A and E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">S2B</xref>). The functional tetrameric complex of CRMP2 is predicted to be assembled through successive two-step folding via the D-hook and T-site. In AGE-CRMP2, we identified 18 AGE sites (average of nine sites in each monomer) within both the D-hook and T-site, including K23, K269, K390, and K480 in the T-site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2E</xref>). Considering the structural contribution of D-hook and T-site to the formation of the tetrameric complex, AGE modifications should directly affect the assembly dynamics and activity of CRMP2. Therefore, we conducted further analyses on the function and structure of CRMP2 under AGE modification.</p>

<sec id="s7">
<title>AGE modification diminishes the MT-bundling activity of CRMP2</title>
<p>Because CRMP2 reportedly promotes MT elongation and bundling, we evaluated the in vitro activity of AGE-CRMP2 in comparison with that of unmodified CRMP2 using a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope. Polymerized MTs were incubated for 5 min in the presence of unmodified CRMP2 protein C532 or AGE-modified CRMP2 C532, and the length and intensity of the MT filaments were measured. Unmodified CRMP2 elicited significant bundling of MTs with increased length and intensity. In contrast, AGE-CRMP2 did not increase the length and intensity of MTs, which indicated that AGE modification disturbed the MT-bundling activity of CRMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3A and B</xref>; filament length: 21.23 ± 3.13, 6.96 ± 0.54, and 9.43 ± 0.87 for MTs + CRMP2, MTs + AGE-CRMP2, and MTs + BSA, respectively; filament intensity: 1,536.24 ± 154.93, 352.74 ± 11.22, and 349.25 ± 10.93 for MTs + CRMP2, MTs + AGEs-CRMP2 and MTs + BSA, respectively). The MT-bundling and MT-binding activities were further investigated through a conventional centrifugal analysis. Specifically, the MT-bundling activity of CRMP2 and AGE-CRMP2 was examined by low-speed centrifugation (6,000<italic>g</italic>, 10 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C</xref>). The number of bundled MTs was increased by unmodified CRMP2 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas AGE-CRMP2 did not show MT-bundling activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C and D</xref>, upper panel). Unmodified CRMP2 was co-sedimented with bundled MTs in pellets, whereas AGE-CRMP2 existed in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C and D</xref>, lower panel). Interestingly, we found that AGE-CRMP2 was stacked in irreversible polymerized forms that can be detected as upper bands on SDS–PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3C</xref>). Furthermore, we analyzed the affinity of CRMP2 with polymerized MTs through a conventional high-speed MTs co-sedimentation assay (76,000<italic>g</italic>, 30 min). Unmodified CRMP2 displayed high affinity to polymerized MTs in a dose-dependent manner; however, AGE-CRMP2 showed reduced affinity to polymerized MTs with irreversibly polymerized upper bands on the SDS–PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig S3A and B</xref>). Different activities between unmodified CRMP2 and AGE-CRMP2 were also confirmed through an assay of MT turbidity that measures the degree of polymerization, elongation, and bundling of MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig S3C</xref>). Compared with the moderate promotion of MT polymerization by unmodified CRMP2, AGE-CRMP2 did not promote MT assembly well, resulting in a growth rate that was similar to that of the negative control (tubulin only) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig S3C</xref>). These results clearly show that AGE modification impairs the function of CRMP2, and in particular, this modification dampens the MT-bundling activity of CRMP2 in vitro. The effect of AGE modification on the MT-bundling activity of CRMP2 was also evaluated in the <italic>GLO1</italic> (+/+) and <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells with/without glyoxal. To quantify the stability of MTs, iPS cells were treated by nocodazole (a MT-destabilizing drug) for 15 min, fixed, and stained, and the survived stable MTs were monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs 3E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3D and E</xref>). The <italic>GLO1</italic> (+/+) iPS cells displayed stable MTs with strong fluorescence intensity even under nocodazole treatment. In contrast, the <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells displayed destabilized tubulin after nocodazole treatment, as demonstrated by a blurred fluorescence intensity, which indicated that the MTs of <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells were less stable than those of the <italic>GLO1</italic> (+/+) iPS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3E and F</xref>). After the elicitation of carbonyl stress by glyoxal treatment, the MTs of <italic>GLO1</italic> (+/+) iPS cells displayed similar stability to those of <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig S3D and E</xref>). These results suggest that the AGE modification of CRMP2 disrupts the MT-bundling ability of this protein in cellular system.</p>

<title>AGE modification induces the formation of irreversible di-Lys bonds</title>
<p>Next, we asked how AGE modification elicits impairment of CRMP2 activity. To this end, the structures of unmodified CRMP2 (C532) and AGE-CRMP2 were analyzed by X-ray crystallography at 2.26 and 2.00 Ǻ resolutions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4</xref>). By comparing the overall tetrameric complex structures, apparent structural differences were observed in the N-terminal region, especially for the β2 and β3 sheets that include the AGE target K23 in T-sites. In AGE structure, β2 sheet underwent a sharp inclination and β3 sheet broke into two separated β strands with a linking loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4A</xref>). Based on the density maps of unmodified and AGE-CRMP2 structures, much significant difference was observed within T-site. In the AGE-CRMP2 complex structure, three Lys pairs (K23–K480, K269–K269, and K390–K390) of T-site were AGE-modified in close distance of the ε-ammonium group with extra electron density in Fo-Fc map (compared with unmodified CRMP2 structure) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>). Furthermore, the electron density of the AGE modification was also observed at K43, K56, and K451 on the outer surface of tetrameric complex with their AGE-modified Lys side chains in outward protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>). Because AGE-derivative residues comprise not only the intramolecular type such as CML but also the intermolecular types such as GOLD (glyoxal pathway), DOLD (3DG pathway), and MOLD (methylglyoxal pathway), the extra electron density indicates the formation of irreversible di-Lys bonds within/between the CRMP2 tetramer complexes by AGE modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>

<title>AGE modification induces CRMP2 dysfunction through the irreversible formation of a multimer complex</title>
<p>Because previous studies have indicated that CRMP2 potentially forms dynamic transformative conformations between its tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al, 2018</xref>) and monomer (or dimer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inagaki et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fukata et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Charrier et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cole et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Quach et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Niwa et al, 2017</xref>) forms to generate its specific function and regulation, we further evaluated the functional states of unmodified and AGE-modified CRMP2 proteins by measuring the flexibility and the dynamic size of the complexes in solution. To investigate the flexibility and the stability of CRMP2 in solution, unmodified and AGE-modified CRMP2 proteins were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The DSC results showed that the thermal transition midpoint (Tm) of AGE-CRMP2 rose to 64.4°C (+1.8°C) compared with that of CRMP2 (62.6°C), which indicated that AGE-CRMP2 gained higher thermal stability and lower flexibility after its transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A</xref>). To precisely evaluate the dynamic states of CRMP2 after AGE modification, unmodified and AGE-modified recombinant CRMP2 proteins were centrifuged to separate the large aggregates, and the supernatants were analyzed through a HiRes-SEC–based assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ogawa et al, 2017</xref>). On the SEC chromatogram, unmodified CRMP2 exhibited a major tetramer complex and two minor peaks that represent its octamer and monomer forms, which reflected a dynamic equilibrium between reversibly formed complexes in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5B</xref>). In contrast, AGE-CRMP2 was stacked in a multimer form, which indicated that the transformative dynamics was disrupted by the irreversible AGE modification. In addition, on SDS–PAGE, AGE-CRMP2 displayed multiple upper band shifts with substantially higher molecular weights than 60 kD, which indicated that AGE modification induced irreversible cross-linking within/between the complexes that cannot be broken even under strong reducing and unfolding conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5B</xref>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, whether the irreversible cross-linking of CRMP2 under enhanced carbonyl stress was produced in iPS cells was also examined. To exclude the bias in the epitope recognition of anti-CRMP2 antibody against AGE-CRMP2, N-terminal Myc-tagged CRMP2 was expressed in iPS cells and analyzed using anti-Myc antibody. In the <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells, Myc-CRMP2 displayed multiple upper band shifts above 60 kD probably because of irreversible cross-linking, which is consistent with our in vitro results. These protein phenotypes of CRMP2 in <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells were suppressed by pyridoxamine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5C and D</xref>). Collectively, the results demonstrate that AGE modification causes irreversible polymerization and aggregation (both CRMP2 from the <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells and in vitro expressed CRMP2) as well as the formation of intermolecular bonds within/between the tetramers, which disturbs the transformative dynamics of CRMP2. This molecular behavior of the multimerized AGE–CRMP2 complex in solution is consistent with the rigid cross-linking of di-Lys bonds both within the tetramer complex and between the complexes suggested by the electron density maps obtained from the crystal structure of AGE-CRMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on all the above-described evidence, we propose a new model for the molecular pathogenesis in a subset of schizophrenia under enhanced carbonyl stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>). Under healthy conditions, CRMP2 proteins exist as a tetrameric complex in dynamic equilibrium between its transformative units, such as octamer, tetramer, and monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6A</xref>), and in this state, CRMP2 showed high MT-bundling activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6B</xref>). In contrast, under enhanced carbonyl stress, CRMP2 proteins are carbonylated as a major target of AGE modification, and these effects elicit the multimerization and aggregation of CRMP2 through the formation of irreversible di-Lys bonds within/between the tetrameric complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6C</xref>). This damage to the transformative dynamics of CRMP2 dampens the MT-bundling activity of CRMP2, resulting in abnormal cellular deficits and potentially leading to schizophrenia susceptibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Enhanced carbonyl stress leaves irreversible footprints on its target molecules in biological systems. In this study, we found the direct effects of enhanced carbonyl stress on CRMP2 via AGE modification. AGE sites were found to be distributed in functional motifs of CRMP2, particularly D-hook and T-site, which are critical for the formation of the active CRMP2 tetramer. Here, we analyzed the pathological mechanism of AGE modification on CRMP2 activity from two aspects. First, AGE modification altered the normal charge distribution in multiple functional regions of CRMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2A, C, and D</xref>), which directly interfered with the CRMP2–MT or CRMP2–tubulin interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs 3C and D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3A–C</xref>). Second, AGE modification surprisingly produced covalent di-Lys linkages within the T-site of the CRMP2 tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig 4B</xref>). Moreover, AGE-modified sites were also located on the outer surface of the tetrameric CRMP2 complex, and their AGE-modified Lys side chains were located in outward protrusions, which resulted in the production of irreversible bonds between the complexes and, therefore, in the multimerization and aggregation of CRMP2. Taking into consideration that the transformative conformation is a critical factor for CRMP2 activity, we conclude that the loss of this transformative conformation in the multimer and aggregates via the irreversible AGE modification is the fundamental molecular pathology of CRMP2 dysfunction under enhanced carbonyl stress.</p>
<p>In this article, we analyzed the AGE sites of CRMP2 both in iPS cells and in vitro. By using LC/MS analysis, we qualitatively determined more than 60 AGE sites. The quantitation of stoichiometry distribution of each AGE site in iPS cells and post-mortem brain should be further investigated in future. Based on the comparison of our data in iPS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5C and D</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig S1E</xref>), we speculate that there is a similar stoichiometry of AGE modification between our iPS cell—derived and in vitro glyoxal-induced CRMP2 proteins.</p>
<p>It has been reported that monomeric CRMP2 promotes MT assembly when the soluble GTP-tubulin dimer breaks the stable tetrameric CRMP2 to form a complex composed of one CRMP2 monomer and the tubulin dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fukata et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Niwa et al, 2017</xref>). Moreover, tetrameric CRMP2 was recently reported to bundle MTs, and this activity decreased after the CRMP2 tetramer was decomposed into dimers through phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al, 2018</xref>). Therefore, it could be analogized that each specific function of CRMP2 corresponds to a specific conformation. Our HiRes-SEC assay showed that soluble free CRMP2 mainly exists as tetramer in dynamic equilibrium with its monomer and octamer forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5D</xref>). When this dynamic transformation was stacked by AGE modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5D</xref>), both MT-assembly and MT-bundling activities were irreversibly lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig 3</xref>). Taken together, our observations show that the dynamic transformative conformation is fundamental for the activity of CRMP2 against its substrate in the specific situation.</p>
<p>A number of PTMs were previously reported to regulate multifaceted functions of CRMP2. For instance, the functions of CRMP2 is reportedly promoted by SUMOylation and inhibited by phosphorylation via GSK3β, CDK5, Rho, and Fer kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arimura et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yoshimura et al, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cole et al, 2007</xref>). However, the molecular and structural mechanism through which these modifications control CRMP2 function remained largely elusive. Interestingly, most of the reported phosphorylation sites are located within the D-hook and T-site regions. For example, Fer phosphorylates Y479 and Y499 within T-site and D-hook of CRMP2 and inhibits MT-bundling activity by demolishing the tetramer complex. Based on our observation of the dynamic CRMP2 transformation, these PTMs might tune the activity of CRMP2 by “reversibly” changing its functional tetramer states. In addition, many PTM sites are also overlapped or closely situated with the AGE sites, such as N6-succinyllysine at K258, SUMOylation at K374, phosphorylation at K514, and acetylation at K525 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>); therefore, AGE modification might also disrupt the normal regulation system of CRMP2 by destroying the target sites or the motif sequence targets of PTMs.</p>
<p>In this study, we revealed cellular deficits in neurosphere formation under carbonyl stress in iPS cells from a schizophrenia patient with the <italic>GLO1</italic> frameshift mutation. The phenotype of the differentiated neurons from <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells, which showed a shortened neurite length, highly resembles the previously reported phenotypes of iPS cells in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brennand et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Robicsek et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Toyoshima et al, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, we identified CRMP2 as a major target of AGE modification in <italic>GLO1</italic> (−/−) iPS cells. Other proteins have been reported as targets of AGE modification, such as PEN-modified albumin in plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koike et al, 2015</xref>) and ARP-modified SBP1 (selenium binding protein 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishida et al, 2017</xref>) in blood of schizophrenic patients. The targets of AGE modification might differ depending on various factors, such as cell type, organs, developmental stages, and pathogenic contexts. Not only cytoskeletal proteins, such as CRMP2, but also some specific receptors, channels, kinases, and phosphatases can be affected by AGE modification. In addition to carbonyl stress, other pathogenic factors can affect CRMP2 activity. Transcriptional and translational defects might be involved in the loss of CRMP2 activity observed in psychiatric disorders. The defect of upstream regulation in pathogenic contexts might also affect CRMP2 activity. Based on our basic molecular pathogenetic study of CRMP2 in the iPS cells under enhanced carbonyl stress, further in vivo analyses would deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia in the developing brain.</p>
<p>To date, the expansion of irreversible protein aggregation in pathogenic contexts has been found in neurodegenerative diseases, including the aggregation of β-amyloid in Alzheimer’s disease and the spreading of prion-aggregates in Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Here, we report that the aggregation and multimerization of AGE-CRMP2 forms one of the pathogenic pathway for a schizophrenia subset under carbonyl stress at an early stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig 6</xref>). Recently, disrupted proteostasis resulting in protein misfolding or aggregation has been attributed to the etiopathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bader et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Korth, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hui et al, 2019</xref>). Although, the extent of aggregation was subtle in brain tissues from schizophrenia, when compared with the neurodegenerative disorders, mechanistic delineation of the process could provide crucial information on disease pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bradshaw &amp; Korth, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, a related protein, CRMP1, was detected as aggregates, exclusively in the postmortem brain samples from schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bader et al, 2012</xref>). This evidence further underscores our observation of pathogenic multimeric aggregation of CRMP2, stemmed from enhanced carbonyl stress, possibly by altered proteostasis for the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. From this perspective, the expansion of protein aggregation, specifically in a developmental stage-dependent manner, might be the central cascade in both neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. Future studies are warranted in postmortem samples from schizophrenia to show the subtle aggregation pathology involving CRMP2, particularly in the subset of patients with enhanced carbonyl stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ohnishi et al, 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the recent discovery for the role of mTOR signaling in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders through altered proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hui et al, 2019</xref>) and the regulation of the <italic>DPYSL2</italic> expression by mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pham et al, 2016</xref>) points to a possible additional role of dysregulated mTOR signaling in schizophrenia pathogenesis, through CRMP2-mediated aggregate formation. Because AGE modification induces the irreversible aggregation and polymerization of functional proteins, the development of therapeutics against carbonyl stress and diagnostic tools for the initial aggregation under carbonyl stress might be particularly important.</p>
<p>In summary, this report provides the first direct evidence showing CRMP2 as a target of enhanced carbonyl stress and revealed the mechanism of functional consequences of modified CRMP2 at the molecular and atomic levels at an early developmental stage. Further structural analyses in solution and physiological analyses in neurons and in vivo are strongly warranted.</p>

The MS fragments were analyzed through an MS/MS ion search against the NCBI human database using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 software, including SequestHT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and MASCOT (Matrix Science). The search was performed with the following parameters: a parent mass tolerance less than 5 ppm, a fragment mass tolerance less than 0.5 kD, a cutoff FDR of 5%, and a peptide rank of 1. Carbamidomethyl (C) was considered a static modification, and oxidation (M) and GRT-derivatization for Arg (72.057515 m/z), Lys (114.079313 m/z), Pro (131.105862 m/z), and Thr (113.095297 m/z) were considered dynamic modifications, with a set FRD of 5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Crystallization, diffraction data collection, and processing</title>
<p>The crystallization of CRMP2 C532 protein was conducted at 287 K using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 1 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of reservoir solution. Crystals of unmodified and AGE-modified C532 proteins were obtained with 0.1 M calcium acetate hydrate, 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0), and 15% vol/vol PEG 400. The crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution (20% [vol/vol] glycerol in reservoir solution) for 10 s, immediately flash-frozen, and preserved in liquid nitrogen for diffraction experiments. Diffraction data were collected at beamlines: BL5A and BL17A at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization-Photon Factory (KEK-PF) and BL41XU at SPring-8. The datasets were then processed using HKL2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Otwinowski &amp; Minor, 1997</xref>) and programs from the CCP4 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey, 1994</xref>).

<title>Structure determination, refinement, and analysis</title>
<p>Structure coordinates were determined by the molecular replacement method using MOLREP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vagin &amp; Teplyakov, 2000</xref>), and the structure of CRMP2 residues 13–516 (PDB code: <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="5MKV">5MKV</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al, 2018</xref>) was used as an initial search model. The models were further refined at 2.26- and 2.20-Å resolution, respectively, using Refmac5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murshudov et al, 2011</xref>) and COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Emsley &amp; Cowtan, 2004</xref>) with manual model correction. After several cycles of interactive refinements, we successfully established final structure models with R<sub>free</sub>/R<sub>work</sub> values of 0.171/0.193 and 0.183/0.204, and the final models were evaluated using the MOLPROBITY program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis et al, 2007</xref>). The data collection and refinement statistics are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Structure-based multiple sequence alignment was performed using the ESPript program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Robert &amp; Gouet, 2014</xref>). The details of the interactions among residues of the structural interface were obtained using the Contact program in the CCP4 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey, 1994</xref>), and structural Fig were generated using the PyMOL program (DeLano Scientific LLC).</p>

<title>HiRes-SEC assay</title>
<p>HiRes-SEC assays were performed with a tandem connected column consisting of twin Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 columns (GE Healthcare) on an AKTA pure system (GE Healthcare) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ogawa et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ogawa &amp; Hirokawa, 2018</xref>). Purified unmodified or AGE-modified CRMP2 proteins (100 μM) were centrifuged, and the supernatants (100 μl) were loaded onto the column containing assay buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 5% [vol/vol] glycerol) for assessment. The eluted fractions, along with the pellets and supernatants of the total protein samples, were analyzed by SDS–PAGE. The data analysis was performed using Origin 8.0 (OriginLab Corp).</p>

<sec id="s25">
<title>DSC</title>
<p>DSC was performed using a MicroCal PEAQ-DSC Automated system (Malvern Panalytical), which was temperature-calibrated with water and indium. The enthalpy was calibrated with indium. The protein samples (0.5 mg/ml) were applied into the cells of the calorimeter and scanned at a heating rate of 200°C/h over the range of 20°C–120°C. Protein buffer was used as a reference. The thermograms acquired from the raw data after reference subtraction were fitted with baseline subtraction. Peak integration was performed using nonlinear least-square fitting, and the curve fit was further adjusted using the iterative curve fitting function included in the software provided with the instrument until a constant χ<sup>2</sup> value was obtained.</p>

<title>MT cosedimentation assay</title>
<p>Tubulin was purified from a porcine brain, and polymerized MTs were prepared using previously described standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ogawa &amp; Hirokawa, 2015</xref>). Taxol-stabilized MTs (10 μM) were incubated with increasing concentrations of unmodified or AGE-modified CRMP2 proteins in BRB80K150 (80 mM PIPES, 150 mM KCl, and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) at 27°C for 15 min. Three independent assays were performed for each concentration, and the reaction samples were sedimented at a low speed (6,000<italic>g</italic>, 10 min) for measurement of the MT-bundling activity and a high speed (76,000<italic>g</italic>, 30 min) for assay of the total binding with MTs and then processed for SDS–PAGE analysis. The protein concentrations in the supernatant and pellet were quantified by densitometry of CBB-stained gels using ImageJ (NIH). The amounts of bound proteins and the proportions of bound proteins were plotted as functions of the amounts of unbound and total proteins, respectively. Because it was previously reported that one CRMP2-binding site is located on the tubulin-CRMP2 complex, the binding equation was fitted with the one-site model function using GraphPad Prism7 (GraphPad Software).</p>

<p>The flow chambers for the MT-bundling assay were prepared with cover glass (MATSUNAMI) and spacers. The internal surface of the chamber was coated with NeutrAvidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The reaction mixture of polymerized MTs, 10% labelled with tetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester (TAMRA-X-SE, T-6105; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 10% biotin succinimidyl ester (Biotium #90050; Biotin-SE) via standard MTs-labelling protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gell et al, 2010</xref>), and CRMP2 (unmodified or AGE-modified CRMP2) (at a molar ratio of 1:4) was flowed into the chambers. The observations were performed using the ELYRA P.1 system (Carl Zeiss) with a 100× oil-immersion lens at 512 × 512 resolution in the TIRF mode. The MTs were randomly observed, and the length and intensity × area (1 × 2.5 μm) of the MTs were measured using ImageJ software (NIH).
