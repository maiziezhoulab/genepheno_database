<p id="Par1">Neural tube defects (NTDs) are severe congenital abnormalities, caused by failed closure of neural tube during early embryonic development. Periconceptional folic acid (FA) supplementation greatly reduces the risk of NTDs. However, the molecular mechanisms behind NTDs and the preventive role of FA remain unclear. Here, we use human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from fetuses with spina bifida aperta (SBA) to study the pathophysiology of NTDs and explore the effects of FA exposure. We report that FA exposure in SBA model is necessary for the proper formation and maturation of neural tube structures and robust differentiation of mesodermal derivatives. Additionally, we show that the folate antagonist methotrexate dramatically affects the formation of neural tube structures and FA partially reverts this aberrant phenotype. In conclusion, we present a novel model for human NTDs and provide evidence that it is a powerful tool to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying NTDs, test drugs for therapeutic approaches.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Neural tube defects (NTDs) are a common type of congenital anomaly. The manifestation of NTDs occurs in very early stages of embryonic development, with failed closure of the neural tube at around day 28<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. An occurrence frequency of the disease is 1 case per 1,000 births<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and each year nearly 300,000 infants with NTDs are born, further resulting in death or lifelong disabilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Therefore, socioeconomic cost associated with NTD patients is very high due to the increased morbidity and premature mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">Spina bifida aperta (SBA) is one of the most severe types of NTDs associated with herniation of neural tissue through an incompletely formed spine. SBA is a progressive, nonlethal but yet chronic disease with significant morbidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The condition can be easily picked up in first trimester screening programs. However, in practice, most diagnoses are still made in the second trimester<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Although fetal surgery by prenatal repair of the damage is a common treatment approach for SBA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, the malformation may lead to severe progressive complications after birth, like hydrocephalus, cognitive impairments, and sensory-motor deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">The aetiology of SBA, and NTDs in general, is poorly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Preclinical studies performed on mice showed numerous genes associated with the disease; however, specific genes described in mice are not sufficient to explain the heterogeneity of NTDs in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Over 25 years of clinical and experimental studies indicate that NTDs arise from a combination of genetic and gene-environment interaction factors.</p>
<p id="Par5">The risk of NTDs is greatly reduced by folic acid (FA) taken as a supplement starting from at least one month before conception and continuing throughout the first trimester of pregnancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The folate metabolic pathway plays a crucial role in nucleotide biosynthesis, proper cell proliferation and generation of methyl donors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, during the first-trimester of pregnancy, exposure to FA antagonists is associated with an increased risk of congenital anomalies, including NTDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. For instance, exposure to the folate antagonist methotrexate (MTX) induces NTDs in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. MTX inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate (THF) synthesis from folate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, the exact mechanism through which MTX causes and FA supplementation prevents NTDs remains unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">High and persisting proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) is required for the normal development and correct morphogenesis of the central nervous system (CNS). FA, influences the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs, whereas MTX impairs cell proliferation of embryonic NSCs in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Consistent folate deficiency can also lead to various neurological conditions in children and adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Folate transport through its own receptors might be crucial to prevent NTDs, as, for instance, Folate Receptor 1 (<italic>FOLR1</italic>, a member of the family of folate transport genes) is involved in the maintenance of intracellular folate level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and, mice lacking Folr1 exhibited failure of neural tube closure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. <italic>FOLR1</italic> receptors are expressed on the plasmatic membrane of the human placenta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, where they play a role in folate transport during early embryonic development. The mechanistic link between <italic>FOLR1</italic> and NTDs is also unclear. Thus, <italic>in vitro</italic> models of human NTDs to capture the pathological phenotype and reveal the mechanism of FA action are urgently needed.</p>
<p id="Par7">Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology could provide an attractive model to recapitulate the disease with its specific mechanisms and address early events in NTD manifestation. During the early neural differentiation, pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) undergo morphogenetic events and form radially arranged columnar epithelial cells, named neural rosettes. Neural rosettes resemble the structure of embryonic neural tube and express several early neural and radial glia (RG) markers, including PAX6, SOX1, NESTIN, BLBP (known also as FABP7) similar to the developing neural tube<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Cells within rosettes acquire apical-basal polarity based on the localized expression of adherence and tight junction proteins, including N-CAD and ZO-1 in a ring surrounding the central lumen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The structures, proliferation potential and proper polarization of the neural rosettes are significant features for their neurogenic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Thus, generation of the neural rosettes from iPSCs derived from NTD patients and determination of the disease features and mechanisms are of utmost importance to allow intervention strategies to be proposed.</p>
<p id="Par8">Musculoskeletal problems are common among SBA patients and in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, confirming the complexity of the disease and its involvement in various tissues. Several genes associated with NTDs, including Pax3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> in mice, play an important role in mesodermal derivatives and loss of mesoderm in zebrafish leads to NTDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Thus, the exploration of the human NTD characteristics in mesodermal derivatives is timely.</p>
<p id="Par9">In the present study, we established a human NTD cell model using disease-specific iPSCs. We described the morphological features of the disease administrated or not with FA during early neural and mesodermal lineages specification. We also explored the effect of the folate antagonist MTX during SBA iPSC differentiation towards neural rosettes.</p>

<title>Generation of SBA and healthy iPSCs using non-integrating Sendai viral vectors</title>
<p id="Par10">To avoid transgene insertion into the host genome, we used a non-integrating Sendai virus (SeV) reprogramming approach to generate iPSCs from skin fibroblasts derived from 3 SBA fetuses and from 1 amniotic fluid derived stem cells (AFSCs) sample. In addition, we generated iPSCs from skin fibroblasts of 2 healthy adult donors and from 1 AFSC sample derived from healthy fetus as controls. Reprogramming efficiency by SeV was 0.07% as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and we were able to generate several iPSC lines from each fetus and healthy donor samples. We deeply characterized 3 lines derived from each fetus and healthy donors.</p>
<p id="Par11">qRT-PCR analysis for PSC markers (<italic>OCT4</italic>, <italic>NANOG, SOX2</italic>) was performed in SeV generated iPSCs from SBA and healthy donors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A</xref>). Additionally, human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and fetal skin fibroblasts (FSFs) were used as positive and negative controls respectively. All iPSC lines showed pluripotent gene expression similar to human ESCs. In addition, the expression of this class of genes was maintained unaltered at early and late passages (8–25 passages) of all iPSC lines (data not shown). Consistently, <italic>SOX2, LIN28</italic>, and <italic>TRA1</italic>-60 gene products showed correct levels and sub-cellular localization when detected in iPSCs by immunofluorescence (IF) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1B</xref>). All iPSCs were able to form teratoma in immunodeficient mice in 5–8 weeks after grafting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1C</xref>). We also performed qRT-PCR analysis and confirmed the presence of three germ layers in teratoma tissues generated by SBA-, healthy iPSCs and human ESCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1D</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Generation of human iPSCs derived from SBA fetuses.

<p id="Par12">Finally, to assess the functional pluripotency and <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation potential of human iPSCs, we used spontaneous differentiation and TaqMan<sup>®</sup> hPSC Scorecard™ panel comprehensive gene expression real-time PCR assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Our results revealed that majority of iPSC lines, generated both from SBA and healthy donors were pluripotent and able to differentiate toward all three germ layers (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1A</xref>). However, 2 SBA and 1 healthy-derived iPSC lines were excluded from our study, since they demonstrated lower level of pluripotency genes expression and inadequate differentiation capacity towards three-germ layers (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1B</xref>). More details about iPSC lines used in this study are presented in <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information</xref> (<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Note</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par13">Taken together, our results showed that SeV-generated SBA and healthy iPSCs exhibited similar characteristics to human ESCs, with a great ability to differentiate toward derivatives of all three germ layers.</p>

<title>Aberrant number and size of neural rosettes derived from SBA iPSCs</title>
<p id="Par14">To assess neural tube-like structures formation potential of SBA iPSCs, we induced <italic>in vitro</italic> neural differentiation and rosette formation. We generated neural rosettes, widely used procedure to mimic early neural tube and CNS structures, from all PSCs. To test whether FA supplementation had any role on NSC induction and neural rosette formation; we performed all experiments with and without FA administration. Dose dependent experiments showed that additional 4.5 μM FA was a suitable dose for neural induction, since it did not affect PSCs and NSCs viability (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2A–C</xref>). We added additional 4.5 μM FA to the culture medium during the first 12 days of NSC induction from all PSC, before the formation of neural rosettes. All iPSC lines maintained PSC morphology and showed similar growth and proliferation potential before the neural induction. During the neural induction, all cell lines changed morphology and formed tightly crowded neuroepithelial (NE) cell layers with small nuclei in all conditions (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3A</xref>). No differences were observed in morphology and proliferation and the initial immature rosettes started to appear at day 14 from neural induction in all samples. The rosettes from SBA lines were smaller and in higher number compared to controls. We stained rosettes nuclei with DAPI and confirmed these findings (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3B</xref> panels left). Interestingly, FA exposed SBA cells generated larger rosettes with respect to those obtained by SBA untreated cells and more comparable to the structures originated by control cells in normal conditions (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3B</xref> panels right). Subsequently, we measured the diameter size of rosettes derived from SBA and control lines and confirmed that the majority of SBA rosettes were significantly smaller <italic>(p</italic> &lt; <italic>0.0001)</italic> and the diameter size was between 40–70 μm while in the controls the majority of rosette diameter size was more than 100 μm. FA exposure significantly increased the SBA neural rosette diameter sizes <italic>(p</italic> &lt; <italic>0.0001)</italic> that reached more than 100 μm. FA exposure did not affect on control-derived neural rosettes diameter sizes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3C</xref>). Additionally, we counted the rosette number derived from all cell lines and confirmed that SBA lines compared to controls generated significantly more rosettes <italic>(p</italic> &lt; <italic>0.0001)</italic>. Interestingly, upon FA exposure the number of SBA derived rosettes decreased and became similar to that in controls, and no significant differences were found in FA exposed control rosettes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3D</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par15">Taken together, our data demonstrated that SBA iPSCs formed aberrant neural tube structures, presented smaller rosette diameter sizes and in higher quantities as compared to controls. Additionally, FA exposure rescued both aberrant phenotypes, suggesting a critical role of FA in neural rosette formation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec5">
<title>No alterations in early neural gene expressions and protein localization in SBA fetal iPSC-derived NSCs</title>
<p id="Par16">To test whether NSCs derived from SBA lines exhibited any peculiar expression of early neural genes, we next assessed the levels of early neural markers (<italic>PAX6, SOX1</italic> and <italic>NESTIN)</italic> and the Folate Receptor 1 (encoded by the <italic>FOLR1</italic> gene) at day 0 and day 12 of neural differentiation. An upregulation of the early neural markers in concomitance with a parallel decrease of the pluripotency marker <italic>OCT4</italic> was observed in all SBA samples at day 12 of differentiation similar to the controls. Early neural markers were not affected by additional FA exposure.

<title>Correct polarization of neural rosettes derived from SBA iPSCs</title>
<p id="Par19">Polarity of NSCs within rosettes is one of the most important aspects for neural tube development and one of the key features for correct dynamics of NSCs proliferation and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. To this end, we investigated the localization of crucial cell polarity cues within the rosette forming cells. In particular, we evaluated the apical localization of Zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) (known also as Tight junction protein 1,TJP1) and basal enrichment of the adherent junction’s marker N-cadherin (N-CAD) at day 18 of differentiation of SBA iPSCs-derived neural rosettes. Both proteins were localized on the inward side facing the central lumen of the rosettes in all cell types as expected.

<title>Impairment of Ki67+ cells in neural rosettes derived from SBA iPSCs and rescue through additional FA administration</title>
<p id="Par23">We next investigated whether the small size and increased number of SBA iPSC-derived rosettes was associated to any impairment in cell proliferation. We checked Ki67 (also known as MKI67), marker strictly associated with cell proliferation, at day 6 of neural induction. We found that the frequency of Ki67+ cells in SBA iPSC and control lines progeny were similar (around 92%), independently from FA administration. In addition, upon FA exposure, Ki67+ cells significantly increased <italic>(p</italic> &lt; <italic>0.0001)</italic> in all cell lines (around 98%) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S5A,B</xref>). We then determined Ki67 localization in neural rosettes. IF analysis indicated that at day 18 of neural induction Ki67+ cells were decreased in all cell lines as compared to day 6 of the neural induction. Surprisingly, SBA rosettes presented significantly less Ki67+ cells compared to the controls <italic>(p</italic> &lt; <italic>0.0001)</italic>. Moreover, several SBA rosettes were entirely Ki67 negative, indicative of an absence of proliferative cells.

<p id="Par24">In conclusion, during early neural induction, expression of Ki67 was similar in SBA and control lines, and FA exposure similarly increased the number of Ki67+ cells in all cell lines. However, at late stage, Ki67+ cells were significantly reduced in SBA derived neural rosettes, as compared to the controls. FA exposure could rescue this phenotype suggesting an important role of FA in NSCs proliferation.</p>

<title>3D spheroids derived from SBA iPSCs represent aberrant structures and generate less early neurons, rescued by FA exposure</title>
<p id="Par25">We next generated 3D spheroids from neural rosettes to enhance the maturation of the neural tube-like structures (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>).

The 3D spheroids from SBA iPSC lines were significantly smaller as compared to the controls and FA exposure significantly rescued the small size (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4A</xref>). All spheroids displayed correct polarization by expressing ZO-1 in the lumen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4C</xref> panels top-left).

<p id="Par26">We determined if 3D spheroids derived from SBA lines were proliferating less similarly to SBA iPSC-derived neural rosettes. Indeed, we found that the amount of Ki67+ cells was significantly less in SBA-derived spheroids as compared to the controls.

<p id="Par27">To evaluate early neural differentiation potential, we stained spheroids sections with the β-III Tubulin.

<p id="Par28">These data suggest that the SBA-derived 3D spheroids displayed similar characteristics (smaller diameter size and less Ki67+ cells) to neural rosettes and further maturation did not affect their size. Moreover, the amount of early-generated neurons was significantly reduced in SBA-derived 3D spheroids compared to controls. Finally, FA exposure rescued this aberrant phenotype and greatly increased the amount of β-III Tubulin+ cells in all spheroids, underlining the critical role of FA in early neural differentiation process.</p>

FA supplementation is able to prevent occurrence by up to 70%, however the mechanisms behind the action of FA are not clear yet. Given the fact that animal models cannot completely recapitulate human NTDs and clinical phenotype, the needs of additional models, including human <italic>in vitro</italic> models were urgent. Hence, for the first time, we introduced a human cell model derived from SBA fetuses, one of the most severe forms of NTDs. We used different cell sources derived from SBA fetuses, including FSFs and AFSCs, to generate human iPSCs and employed a transgene-free SeV reprogramming approach to avoid integration into the host genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Previous studies showed that human iPSC-derived neural crest stem cells integrated and differentiated into neural lineage when transplanted in large animal models of NTD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Hence human SBA iPSC derivatives could, in principle, be <italic>in vitro</italic> manipulated and tested <italic>in vivo</italic> for their regenerative potential.</p>
<p id="Par41">Neural tube formation and closure are complex processes and may be represented <italic>in vitro</italic> by NSC generation and rosette formation. As a consequence, SBA iPSC-derived neural rosettes may reveal some morphological and gene signature abnormalities. To our surprise, NSCs generated from SBA lines formed self-organized structures and expressed set of early neural genes (<italic>PAX6, SOX1, NESTIN</italic>) similar to the control cell lines. Furthermore, they were correctly polarized, as evidenced by a proper localization of N-CAD and ZO-1 proteins surrounding the lumen already at day 18 of neural induction. Despite these similarities, a number of defects were noted. For example SBA rosettes showed increased expression of the <italic>BLBP</italic> gene, an early RG marker, suggesting altered RG commitment. BLBP plays a role in the establishment of the RG fibres in the developing brain, and impaired RG commitment can alter neural migration and lead to abnormal CNS development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Additionally, previous studies showed that BLBP is highly expressed in different types of tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, including neuroblastoma, one of the most common neurogenic tumours of infancy. In view of this, SBA lines would provide a novel platform to further explore the common characteristics with neuroblastoma.</p>
<p id="Par42">Our results showed that neural rosettes derived from SBA lines were larger in number, yet significantly smaller in size. FA exposure corrected the aberrant phenotype of neural rosettes. This confirms that indeed, appropriate dose of FA is necessary to guarantee the proper formation of neural rosettes. It is still true; that basal culture medium contained few micromoles of FA, and all cell lines, including not treated, received a few amount of FA. However, our analysis demonstrated that extra amount of FA positively impacted on SBA neural rosettes formation. Indeed, some foods are rich with folate (naturally or by fortification), but still additional 400 micrograms (in some cases even more) per day FA supplementation is recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy, which is the crucial period of neural tube formation, closure and the CNS maturation.</p>
<p id="Par43">NTDs occur at early stage of embryonic development, when NSCs are still actively proliferating. Our data showed that at day 6 of neural induction NSCs from SBA lines were proliferating similar to control lines, and FA exposure increased the amount of Ki67+ cells in pathologic and healthy lines. On the contrary, at day 18 of neural induction neural rosettes derived from SBA lines showed a serious reduction in number of Ki67+ cells. Previous studies reported that disrupted NSC proliferation causes several diseases like autism or schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Further experiments are necessary to precisely define the molecular mechanism behind the NSC proliferation impairment within neural rosettes. Additionally, it has previously been shown that FA influenced proliferation and maturation of fetal neural tube cells from Splotch mutant mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Consistent with these reports, FA administration in our human cell model greatly improved the number of Ki67+ cells within neural rosettes that became larger and similar to controls.</p>
<p id="Par44">To better mimic neural tube maturation process, we generated 3D spheroids from neural rosettes. Our results demonstrated that also 3D spheroids derived from SBA neural rosettes were significantly smaller and presented less Ki67+ cells compared to the controls. Consistent to our results, <italic>Lancaster et al</italic>. showed that cerebral organoids derived from neurodevelopmental disorder microcephaly patient-derived iPSCs resembled small brain structures too<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Our data highlighted that the size and amount of early neural tube structures can be crucial too for CNS development and, eventually, for the neural tube closure. FA exposure greatly rescued the size of 3D neural tube structures and the number of Ki67+ cells. Notably, Ki67+ cell fraction was increased mainly in the midline of the lumen, where ZO-1 was expressed too. Polarization, adherence junction interactions are crucial for neural tube closure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> and tissue remodelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Our data suggest that additional amount of FA influenced the morphogenetic processes of neural tube by increasing proliferation and the maturation of the luminal structures. We also evaluated early neural differentiation potential of 3D spheroids, to check upon the hypothesis that the decreased proliferation was likely to be due to the increased number of the early-generated neurons in SBA lines. Our findings demonstrated that β-III Tubulin+ cells were less frequent in SBA derived spheroids as compared to the controls. FA greatly increased the fraction of β-III Tubulin+ cells in SBA and control lines, indicating the important role of FA for early neural differentiation process too. Consistent to our results previous studies also demonstrated the positive influence of FA on fetal neural stem cells differentiation from NTD mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par45">We next assessed NSC differentiation and neural rosette formation upon folate metabolism disruption through acute treatment with folate antagonist MTX. Indeed, our data demonstrated that interference with the folate metabolism resulted in down regulation of early neural markers that dramatically affected neural rosette formation in both SBA and control lines. In agreement with this, previous studies showed that absence of FA in neural differentiation medium also significantly inhibited NSCs proliferation and the expression of neural stem cell markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In our previous study we demonstrated that MTX negatively regulated neurogenesis also in human AFSC culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. It has been also shown that folate deficiency or MTX treatment affected proliferation of embryonic murine NSCs causing NTDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that FA administration rescued <italic>de novo</italic> proliferation and neurosphere formation in mouse primary cultured NSCs exposed to MTX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. This is in line with our observations in human cell model that FA supplementation impacted positively on neural gene expression profile and rosette formation, disrupted by MTX exposure. Thus our data support a mechanistic basis for clinical recommendations of FA administration during MTX treatments. Intriguingly, <italic>FOLR1</italic> was positively regulated by extracellular folate depletion, but upon MTX treatment upregulation was only seen in SBA-derived NSCs. This suggests that SBA-derived NSCs were extremely sensitive to folate depletion and promptly induced <italic>FOLR1</italic> activation in an attempt to increase folate signalling. Indeed, MTX + FA treatment resulted in significant downregulation of <italic>FOLR1</italic> in SBA lines. The upregulation of <italic>FOLR1</italic> observed in specific malignant tumours of epithelial origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> supports the idea that SBA-derived NSCs display a more immature phenotype compared to healthy NSCs.</p>
<p id="Par46">Since previous reports showed impairments in mesodermal tissue formation in both mouse and human NTDs, we differentiated SBA iPSC lines toward the three major mesodermal lineages: chondrogenic, osteogenic and myogenic cells. Our data demonstrated that osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiations were less efficient in SBA lines compared to control lines. FA exposure significantly increased in SBA lines the expression of the cartilage matrix marker <italic>ACAN</italic> essential for cartilage formation during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, however, did not affect the overall GAG deposition, likely because of the short term of FA exposure. FA significantly increased also the osteogenic marker <italic>OCN</italic> and mineral deposition in SBA lines in appropriate culture regiments. In the line to our results, previous studies also demonstrated reduced expression of cartilage matrix genes <italic>COL2A1</italic> and <italic>ACAN</italic> and limited chondrogenesis in an iPSC-based model from patients affected by the congenital disorder, achondroplasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Furthermore, previous studies showed that dietary supplementation of FA rescued cartilage defects in transgenic mice and that developing chondrocytes required folate for proliferation and/or differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par47">Finally, our study showed that early myogenesis was not impaired in SBA iPSCs, although <italic>PAX7</italic> was significantly downregulated and <italic>PAX3</italic> was upregulated upon FA treatment in SBA lines compared to controls. These findings are particularly relevant since <italic>PAX3</italic> and <italic>PAX7</italic> are essential for normal embryonic development and are specifically expressed in the neural tube and the developing somite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. The Splotch (<italic>Pax3-null</italic>) mutant mice exhibit 100% of penetration of neural tube and loss-of-function mutations of <italic>PAX3</italic> are linked to Waardenburg syndrome and NTDs in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Our previous study also showed overexpression of <italic>PAX3</italic> in AFMSCs isolated from the SBA lamb model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> thus emphasising the importance of this gene in the pathogenesis of NTD.</p>
<p id="Par48">Future experiments on our SBA model should be dedicated to find out the possible mechanisms behind the disease phenotypes and FA exposure effect. However, it is still noteworthy to show for the first time how proper amount of FA positively impacted on several phenotypes represented by SBA human iPSC-derived model. Moreover, several signalling pathways contribute to neural tube formation and could be altered in our SBA model. For instance, recent studies showed that γ-secretase inhibitors, preventing Notch signalling, affected <italic>P</italic><italic>AX6</italic>+ and <italic>Ki67</italic>+ cells in human iPSCs-derived rosettes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. In support of this are other studies demonstrating that FA greatly stimulates Notch signalling and cell proliferation in embryonic NSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Alteration of Notch signalling could be another explanation for altered rosette phenotype and be directly linked to Ki67+ cell depletion. However, it is likely not sufficient to consider only Notch signalling to be implicated in the beneficial effect of FA administration that we observed. Indeed, more than 5,000 genes responded to FA exposure in NSCs generated from Rhesus monkey ES cells. These are mainly involved in cell division, morphogenesis, cell migration and metabolism as recently reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par49">In conclusion, we have set up the first human SBA cell model that clearly recapitulates defective early neurogenesis. We believe our human SBA cell model can be used for neurodevelopmental studies and can be further explored to reveal novel mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of NTDs, for drug screenings purposes and <italic>in vivo</italic> regenerative studies.</p>

<p id="Par71">At day 21 of osteogenic differentiation cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol (Sigma Aldrich) for 1 hour and incubated at 4 °C. Cells then were washed with PBS and MilliQ water (Sigma Aldrich). Subsequently, 1 mL of 1% ARS (Sigma Aldrich) solution (pH 4.1 diluted in water) was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at RT. Cells were washed with MilliQ water until cleared of any dye. Then, ARS was distained for quantitative analyses. Briefly, cells were incubated with 300 µL 10% CPC (Sigma Aldrich), at RT overnight with gentle agitation. Next day the solution was removed and 100 µL aliquots were transferred to a 96 well plates, diluted in 100 µl dH<sub>2</sub>0 and read at 570 nm by ICN Titertek Multiskan Plus (Thermo Fisher).</p>

<title>Protein extraction and Western blot analysis</title>
<p id="Par72">At day 16 of myogenic induction cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma Aldrich) supplemented with 10 mM NaF, 0.5 mM Sodium Orthovanadate, 1:100 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and 1 mM Phenylmethylsulfonyl Fluoride. Equal amount of protein were loaded in sample-loading buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mM DTT, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, and 10% glycerol) afterwords transferred in to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline consisting of 0.05% Tween and 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody PAX3 (1:5000) and normalized for Beta-Actin (Millipore). After incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000, Invitrogen) for 1 hour at RT, specific bands were detected with Chemiluminescent Peroxidase Reagent (Sigma Aldrich) and pictures were taken with GelDoc system (Bio-Rad). Quantitation was performed using the QuantityOne Software.</p>
