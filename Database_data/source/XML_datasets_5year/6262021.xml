<p id="Par1">Myoblast fusion (MF) is required for muscle growth and repair, and its alteration contributes to muscle diseases. The mechanisms governing this process are incompletely understood, and no epigenetic regulator has been previously described. Ash1L is an epigenetic activator belonging to the Trithorax group of proteins and is involved in FSHD muscular dystrophy, autism and cancer. Its physiological role in skeletal muscle is unknown. Here we report that Ash1L expression is positively correlated with MF and reduced in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In vivo, ex vivo and in vitro experiments support a selective and evolutionary conserved requirement for Ash1L in MF. RNA- and ChIP-sequencing indicate that Ash1L is required to counteract Polycomb repressive activity to allow activation of selected myogenesis genes, in particular the key MF gene <italic>Cdon</italic>. Our results promote Ash1L as an important epigenetic regulator of MF and suggest that its activity could be targeted to improve cell therapy for muscle diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Cell fusion is a fundamental process required for sexual reproduction and for the development of many body tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. During fertilization, the fusion of sperm and egg leads to the formation of a diploid cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Macrophages undergo fusion events to form osteoclasts during bone development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Also, the genetic reprogramming of somatic cells could occur following stem cell fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Besides these important examples, a specific and tightly regulated type of fusion is crucial for skeletal muscle tissue formation, growth, and repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. During embryonic development, mononucleated muscle cells, termed myoblasts, undergo massive proliferation, providing the required number of precursor cells to build skeletal muscles. Subsequently, they exit the cell cycle, start to differentiate and fuse with one another to generate multinucleated and fully differentiated myofibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This process continues for the first 3 weeks of postnatal life, in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In the adulthood at steady state, myoblast fusion events are sporadic but necessary for muscle regeneration. In response to muscle damage, muscle stem (satellite) cells, which normally reside at the periphery of the mature fiber in a quiescent state, activate, proliferate, and fuse to reconstruct the damaged muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Notably, defects in myoblast fusion contribute to the pathogenesis of an increasing number of muscle diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Recognition and adhesion between fusion partners is an early and key event in myoblast fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Accordingly, the majority of the proteins involved in myoblast fusion identified so far are adhesion proteins, transmembrane lipids, intracellular signaling, or adaptor proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Among these, the immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III domains protein Cdon (cell-adhesion-molecule-related/downregulated by oncogenes) is a member of a cell-surface receptor complex that mediates cell–cell interactions between muscle precursor cells and positively regulates myogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">While we know extensively about the structural and signaling components required for myoblast fusion, the gene expression regulation underlying this important process is poorly understood. A few transcription factors activating myoblast fusion have been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>; however, an identification of fusion-regulated target genes on a genome-wide scale is mostly lacking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Importantly, no epigenetic regulator of myoblast fusion has ever been defined.</p>
<p id="Par6">Absent, small, or homeotic discs like 1 (Ash1L) is a Trithorax group protein that positively regulates gene transcription by counteracting Polycomb group (PcG) protein-mediated silencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Ash1L di-methylates histone H3 lysine 36 to produce H3K36me2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, a histone mark associated with transcriptional activation and enriched at transcription start sites (TSS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Ash1L is involved in several pathological conditions, including autoimmune disease, autism, and cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Despite its involvement in facioscapulohumeral (FSHD) muscular dystrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, the physiological role of Ash1L in skeletal muscle is unknown.</p>
<p id="Par7">We found an evolutionarily conserved requirement for Ash1L in myoblast fusion. Combining genome-wide approaches with gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays, we identified <italic>Cdon</italic> as a direct Ash1L target required for Ash1L-mediated myoblast fusion activation. Altogether, our results promote Ash1L as a crucial epigenetic regulator of myoblast fusion.</p>

<title>Ash1L expression positively correlates with myoblast fusion</title>
<p id="Par8">To begin investigating the physiological role of Ash1L in the skeletal muscle, we evaluated its expression in three crucial processes: muscle development, muscle regeneration, and in vitro muscle differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). During murine prenatal development and adulthood, <italic>Ash1L</italic> expression resulted maximal in fetal skeletal muscles, when myoblast fusion events are most frequent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and was progressively and significantly reduced reaching a minimum at P28, when myoblast fusion is normally off (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Intriguingly, the key myoblast fusion factor <italic>Myomaker</italic> displayed a similar expression pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. On the contrary, the gene encoding for the adult skeletal muscle myosin <italic>Myh4</italic> showed an opposite trend, reaching a maximum when myoblast fusion is over (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). In adulthood at steady state, myoblast fusion is nearly absent, but it is reactivated during regeneration in response to muscle damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. To assess <italic>Ash1L</italic> expression during muscle regeneration, we analyzed tibialis anterior muscle of 8-week-old mice after cardiotoxin (CTX) injury (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). Compared to uninjured muscle, <italic>Ash1L</italic> expression was significantly upregulated during the initial phase of muscle regeneration (day 5), and downregulated at day 10, when myoblast fusion decreases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> similarly to <italic>Myomaker</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. During in vitro myogenesis, we found that Ash1L upregulation occurred just after the induction of differentiation (day 1) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>), and simultaneously with myoblast fusion activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. A key step for myoblast fusion activation is cell–cell contact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we found that cell confluence in proliferation media was sufficient to significantly induce Ash1L expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). Myoblast fusion defects have been described in several muscle diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Inspection of the GEO database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/profiles.html">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/profiles.html</ext-link>) revealed that <italic>Ash1L</italic> expression is significantly downregulated in muscle tissue from both DMD patients and the DMD mouse model mdx, which we confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Collectively, our results indicate that the expression of Ash1L is positively correlated to myoblast fusion and is significantly downregulated in DMD.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Correlation between Ash1L expression and myoblast fusion. <bold>a</bold>

<title>Ash1L is specifically required for myoblast fusion</title>
<p id="Par9">We used embryonic stem cells containing a gene trap cassette inserted in intron 1 of the mouse <italic>Ash1L</italic> gene to generate mice lacking Ash1L (<italic>Ash1L</italic> GT). Unlike a previous report showing that the majority of <italic>Ash1L</italic> GT mice survived into adulthood, although not at a Mendelian ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, most of our independently generated <italic>Ash1L</italic> GT mice were not born alive and the remaining animals displayed full lethality by P8 (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>), possibly due to the different procedures utilized and the degree of backcrossing of the different strains (see Methods). We hence decided to analyze <italic>Ash1L</italic> GT mice at embryonic day 18.5 when <italic>Ash1L</italic> expression and myoblast fusion are high. While we found no significant alteration in the number of muscle fibers, Gomori-trichrome staining of quadricep transverse cryosections revealed a significantly reduced myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA) in <italic>Ash1L</italic> GT mice compared to wild-type mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). Interestingly, longitudinal sections showed that the number of myonuclei per individual myofiber is significantly lower in <italic>Ash1L</italic> GT mice compared to wild-type mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p><italic>Ash1L</italic> GT mice display muscle hypoplasia. <bold>a</bold> Gomori-trichrome staining of transverse cryosections from wild-type (WT) and <italic>Ash1L</italic> GT mice, at embryonic stage E18.5 (upper panel).

Moreover, individual <italic>Ash1L</italic> GT myofibers presented a significantly reduced number of myonuclei compared to controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Effects of <italic>Ash1L</italic> ablation on myoblast fusion. <bold>a</bold> Primary myoblasts isolated from <italic>Ash1L</italic> GT mice display a fusion defect.

<p id="Par11">To further support our findings, we performed acute <italic>Ash1L</italic> knockdown (KD) in C2C12 muscle cells. Similar to <italic>Ash1L</italic> GT, <italic>Ash1L</italic> KD caused no significant alteration in the percentage of Mhc-positive myofibers, but a significant reduction of the fusion index and the number of nuclei per myofiber (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>). Importantly, similar results were obtained in human primary myoblasts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>), indicating that Ash1L is evolutionary required for myotube formation.</p>
<p id="Par12">Muscle formation requires myoblast proliferation, migration, differentiation, and fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. In principle, dysfunction of one or more of these processes could contribute to aberrant myotube formation in the absence of Ash1L. As shown in Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>, <italic>Ash1L</italic>-depleted cells did not present either proliferation or doubling time alterations compared to control cells. Time-lapse microscopy excluded also a significant migration impairment of <italic>Ash1L</italic>-KD myoblasts (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3b</xref>). Finally, the myogenic transcription factors MyoD and myogenin, and the muscle-specific marker desmin were expressed normally in <italic>Ash1L</italic>-KD cells (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3c</xref>), suggesting that Ash1L is not required to activate the muscle differentiation program. These findings imply that myoblasts depleted of Ash1L can proliferate, migrate, and activate muscle-specific gene expression, while are selectively defective in their ability to fuse.</p>

<title>Identification of direct Ash1L targets in muscle cells</title>
<p id="Par13">In order to define the molecular mechanism through which Ash1L activates myoblast fusion, we performed RNA-sequencing comparing <italic>Ash1L</italic> KD to control C2C12 myoblasts.

In line with the known involvement of Ash1L in transcriptional activation, most of the differentially expressed genes resulted downregulated (100/135, 74%), whereas only a few genes resulted upregulated (35/135, 26%).

<title>Ash1L promotes myoblast fusion through Cdon regulation</title>
<p id="Par19">To provide a possible molecular mechanism for the specific myoblast fusion defect observed upon <italic>Ash1L</italic> depletion, we inspected the list of direct Ash1L target genes. Among them, the only one with a known role in myoblast fusion was <italic>Cdon</italic>. The <italic>Cdon</italic> gene encodes for a cell-surface receptor mediating cell–cell interactions between muscle precursor cells and positively regulating myoblast fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>.

Moreover, like <italic>Ash1L</italic> GT myoblasts, <italic>Cdon</italic>-null primary myoblasts fail to fuse into myotubes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. We found that in vivo during muscle development or in response to muscle damage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a, b</xref>), and in vitro during muscle differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>), Cdon displays an expression pattern almost identical to that of Ash1L.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par21">Using a combination of cell biology, transcriptomics, genomics, and genetic analyses we show that Ash1L is evolutionarily required for myoblast fusion, while it is dispensable for myoblast proliferation, migration, and differentiation. In particular, our results suggest that muscle cells lacking Ash1L can differentiate and fuse to form the initial multinucleated myotube, but are defective in the further fusion of myoblasts with myotubes or myotubes with myotubes.</p>
<p id="Par22">Myoblast fusion is a complex process required for muscle development, postnatal muscle growth, and adult muscle regeneration. Elegant studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates have identified many secreted, membrane, signaling, or cytoskeletal proteins belonging to the myoblast fusion machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. On the contrary, only few transcription factors involved in myoblast fusion are known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Notably, no epigenetic regulator of myoblast fusion has ever been described.</p>
<p id="Par23">Ash1L (Kmt2h) is a histone methyltransferase belonging to the Trithorax group. It positively regulates gene transcription by attaching two methyl groups to H3K36 and counteracting PcG-mediated gene silencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We found that the expression of <italic>Ash1L</italic> is positively correlated to myoblast fusion in vivo and in vitro. Intriguingly, <italic>Ash1L</italic> ablation causes a selective myoblast fusion defect in murine and human muscle cells. Accordingly, <italic>Ash1L</italic> GT mice display smaller muscles and fewer nuclei per myofibers likely due to a reduced myoblast fusion.</p>
<p id="Par24">In agreement with its role in transcriptional activation, we found that Ash1L is enriched in active regions of the muscle cells genome, near the TSS of genes presenting also high levels of H3K36me2, and we observed mostly gene downregulation following <italic>Ash1L</italic> depletion. Genomic regions associated to Ash1L are also enriched for regulatory sequences that have been defined by the presence of the Polycomb-dependent histone mark H3K27me3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, we found that the genes downregulated upon <italic>Ash1L</italic>-KD are enriched for known Polycomb targets. By combining RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, we identified 45 direct Ash1L targets. They are enriched for genes induced upon muscle differentiation and with an important role in myogenesis. Given the known role of Ash1L in counteracting Polycomb-repressive activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, it is tempting to speculate that the increase in <italic>Ash1L</italic> expression at the early phase of muscle differentiation could allow for the expression of specific Polycomb targets required for muscle differentiation.</p>
<p id="Par25">Cell–cell contact is required for myoblast fusion and strongly stimulates myogenesis through the activation of promyogenic signal transduction pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. A key factor in cell contact-dependent signaling during myoblast fusion is Cdon, a multifunctional cell-surface protein serving as coreceptor for N-cadherin, neogenin, Hedgehog, and Wnt pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. <italic>Cdon</italic> is a Polycomb target (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">5</xref>), is upregulated during muscle differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> and is the only direct Ash1L target gene with a known role in myoblast fusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. We found that <italic>Cdon</italic> parallels <italic>Ash1L</italic> expression during muscle development and regeneration. Moreover, <italic>Cdon</italic> is significantly downregulated in muscles of <italic>Ash1L</italic> GT mice and upon <italic>Ash1L</italic> depletion in mouse and human muscle cells. <italic>Cdon</italic>-KO mice display smaller muscle fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>, as we observed in <italic>Ash1L</italic> GT mice. Furthermore, primary myoblasts isolated from both <italic>Cdon</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup> and <italic>Ash1L</italic> GT mice display a myoblast fusion defect. Importantly, we found that <italic>Cdon</italic> expression is sufficient to rescue the myoblast fusion defect of <italic>Ash1L</italic>-KD cells indicating that (at least in vitro) <italic>Cdon</italic> is a key target through which Ash1L regulates myoblast fusion. Future work is required to understand the relevance of the other direct Ash1L targets that we identified in muscle.</p>
<p id="Par26">In vitro, myotube formation is generally obtained by growing myoblasts until near confluence in mitogen-rich medium, followed by a switch to mitogen-poor medium. Although the reduction of growth factors is an important differentiation signal, cell confluency itself is strongly promyogenic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, we found that cell confluence is sufficient to strongly activate Ash1L expression even in the presence of a mitogen-rich medium. In the future, it would be interesting to determine which signaling pathway activated by high myoblast cell density is involved in Ash1L activation.</p>
<p id="Par27">Ash1L is not a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. Hence, the association of Ash1L to specific genomic regions is likely mediated by gene-specific recruiters. We previously reported that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) <italic>DBE-T</italic> directly binds to Ash1L and recruits it to the FSHD muscular dystrophy locus for the activation of key disease genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. By analogy, it would thus be interesting to find out whether additional lncRNAs are involved in Ash1L recruitment to its target genes identified in the present study.</p>
<p id="Par28">The regulation of myoblast fusion is relevant for understanding the pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> and treatment of several muscle disorders. One of the muscular diseases in which myoblast fusion defects have been described is DMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Exon skipping with morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (PMO-AO) is a promising therapeutic strategy for DMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. However, sporadic and variable rescue of dystrophin expression has been reported so far. It was recently shown that the fusion of PMO-loaded myoblasts to the repairing myofiber is a crucial aspect for PMO delivery into muscles of mdx mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we found a significant reduction of <italic>Ash1L</italic> expression in muscle tissue from both DMD patients and mdx mice. In line with a role of Ash1L in activating myoblast fusion and of its downregulation in DMD, it would be intriguing to test whether Ash1L co-delivery could increase the efficacy of PMO for the treatment of DMD.</p>
<p id="Par29">In conclusion, we defined a key regulatory mechanism of myoblast fusion, a process required for muscle formation and repair. A better understanding of Ash1L-mediated regulation of myogenesis could contribute to clarify pathogenic mechanisms as well as to improve therapeutic approaches for muscle diseases.</p>

All comparisons were done in triplicate. In each comparison the probe sets that were upregulated and downregulated with FDR &lt;0.05 were identified. A gene was defined as upregulated if at least one of its probe sets was upregulated in one comparison and if the number of its probe sets upregulated across all conditions was greater than the number of downregulated ones.
