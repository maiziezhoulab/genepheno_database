<title>ABSTRACT</title>
<p>Heterozygous mutations in <italic>GBA</italic>, the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucosylceramidase beta/β-glucocerebrosidase, comprise the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD), but the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Here, we show that in <italic>Gba</italic><sup>L444P/WT</sup> knockin mice, the L444P heterozygous <italic>Gba</italic> mutation triggers mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting autophagy and mitochondrial priming, two steps critical for the selective removal of dysfunctional mitochondria by autophagy, a process known as mitophagy. In SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells, the overexpression of L444P GBA impeded mitochondrial priming and autophagy induction when endogenous lysosomal GBA activity remained intact. By contrast, genetic depletion of <italic>GBA</italic> inhibited lysosomal clearance of autophagic cargo. The link between heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutations and impaired mitophagy was corroborated in postmortem brain tissue from PD patients carrying heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutations, where we found increased mitochondrial content, mitochondria oxidative stress and impaired autophagy. Our findings thus suggest a mechanistic basis for mitochondrial dysfunction associated with <italic>GBA</italic> heterozygous mutations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>GBA (glucosylceramidase beta) is a lysosomal enzyme that degrades glucosylceramide to ceramide and glucose. Homozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutations cause Gaucher disease (GD), the most common lysosomal disorder, whereas heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutations are the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD), present in 7–20% of all PD cases [<xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>]. Compared to PD patients lacking <italic>GBA</italic> mutations (Non-GBA-PD), patients with heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutations (GBA-PD) have an earlier age at onset, greater cognitive decline, and a faster rate of disease progression [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>The mechanisms underlying the association between heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutations and PD are unclear. The pathogenesis of PD, however, involves abnormalities in mitochondrial function, which include impaired mitochondrial electron transport chain function, damaged mitochondrial DNA, impaired calcium buffering, and abnormal mitochondrial morphology and dynamics [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>–<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. Moreover, familial PD can be caused by mutations in genes that encode the proteins PINK (PTEN induced putative kinase 1), PRKN/PARK2 (parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) and PARK7/DJ-1 [<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>], each of which contribute to the selective removal of dysfunctional mitochondria by macroautophagy (autophagy hereafter). In this process, known as mitophagy, compromised mitochondria are flagged by autophagy receptors, recognized and engulfed by phagophores, which mature into autophagosomes, and delivered to lysosomes for degradation.</p>
<p>Recent studies reported mitochondrial fragmentation, reduced respiratory chain complex activities, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and lower oxygen consumption in neuronal and glial cells of <italic>Gba</italic> conditional knockout mice [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. The link between GBA deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction is corroborated by decreased MMP in neuronal cultures treated with conduritol B epoxide (CBE), a covalent inhibitor of GBA [<xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]. These findings provided evidence for a loss-of-function mechanism of <italic>GBA</italic> mutations for mitochondrial dysfunction associated with GD, in which both <italic>GBA</italic> alleles are mutated, resulting in a reduction in GBA protein levels and lysosomal GBA enzyme activity, probably because <italic>GBA</italic> mutations often lead to misfolded proteins that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and undergo rapid ER-associated degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. As a consequence, an accumulation of GBA lipid substrate is found in GD throughout the body.</p>
<p>Whereas reduced GBA activity is associated with GBA1 mutations, and has been reported in both sporadic PD and heterozygous GBA-PD patients, as well as in D409V/WT, L444P/WT, and N370S/WT heterozygous GBA mutant or heterozygous <italic>Gba</italic> knockout (WT/-) mouse brain [<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>], hemizygous <italic>Gba</italic> knbockout (<italic>Gba</italic><sup>WT/-</sup>) mouse neurons and glia do not show mitochondrial defects [<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. It thus remains unclear whether and how heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutations, particularly those commonly encountered in PD patients (L444P and N370S), contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction associated with PD.</p>
<p>In this study, we address whether and how heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutations affect mitochondrial homeostasis and autophagy-lysosome degradation. We found that knockin mice carrying one copy of the PD-associated L444P mutant <italic>Gba</italic> allele (<italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic>) exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction associated with impaired autophagy and mitochondrial priming, a process by which autophagy receptor proteins are recruited to damaged mitochondria for selective degradation. In genetically engineered SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, the loss of GBA activity compromised lysosomal clearance of autophagosomes, whereas the presence of the L444P GBA mutation in the context of normal lysosomal GBA enzyme activity disrupted mitochondrial priming and autophagy induction. We confirmed these mitochondrial and autophagy deficits in brain tissues from PD patients with heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutations. Together, our results suggest that PD-associated heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutation is sufficient to drive mitochondrial dysfunction through specific alterations in autophagy-lysosomal function and mitochondrial tagging, and so provides a cellular basis for furthering the development of PD-associated mitochondrial phenotypes.</p>

<title>L444P GBA heterozygous mutation causes mitochondrial dysfunction</title>
<p>To address whether heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutations impair mitochondrial function, we used a <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> knockin mouse model carrying the heterozygous L444P mutation, a common pathogenic mutation for neuropathic GD and for PD with accelerated longitudinal cognitive decline [<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>]. The brains of these mutant mice possessed ~40% lower GBA protein levels (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1(A,B</xref>)) and ~40% lower lysosomal GBA enzyme activity (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1(C</xref>)) than their wild-type (WT) littermates. We also noted an accumulation of soluble SNCA/α-synuclein protein in the hippocampus of <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1(A,D)</xref>), although we did not find aggregated SNCA species (not shown).<fig fig-type="figure" id="F0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/15548627.2018.1509818-F0001</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Reduced GBA protein levels and enzyme activity in <italic>Gba</italic><sup>L444P/WT</sup> hippocampus.

<p>We assessed mitochondrial function in primary hippocampal neurons by measuring MMP using MitoTracker Red (MitoRed). Total mitochondrial content was determined using MitoTracker Green (MitoGreen). Compared to WT controls, <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> neurons showed a lower baseline MMP but increased total mitochondrial content (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(A</xref>)). The ratio of MitoRed to MitoGreen, which reports levels of polarized functional mitochondria, was significantly lower in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> neurons than in controls, supporting impaired mitochondrial function (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref>). We then assessed mitochondrial morphology by calculating the aspect ratio (length to width ratio) of individual mitochondria labeled by MitoGreen [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>], which was increased in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> neurons, indicating an elongated mitochondrial phenotype in the mutants (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(B)</xref>). The form factor, which reflects mitochondrial complexity and branching, remained similar between WT controls and mutant neurons.<fig fig-type="figure" id="F0002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/15548627.2018.1509818-F0002</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mouse hippocampal neurons (A) Representative micrographs of MitoTracker Red- and MitoTracker Green-labeled WT and <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> primary hippocampal neurons in primary cultures (14–15 DIV).

<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction may lead to oxidative stress and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). We therefore measured mitochondrial ROS levels in live <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> neurons using MitoSOX Red, a cell permeant mitochondrial superoxide indicator that, when oxidized, intercalates into mitochondrial DNA, resulting in red fluorescence. Compared to controls, <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> neurons displayed increased MitoSOX Red fluorescence, indicating higher levels of superoxide production (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(C)</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm increased mitochondrial content in the hippocampus of <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mice in vivo, we probed for the mitochondrial outer membrane proteins VDAC1/PORIN and TOMM20 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20), the inner membrane protein TIMM23 (translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 23), and the intermembrane protein CYCS (cytochrome c, somatic) [<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>]. Whereas protein levels of VDAC1 and CYCS were significantly higher in the <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> hippocampus, the levels of TOMM20 and TIMM23, two mitochondrial import proteins that translocate nuclear-encoded precursor proteins to mitochondria, were significantly decreased (<xref rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>). The reduction in TOMM20 protein levels was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in the <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mouse hippocampus in vivo, where total TOMM20 fluorescence intensity was decreased in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figure S1(A)). The number of TOMM20-positive puncta was, however, slightly higher in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> neurons, supporting an increase in mitochondrial content.</p>
<p>We did not find alterations in the protein levels of PPARGC1A/PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferative activated receptor, gamma, coactivator 1 alpha) as well as its downstream targets NRF1 (nuclear respiratory factor 1) and TFAM (transcription factor A, mitochondrial), all of which regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. We further noted that protein levels of MT-CO1 (mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase I), mitochondrial matrix proteins SOD2 (superoxide dismutase 2, mitochondrial) and PPID (pepidylprolyl isomerase D [cyclophilin D]) as well as mitochondrial DNA copy number (Figure S1(B,C)) remained unaltered in the <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> brain. Therefore, the increase in mitochondrial content may not result from upregulated mitochondrial biogenesis.</p>
<p>Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that require continuous fission and fusion to maintain integrity: fusion allows the exchange of contents, and fission effectively lowers the fraction of defective mitochondria [<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>]. Thus, an appropriate equilibrium between fission and fusion is critical for normal mitochondrial function [<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref>]. We assessed mitochondrial dynamics by measuring the levels of mitochondrial fission protein DNM1L/DRP1 (dynamin 1-like) and fusion proteins OPA1 (OPA1, mitochondrial dynamin like GTPase), MFN1 (mitofusin 1), and MFN2 (mitofusin 2).

<title>Impaired mitophagy by the L444P GBA heterozygous mutation</title>
<p>We next asked whether the accumulation of compromised mitochondria in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> neurons resulted from impaired mitophagy. To measure basal mitophagy, we crossed the <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mice to a transgenic mouse model expressing mitochondrial-targeted Keima (mt-Keima), a coral-derived acid-stable fluorescent protein that exhibits a pH-dependent bimodal excitation spectrum [<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>]. Protonated Keima in acidic lysosomes has stronger 561-nm excitation, whereas neutral Keima is predominantly excited by 458-nm wavelength light [<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>]. The slow turnover of lysosomal Keima allows for the qualitative measurement of mitophagic flux in live cell cultures [<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>], and the ratio of 561:458 nm-excited Keima fluorescence intensity indicates the delivery of mitochondria to lysosomes. As in <xref rid="F0004">Figure 4(A</xref>), mt-Keima within lysosomes was mainly excited by the 561-nm (red) wavelength, but retained some modest capacity for 458-nm (green) excitation, which made the mt-Keima fluorescence yellow. Compared to WT controls, <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> neurons exhibited a significantly lower red excitation, suggesting impaired autophagic delivery of mitochondria to lysosomes. Lysosomal protease inhibition by leupeptin and pepstatin (Leu/Pep) elicited a subtle increase in lysosomal-retained Keima in WT controls, but had no effect in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> neurons (<xref rid="F0004">Figure 4(A)</xref>). <fig fig-type="figure" id="F0004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/15548627.2018.1509818-F0004</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Impaired mitophagy in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mouse hippocampal neurons.

The ratio of the 561:458 nm-excited mito-Keima fluorescence in neuronal cell bodies was calculated to reflect mitophagy activity (right panel) .

The cells were recovered in fresh medium, loaded with MitoTracker Green (MitoGreen; 200 nM) for 30 min followed by LysoTracker Red (LysoRed, 200 nM) for 30 min at 37°C. The number of MitoGreen and LysoRed colabeled puncta (yellow) per cell body were counted as an index of mitophagy (right panel). The boxed areas (scale bar: 2 μm) are shown in higher magnification in the right 3 micrographs for clarity.

(C) Mitochondrial levels of autophagy receptor proteins in brain tissue from WT (n = 12) and <italic>Gba</italic><sup>L444P/WT</sup> (n = 12) mice. Brain mitochondria were fractionated and analyzed for mitophagy proteins PINK1 and PARK2, K63- and K48-ubiquitinated species, and the autophagy receptors SQSTM1, NBR1, BNIP3L and OPTN. Protein levels were normalized to VDAC1, as the abundance of VDAC1, when normalized to GAPDH, was consistent with the increase in mitochondrial content in the mutants. Data represent mean ± SE (A, B) or mean % of WT controls (C) from 3 independent experiments.

<p>To assess evoked mitophagy, we treated WT and <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> neurons with the protonophore Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP, 10 μM), a potent mitochondrial uncoupler that induces mitochondrial depolarization and thus mitophagy [<xref rid="CIT0025">25</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref>], or with a milder mitochondrial complex III inhibitor, antimycin (40 μM), that was recently shown to induce mitophagy in hippocampal neurons [<xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>]. We found no difference in cell survival between vehicle-treated WT and <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> neurons. One-hour exposure to 10 μM CCCP or 40 μM antimycin had no effects on neuronal survival, but 12-h prolonged treatment induced significant neuronal death in both WT and mutant cultures, with the mutants more vulnerable to both mitochondrial toxins (Figure S2(A)). We thus chose to assess the induction of mitophagy following 1-h CCCP or antimycin exposure, by measuring the colocalization of MitoGreen-labeled mitochondria with LysoTracker Red-labeled lysosomes [<xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0029">29</xref>]. Compared to WT controls, <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> neurons showed less colocalization of mitochondria and lysosomes following CCCP (<xref rid="F0004">Figure 4(B)</xref>) or antimycin treatment (Figure S2(B)). Collectively, these data suggested that evoked mitophagy was impaired in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mutants.</p>
<p>We further examined the initiation of mitophagy <italic>in</italic> vivo in WT and <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> CA1 neurons by immunostainning hippocampal brain sections for the mitochondrial protein TOMM20 and the autophagosome protein MAP1LC3B/LC3B. Compared to WT, <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> hippocampal neurons showed fewer puncta positive for both TOMM20 and LC3B (Figure S2(C)), suggesting that fewer mitochondria were recruited to phagophores under basal conditions in the mutants. To determine the steps that may interfere with autophagic delivery of mitochondria to lysosomes, we analyzed the recruitment of the autophagy machinery to damaged mitochondria, a process known as mitochondrial priming, which is thought to occur through either PRKN/PARK2-dependent or -independent mechanisms [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>]. Mitochondria were fractionated from brains of WT and <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mice by density centrifugation as outlined in Figure S3(A,B), and subjected to western blot analysis for autophagy receptor proteins, including ubiquitin-dependent receptors NBR1 (NBR1, autophagy cargo receptor), CALCOCO2/NDP52 (calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2), OPTN (optineurin) and SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1). These cargo-recognizing molecules bind preferentially to Lys63 ubiquitin linkages on the surface of damaged mitochondria to trigger mitochondrial priming [<xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>]. We also examined levels of BNIP3L (BCL2/adenovirus E1B interacting protein 3-like), a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that regulates mitophagy in a PRKN/PARK2- and ubiquitin-independent manner. Compared to control mice, <italic>Gba</italic> mutants exhibited decreased levels of mitochondrial PARK2, NBR1 and BNIP3L (<xref rid="F0004">Figure 4(C)</xref>), suggesting that the processes that target compromised mitochondria for autophagic degradation were disrupted in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mice.</p>

<title>Impaired basal autophagy and lysosomal degradation by the L444P GBA heterozygous mutation</title>
<p>Removal of damaged mitochondria through autophagy also requires the induction of general autophagy. Thus, we assessed basal autophagy by western blot analysis of LC3B-II, which represents the abundance of autophagosomes [<xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>], and the autophagy substrate SQSTM1 in hippocampal tissue from WT and <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mice. Levels of LC3B-II and SQSTM1 proteins were both increased in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> brain (<xref rid="F0005">Figure 5(A,B</xref>)). This increase was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> hippocampus (<xref rid="F0005">Figure 5(C)</xref>).<fig fig-type="figure" id="F0005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/15548627.2018.1509818-F0005</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Impaired autophagy-lysosome function in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> neurons.

Quantification of GFP-positive (green) and RFP-positive (red) LC3B puncta in cell bodies of primary hippocampal neurons (DIV 14–15) was used to estimate the amount of reporter LC3B protein degraded by autophagy. Neurons were treated with (PI<sup>+</sup>) and without the lysosome protease inhibitors leupeptin and pepstatin A (10 μM each) to determine the amount of reporter LC3B degraded by lysosomes. Induced autophagy was assessed by treating neurons with rapamycin (200 µM) + leupeptin and pepstatin A. Green puncta denote GFP-positive autophagosomes prior to fusion with lysosomes, and RFP-positive red puncta denote the total pool of autophagic vacuoles. The ‘Red-Green’ denotes autolysosomes, which was calculated by subtracting the number of GFP-positive from RFP-positive puncta. Data are mean ± SEM of ~40 neurons from 4–5 dishes of living neuronal cultures per condition. Compared to WT, *, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01, One-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post hoc test.

<p>The increase in LC3B-II levels may indicate an enhanced autophagy induction or a blockade in downstream lysosomal degradation. Autophagy can be initiated through MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase)-dependent and -independent pathways [<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>]. MTOR negatively regulates the induction of autophagy, and MTOR activity, reported by levels of phosphorylated MTOR (p-MTOR) and phosphorylated RPS6 (ribosomal protein S6) protein (p-RPS6), is negatively correlated with autophagy induction. BECN1 (beclin 1, autophagy related) and AMBRA1 (autophagy/beclin 1 regulator 1) are key proteins essential for the initiation of autophagosome formation downstream of MTOR, and in some cases, in response to signaling cues bypassing MTOR [<xref rid="CIT0033">33</xref>]. Whereas we found lower p-MTOR and p-RPS6 levels in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> brain than in controls, levels of BECN1 and AMBRA1 were also decreased in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> brain (<xref rid="F0005">Figure 5(A,B)</xref>), suggesting that the mutant GBA may suppress the induction of basal autophagy despite the decrease in MTOR activity.</p>
<p>To examine how autophagic flux was altered in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> hippocampal neurons, we crossed <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mice to a tandem CAG-red fluorescent protein (RFP)-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3B transgenic autophagy reporter mouse line [<xref rid="CIT0034">34</xref>]. In this assay, RFP red fluorescence is stable whereas GFP green fluorescence is rapidly quenched in acidic compartments. As such, neutral autophagosomes are labeled with both RFP (red) and GFP (green) fluorescence. When fused with lysosomes, autophagosomes mature into autolysosomes which exhibit RFP (red) fluorescence only [<xref rid="CIT0035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>We quantified autophagosomes by counting GFP fluorescent green puncta. The total number of autophagic vacuoles, including autophagosomes and autolysosomes, was determined by counting all RFP fluorescent red puncta. The amount of autolysosomes, which represents the number of autophagosomes that were delivered to and degraded by lysosomes [<xref rid="CIT0036">36</xref>], was derived by subtracting the number of green puncta from the number of red puncta (red minus green). Consistent with our previous finding of increased LC3B-II protein levels in the mutants (<xref rid="F0005">Figure 5(A,B)</xref>), <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> neurons exhibited higher levels of total autophagic vacuoles than WT controls (<xref rid="F0005">Figure 5(D)</xref>), which is likely due to higher levels of autolysosomes. We further treated these cultures with the lysosomal protease inhibitors leupeptin and pepstatin, which block lysosomal LC3 degradation without elevating lysosome pH, resulting in an increase in autophagic vacuoles. Following leupeptin-pepstatin treatment, we observed a dramatic increase in autolysosomes in WT but not in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> neurons. These data suggested a rapid degradation of autophagosomes in WT neurons but a blockade of lysosomal degradation in the mutants.</p>
<p>The capacity for autophagy induction was assessed by treating cells with the autophagy inducer rapamycin in the presence of leupeptin and pepstatin. Rapamycin induced a significant increase in the number of total autophagic vacuoles in WT neurons. This increase was however significantly attenuated in GBA mutant neurons (60% induction in WT vs. 25% induction in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic>), suggesting that autophagy induction was impaired by the L444P/WT heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutant. Together, our findings support the idea that autophagy is impaired in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> neurons at both an initial autophagy induction step and a later step of lysosomal degradation.</p>

<title>A dual mechanism for mitophagy defect by the L444P GBA heterozygous mutation</title>
<p>Our data above showed that mitophagy was disrupted in the <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mouse brain due to both reduced efficacy of autophagy-lysosomal degradation and impaired mitochondrial priming. We repeated all of these measurements in human fibroblasts carrying heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutations (Figure S4(A-D)) and in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mouse heart tissue (Figure S4(E,F)), and found similar mitochondrial and autophagy phenotypes. As SNCA protein is not typically expressed in fibroblasts and heart tissue, our findings suggest that GBA heterozygous mutation caused defects in mitophagy independently of SNCA accumulation.</p>
<p>To address whether heterozygous GBA mutations contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction through a loss-of-function mechanism, we generated a <italic>GBA</italic> gene knockout (KO) SH-SY5Y cell line, in which <italic>GBA</italic> gene deletion resulted in a complete loss of both GBA protein and enzyme activity (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(A)</xref>). Given that hemizygous <italic>GBA</italic><sup>WT/-</sup> cells do not show mitochondrial defects [<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>], we propose that mitochondrial phenotypes in <italic>GBA</italic> heterozygous mutants may require alternative mechanisms that involve the presence of mutant GBA protein. To distinguish the effect of mutant protein from the loss of GBA enzyme activity, we generated SH-SY5Y cells stably overexpressing MYC-tagged WT or L444P GBA on the background of both copies of endogenous WT <italic>GBA</italic> alleles.</p>
<p>The expression of endogenous GBA and exogenous MYC-tagged GBA was confirmed by western blot analysis using antibodies against GBA and MYC-tag (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(A)</xref>). Whereas WT GBA overexpression markedly increased both GBA protein levels and lysosomal GBA enzyme activity, the overexpression of mutant GBA<sup>L444P</sup> did not interfere with the normal lysosomal enzyme activity of endogenous WT GBA, although the total GBA protein levels significantly increased (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(A)</xref>). It was reported that the MYC-tagged WT or mutant GBA possessed similar properties as those of endogenous WT and mutant proteins from GD or PD human fibroblasts [<xref rid="CIT0037">37</xref>]. We confirmed these early findings by examining GBA protein levels in fractionated ER and lysososmes (Figure S3(C,D)), and found that MYC-tagged WT GBA was mainly transported to lysosomes, whereas MYC-tagged GBA<sup>L444P</sup> was largely retained in the ER (Figure S3(E)).<fig fig-type="figure" id="F0006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/15548627.2018.1509818-F0006</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Dual effects of heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutation on mitophagy.

<p>We assessed MMP in these cell lines using MitoRed and mitochondrial content using MitoGreen (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(B)</xref>). The loss of GBA in the KO cells did not affect mitochondrial content but impaired MMP (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(C)</xref>). The overexpression of WT GBA resulted in an increase in both MMP and mitochondrial content, whereas GBA<sup>L444P</sup> overexpression led to a reduction in MMP but an increase in mitochondrial mass (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(D)</xref>). Both L444P-expressing and KO cells exhibited a reduction in the MitoRed:MitoGreen ratio, reflecting an increase in compromised mitochondria. Consistently, we observed increased MitoSox Red signals in both L444P-expressing and KO cells, indicating increased mitochondrial ROS generation (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(B,E)</xref>). Together, these data suggest that either the loss of GBA activity or the presence of the mutant GBA<sup>L444P</sup> protein can cause the accumulation of compromised mitochondria, decrease in MMP, and mitochondrial oxidative stress. Further, we observed a decrease in protein levels of autophagy receptors SQSTM1, BNIP3L and NBR1 in mitochondria fractionated from L444P-expressing but not KO cells (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(F)</xref>), suggesting that the mutant GBA<sup>L444P</sup> protein, but not the loss of GBA enzyme activity, inhibited mitochondrial priming.</p>
<p>We next examined basal autophagy in all four cell lines. Compared to controls, KO cells showed higher LC3B-II levels, while L444P-expressing cells exhibited lower LC3B-II levels (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(G)</xref>). To assess the flux of autophagy including lysosome degradation, LC3B-II levels were compared between cells treated with (PI<sup>+</sup>) or without (PI<sup>−</sup>) lysosome inhibitors leupeptin and pepstatin. Upon treatment, all 4 cell lines showed an increase in LC3B-II levels, but L444P-expressing cells exhibited much lower LC3B-II levels than mock control and WT cells, suggesting that the presence of the GBA<sup>L444P</sup> protein can suppress autophagosome formation when the lysosomal GBA activity is preserved. We further noted a reduction in AMBRA1 and BECN1 protein levels in the L444P-expressing but not the KO cells (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(H)</xref>), which confirmed that the mutant GBA<sup>L444P</sup> protein, but not the loss of GBA enzyme activity, inhibits autophagy induction. The flux of autophagy, denoted as ‘PI<sup>+</sup>-PI<sup>−</sup>’, remained intact in the L444P-expressing cells, supporting intact lysosome degradation. The autophagy flux was, however, increased in the WT line but decreased in the KO cells (<xref rid="F0006">Figure 6(G)</xref>). Thus, overexpressing WT GBA enhances autophagy flux, whereas the loss of GBA enzyme activity impedes lysosomal clearance of autophagic vacuoles.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial dysfunction in the anterior cingular cortex of GBA-PD patients</title>
<p>Mitochondrial pathology in the anterior cingular cortex of GBA- and non-GBA-PD patients was determined by measuring the levels of mitochondrial proteins that are critical for mitochondrial electron transport, dynamics, and oxidative stress. Both GBA-PD and non-GBA-PD brains exhibited an accumulation of oligomeric SNCA (Figure S5(A)). GBA protein levels were decreased by ~30% in non-GBA-PD and ~60% in GBA-PD, suggesting an additive effect of PD status and heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutations on reducing GBA protein levels. GBA enzyme activity was significantly lower in GBA-PD, but was not different between controls and non-GBA-PD patients (<xref rid="F0007">Figure 7(A)</xref>).</p>

There was a similar but nonsignificant trend (p &gt; 0.05) in non-GBA-PD cases, suggesting that the presence of the <italic>GBA</italic> mutation may exacerbate these aspects of mitochondrial pathology. Immunohistochemistry of VDAC1 in fixed brain sections confirmed the accumulation of VDAC1-labeled mitochondria in pyramidal neurons from GBA-PD brain (<xref rid="F0007">Figure 7(E)</xref>).

These data together confirmed an increase in mitochondrial content in GBA-PD brain, despite a decrease in mitochondrial protein import complexes.</p>
<p>We also noted that levels of DNM1L, FIS1 (fission, mitochondrial 1) and MFN2 proteins were lower in GBA-PD brain than in controls, suggesting altered mitochondrial dynamics in GBA-PD brain (<xref rid="F0007">Figure 7(G)</xref>).

<title>Impaired autophagy in the anterior cingular cortex of GBA-PD patients</title>
<p>We next asked whether mitochondrial pathology in GBA-PD anterior cingular cortex is associated with abnormalities in autophagy-lysosomal degradation. The level of LC3B-II was significantly higher in GBA-PD and non-GBA-PD patients than in controls (<xref rid="F0008">Figure 8(A)</xref>). We, however, detected a significant accumulation of the autophagy substrate SQSTM1 in GBA-PD, but not in non-GBA-PD, brain (<xref rid="F0008">Figure 8(A)</xref>), suggesting that the degradation through the autophagy-lysosomal pathway was compromised most significantly in GBA-PD. Abnormalities in autophagy in GBA-PD were confirmed by immunohistochemistry of LC3B and SQSTM1 in fixed cingular cortical brain sections, as the fluorescence intensity of both LC3B and SQSTM1 was higher in pyramidal neurons in GBA-PD patients than in controls (<xref rid="F0008">Figure 8(B)</xref>). No differences were detected in levels of the lysosomal proteins LAMP1 and CTSD (cathepsin D) (<xref rid="F0008">Figure 8(A)</xref>), suggesting that the total lysosomal content remained similar between control and GBA-PD brain. We then examined whether the increase in LC3B-II levels in GBA-PD was due to enhanced autophagy induction.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recent studies reported both mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy defects in <italic>gba</italic> gene knockout GD mouse models and cell cultures [<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0039">39</xref>], suggesting a loss-of-function mechanism of GBA mutations in mitochondrial dysfunction that is associated with GD. It remains unclear, however, whether and how PD-associated heterozygous GBA mutations contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, we provide evidence that heterozygous L444P <italic>Gba/GBA</italic> mutation impairs mitochondrial function by inhibiting mitophagy, a process essential for the removal of compromised mitochondria [<xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0040">40</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0041">41</xref>], We confirmed a reduction in both general autophagy and mitochondrial priming in vivo in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mouse brain tissue and in vitro in cultured hippocampal neurons. The GBA<sup>L444P</sup> mutant protein appears to affect mitophagy through a dual mechanism: the loss of GBA activity impedes lysosomal clearance of autophagosomes, whereas the mutant GBA protein inhibits autophagy induction and mitochondrial priming. Importantly, these findings were mirrored in postmortem anterior cingulate cortical tissue from PD patients with heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutations, suggesting that carriers of heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutations have mitophagy deficits that may contribute to PD-associated mitochondrial deficits.</p>

<title>Impaired mitochondrial fission by the L444P GBA heterozygous mutation</title>
<p>A number of PD-related proteins, including SNCA, PINK1, PRKN, PARK7, and LRRK2, have been reported to regulate mitochondrial fission and fusion [<xref rid="CIT0042">42</xref>–<xref rid="CIT0046">46</xref>], suggesting that altered mitochondrial dynamics contributes to neurodegeneration. We found substantial changes in levels of mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins, with a consistent decrease of DNM1L in brain tissues from GBA-PD patients and <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mice. As most mitochondrial fission pathways converge on DNM1L [<xref rid="CIT0042">42</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0047">47</xref>], the reduction in DNM1L levels indicates disrupted mitochondria dynamics in GBA-PD, a defect consistent with the elongated mitochondrial phenotype we observed in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> neurons (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(B)</xref>) and fibroblasts (Figure S3(D)). It has been proposed that coupled fission and fusion, followed by autophagy, plays an important role in removing dysfunctional mitochondrial components [<xref rid="CIT0048">48</xref>], and an inhibition of mitochondrial fission may impair mitochondrial degradation by autophagy.</p>

<title>Impaired general autophagy by the L444P GBA heterozygous mutation</title>
<p>We report a reduction in protein levels of autophagy inducers AMBRA1 and BECN1 in brain tissues from GBA-PD patients and <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mice, which suggests impaired autophagosome biogenesis. We confirmed the reduction in autophagy flux and autophagy induction in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mutant mouse neuronal cultures. The steady-state LC3B-II levels were, however, higher in vivo in brain tissues of GBA-PD patients and <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mice, which may represent impeded lysosomal degradation of autophagosomes. Unexpectedly we found that p-MTOR and p-RPS6 protein levels were decreased in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mouse brains. While contrary to our observation of suppressed autophagy induction, these data are consistent with recent studies in GD and GBA-PD patient-derived fibroblasts [<xref rid="CIT0049">49</xref>] and <italic>Gba1</italic>-deficient <italic>Drosophila</italic> models [<xref rid="CIT0050">50</xref>] in which the hypoactive MTOR was proposed to be responsible for impaired recycling of functional lysosomes from autolysosomes.</p>
<p>We found that, in <italic>GBA</italic> KO SH-SY5Y cells, <italic>GBA</italic> gene deletion impaired lysosomal degradation of autophagosomes but had little effect on the induction of autophagy. The lack of impaired autophagy induction in these KO cells suggests a gain-of-function mechanism of GBA mutation for altered autophagy. Consistently, we recapitulated the reduced autophagy induction, which is likely to result from reduced AMBRA1 and BECN1 expression, in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing the mutant GBA<sup>L444P</sup>, in which endogenous lysosomal WT GBA enzymatic activity was preserved. Note that this SH-SY5Y-overexpressing cell model system may be artificial, and the defects in autophagy induction may result from dramatic overexpression of misfolded protein. By comparing autophagy defects between MYC-tagged WT and L444P mutant GBA-overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells, we found that this inhibitory effect on autophagy induction may be specific to the L444P mutation, given that the expression levels of exogenous MYC-tagged GBA protein levels were similar between the WT and mutant GBA-overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells, and that the properties of MYC-tagged WT and mutant GBA were similar to those of endogenous WT and mutant GBA.</p>
<p>The mechanisms for the reduction in AMBRA1 and BECN1 by mutant GBA remain to be elucidated, but may involve the ER retention of mutant GBA, abnormal interactions between mutant GBA and ER proteins, decreased MTOR activity and altered TFEB (transcription factor EB) protein levels. Indeed, <italic>GBA</italic> mutations in GD iPSC-derived neuronal cells has been reported to downregulate the expression of TFEB and lysosomal genes [<xref rid="CIT0051">51</xref>]. Nevertheless, our data indicate that the mutant GBA protein may act at an early stage to block autophagy induction, whereas the loss of GBA enzyme activity suppresses lysosomal degradation at a later step of autophagosome clearance.</p>

<sec id="S0003-S2003">
<title>Impaired mitochondrial priming by the L444P GBA heterozygous mutation</title>
<p>The most thoroughly characterized pathway for mitochondrial priming is that of PINK1- PRKN/PARK2 signaling [<xref rid="CIT0040">40</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0052">52</xref>]. Upon mitochondrial depolarization, PINK1 accumulates on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) to recruit the cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase PRKN/PARK2. PRKN/PARK2-mediated ubiquitination of OMM proteins serves as a general signal recognized by autophagy adaptor proteins [<xref rid="CIT0053">53</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0054">54</xref>], such as SQSTM1, NBR1, CALCOCO2/NDP52 and OPTN/optineurin [<xref rid="CIT0055">55</xref>–<xref rid="CIT0060">60</xref>]. Through interacting with both LC3 and ubiquitin chains, these receptors target dysfunctional mitochondria to phagophores for degradation. Increasing evidence also supports PRKN/PARK2-independent priming, which involves mitochondria-anchored receptors including OMM proteins BNIP3L and FUNDC1 (FUN14 domain containing 1) [<xref rid="CIT0061">61</xref>–<xref rid="CIT0064">64</xref>]. AMBRA1 may also act as a mitophagy receptor by binding to LC3 in PRKN/PARK2-dependent and -independent manners [<xref rid="CIT0065">65</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0066">66</xref>].</p>
<p>We found that protein levels of PARK2, NBR1, and BNIP3L were reduced in mitochondria fractionated from <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mouse brain. These findings suggest that the <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mutation impedes both PRKN/PARK2-dependent and -independent mitochondrial priming under basal conditions. Our data corroborate the Osellame et al. study [<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>] where it was proposed that that MMP in <italic>gba</italic> knockout neurons was not low enough for PARK2 recruitment because mitophagy could be enhanced by fully dissipating MMP [<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. We thus concluded that mitochondria in <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> heterozygous mutant mice are compromised, and not flagged properly for turnover by the mitophagy pathway. The impaired mitochondrial priming in the <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mutants, however, appears to be associated with the mutant GBA protein per se but not the loss of GBA enzyme activity.</p>

<sec id="S0003-S2004">
<title>L444P GBA heterozygous mutation impairs mitophagy through a dual mechanism</title>
<p>Our findings support a dual mechanism by which the heterozygous L444P <italic>GBA</italic> mutation impairs mitophagy. The loss of lysosomal GBA enzyme activity blocks the degradation of autophagic cargos, whereas the mutant GBA protein per se impairs autophagy induction and the priming of damaged mitochondria. The defects in both autophagy-lysosomal degradation and mitochondrial priming may compromise the autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria, leading to an accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and thus mitochondrial oxidative stress. While our data support recent studies in which homozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutations alter lysosomal and mitochondrial function via a loss-of-function mechanisms [<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0038">38</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0039">39</xref>], the specific effects of mutant GBA on mitochondrial priming and autophagy induction indicate a gain-of-toxic-function of the mutant protein. This effect may be attributed to the ER retention of mutant GBA protein, resulting in an unfolded protein response [<xref rid="CIT0067">67</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0068">68</xref>]. For example, N370S and L444P GBA mutant proteins, but not WT GBA, interact with PRKN/PARK2 within the ER [<xref rid="CIT0069">69</xref>], preventing the binding of PRKN/PARK2 to other substrates [<xref rid="CIT0070">70</xref>].</p>
<p>The co-existence of gain-of-toxic-function and loss-of-function mechanisms of heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutations has also been implicated in SNCA pathology, a feature of the vast majority of PD cases. The loss of GBA activity promotes SNCA accumulation by inhibiting lysosomal function, whereas direct interactions between mutant GBA and SNCA promote SNCA aggregation [<xref rid="CIT0071">71</xref>]. Additionally, impaired mitochondrial homeostasis may interact with SNCA deposition to form a ‘vicious cycle’, in which SNCA accumulation increases mitochondrial permeability [<xref rid="CIT0072">72</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0073">73</xref>] and mitochondrial ROS generation, which further promotes SNCA misfolding, aggregation, and accumulation [<xref rid="CIT0073">73</xref>]. We propose that, as a predisposing factor, heterozygous <italic>GBA</italic> mutations may contribute to the risk of PD by conferring a distinct subclinical pathological state with mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy defects, which lowers the threshold and increases the risk for SNCA accumulation, ultimately culminating in the development of PD. Our studies strongly indicate that both the mutation and the enzyme activity should be considered when developing <italic>GBA</italic>-targeted PD therapy. One such promising strategy is the use of small-molecule chaperones that correct the folding of mutant GBA in the ER and facilitate its trafficking to lysosomes [<xref rid="CIT0074">74</xref>], where the residual activity of the mutant GBA allows for the degradation of its lipid substrate, glucocerebroside.</p>

At day 14–15, cells were rinsed with 2 ml HEPES (6.7 mM KCl, 142 mM NaCl, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5), and incubated with 0.5 ml of 0.2% trypan blue (Sigma, T8154) in HEPES for 2 min at room temperature. Trypan-blue positive and -negative cells were counted in 10 random fields per well using the grid-containing eyepiece. The percentage of trypan blue-negative cells, which are indicative of live cells, was calculated to estimate survival rates. All experiments were performed in triplicate.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Human anterior cingular cortex, mouse hippocampal brain tissue, SH-SY5Y cells or fractionated mitochondria were homogenized in 1 × RIPA buffer (Sigma, R0728) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma, 11836170001) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma, P5726). The suspensions were centrifuged at 13,000 g at 4°C for 30 min.The supernatants were collected and assayed for total protein concerntration using the Bradford method (BioRad, 5000006). Samples were aliquoted into labeled vials and stored at −80°C until use.</p>
<p>For western blot analysis, protein lysates were mixed with NuPAGE sample buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NP0007), separated in 4–12% NuPAGE Bis–Tris gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NP0329BOX) and transferred to Whatman PROTRAN Nitrocellulose Membranes (GE Healthcare, 10600001). The Membranes were washed with 1 × Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-362311), and blocked with 5% dry milk in 1 × TBS-T at room temperature (RT) for 1 h, and then incubated overnight with the primary antibodies. After 3 washes with 1 × TBS-T buffer at 10-min intervals, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at RT with appropriate secondary antibodies, followed by 3 additional washes at 10-min intervals. Protein bands were visualized using ECL (Millipore, WBKLS0500) or Supersignal Chemiluminescent reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34076).</p>
<p>Prior to western blot analysis of target proteins, the amount of sample needed to produce a linear response for housekeeping proteins was determined. The linear range of sample loading was estimated by serially diluting a representative sample preparation and blotting for ACTB and GAPDH (human brain, mouse brain tissue or cell lysates), or VDAC1 (fractionated mitochondria). The optimal protein load was 10–15 μg for the linear detection of GAPDH and ACTB in total brain or cell lysates, and 4–6 μg for VDAC1 in fractionated mitochondria.</p>
<p>Blots were imaged with the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc™ Touch Imaging System, and we used the Signal Accumulation Mode <italic>(SAM</italic>) to determine the optimal imaging time for chemiluminescent detection. After the optimal exposure time was determined using a CCD camera, a series of single images with different exposure settings were acquired to identify faint signals in the image. Images with saturated bands were discarded, and data analysis was performed on images in which target protein bands can be detected in all gel lanes.</p>
<p>The densities of immunoreactive bands were quantified using ImageJ and presented as mean ± SE. To further confirm the validity of GAPDH as a loading control, we normalized GAPDH protein levels to that of ACTB (actin beta), and found no differences when comparing disease states or the presence of <italic>GBA</italic> mutations (Figure S6). Triton X-100 (Sigma, T9204)-soluble and -insoluble SNCA protein in human brain tissue was assessed as described in Rockenstein et al., 2014 [<xref rid="CIT0078">78</xref>]. All data were generated from experiments with at least 3 replicates.</p>

<title>Lysosomal GBA enzyme activity assay</title>
<p>GBA enzyme activity was measured in lysosome-enriched fractions using 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-glucopyranoside (Sigma, M3633) as a substrate, as in Gegg et al., 2012 [<xref rid="CIT0079">79</xref>]. Brain tissue or cell pellets were homogenized in buffer containing 250 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, protease (Roche, 11836170001) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma, P5726). Diluted sample (50 µl) was added to 50 μL of 10 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside substrate in a 96-well plate with or without CBE (Sigma, C5424). After incubation with the substrate for 60 min at 37°C, the reaction was terminated using 50 μL of stop solution (1 M glycine-NaOH, pH 12.5, sigma G7126). The plate was read (excitation 365 nm-emission 450 nm) with a BioTek Synergy Mx Monochromator-based Microplate Reader with Gen5 Software (BioTek Instruments, Inc, Winoosk, VT, USA). Fluorescence intensity was converted to CBE-specific enzymatic activity using a standard curve from human GBA (R&amp;D Systems, 7410-GHB) and normalized to protein content per sample determined with a BCA kit (Thermo Scientific Pierce, 23227). All data were acquired from experiments with at least 3 replicates.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial complex I dipstick assay</title>
<p>Mitochondrial complex I activity was determined using the Mitochondrial Dipstick Assay kit (Abcam, ab109876), as described in Tang et al., 2014 [<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]. Fifteen micrograms of protein were allowed to wick up laterally through the dipstick membrane, the dipsticks were transferred into the complex I enzyme substrate buffer and enzyme activities were calculated by measuring the optical density of precipitating, colorimetric enzyme reaction using ImageJ. All measurements were made in triplicate.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Immunohistochemistry was performed in paraffin-embedded sections from age- and postmortem interval-matched control and GBA-PD brains, and in floating sections from perfusion-fixed mouse brains, according to general protocols. Immunohistochemistry was performed in fixed brain sections from GBA-PD (n = 3) and age-matched controls (n = 3), according to general protocols. One cubic centimeter brain sections were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and were embedded in paraffin blocks. Seven-micron-thick consecutive sections were prepared, deparaffinized and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed in a steamer for 40 min with Trilogy buffer (Cell Marque, 920P-10). Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies against mitochondrial membrane proteins VDAC1/porin, SQSTM1 and LC3B at 4°C overnight, followed by an appropriate species of secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 594 (Thermofisher Scientific, A21202, A21203, A21206, A21207, A21209) for 1 h at room temperature. Negative control sections were held in phosphate-buffered saline (<italic>Sigma, D1408)</italic> without primary antibody during the primary incubation. Background immunoreactivity with anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies alone was negligible.</p>
<p>For 8-OHdG immunostaining, antigen-retrieved paraffin sections were treated with proteinase K (20 μg/ml; Sigma 21627) at 37°C for 45 min. The slides were blocked for endogenous peroxidase activity with peroxidase block (DAKO, S2001), washed 5 min in buffer, and incubated with serum-free protein block (DAKO, X0909) for 1 h. The sections were incubated with anti-8-OHdG antibody at 37°C for 1 h, followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody at RT for 1 h.</p>
<p>Images were acquired using a Leica Multiphoton imaging system with a 63x objective and a zoom factor 4. ImageJ software was used to quantify the fluorescence intensity from 30 randomly selected pyramidal neurons per case. The fluorescence intensity was obtained for the soma of each neuron, averaged and corrected for background by subtracting the fluorescence intensity of the negative control sections. All images were acquired under identical conditions.</p>

<sec id="S0004-S2015">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data were presented as mean ± standard error (SE) or mean (percentage of controls) ± SE from 3–4 independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software. Normal distribution of the data was determined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Differences among multiple groups were compared using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc comparisons tests. Differences in the normalized intensity value between controls and GBA-PD groups (or between control and <italic>Gba<sup>L444P/WT</sup></italic> mice) were performed with the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test or Student t test, depending on whether datasets are normally distributed. p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
