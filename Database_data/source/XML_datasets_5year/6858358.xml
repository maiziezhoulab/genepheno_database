Astrocytes responded to interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) treatment with a typical transition to polygonal morphology and a shift to an inflammatory phenotype characterized by altered gene and protein expression profiles. Astrocyte-secreted factors did not exert neurotoxic effects, whereas they transiently promoted the functional activity of neurons. Importantly, we engineered a novel microfluidic platform designed for investigating interactions between neuronal axons and reactive astrocytes that also enables the implementation of a controlled inflammatory environment. In this platform, selective stimulation of astrocytes resulted in an inflammatory niche that sustained axonal growth, further suggesting that treatment induces a reactive astrocyte phenotype with neurosupportive characteristics.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the central nervous system (CNS) and play important roles in supporting neuronal cell functions by releasing energy substrates and trophic factors, maintaining homeostatic functions and regulating neuronal synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. During CNS injury and disease, astrocytes transform into a reactive phenotype with changed morphology and altered gene expression and secretion profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. These astrocytes are regarded as immunocompetent cells that can respond to complex inflammatory events by secreting cytokines and chemokines, thereby controlling immune cell activation and migration to sites of damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Astrocytes are considered to play a dual role in CNS pathophysiology, as they can both support regeneration and exert detrimental effects on surrounding cells and brain parenchyma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Interestingly, two distinct astrocyte phenotypes were recently described in rodent studies: a detrimental A1 type and a beneficial A2 type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Of these, A2 astrocytes were associated with ischemia-induced CNS lesions, while A1 astrocytes dominated in inflammation-induced lesions reflecting those in diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). However, reactivation of astrocytes is a complex phenomenon that possibly results in a mixture of the two phenotypes or even several distinct yet unidentified activation states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">The majority of the knowledge on reactive astrocytes has been gathered from rodent studies, whereas the inflammatory nature of human astrocytes has received less attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, growing evidence shows significant structural and functional differences between human and rodent astrocytes, underlining the relevance of further studies focusing on human astrocytes and their behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies with human cells have typically utilized astrocytes from primary fetal or adult tissues or immortalized astrocytoma cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>; however, the availability of human primary astrocytes is limited, and immortalized cells are often criticized as model systems. Advancements in the field of stem cell biology have enabled the differentiation of astrocytes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, providing an unlimited cell source and an option to create disease-specific cell lines. Despite these advancements, only a few studies have described the reactivation of hPSC-derived astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and even fewer studies have reported the interplay of inflammation or reactive astrocytes with human neuronal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">The development of newly engineered <italic>in vitro</italic> platforms based on hPSC-derived cells is a promising approach for studying the mechanisms of CNS functions and disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Microfluidic devices are potent research tools for studying the interactions of several cell types in controlled, compartmentalized culture environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. For example, multiple cell compartments can be connected via microtunnels, allowing the growth of axons while restricting neuronal somas thus facilitating experimentation on cellular processes and cell-to-cell interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Advantages in microfluidic technology have already been validated, for instance, in axonal transport and myelination studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. However, less data are available on neuron-astrocyte interactions and neuroinflammatory activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Understanding the complex cellular interplay among several neural cell types can help to reveal underlying mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases and create opportunities for drug discovery.</p>
<p id="Par5">Here, we studied reactivation using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) -derived astrocytes and observed their transformation into cells with reactive proinflammatory phenotypes with neurosupportive characteristics. Furthermore, we designed a novel microfluidic co-culture platform including neurons, astrocytes and an inflammatory environment that was validated for studying reactive astrocyte-neuron interactions. We are convinced that hiPSC-astrocyte model systems can facilitate investigation of specific human cell properties and ultimately model human CNS diseases in a dish.</p>

<title>Characterization of hiPSC-derived astrocytes</title>
<p id="Par6">HiPSC-derived astrocytes were first characterized in their quiescent resting state for the expression of astrocyte-specific markers at the gene and protein levels. Gene expression analysis revealed expression of transcripts typical for developing astrocytes, including S100 calcium-binding protein beta (<italic>S100β</italic>) and vimentin (<italic>VIM</italic>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Additionally, mature astrocyte genes, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (<italic>GFAP</italic>) and excitatory amino acid transporters 1 and 2 (<italic>EAAT1</italic> and <italic>EAAT2</italic>, respectively), were expressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Major astrocyte-specific markers were also confirmed by immunocytochemical staining of GFAP, S100β, glutamine synthetase (GS), aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member (Aldh1L1), EAAT1 and EAAT2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). To confirm that the astrocytes were mostly negative for neuronal markers, the cells were stained for microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Thus, the culture consisted of a heterogeneous astrocyte population with a cell type-specific expression signature.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Characterization of hiPSC-derived astrocytes.

<title>Treatment of hiPSC-derived astrocytes with IL-1β and TNF-α induces a reactive phenotype</title>
<p id="Par7">To induce a reactive astrocyte phenotype with inflammatory cytokines and to characterize astrocyte properties, an extended seven-day co-stimulation with IL-1β and TNF-α was performed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). First, the presence of cytokine receptors for IL-1β and TNF-α in hiPSC-derived astrocytes was analyzed in the quiescent resting state. The expression of IL-1 receptor 1 (<italic>IL1R</italic>) and IL-1 receptor accessory protein (<italic>IL1RAP</italic>), as well as that of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 1 A (<italic>TNFRSF1A</italic>), which is important for mediating the signals of these cytokines, was confirmed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). However, <italic>TNFRSF1B</italic> was not detectable in the hiPSC-derived astrocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>IL-1β and TNF-α treatment induces a reactive astrocyte phenotype. (<bold>a</bold>) Experimental setup for astrocyte stimulation with IL-1β and TNF-α and astrocyte characterization. (<bold>b</bold>) Gene expression analysis revealed the presence of TNFRSF1A, IL1R, and IL1RAP transcripts in the astrocytes (n = 2 with three technical replicates; the data are representative of two experiments). (<bold>c</bold>) In control astrocytes, NF-κB was ubiquitously expressed in the cytoplasm, whereas after 60 minutes cytokine stimulation, it was activated and translocated to the nucleus (white arrows). (<bold>d</bold>) NF-κB activation was quantified as the percentage of nuclei with translocation among the total nuclei (n = 6 cultures; the data were analyzed from two experiments). (<bold>e</bold>) Immunocytochemical staining of the intermediate filament proteins vimentin and GFAP showed morphological changes from filamentous to flattened shapes (white arrows) in response to cytokine stimulation. (<bold>f</bold>) Morphological change was quantified based on the vimentin staining of samples on day 7. The circularity of the cells in each group is presented as the median and interquartile range, with the whiskers showing the minimum and maximum values. Images were analyzed from six cultures derived from three experiments. (<bold>g</bold>) <italic>GFAP</italic> expression levels decreased following cytokine stimulation (n = 2 with three technical replicates; the data are representative of two experiments). (<bold>h</bold>) GFAP was analyzed at the protein level by western blot analysis, representative cropped images of the membranes for the GFAP and β-Actin are shown here and full length of membranes are presented in the Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>. (<bold>i</bold>) Quantification of GFAP and β-Actin showed a reduction after cytokine treatment. β-Actin was used as a loading control (n = 2; the data are representative of three experiments). (<bold>j</bold>) Cytokine treatment impaired the glutamate uptake capacity of astrocytes (n = 3; the data are representative of two experiments). The data are presented as the mean ± s.e.m. Statistical analysis was performed with independent-sample t-tests except in (<bold>f</bold>), in which statistical analysis was performed with the Mann-Whitney U test.

<p id="Par8">Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is a key transcription factor that has been shown to be activated in reactive astrocytes during neuroinflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Here, NF-κB was ubiquitously present in the cytoplasm of quiescent astrocytes but was only present in low amounts in the nuclei (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>). However, soon after the initiation of cytokine treatment, NF-κB was activated and translocated to the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). After 60 min of cytokine stimulation, a significant portion (over 50%) of the astrocytes showed activation of the NF-κB pathway (control [Ctrl] 9.7 ± 0.6 vs. IL-1β/TNF-α treated [Trt] 55.3 ± 1.9, p &lt; 0.001, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par9">Reactive astrocytes undergo changes in morphology typically characterized by hypertrophy of main cellular processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Over the 7-day cytokine treatment period, the astrocytes gradually exhibited a morphological change from a highly filamentous shape to a flattened polygonal appearance (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). This typical response was most notable upon the staining of the intermediate filament proteins vimentin and GFAP, both of which contribute to astrocyte morphology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). The morphology of the control and treated astrocytes was quantified based on vimentin staining at the 7-day time point (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>). The circularity index was calculated according to the area and perimeter metrics of each cell, with a value of 1 describing a perfectly circular object. Quantification confirmed that the astrocytes lost their filamentous shape and adopted a more circular morphology in response to cytokine activation (medians Ctrl 0.16 vs. Trt 0.27, p &lt; 0.001, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par10">Changes in intermediate filament protein expression have often been considered to be hallmarks of reactive astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Although the cytokine-stimulated reactive astrocytes showed positive staining for GFAP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>), we observed an 8-fold decrease in mRNA levels after the 7-day treatment in the treated cells compared to the controls (Ctrl 8.81 ± 0.54 vs. Trt 1.05 ± 0.15, p &lt; 0.001, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g</xref>). The GFAP protein levels were also confirmed by western blot analysis, showing similar decreases as a result of IL-1β and TNF-α treatment (Ctrl 0.73 ± 0.04 vs. Trt 0.16 ± 0.06, p = 0.010, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2h–i</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>). Additionally, the vimentin protein levels were studied and were found to remain more stable than GFAP protein levels after cytokine treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par11">Uptake of glutamate from the extracellular space is an important function of astrocytes that sustains healthy synaptic transmission of neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Impairment in the uptake of glutamate from the culture medium was revealed in cytokine-stimulated astrocytes compared to control astrocytes (Ctrl 42.4 ± 1.4 vs. Trt 9.0 ± 0.66, p &lt; 0.001, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2j</xref>). In summary, treatment with the cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α activated astrocytes, modified their intermediate filament cytoskeleton and transformed them morphologically and functionally into cells with a reactive phenotype.</p>

<sec id="Sec5">
<title>Cytokine treatment induces astrocyte proliferation and reduces viability</title>
<p id="Par12">Next, we studied the effects of cytokines on the viability and proliferation of astrocytes after a 7-day treatment regimen. Immunocytochemical staining with the proliferation marker Ki67 showed a slight (5%) but significant increase in proliferation in cytokine-treated cells compared to control cells (Ctrl 6.8 ± 0.9 vs. Trt 11.8 ± 0.7, p &lt; 0.001, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a–b</xref>). However, this increase did not significantly affect the total nuclei count (Ctrl 1094 ± 28 vs. Trt 1040 ± 55, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>) or the total DNA amount (Ctrl 95476.7 ± 8299.5 vs. Trt 89263.8 ± 8779.2, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). Upon assessing the viability of astrocytes after cytokine treatment, a significant increase in cytotoxicity (Ctrl 1053.0 ± 55.8 vs. Trt 2677.3 ± 461.2, p = 0.017) and a decrease in viability (Ctrl 38938.2 ± 2347.3 vs. Trt 17999.2 ± 3352.4, p &lt; 0.001) in the treated cells compared to the control cells were found (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>). In the apoptosis metrics, no statistically significant differences were detected between the groups (Ctrl 26026.8 ± 4362.3 vs. Trt 20265.8 ± 3629.6, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>). In conclusion, cytokine treatment of hiPSC-derived astrocytes caused minor proliferation, but the total cell number remained stable due to cytotoxicity.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Viability and proliferation of cytokine-treated astrocytes.

<title>Reactivation induces a proinflammatory response in astrocytes</title>
<p id="Par13">To reveal whether the astrocytes were able to produce an immune response, the gene expression and secretion profiles of inflammatory markers were characterized. First, the effects of IL-1β and TNF-α treatment on the expression of the inflammation-related genes <italic>CCL5</italic>, <italic>CXCL8</italic>, complement component 3 (<italic>C3</italic>) and lipocalin-2 (<italic>LCN2</italic>) were studied (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a–d</xref>). At the basal level, none of the transcripts were expressed, whereas treatment for 24 h led to over 300-fold increases in the expression of the chemokines <italic>CCL5</italic> and <italic>CXCL8</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a–b</xref>). Recently, C3 has been linked to astrocyte reactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Here, <italic>C3</italic> expression increased in a time-dependent manner after cytokine treatment, reaching over a 200-fold change compared to the control level at the 7-day time point (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>).

<p id="Par14">Next, the secretion of 105 inflammatory proteins (see full list in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) from cytokine-stimulated astrocytes was studied (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S5a</xref>). Treatment induced widespread protein secretion at the 24 h and 7-day time points (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S4a</xref>). The most highly secreted proteins were chemokines (CXCL10, CXCL5, CXCL8, CCL2, CXCL1, and CCL5), but other inflammatory factors, such as pentraxin 3 (PTX3), osteopontin (OPN), chitinase-3 like 1 (CHI3L1), Serpin E1 and adhesion molecule vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (VCAM1), were also secreted. Among the cytokines, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) were detected on medium obtained from the cytokine-treated astrocytes.</p>
<p id="Par15">IL-6 is a classic inflammatory mediator known to be secreted from astrocytes after reactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>; therefore, the secretion of IL-6 was further investigated.

In summary, astrocytes responded to cytokine treatment with changes in gene expression and broad secretion of proinflammatory factors.</p>

<title>Astrocyte conditioned medium sustains neuronal viability and supports functional activity</title>
<p id="Par16">Astrocyte activation resulted in widespread secretion of inflammatory molecules; therefore, we next studied whether astrocyte conditioned medium (ACM) has an effect on neurons. Astrocytes were treated with IL-1β and TNF-α for seven days; the treatment was then washed out, and the ACM was collected 48 h later. At this stage, the astrocytes still secreted a broad profile of inflammatory factors (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S5b</xref>). In-house-differentiated hPSC-derived neurons were exposed to ACM for 48 h, after which they still retained a normal branched neuronal morphology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). Additionally, ACM treatment did not cause any changes in viability or apoptosis or cause cytotoxicity, confirming that the produced reactive astrocytes did not secrete neurotoxic factors at detrimental levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). Similar results were obtained with commercial hiPSC-derived neurons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S6a–b</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Viability and functionality of neuronal cells after exposure to reactive astrocyte conditioned medium.

<p id="Par17">The effect of ACM on neuronal functionality was studied with a microelectrode array (MEA) setup, which allowed repeated measurements from the same network. In-house-differentiated hPSC-derived neuronal cells were first cultured on MEAs for five weeks until mature bursting and synchronic activity was achieved throughout the network (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c–d</xref>). Once array-wide activity had developed, the cultures were treated with control ACM or reactive ACM, and measurements were performed immediately (acute) and at 1 h, 4 h and 24 h after ACM application (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>). A naïve control group received the same volume of intact medium (held for 48 h in an incubator similar to that in which the collected ACM was held). Overall, addition of the media induced increases in spike rates in all studied groups and, to a lesser extent, increases in burst counts during the 24 h follow-up period (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e–f</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). The magnitudes of these changes were not as great in the commercial neurons as in the in-house-differentiated neurons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S6d–e</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par18">Next, activity changes in relation to baseline measurements were studied between the different treatment groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5g–h</xref>). The control ACM- and reactive ACM-treated networks responded similarly, as no significant differences between them were detected in spike or burst rates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5g–h</xref>). This result was confirmed with both in-house-produced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5g–h</xref>) and commercial neurons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S6f–g</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par19">In comparison to the control group, the reactive ACM group demonstrated an immediate increase in spike activity (Ctrl -0.168 ± 0.039 vs. reactive ACM 0.025 ± 0.036, p = 0.033) and a decrease in activity at the 24 h time point (Ctrl 0.470 ± 0.066 vs. reactive ACM 0.250 ± 0.087, p = 0.045, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5g–h</xref>). However, the control ACM group exhibited both increased spike activity (Ctrl 0.349 ± 0.067 vs. Ctrl ACM 0.576 ± 0.095, p = 0.039) and increased burst rate (Ctrl 0.579 ± 0.377 vs. Ctrl ACM 2.048 ± 0.535, p = 0.02) at the 1 h time point compared to the control group. Similar changes in spike and burst rates were also confirmed with commercial neurons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S6f–g</xref>). Thus, conditioned medium from reactive astrocytes did not cause any detectable cytotoxicity or functional silencing of neuronal networks. In fact, both control and reactive ACM supported functional activity, suggesting that astrocytes were neurosupportive rather than neurotoxic under these conditions.</p>

<title>Generation of a controlled astrocyte-neuron co-culture system utilizing a microfluidic device</title>
<p id="Par20">Next, we established a novel platform enabling controlled co-culture of neurons and astrocytes, targeted stimulation of astrocytes, and study of neuron-astrocyte interactions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). The microfluidic device is composed of separate compartments for neurons and astrocytes, which are connected via microtunnels and axonal compartment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a,b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that β-tubulin-positive neuronal somas were restricted to their designated compartments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c–e</xref>), while NF-H-positive axons grew readily through the microtunnels into the axonal compartment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d</xref>). GFAP-positive astrocytes were restricted to the astrocyte compartment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>), and direct cell-to-cell interactions could be verified, as astrocyte processes extended through the microtunnels and connected to neuronal axons in the neighboring compartment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6e,f</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Description of the microfluidic device for co-culture of neurons and astrocytes and the fluidic isolation of the cell compartments.

<p id="Par21">Fluidic isolation of the astrocyte compartment from the neuron compartment was demonstrated with FITC-conjugated dextran particles, which did not diffuse to the neuron compartment, as detected by fluorescence imaging (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6g</xref>) and measurements of particle concentrations after 24 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6h</xref>). However, over 24 h, particles did diffuse from the astrocyte compartment into the axonal compartment, verifying the possibility of studying humoral effects on axons with this system (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6g</xref>). In summary, the generated platform enabled the isolation of different cell types and cell parts, and the control of cell-to-cell interactions and fluid flow.</p>

<title>Reactive astrocytes and an inflammatory environment affect axonal growth in the microfluidic platform</title>
<p id="Par22">The last aim was to induce the reactive astrocyte phenotype in the microfluidic platform and study the effect of reactive astrocytes on axon growth in the axonal compartment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>). To treat astrocytes, IL-1β and TNF-α were applied to the astrocyte compartment after the neurons and astrocytes were both plated into the microfluidic platform (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>). The 72 h cytokine treatment did not cause any major cytotoxic effects on either cell type, as only a few dead cells were detected among viable cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b</xref>). Similar to the findings under open-well conditions described above, the reactive astrocytes secreted a wide range of inflammatory factors (e.g., VCAM1, CCL2, CXCL8, CXCL5, and CHI3L1) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S8</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><italic>In vitro</italic> model for astrogliosis and axonal growth.

<p id="Par23">After confirming the proinflammatory phenotype of the astrocytes, the effect of these astrocytes on axonal growth was studied by quantifying the number and density of axons extending to the axonal compartment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7d–g</xref>). In addition to devices with co-cultures of control or reactive astrocytes with neurons (treatment groups: Neu + Ctrl astro and Neu + Reactive astro), devices with only neurons were included in the study to elucidate whether treatment with IL-1β and TNF-α alone had an effect on axons (treatment groups: Neu and Neu + IL-1β/TNF-α). Over the 72 h follow-up period, no statistically significant differences were detected in axon counts between the groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7e</xref>). Furthermore, axonal density was assessed with live-cell calcein-AM color staining by quantifying the area coverage in the axonal compartment 72 h after cytokine treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7f,g</xref>). The results showed that reactive astrocytes increased axonal density compared to control astrocytes (Neu + Ctrl astro 4.7 ± 0.6 vs. Neu + Reactive astro 8.2 ± 1.3, p = 0.028, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7g</xref>). Taken together, the results indicate that selective cytokine stimulation of astrocytes resulted in an inflammatory environment that had a positive effect on axonal growth, demonstrating the suitability of the developed cell model for studying axonal biology.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par24">Astrocytes are an acknowledged partner in the inflammatory processes in many neurodegenerative diseases and injuries of the CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Astrocytes regulate the homeostasis of their surroundings and can have direct effects on neurons, both beneficial and detrimental. Human astrocytes are known for their complexity and heterogeneity, and some of their structural and functional traits differ from those of rodent astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, in this study, we used hiPSC-derived astrocytes to create a human cell model system to study the inflammatory activation of astrocytes and the effects of activated astrocytes on neuronal functionality and axonal growth.</p>
<p id="Par25">A variety of inflammatory molecules have been studied for their ability to induce a reactive astrocyte phenotype <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Here, astrocytes were treated with a combination of the cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α, which are typically released by activated microglia during neuroinflammation and are capable of stimulating astrogliosis <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> and <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Furthermore, co-stimulation with IL-1β and TNF-α has been demonstrated to be a more potent trigger of reactivity that stimulation with either of the cytokines independently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. To date, few reports have described the responses of hiPSC-derived astrocytes to cytokine treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. However, many astrocyte differentiation protocols use serum to enhance astrocytes production that can promote astrocyte reactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Here, astrocytes were cultured in serum-free medium, and under control conditions, the astrocytes remained in a quiescent state according to the results of gene expression and secretion profile analysis. We also treated astrocytes with the inflammatory cytokines for 7 days as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> to mimic chronic effects. During the 7-day activation, we observed a gradual change in the morphology of the astrocytes from fibrous to polygonal and a reorganization of intermediate filament proteins, which are typical hallmarks of astrogliosis <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This clear morphological change has previously been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> with human fetal astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> but not reported with hiPSC-derived astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Additionally, upregulation of GFAP has been commonly described in relation to astrogliosis <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Interestingly, even though both control and reactive astrocytes stained positive for GFAP, more detailed analysis revealed downregulation of GFAP at both the gene and total protein levels upon cytokine treatment. Consistent with our data, reductions in GFAP have been reported in IL-1-treated human fetal astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> and in IL-1β- and TNF-α-treated rodent astrocytes at both the gene and protein levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Overall, we showed morphological transformation and alterations in the structural proteins of reactive astrocytes following 7-day IL-1β and TNF-α treatment.</p>
<p id="Par26">Astrocytes are immunocompetent cells, and inflammatory activity upon stimulation is therefore their important feature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The key signaling pathways involved in astrocyte reactivation include NF-κB pathway, which was acutely activated after cytokine treatment in the present study. NF-κB activation is known to induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules, which mediate leukocyte recruitment to the CNS, leading to neuroinflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrated the secretion of a wide variety of chemokines, cytokines and other inflammatory factors by reactive astrocytes. For example, secretion of the typical inflammatory markers CCL5, CXCL8 and IL-6 was temporally induced after cytokine treatment, which has also been previously reported in studies on IL-1β- and TNF-α-treated hiPSC-derived astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we observed upregulation of complement component 3 (C3), which has been linked to the neuroinflammatory phenotype of reactive astrocytes and has also been detected in demyelinating lesions of MS patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. For the first time, we detected CHI3L1, OPN, and PTX3, known astrogliosis-associated markers <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, in hiPSC-derived reactive astrocytes; these proteins are also considered candidate diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for CNS diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Thus, a broad range of inflammatory factors were discovered in a human model system of astrogliosis; however, the specific roles of these factors in neuroinflammatory processes remain to be explained.</p>
<p id="Par27">Only a handful of studies have addressed interactions between reactive astrocytes and neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> using human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Here, humoral signaling by reactive astrocytes sustained neuronal viability, suggesting that the astrocyte secretion profile was not primarily neurotoxic. In contrast, previous studies have described decreased numbers of neurons in direct co-cultures of human neurons and IL-1β-stimulated astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, and the humoral effects of TNF-α, IL-1α and complement component 1q (C1q) -stimulated rodent astrocytes have been reported to be toxic to human neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Here, responses were also studied on a more sensitive neuronal network functionality level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. ACM exposure did not silence neuronal network activity but rather supported functionality, suggesting the polarization of astrocytes into a neurosupportive state. Previous studies have shown that secreted factors as well as direct cell-to-cell contact with rodent astrocytes can increase the activity of networks on MEAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. On the other hand, neurotoxic astrocytes have failed to promote synapse function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Altogether, our results suggest that 7-day stimulation of hiPSC-derived astrocytes with cytokines results in an inflammatory phenotype that has a supportive rather than a harmful effect on neuronal cells.</p>
<p id="Par28">To reveal the underlying mechanisms of CNS disorders, the complex cellular interactions between glial and neuronal cells should be investigated in more detail. Microfluidic technology can provide <italic>in vitro</italic> research tools that go beyond conventional cell culture methods with the aim of better modeling <italic>in vivo</italic> environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Here, our microfluidic platform was developed to co-culture the two cell types in a compartmentalized, controlled manner to specifically study axonal interactions with glial cells. Co-culture of human neurons and astrocytes was successful in the platform, which allowed direct contact between astrocyte processes and axons. Moreover, fluidic isolation enabled targeted stimulation of astrocytes in their compartment while also permitting humoral effects on neuronal axons extending into the axonal compartment. Activation of astrocytes with IL-1β and TNF-α was reproduced selectively in the microfluidic platform, and the inflammatory niche promoted axonal growth, further suggesting neurosupportive characteristics. This interpretation is supported by a recent report in which IL-1β mediated a potentially neuroprotective astrocyte phenotype expressing axonal permissive transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. A microfluidic platform has been previously used for analysis of the neuroinflammatory mechanisms of astrocytes and microglia in the neurotoxic environment of Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Our results present a unique microfluidic device designed for studying the interactions of axons and glial cells and further validate the suitability of microfluidic platforms as tools for studying the complex interplay among multiple cell types in the contexts of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.</p>
<p id="Par29">In conclusion, our results suggest that extended co-stimulation with IL-1β and TNF-α produces a reactive astrocyte phenotype with a broad inflammatory secretion profile that displays neurosupportive characteristics with regard to neuronal viability, functionality and axonal growth. The mechanism behind the neurosupportive effects need to be clarified in the future studies. Furthermore, an <italic>in vitro</italic> model combining human cells and microfluidic technology was developed, and the usefulness of the proposed novel microfluidic platform for investigation of neuron-astrocyte interactions in an inflammatory environment was demonstrated.

The hiPSC line 10212.EURCCs was derived from human skin fibroblasts using Sendai virus technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. The hPSC lines were expanded in feeder-free culture as described earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. The in-house-produced neurons were differentiated according to the methods in a previous publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>, with some modifications (details in the Supplementary methods).</p>
<p id="Par31">Commercial hiPSC-derived neurons (ax0018) and astrocyte progenitors (ax0083) from healthy donors were cultured according to the manufacturer’s protocol (both from Axol Bioscience Inc., UK). The astrocyte progenitors were differentiated for 24 days in culture and then treated for 7 days with 10 ng/ml human recombinant TNF-α and 10 ng/ml human recombinant IL-1β (PeproTech Inc.). Samples for astrocyte characterization were collected during the treatment at the 0 h, 24 h, 72 h and 7 day time points (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec13">
<title>RNA isolation and quantitative PCR</title>
<p id="Par32">RNA was isolated from astrocytes with a NucleoSpin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel). The concentration and purity of RNA were quantified with a NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA was converted to cDNA using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The expression levels of <italic>CCL5, CXCL8, GFAP, LCN2, C3, GFAP, VIM, S100B, IL1R, IL1RAP, TNFRSF1A</italic> and <italic>TNFRSF1B</italic> (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) were analyzed with TaqMan assays using an ABI Prism 7300 real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The data were analyzed using the delta Ct method using GUSB and GAPDH as endogenous controls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec14">
<title>Immunocytochemical staining</title>
<p id="Par33">Immunocytochemical staining was performed according to the methods in a previous publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. The used primary and secondary antibodies are listed in the Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>. Images were acquired with an Olympus IX51 microscope equipped with an Olympus DP30BW camera (Olympus Corporation, Germany) or an LSM780 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with a Quasar spectral GaAsP detector (all from Carl Zeiss, Germany). CellProfiler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> and CellProfiler Analyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup> software was used to perform image analysis. For evaluation of astrocyte morphology, the FormFactor module of CellProfiler software was used to calculate circularity index according to the area and perimeter metrics of each cell. Circularity index was calculated as 4*π*Area/Perimeter<sup>2</sup>, with a value of 1 describing a perfectly circular object.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec15">
<title>Glutamate uptake</title>
<p id="Par34">Glutamate uptake by cultured cells was analyzed with a glutamate assay kit (Abcam). The cells were washed with PBS and with 0.1% BSA in PBS for 30 min + 37 °C. The cells were then incubated with 100 μM glutamate in PBS for 1 h + 37 °C. Finally, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed with assay buffer. The concentration of glutamate in the cell lysate was analyzed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec16">
<title>Cell proliferation assay</title>
<p id="Par35">A CyQUANT Cell Proliferation Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to analyze the DNA amounts in cultured cells according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Fluorescence was measured at 520 nm (Wallac Victor 1420, PerkinElmer).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec17">
<title>Cell viability and apoptosis assay</title>
<p id="Par36">Cell viability and caspase-3/7 activation were detected in cultured cells with an ApoTox-Glo Triplex Assay (Promega). For positive controls, cells were treated with 1.25 µM staurosporine and 25 µM ionomycin (both from Sigma) for 6 h. Fluorescence was measured at 505 nm and 520 nm for viability and cytotoxicity, respectively. Luminescence was measured to detect apoptosis (Wallac Victor 1420).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec18">
<title>Collection of astrocyte conditioned medium</title>
<p id="Par37">Astrocyte conditioned medium (ACM) from cytokine-treated and control astrocytes was collected at the 9-day time point. First, astrocytes were treated for 7 days with the cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α; thereafter, the cells were washed with PBS, and fresh medium was added to the cells. At day 9, the medium was harvested and centrifuged at 400 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at RT, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -80 °C until use. Neuronal cells (in-house-derived hESC line Regea 08/023) were exposed to ACM or control medium for 24 h (MEA analysis) or 48 h (viability assay) before analysis. The experiments with ACM also included a control group; the control medium was prepared similarly to the ACM but without astrocytes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec19">
<title>Cytokine array and ELISA</title>
<p id="Par38">Protein secretion (see the list of analytes in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) into the astrocyte culture medium was measured using a Proteome Profiler Antibody Array (Human XL Cytokine Array Kit, ARY022B, R&amp;D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The membranes were imaged with a ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad), and the intensity of the spots was quantified with Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).</p>
<p id="Par39">The levels of IL-6 in the medium were measured with a human IL-6 uncoated ELISA kit (#88-7066-22, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm (Wallac Victor 1420).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec20">
<title>Viability staining</title>
<p id="Par40">A viability/cytotoxicity kit for mammalian cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to evaluate the viability of cells after ACM treatment and culture in the microfluidic platform. The cultures were incubated for 30 min to 1 h at 37 °C with green-fluorescent calcein-AM (0.5 µM) for detection of live cells and with red-fluorescent ethidium homodimer-1 (0.5 µM) for detection of dead cells. The samples were imaged immediately with an Olympus IX51 microscope equipped with an Olympus DP30BW camera (Olympus Corporation) and an LSM780 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with a Quasar spectral GaAsP detector (Carl Zeiss).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec21">
<title>Microelectrode array measurements</title>
<p id="Par41">Neuronal network activity was recorded with an Axion Maestro system controlled by AxIS Software (Axion Biosystems, Atlanta, GA, USA) with 12.5 kHz sampling rate as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. The hPSC-derived cortical neurons (in-house-derived hESC line Regea 08/023 or commercial hiPSC-derived neurons, ax0018) were plated on CytoView MEA 48 plates with 16 electrodes per array. Recordings were obtained under a controlled temperature of 37 °C. Spontaneous activity development was examined once a week with 10-minute recordings. After five weeks, when synchronous network activity had developed, the experiments with astrocyte conditioned medium (ACM) were initiated. The responses to control medium, control ACM or reactive ACM were measured for 10 min immediately and at 1 h, 4 h and 24 h after application. Analysis methods for spike and burst detection are described in the Supplementary methods section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec22">
<title>Design of the microfluidics device</title>
<p id="Par42">An in-house-developed microfluidics polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) device (Patent: WO2015092141A1) was used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>). The device contains three separate cell compartments and an axonal compartment that are interconnected by microtunnels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>). There are two neuronal compartments (length = 4250 µm, width = 3000 µm) that are connected to the axonal compartment (length = 1000 µm, height = 100 µm, width = 100 µm) with three microtunnels (length = 250 µm, height = 3 µm, width = 10 µm). The microtunnels allow the extension of axons but prevent the migration of neuronal somas from the neuronal compartment into the axonal compartment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b,c</xref>). The flow-based astrocyte compartment is connected to the axonal compartment with seven microtunnels (length = 50 µm, height = 3.5 µm, width = 10 µm) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>). The fabrication of PDMS devices are described in the Supplementary methods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec23">
<title>Co-culture of neurons and astrocytes in the microfluidic platform</title>
<p id="Par43">HiPSC-derived cortical neurons (10212.EURCCs) and commercial hiPSC-derived astrocytes (ax0083) were seeded into the neuronal compartments and astrocyte compartment, respectively (see details on Supplementary methods). Three days after cell plating, 10 ng/ml IL-1β- and TNF-α-containing medium was added into the astrocyte compartment, and treatment continued for 3 days. After cytokine treatment, the viability of cells was assessed with viability staining, and astrocyte-secreted inflammatory factors were analyzed in medium collected from the astrocyte compartment. To characterize the astrocytes and neurons in the co-cultures, immunofluorescence staining was performed. First, the microfluidics devices were separated manually from the coverslips, and then the cells were fixed with 4% PFA and stained according to an immunocytochemical protocol. To evaluate the influences of the astrocytes and cytokines on axonal growth, the following experimental groups were established: 1) a group in which neurons were seeded in the neuronal compartments (the Neu group), 2) a group in which neurons were seeded in the neuronal compartments and cytokine treatment was conducted via the astrocyte compartment (the Neu + IL-1β/TNF-α group), 3) a group in which neurons and astrocytes were seeded in their compartments (the Neu + Ctrl astro group), and 4) a group in which neurons and astrocytes were seeded in their compartments and cytokine treatment was conducted via the astrocyte compartment (the Neu + Reactive astro group). The cells in the devices were imaged with phase-contrast microscopy at baseline and at 24 h and 72 h after cytokine treatment. The individual axons entering the axonal compartment were counted manually from the images at a distance of 80 µm from the axonal microtunnels (the white dotted line in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7d</xref>). The density of the axons in the axonal compartment was evaluated by analyzing the area covered with calcein-AM-stained axons at 72 h after cytokine treatment. The analyzed area was a 0.033 mm<sup>2</sup> (325 µm × 100 µm) region next to the axonal microtunnels (the white dotted line in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7f</xref>), and analysis was performed using CellProfiler software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec24">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p id="Par44">Statistical analysis of Gaussian-distributed data was performed with independent-sample T-tests. If the data followed a non-Gaussian distribution, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test was used. Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons.</p>
<p id="Par45">The MEA data followed a non-Gaussian distribution; therefore, nonparametric tests were selected. To study changes in activity within treatment groups over time, the Friedman test for related samples was performed followed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare two related samples. To study differences between groups, delta values were calculated (by subtracting the baseline values from the values obtained immediately (acute), 1 h, 4 h, or 24 h after treatment), and Mann-Whitney U-tests were performed.</p>
<p id="Par46">A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate significance. Statistical significance is denoted as * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, and *** p &lt; 0.001. All statistical tests were performed with SPSS Statistics software (version 25.0).</p>
