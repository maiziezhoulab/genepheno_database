<abstract>
<p>Phelan McDermid Syndrome (PMDS) is a genetic disorder characterized by features of Autism spectrum disorders. Similar to reports of Zn deficiency in autistic children, we have previously reported high incidence of Zn deficiency in PMDS. However, the underlying mechanisms are currently not well understood. Here, using inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry to measure the concentration of Zinc (Zn) and Copper (Cu) in hair samples from individuals with PMDS with 22q13.3 deletion including <italic>SHANK3</italic> (SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3), we report a high rate of abnormally low Zn/Cu ratios. To investigate possible underlying mechanisms, we generated enterocytes from PMDS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and used Caco-2 cells with knockdown of <italic>SHANK3</italic>. We detected decreased expression of Zn uptake transporters <italic>ZIP2</italic> and <italic>ZIP4</italic> on mRNA and protein level correlating with <italic>SHANK3</italic> expression levels, and found reduced levels of ZIP4 protein co-localizing with SHANK3 at the plasma membrane. We demonstrated that especially ZIP4 exists in a complex with SHANK3. Furthermore, we performed immunohistochemistry on gut sections from <italic>Shank3αβ</italic> knockout mice and confirmed a link between enterocytic SHANK3, ZIP2 and ZIP4. We conclude that apart from its well-known role in the CNS, SHANK3 might play a specific role in the GI tract.</p>

<body>
<p>The Phelan McDermid Syndrome (PMDS/22q13.3 deletion syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by symptoms of the autism spectrum that go along with mental retardation, muscular hypotonia, and severely delayed language development. Additionally, patients can show minor facial dysmorphisms, decreased perception of pain, and might suffer from seizures, ADD/ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) and gastrointestinal (GI) problems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. PMDS is caused by a heterozygous deletion of the 22q13.3 region including <italic>SHANK3</italic> (SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3, also known as proline-rich synapse-associated protein 2 (ProSAP2)). SHANK3 is a scaffolding protein of the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> known to be closely associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. <italic>De novo</italic> and inherited mutations in <italic>SHANK3</italic> have been found in individuals with ASD, and are present in about 0.69% of patients with ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. The protein has important functions at the synapse tethering receptors to the PSD, recruiting signaling complexes, and modulating actin polymerization, which underlines the focus on the synaptic site as central factor in the etiology or pathophysiology of ASD.</p>
<p>Heterozygous loss of <italic>SHANK3</italic> is considered to be the main cause for the neurological phenotype in PMDS since patients with small deletions or point mutations in the <italic>SHANK3</italic> gene often develop a phenotype close to that of PMDS including intellectual and speech impairment, hypotonia and ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. A clear association of deletion size and phenotype, however, could only be demonstrated for some features like developmental and language delay as well as hypotonia for larger deletions, and ASD for smaller deletions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Thus, the genotype-phenotype correlation in PMDS and SHANK3 mutations is quite complicated. While it seems that many mutations in SHANK3 lead to the clinical picture of PMDS, not all of them do. On the other hand, deletion of SHANK3 seems to be critical for the development of PMDS, but features of PMDS might be modified by other deleted genes.</p>
<p>Similar to many reports of Zn deficiency or decreased Zn/Cu (increased Cu/Zn) ratio in autistic children<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, we have previously reported a high incidence rate of Zn deficiency in blood samples of PMDS patients that was associated with the occurrence of seizures, ADHD or other attention and hyperactivity issues, and signs of immunodeficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p>
<p>Zn has a central role for GI development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, brain development and for a functional immune system. In humans, Zn deficiency has additionally been associated with several neuropsychiatric diseases such as depression and autism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. However, the pathophysiological correlations between Zn, Cu and ASD or PMDS are, especially on a molecular level, currently not well understood. Recent research indicates a link between the dysfunctions associated with ASD, Zn deficiency and GI problems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Children with ASD frequently suffer from GI problems such as diarrhea, constipation, bloating, abdominal pain, and gastroesophageal reflux<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p>
<p>In animal models, severe prenatal Zn deficiency is associated with teratogenic effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, while mild or late prenatal and early postnatal Zn deficiency result in much less defined clinical pictures. Here, Zn-related dysfunctions lead to behavioral abnormalities, such as reduced memory and learning capacity, increased anxiety, and autism-like behavior<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. It was also shown that a low Zn level may lead to Cu toxicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, which can cause neurological deficits in children.</p>
<p>Zn homeostasis is regulated by many different proteins involved in absorption, intracellular buffering, trafficking and excretion, such as transporters of the ZIP (Zrt- and Irt-like proteins (SLC39A)) and ZnT (Zinc Transporter (SLC30A)) families, and metallothioneins (MTs). The main site of absorption of Zn is the small intestine, where Zn is absorbed by enterocytes. Of at least 10 ZnT and 15 ZIP transporters in human cells, several are expressed in enterocytes and mediate the cellular uptake (mostly ZIP) and removal (mostly ZnT) of Zn<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In particular, ZIP1 (SLC39A1), ZIP2 (SLC39A2), and ZIP4 (SLC39A4) localize to the apical membrane of enterocytes and are strongly involved in Zn absorption<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. In times of decreased dietary Zn intake, in mice, ZIP4 is up-regulated underlining its function in the homeostatic control of Zn levels. Additionally, mutations in <italic>ZIP4</italic> are known to cause <italic>Acrodermatitis enteropathica</italic>, a rare autosomal recessive disorder of impaired Zn uptake in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.</p>
<p>To elucidate mechanistic insights on the dysregulation of heavy metal ions in ASD, we concentrated on one of the most prominent forms of syndromic ASD – PMDS. To that end we investigated Zn levels in PMDS individuals with a heterozygous 22q13.3 deletion including <italic>SHANK3.</italic> We found a high incidence rate of Zn deficiency also in this group of patients, with a syndromic form of ASD. Thus, we analyzed enterocytes differentiated from patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Interestingly, we found that SHANK3 is expressed both in human enterocytes and in gut epithelium of mice. In a screening approach with 27 trace metal homeostasis genes, the Zn transporters ZIP2 and ZIP4 were identified reduced in enterocytes differentiated from PMDS iPSC. Reduced expression of ZIP2 and ZIP4, was confirmed on both mRNA and protein level. In addition, a decreased amount of ZIP4 protein was detected in SHANK3 protein complexes at the cell surface. Endogenous protein levels of SHANK3 seem to regulate the Zn transporter levels, as overexpression and knockdown experiments in cell lines demonstrated. Accordingly, low enterocytic SHANK3 levels result in diminished Zn transporter levels that could eventually explain reduced Zn concentrations in tissues and organs.</p>

<title>Increased incidence of Zn deficiency and abnormal Zn/Cu ratio in individuals with PMDS</title>
<p>Determination of Zn levels in blood revealed an increased incidence rate of Zn deficiency in PMDS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. To substantiate our findings, we assessed Zn levels in hair samples via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Metal levels in hair samples represent a mean concentration of approx. 2 months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Zn and Cu concentrations of 31 individuals (15 males and 16 females) between 1 and 49 years of age diagnosed with PMDS were measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Only participants with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of PMDS and deletions in 22q13 affecting the <italic>SHANK3</italic> gene were included in the study. Minimum Zn concentrations were based on the levels necessary for individuals aged 1–12 that are less compared to those of adults. Eight participants (25.8%) were identified with Zn deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>) and four showed abnormal high levels of Cu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Among a control group with age range and gender distribution similar to the group of participants with PMDS, an incidence rate of only 8.7% was found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). This results in a 197% increased incidence rate of Zn deficiency in PMDS patients compared to healthy controls. Based on the values obtained, the Zn/Cu ratio was calculated, that is a recommended biomarker for ASD patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. A Zn/Cu ratio below 6.5, the lower limit considered a normal range<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, was found in ten participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). Among the participants with low Zn/Cu ratios, the majority were males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). The occurrence of Zn deficiency alone (data not shown) or a low Zn/Cu ratio was not associated with acute gastro-intestinal problems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>) in PMDS patients. GI abnormalities were assessed categorized into “frequent GI infections”, “constipation”, “diarrhea”, “flatulence”, and “other GI problems (not specified)”. All sub-categories were represented to similar extent within the PMDS group. No GI problems were reported in the control group.</p>
<p>The fraction of individuals with low Zn/Cu ratio seems to slightly decrease with age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Participants with low Zn/Cu ratio were frequently found to show symptoms of ADD/ADHD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c,d</xref>) which is in line with recent findings of an abnormal Zn/Cu ratio in ADHD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.</p>
<p>We were able to document the trace metal profile of one PMDS patient who displayed low Zn levels and that was reported to have undergone Zn supplementation with 10 mg Zn per day for 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e,f</xref>) (Zn supplementation was performed independently of this study by the patient’s legal guardians). The results show a strong increase in Zn content after a period of Zn supplementation with only small effect on other trace elements such as Cu, Pb, Hg, Fe, Ca, and Mg (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). Accordingly, the Zn/Cu ratio showed a strong increase after Zn supplementation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>) that went back to pretreatment values (Zn deficiency) after the discontinuation of the supplementation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e,f</xref>).</p>

<title>Abnormal enterocyte Zn transporter expression in hiPSCs from PMDS patients</title>
<p>To investigate whether abnormal Zn/Cu levels result from impaired absorption in the GI tract, we generated enterocytes derived from iPS cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> from two healthy and two PMDS individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) including one patient with measured Zn deficiency, while Zn status of the other patient was unknown.</p>
<p>Differentiated cells from controls and patients were identified as enterocytes by the expression of the marker proteins Sucrase-Isomaltase (SI) and Peptidase 1 (SLC15A1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). A detailed analysis of mRNA expression profiles of trace metal homeostasis genes revealed no significant alterations in selected genes of Cu homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The level of ATP7A (ATPase Copper Transporting Alpha), a gene regulating Cu transport from the small intestine into the blood and leading to Cu deficiency if mutated, ATP7B (ATPase Copper Transporting Beta), a gene associated with copper excretion leading to increased copper levels if mutated, and COMMD1 (Copper Metabolism Domain Containing 1), a regulator of copper homeostasis, were not different between Control and PMDS patient cells. Further, no significant alterations in selected genes involved in Fe homeostasis or general divalent metal transporters were seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). As expected for PMDS, a significant lower expression level of <italic>SHANK3</italic> was detected in enterocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, analyzing important Zn homeostasis genes of the metallothionein family, metal-responsive transcription factor (<italic>MTF</italic>) family, zinc transporter family (<italic>SLC30A</italic>), and Zrt- and Irt-like proteins (<italic>SLC39A</italic>) by a broad screening approach, revealed a trend towards increased levels of <italic>MT2A</italic> and a significant reduction in <italic>SLC39A2 (ZIP2</italic>) and <italic>SLC39A4 (ZIP4</italic>) was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Next we repeated the quantification of mRNA expression in lysate obtained from enterocytes for <italic>ZIP2</italic> and <italic>ZIP4</italic> using a single-tube format instead of a 96 well approach, confirming equally successful differentiation of the patient iPS cells using <italic>Villin</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> and <italic>CDX2</italic> (caudal type homeobox 2)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> as markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We could verify the significant decrease in <italic>ZIP2</italic> and <italic>ZIP4</italic> mRNA expression levels in PMDS patient samples compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The alterations in ZIP2 and ZIP4 could also be confirmed on protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Quantification of protein expression in lysate obtained from enterocytes shows a significant reduction of ZIP2 in PMDS. In addition, a reduction of ZIP4 protein in samples from PMDS patients was observed as a clear trend.</p>
<p>Expression levels of ZIPs have been reported to respond to local Zn concentrations as part of a regulatory mechanism of Zn homeostasis and uptake. In mice, for example, ZIP4 expression increases under dietary Zn restriction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. We could observe similar regulatory processes in enterocytes derived from healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a–d</xref>). After exposure to Zn depleted medium, the expression levels of <italic>ZIP2</italic> and <italic>ZIP4</italic> increase significantly in cells from unaffected individuals. Again, we could confirm a significant reduction of <italic>ZIP2</italic> and <italic>ZIP4</italic> expression levels in PMDS patient derived cells under these culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,c</xref>). In addition, compared to controls, enterocytes from PMDS patients show significantly altered responses to changing Zn concentrations regarding the expression levels of <italic>ZIP2</italic> and <italic>ZIP4</italic>. A significantly reduced up-regulation of <italic>ZIP2</italic> can be seen in PMDS cells and an increased down-regulation after Zn supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Interaction of SHANK3 and enterocyte Zn transporters in hiPSCs</title>
<p>Using the above mentioned protocol, we found that the expression levels of <italic>SHANK3</italic> that are significantly reduced in PMDS patient derived cells follow a similar expression pattern as seen for <italic>ZIP2</italic> and <italic>ZIP4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). However, again, the up-regulation of <italic>SHANK3</italic> mRNA in Zn depleted medium is less prominent in cells derived from PMDS patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>
<p>SHANK3, which is localized within the cytoplasm and nucleus, but also at the membranes of enterocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>) shows overlapping localization with ZIP2 and ZIP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Moreover, using immunocytochemistry to quantify signal intensities of cell membrane associated ZIP2 and ZIP4, a significant reduction in ZIP4 was found in cells derived from PMDS patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e,f</xref>). No significant reduction of membrane-associated ZIP2 was measured, pointing towards a reduction of the cytoplasmic rather than the membrane associated pool of the Zn transporter contributing to the observed reduction in overall protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>).</p>
<p>As not only SHANK3 can be affected in PMDS, next, to investigate whether alterations in ZIP2 and ZIP4 are specifically dependent on SHANK3 protein levels, we performed overexpression or knockdown experiments of <italic>SHANK3</italic> in Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig 4c–e</xref>). Caco-2 cells have been used to study the bioavailability of micronutrients in the past<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> and are a suitable model to study the mechanistic aspects of zinc uptake. Further, Caco-2 cells express SHANK3, ZIP2 and ZIP4. Knockdown of <italic>SHANK3</italic>, which results in approx. 50% reduction of SHANK3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), leads to a significant reduction of ZIP4 signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). For the analysis, the average ratio between signal intensities of transfected and neighboring untransfected cells was used and compared to the corresponding control. In addition, using Western Blot analysis, a reduction of both ZIP2 and ZIP4 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>) under knockdown conditions, while only mRNA levels for <italic>ZIP4</italic> are significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). We did not observe increased expression of ZIP2 and ZIP4 after overexpression of <italic>SHANK3</italic> on protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>) or mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4e</xref>), which could hint towards an upper limit of ZIP expression regulated by other factors.</p>

Overexpression of a mutated SHANK3 protein (GFP-SHANK3 R1119X) that has been associated with schizophrenia and that is permanently localized in the nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> does not result in a significant increase in ZIP2 and ZIP4 mRNA and protein levels.

<title>Interaction of SHANK3 and enterocyte Zn transporters in mice</title>
<p>Similarly to enterocytes differentiated from hiPSCs, SHANK3 was found expressed in the GI epithelium of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Using co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we found primarily ZIP4 and to a much lesser extend ZIP2 in a complex with SHANK3 in lysate from mouse GI epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Moreover, similar to hiPSC, using measurements of ZIP2 and ZIP4 GI sections from WT and <italic>Shank3αβ</italic> KO mice, a significant reduction in ZIP2 fluorescence intensity of the tissue sections and a trend towards a reduction of ZIP4 fluorescence intensity of the tissue sections in <italic>Shank3αβ</italic> KO mice was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c,d</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A growing amount of research indicates that abnormalities in the GI system during development might be a factor in ASD. Many patients with ASD have symptoms associated with GI disorders and, especially in young age, show a high prevalence for Zn deficiency. In previous studies, we could show that animals with prenatal zinc deficiency display autism like features<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Further, male mice lacking vesicular zinc in the brain were reported to display ASD like behavior<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that the development of ASD is facilitated by Zn deficiency. Of the few studies performed with autistic patients using Zn supplementation, the results show that autistic children with gastro-intestinal co-morbidities significantly improved with respect to hyperactivity and self-stimulatory behavior after Zn therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. However, detailed studies in human PMDS patients are missing so far.</p>
<p>Here, we investigated whether the observed increased incidence rate of Zn deficiency in ASD also occurs in one of the most prominent syndromic forms of ASD, PMDS, as here, a clear genetic cause is underlying the disorder. Surprisingly, we also found a high incidence rate of Zn deficiency in PMDS patients by analyzing hair samples. At present, about 1000 cases of PMDS are diagnosed worldwide. The prevalence is given as 2.5 to 10 cases per million births<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. However, it is known from recent studies on large cohorts of autistic patients that the proportion of patients with PMDS lies at about 0.5% within ASD. Thus, the syndrome could be significantly under-diagnosed. Here, we measured hair samples of 31 patients that have clear diagnosis of PMDS and that have not been sampled in our previous study, where Zn levels of 37 participants were determined in blood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Hair and blood Zn values correlate with the advantage of the measurement of hair being more reproducible and sensitive<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Systemic Zn deficiency as assessed in hair or blood samples was published to affect also brain tissue, with up to 30% decreased Zn concentrations in hippocampus and cerebral cortex accompanied by reduced learning behavior in a rat model of diet-induced Zn deficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>.</p>
<p>Compared to large-scale studies involving hundreds of patients with autism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, the sample size of our study is rather small. However, compared to the overall number of diagnosed cases, our two studies cover a wide spectrum of patients located on different continents (North America, Europe, South America). From 68 patients overall combined from both studies, 15 (22.1%) were found to have mild to severe Zn deficiency and the high number of 27 (42.2% based on 64 samples with determination of both Zn and Cu) display low Zn/Cu ratios.</p>
<p>As with Zn deficiency in autism, a major and unresolved question concerns the cause for Zn deficiency. While maternal Zn deficiency during pregnancy might be a major risk factor for autism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, in PMDS and probably also some cases of autism, other factors may be involved. Interestingly, in this study, one Zn deficient patient was treated for his Zn deficiency after the initial hair measurements by the family physician. The patient was supplemented with 10 mg Zn per day for 3 weeks (20 days). After the supplementation, we were able to obtain fresh hair samples and analyzed only few millimeters grown in the period of Zn supplementation. The results imply that Zn absorption is not completely blocked in PMDS and the Zn status can reach normal levels after increased daily Zn uptake. After discontinuation of the supplementation, the patient again developed a Zn deficiency. The potential to compensate a dysregulation of Zn transporters by external factors such as high Zn intake may be a reason why not every patient, but all patient iPSC lines studied show similar molecular alterations. Contrary to defined cell culture media, PMDS patients are exposed to a variety of factors influencing Zn status including food habits and preferences, as well as physical activity.</p>
<p>Several possible reasons for inefficient Zn absorption might be discussed. One of them could be altered expression of Zn transporters and homeostasis genes due to abnormalities in the GI system. In search for such molecular mechanisms that might be responsible for the Zn malabsorption we made use of a cellular <italic>in vitro</italic> system and employed enterocytes generated from iPSC from PMDS patients in comparison to healthy controls. In a comprehensive screen for proteins regulating heavy metal ions in the body we investigated the expression of 27 Zn homeostasis genes. These included the two families of Zn transporters with <italic>ZnT1–8 (SLC30A1-8</italic>) and <italic>ZIP1-14 (SLC39A1-14</italic>). A significant decrease of <italic>ZIP2</italic> and <italic>ZIP4</italic> mRNA levels was found and confirmed in single-tube qRT-PCR. On protein level, for ZIP4, a significant loss of transporters at the membrane occurs and the analysis of cell protein homogenate reveals a strong trend towards a decrease in total ZIP4 and a significant decrease in ZIP2.</p>
<p>Both, ZIP2 and ZIP4 have been shown to regulate Zn uptake into enterocytes. In particular, mammalian ZIP4 is involved in Zn uptake in enterocytes and embryonic visceral endoderm cells. Both, the level of mRNA abundance and subcellular localization of ZIP4 change in response to Zn levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Mutations in <italic>ZIP4</italic> cause <italic>Acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE)</italic>, a rare and untreated lethal genetic disorder of Zn uptake in humans. Intriguingly, mental problems have been described in <italic>AE</italic> patients such as irritability, a complete lack of smiling and laughing, and an avoidance of eye contact as seen in autistic children<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. However, dietary Zn supplementation can suppress the symptoms of this disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>, probably due to the activation of other Zn uptake transporters such as ZIP1-3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. The compensatory regulation of ZIP2 was affected in PMDS hiPSCs. Thus, on the level of the individual, one might speculate that in case of exposure to low zinc supply, the decreased expression of ZIP2 and ZIP4 and the altered ability to compensate via regulation of ZIP2 might lead to an increased risk to develop Zn deficiency in PMDS patients.</p>
<p>An interesting observation was the fact that the expression of <italic>ZIP</italic> genes was dependent upon <italic>SHANK3</italic> expression levels. Even though no association has been made so far between control of Zn homeostasis and other deleted genes in the PMDS iPS cell lines used in the study (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), it may have been possible that some have an effect on Zn transporters as well. Therefore, knockdown and overexpression experiments specific for <italic>SHANK3</italic> were performed in Caco-2 cells. Caco-2 cells showed reduced levels of ZIP4 after <italic>SHANK3</italic> knockdown on mRNA level, and protein level assessed by protein biochemistry and immunocytochemistry. Interestingly, after incubation with ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, less uptake of Zn was detected in <italic>SHANK3</italic> knockdown cells underlining the physiological relevance of the reduction of ZIP4 in these cells.</p>
<p>While overexpression does not lead to increased ZIP2 or ZIP4 concentrations, overexpression of a SHANK3 protein with mostly nuclear localization slightly increased both mRNA and protein levels of ZIP2 and ZIP4. Moreover, in PMDS cells, these transporters lost their sensitivity to surrounding Zn concentrations. Further investigations revealed that ZIP4 physically interacts with SHANK3 in enterocytes differentiated from hiPSCs and mouse epithelium, and that primarily ZIP4 can be found in a protein complex with SHANK3.</p>
<p>The data indicate that SHANK3 might be involved in a regulatory pathway for Zn concentrations by direct interaction with Zn transporters at the enterocyte membrane as well as a transcriptional regulator for essential Zn transporters. At the moment it still needs to be elucidated how SHANK3 can mediate a regulatory role on transcriptional events, however, the ability of the protein to localize to the nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref> and data presented here might indicate that SHANK3 can not only function as a scaffolding molecule but also as a component of transcriptional complexes. In turn, this would imply that mutations of the <italic>SHANK3</italic> gene can directly cause alterations of transcriptional activity in defined tissues and cell types. A more detailed analysis of surface localization and expression of ZIP2 and ZIP4 in <italic>SHANK3</italic> knockdown and after nuclear localization of SHANK3 should be performed in future studies.</p>
<p>The presence of other “synaptic” proteins in the GI epithelium makes the existence of a protein complex similar to the one described at excitatory postsynapses in enterocytes more than likely. One feature of this complex seems to be the regulation of two Zn importers, <italic>ZIP2</italic> and <italic>ZIP4</italic> by interacting protein networks and possibly nuclear signaling of SHANK3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. Future research will have to investigate whether the deregulation of Zn homeostasis is a common feature of mutations in “synaptic” proteins that are also found in the GI system. The high incidence of trace metal imbalances in patients with autism but also other synaptopathies might hint towards such a common mechanism.</p>
<p>Whenever detected, the treatment of Zn deficiency by oral Zn supplementation is in general advised since persistent Zn deficiency can cause serious health problems including growth impairment, immunological and gastrointestinal problems and neurological symptoms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>. Together with the fact that Zn deficiency can contribute to and modify disease symptoms in ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, our data implies that Zn therapy should be considered in PMDS and Autism patients as the risk to develop Zn deficiency might be high. Especially, as marginal Zn deficiency in humans often is undetected. Whether Zn therapy also is helpful in absence of Zn deficiency for PMDS or Autism patients with mutation in <italic>SHANK3</italic> needs further investigation and new strategies for Zn delivery bypassing classical Zn uptake pathways may be required.</p>

Statistical tests were two tailed with a significance level of α ≤ 0.05. Significances are stated with <italic>p</italic> values &lt; 0.05*; &lt;0.01**; &lt;0.001***. An observed trend (<italic>p</italic> between 0.05 and 0.1) is indicated with “#” and the <italic>p</italic> value stated in the figures.</p>

<title>qRT PCR quantification</title>
<p>Relative quantification is based on internal reference genes to determine virtual mRNA levels of target genes. Cycle threshold (ct) values were calculated by the Rotor-Gene Q Software (version 2.0.2). Ct values were transformed into virtual mRNA levels according to the formula: virtual mRNA level = 10 * ((ct<sub>(target)</sub> − ct<sub>(standart)</sub>)/slope of standard curve).</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="3">
<title>Western blot quantification</title>
<p>Evaluation of bands from Western blots (WBs) was performed using ImageJ. Three independent experiments were performed and blots imaged using a MicroChemi Imaging System from Biostep. The individual bands were selected and the integrated density was measured. All WB bands were normalized to β-Actin or GAPDH and the ratios averaged and tested for significance.</p>

<title>Interaction of SHANK3 and Zn transporters.</title>
<p><bold>(a)</bold> Differentiated enterocytes were analyzed after exposure to Zn depleted and supplemented (with 10 μM Zn<sup>2+</sup>) medium for 20 h. mRNA expression levels are shown as mean Δct values from 3 technical replicates from two controls and two patient cell lines each. Smaller insert (top right of graphs) shows individual data points for each measurement and cell line per group. Compared to Controls, a significant reduction of <italic>SHANK3</italic> expression levels can be found in PMDS patient derived cells under most conditions (2-way ANOVA, main effect of group: F<sub>(1,30)</sub> = 9.716 p &lt; 0.004; Post hoc analysis Ctrl vs. PMDS: Zn depleted p = 0.051 (indicated as trend #), Control p = 0.0461, Zn suppl. p = 0.0096. Main effect of treatment: F<sub>(1,30)</sub> = 8.056 p &lt; 0.002; Main effect treatment x group: F<sub>(1,30)</sub> = 2.589 p = 0.092). <bold>(b)</bold> The <italic>SHANK3</italic> mRNA expression level shows a similar reaction to media with specific Zn concentration as seen for <italic>ZIP2</italic> and <italic>ZIP4</italic>. The up-regulation of <italic>SHANK3</italic> mRNA in Zn depleted medium is significantly less in cells derived from PMDS patients (two tailed t-test, Ctrl vs. PMDS: Zn depleted p = 0.055 (indicated as trend #), Zn suppl. p = 0.9024). <bold>(c)</bold> Immunocytochemistry labeling of SHANK3 reveals cytoplasmic but also nuclear (full arrow) and membrane associated (open arrow) signals of SHANK3. <bold>(d)</bold> Membrane associated SHANK3 co-localizes with ZIP2 (upper panel) and ZIP4 (lower panel) fluorescent signals. <bold>(e)</bold> A significant reduction of ZIP4 signal intensities is seen in PMDS patients compared to controls (t-test, ZIP2 (CTRL1 vs. CTRL2) p = 0.0808; (PMDS1 vs. PMDS2) p = 0.1431; (pooled CTRL vs. PMDS) p = 0.7138 (n = 20); ZIP4 (CTRL1 vs. CTRL2) p = 0.7176; (PMDS1 vs. PMDS2) p = 0.3428; (pooled CTRL vs. PMDS) p = 0.0006 (n = 20)). Smaller insert (top right of graphs) shows individual data points for each measurement and cell line per group. <bold>(f)</bold> For the analysis of signal intensities, cell surface signals were selected and quantified from at least 20 optic fields of view from two patients and two controls.</p>

<title>Knockdown of endogenous <italic>SHANK3</italic> in Caco-2 cells.</title>
<p>Caco-2 cells were transfected with <italic>SHANK3</italic> shRNA co-expressing <italic>GFP</italic> and the corresponding control, a scrambled shRNA. (<bold>a</bold>) The average cytoplasmic ZIP2 or ZIP4 signal intensity was measured in transfected (full arrow) cells and neighboring untransfected cells (open arrow) and the mean ratio of n = 10 cells is shown. Knockdown of <italic>SHANK3</italic> leads to a significant reduction in ZIP4 signal (<italic>t</italic>-test, p = 0.0015). <bold>(b)</bold> Western blot analysis of protein lysate from Caco-2 cells reveals a significant decrease of ZIP2 and ZIP4 levels normalized to the corresponding control. (n = 3, for statistical analysis, all values were normalized to untransfected controls (Control) and the ratio of scrambled RNAi/Control and <italic>SHANK3</italic> RNAi/Control compared) (<italic>t</italic>-test, ZIP2: p = 0.001; ZIP4: p = 0.0052). <bold>(c)</bold> Caco-2 cells were transfected with scrambled RNAi (scrRNAi) or <italic>SHANK3</italic> specific RNAi for 3 d. 50 μM ZnCl<sub>2</sub> were added for 30 min and intracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> visualized by Zinquin ethyl ester labeling. The Zinquin fluorescence intensity was measured and the ratio between a transfected (full arrow) and untransfected (open arrow) cell calculated. Images for Zinquin show signal intensity color-coded. A significantly (p = 0.0254, <italic>t</italic>-test, n = 10) lower Zinquin signals can be seen in cells expressing the <italic>SHANK3</italic> targeting RNAi compared to cells expressing scrRNAi. <bold>(d)</bold> CoIP experiments using lysate from hiPSC derived enterocytes. All analyzed proteins (SHANK3, ZIP2, ZIP4) were found expressed in enterocytes (Input). Rat brain lysate was used to compare SHANK3 antibody signals in human samples. Anti-SHANK3 antibody was bound to magnetic beads and precipitated. Anti-ZIP4 and anti-ZIP2 were used for detection of possibly co-immunoprecipitated proteins. ZIP4 and to a lesser amount ZIP2 were found co-immunoprecipitated in the analyzed eluate (CoIP Eluate), while no clear band or enrichment was visible in the eluate from a reaction without SHANK3 antibodies coupled to beads (CoIP Ctrl). ZIP2 signals are generally low in lysate from Caco-2 and enterocytes due to low protein expression levels.</p>

<title>SHANK3 expression and association with ZIP2 and ZIP4 in mice.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Expression-analysis of SHANK2 and SHANK3 in wildtype mice (n = 3). Both SHANK2 and SHANK3 are expressed in GI epithelium. <bold>(b)</bold> CoIP experiments using lysate from GI epithelium. All analyzed proteins (SHANK3, ZIP2, ZIP4) were found expressed in GI epithelium (Input). SHANK3 was bound to magnetic beads and ZIP4 and ZIP2 were found co-immunoprecipitated in the analyzed eluate (CoIP Eluate), while no clear band or enrichment was visible in the eluate from a reaction without SHANK3 antibodies coupled to beads (CoIP Ctrl). (<bold>c,d</bold>) Immunohistochemistry performed on WT and <italic>Shank3αβ</italic> KO mice (n = 3, 10 weeks of age) reveals a significant reduction in ZIP2 fluorescence intensity and a trend towards a reduction of ZIP4 fluorescence intensity in <italic>Shank3αβ</italic> KO mice compared to WT (t-test, ZIP2: p = 0.01; ZIP4: p = 0.08). For the analysis, fluorescence signal intensity of ZIP2 and ZIP4 positive signals of at least 10 different regions from multiple sections were analyzed.</p>
