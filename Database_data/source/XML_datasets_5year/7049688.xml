<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Family with sequence similarity (FAM46) proteins are newly identified metazoan-specific poly(A) polymerases (PAPs). Although predicted as Gld-2-like eukaryotic non-canonical PAPs, the detailed architecture of FAM46 proteins is still unclear. Exact biological functions for most of FAM46 proteins also remain largely unknown. Here, we report the first crystal structure of a FAM46 protein, FAM46B. FAM46B is composed of a prominently larger N-terminal catalytic domain as compared to known eukaryotic PAPs, and a C-terminal helical domain. FAM46B resembles prokaryotic PAP/CCA-adding enzymes in overall folding as well as certain inter-domain connections, which distinguishes FAM46B from other eukaryotic non-canonical PAPs. Biochemical analysis reveals that FAM46B is an active PAP, and prefers adenosine-rich substrate RNAs. FAM46B is uniquely and highly expressed in human pre-implantation embryos and pluripotent stem cells, but sharply down-regulated following differentiation. FAM46B is localized to both cell nucleus and cytosol, and is indispensable for the viability of human embryonic stem cells. Knock-out of <italic>FAM46B</italic> is lethal. Knock-down of FAM46B induces apoptosis and restricts protein synthesis. The identification of the bacterial-like FAM46B, as a pluripotent stem cell-specific PAP involved in the maintenance of translational efficiency, provides important clues for further functional studies of this PAP in the early embryonic development of high eukaryotes.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>PAPs are a branch of the nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Previous structural studies have established close relationship between PAPs and CCA-adding enzymes, another group of template-independent RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Eukaryotic PAPs share sequence similarity to the class-I archaeal CCA-adding enzymes, whereas bacterial PAPs are homologous to the class-II eukaryotic and bacterial CCA-adding enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Eukaryotic PAPs can be classified into two subgroups. The ‘canonical’ PAPs, represented by nuclear PAPα, are responsible for adding long poly(A) tail during mRNA maturation. They are composed of three domains: an N-terminal catalytic domain containing the signature NTase motif, a central domain and a C-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD). The ‘non-canonical’ PAPs, including but not limited to Gld-2, terminal uridylyltransferase (TUTs) and mitochondrial (mt-)PAP, add poly(A) tails or short terminal tails to a variety of RNA substrates including mRNA, snRNA, miRNA, aberrant rRNA and snoRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Given the diversity of their substrate preference, these non-canonical PAPs are recently renamed terminal nucleotididyltranferase (TENTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). TENTs usually share a bipartite core PAP domain that lacks the RBD, and have different accessory domains to fulfil their diverse functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the known eukaryotic PAPs are localized in the nucleus, and their activity and specificity relies on the association with other co-factors. For example, PAPα functions as a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic><italic>elegans</italic> (ce)Gld-2 separately forms complex with Gld-3 or RNP-8 to control gamete sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In contrast, bacterial PAPs polyadenylate mRNAs in a non-discriminative manner, and usually require no partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In terms of overall structure, bacterial PAPs are characterized by a seahorse-like shape, where the catalytic head domain is linearly aligned with the neck, body and tail domains involved in substrate RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). This domain organization is distinct from that of eukaryotic PAPs.</p>
<p>Family with sequence similarity 46 (FAM46) is a group of predicted NTases found mainly in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Human and mice both have four FAM46 proteins: namely FAM46A/B/C/D (also named TENT5A/B/C/D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The amino acid sequences of these homologs share &gt;40% overall sequence identity, but are not apparently associated with other protein families. Prior bioinformatics analysis suggested that the FAM46 proteins are non-classical PAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), which was supported by a recent study on FAM46C, a putative suppressor for multiple myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). However, the detailed biological roles of other FAM46 proteins and the structural feature of this protein family still remain unclear.</p>
<p>Most eukaryotic mRNAs carry poly(A) tails, whose length is closely coupled with translational efficiency and mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). These tails are firstly added by nuclear PAPs during transcription termination, and usually shortened by deadenylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The poly(A) tails can also be re-extended in the cytoplasm, which may promote translation and inhibit decay of certain mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16–18</xref>). This tail-length regulatory mechanism is considered to be an important regime of translation control in the early development of metazoan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). A cytoplasmic PAP, Gld-2, was found to be responsible for this process during gametogenesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, the cytoplasmic polyadenylation process is less understood in mammalian early embryos, partly due to the lack of information on corresponding PAPs.</p>
<p>In this study, we started from structure determination and revealed that FAM46B is a robust bacterial-like PAP. Being specifically expressed in human pluripotent stem cells, FAM46B is critical for cell viability, possibly by maintaining the stability of certain mRNAs. These results expand the knowledge of eukaryotic PAPs, and provide new insight into the translational control in early development of mammals.</p>

<title>Protein expression and purification</title>
<p>The cDNAs of <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> (xt), <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (hs)FAM46B and <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> CCA adding enzyme (tmCCA) were purchased from YouBio. All constructs and mutants were expressed from a modified pET28 vector with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag fusion followed by a PreScission protease (PSP) cleavage site. Recombinant plasmids were transformed into <italic>Escherichia coli Rosetta</italic> (DE3) cells. Transformed bacteria were cultured at 37°C in Terrific Broth (TB) medium until OD<sub>600</sub> reached 0.6, and then induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Induced bacteria were grown overnight at 18°C. Cells were lysed in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF), 1 μM DNase I and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) using a cell disruptor (JNBIO) and subjected to centrifugation at 40 000<italic>g</italic> for 1 h. The supernatant was filtered and applied to a Ni-NTA (first Ni-NTA) column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with binding buffer A containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM KCl and 2 mM β-ME. The column was extensively washed with buffer A and shortly with 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 70 mM imidazole, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM KCl and 2 mM β-ME. Proteins were eluted with 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM KCl and 2 mM β-ME before incubated with 20 μg glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused PSP to remove the His<sub>6</sub>-tag and dialyzed overnight against binding buffer B containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM KCl and 2 mM β-ME. After dialysis, PSP was removed using a GST column. The protein was re-applied to a second Ni-NTA column equilibrated with binding buffer B, and eluted with binding buffer A. Eluted proteins were concentrated and loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with gel filtration buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM KCl and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Peak fractions corresponding to monomeric FAM46B were collected. tmCCA was purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), plus an extra ion-exchange step using a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare) to remove the nucleic acids bound to the protein. Cell lysis and protein purification were performed at 4°C.</p>

<title>Crystallization and structure determination</title>
<p>Crystals of xtFAM46B were obtained via hanging vapor diffusion by mixing 10 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> protein with equal volume of reservoir solution containing 2% tacsimate pH 5.0, 0.15 M sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate pH 5.6 and 10% PEG 3350 at 10°C. During flash-cooling of the crystals in liquid N<sub>2</sub>, a cryo-solution containing 0.15 M sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate pH 5.6, 15% (w/v) PEG3350 and 10% glycerol was used.

<title>Data analysis for <italic>in vitro</italic> A-tailing experiment</title>
<p>For all reads from the sequencing data, the first 15 bases were sub-stringed, and the index of the first 3 bases ‘TGG’ of the adapter was searched. The numbers of added A were calculated as ‘the index number—15’, if 90% of the bases were A between the first 15 bases and the adapter. If no adapter was found and 90% of the bases were A after the first 15 bases, then the number of A equals to 35. Reads without added A (0A) were classed as background, whereas reads with 5A or greater were classed as foreground. The frequencies of ATCG at each position were calculated both in background and foreground. At a particular position j, of a sequence in foreground, p = (pA, pC, pG, pT) denoted the probabilities of the four elements, and q = (qA, qC, qG, qT) denoted the corresponding background probabilities.

<title>siRNA Transfection</title>
<p>Plates of 12-well (Corning) were coated with 400 μl of diluted Matrigel before addition of siRNA oligos. siRNAs (Qiagen) mixed with Opti-MEM I (GIBCO) were added into the wells. For higher transfection efficiency, a mixture of 2 μl DharmaFect1 (Dharmacon) transfection reagent with 98 μl Opti-MEM I was added into each well after siRNA addition. After incubation for ∼30 min at room temperature, single cell suspension of 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> hESCs in 800 μl of mTeSR1 with 10 μM Y-27632 (Stem Cell Technologies) was seeded into each well. 18 h later, Y-27632 was washed off. The working concentration of siRNA was 100 nM. Six hours after washing off Y-27632, RNA samples were collected for further assays unless specified. The siRNA sense sequences are: 5′-UAAGGCUAUGAAGAGAUAC (scramble), 5′-GGCGCCATTTGTCTTGGAATT (siRNA-1), 5′-CCGUGUGCCUCAUGAACCATT (siRNA-2).</p>

<p>FUNCAT assay was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Briefly, 24 h after transfected with scramble or <italic>FAM46B</italic> siRNAs, 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> hESC cells of each sample were collected and lysed in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). HPG incorporated protein lysates were labeled selectively with Cy5-conjugated azide by copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Click reaction was performed following the protocol from Click Chemistry Protein Reaction Buffer Kit (Click Chemistry Tools). Finally, samples were heated at 70°C for 10 min before resolved by SDS-PAGE and imaged using a pharos FXTM Plus Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad).

<title>Overall crystal structure of FAM46B</title>
<p>In order to obtain functional clues of FAM46 proteins, we solved a 2.7 Å crystal structure of nucleotide-free FAM46B protein from <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> (xtFAM46B) with a <italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub> of 0.252 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). In the structural model, residues 1−8, 198−200 and 347−350 are missing due to disordered configuration. The protein contains an <underline>N</underline>-terminal <underline>c</underline>atalytic <underline>d</underline>omain (NCD, residues 9−230 resolved in the structure) and a C-terminal <underline>h</underline>elical <underline>d</underline>omain (HD, residues 231−346), which together form a massive cleft (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A−C). Inside the cleft, the three NTase consensus carboxylates, Asp91, Asp93 and Glu167 are present at the putative catalytic site, but we did not observe the electron density for catalytic metal ion. A conserved Arg176 directs the loop linking the two domains via hydrogen bonds and a salt bridge with Thr234, Arg235<sub>O</sub>, Asn236<sub>O</sub> and Glu239 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The other side of the cleft is shielded by a salt bridge between Lys90 from the NCD and Asp295 from the HD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). The bottom of the cleft is featured by an extensive hydrophobic network formed by residues from both NCD and HD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Glu179 and Asp183 sit in the center of the cleft and interact with Lys247 protruding from the HD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>).</p>

<title>FAM46B is a bacterial-like PAP</title>
<p>The overall architecture of FAM46B does not conform to the previously calculated FAM46C model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Compared to other known eukaryotic PAPs such as the classical PAPα and non-classical Gld-2 or mt-PAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45–47</xref>), the NCD of FAM46B is double-sized in terms of amino acid residue numbers, and contains more secondary elements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A and B</xref>). To our knowledge, FAM46 proteins are likely to bear the largest catalytic domain among all known PAPs. Compared to Gld-2, FAM46B has a substantially wider NCD and deeper cleft (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1C and D</xref>). In addition, the relative position of FAM46B NCD and HD also differs from that of the catalytic domain and central domain of Gld-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1E</xref>). This somewhat ‘complex’ architecture of FAM46B, which is obviously distinguished from other known eukaryotic PAPs, prompted us to look for its other potential relatives in the Dali server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Intriguingly, FAM46B shows high topological similarity with the class-II bacterial PAPs and CCA-adding enzymes. When FAM46B is individually superimposed with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> PAP I (ecPAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> CCA-adding enzyme (tmCCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), the root mean standard deviation (r.m.s.d.) values of aligned Cα atoms are 2.93 Å and 3.65 Å, respectively, although the sequence identity between FAM46B and these two prokaryotic enzymes is only ∼15% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). In particular, the central eight-stranded β-sheet in the NCD is highly consistent with the bacterial PAPs/CCA-adding enzymes, and the HD of FAM46B also resembles their neck domains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">B</xref>). The conserved inter-domain salt bridges in ecPAP and tmCCA, which are shown to be involved in the coordination of nucleotides (i.e. Asp151-Arg200 in ecPAP, and Asp130-Arg180 in tmCCA), are equivalent to the aforementioned Glu179-Lys247 pair in FAM46B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis also revealed that compared to eukaryotic PAPs, FAM46 proteins are more closely related to class-II bacterial PAPs and CCA-adding enzymes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Following this clue, we tested whether FAM46B and FAM46C possess PAP and/or CCA-adding activities. CCA-adding enzymes catalyze the consecutive 3′-terminal CCA extension of precursor tRNAs with CTP and ATP as donors, while PAPs selectively add a string of nontemplated AMPs to the 3′-end of target mRNAs by consuming ATP molecules. 5′-biotinylated 15-mer poly(A) RNA (A<sub>15</sub>) and mini-tRNA substrates were individually incubated with FAM46B or FAM46C in the presence of corresponding nucleotides, and the products were visualized using streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Both proteins failed to add AMP or CMP to mini-tRNAs lacking 3′ A, CA and CCA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). On the other hand, FAM46B and FAM46C were able to elongate A<sub>15</sub> in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and the lengths of the products were apparently coupled to ATP concentration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). When Mg<sup>2+</sup> was replaced by Mn<sup>2+</sup>, both proteins became more potent in catalyzing polyadenylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Notably, FAM46B showed much higher PAP activity than FAM46C, especially in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-present conditions. FAM46B is able to efficiently extend oligoA substrates ranging from A<sub>5</sub> to A<sub>30</sub>, but shows no apparent binding to AMP, ATP or ATPγS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3C and D</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>tmCCA and ecPAP rely on two charged residues (Asp174 and Arg177 in tmCCA; Asp194 and Arg197 in ecPAP), which are conserved among class-II bacterial PAPs, in recognizing adenosine and cytosine nucleotides. However, structural comparison between FAM46B and tmCCA/ecPAP revealed that these two conserved residues are not present in FAM46B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3E</xref>). Considering the lack of the nucleotide-binding affinity of FAM46B that also differs from tmCCA and ecPAP, we infer that FAM46B and FAM46C are bacterial-like poly(A) polymerases in terms of overall folding but may possess a different nucleotide binding manner from the class-II bacterial PAPs. In the rest part of the paper, human FAM46B has been used for all the experiments.</p>

<title>The catalytic properties of FAM46B</title>
<p>To investigate the catalytic properties of FAM46B, we firstly examined the nucleotide selection of FAM46B. An HPLC-based method was developed to monitor the incorporation of each monophosphate nucleotide (NMP). FAM46B and A<sub>15</sub> primer were individually incubated with corresponding label-free triphosphate nucleotides (NTPs). After reaction, the mixture was applied to a C18 column with an upstream guard column to block the protein and RNA primer/product (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Thus, we were able to monitor the consumption of NTPs by quantifying the remaining nucleotides. When ATP was supplied, we observed decreased area of the ATP peak but no AMP peak after incubation, suggesting that ATP has been hydrolyzed and added to the A<sub>15</sub> primer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>). In contrast, UTP, CTP or GTP was barely consumed under the same conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). Consistent with the HPLC assay, FAM46B only extends 5′-biotinylated A<sub>15</sub> in the presence of ATP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="gkaa049fig5"></graphic>
</fig>
<p>In order to figure out whether FAM46B has preference on the oligonucleotide primers, we compared the ATP consumption of FAM46B in the presence of A<sub>15</sub>, A<sub>14</sub>U<sub>1</sub> or U<sub>14</sub>A<sub>1</sub>. For three cases, the remaining ATP portions were approximately 10%, 30% and 90%, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Similar results were observed in AMP incorporation assay using α-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled ATP ([α-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP), where A<sub>14</sub>U<sub>1</sub> led to less AMP incorporation than A<sub>15</sub>, and U<sub>14</sub>A<sub>1</sub> showed only little ATP incorporation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). To further explore the potential sequence preference of FAM46B over the substrates, we used a pool of random sequences of 15 nt as primers for an <italic>in vitro</italic> adenosine (A)-tailing assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). It turned out that FAM46B indeed prefers an AxAA sequence at 3′-end of the substrates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). Further experiments indicated that FAM46B extended A<sub>15</sub> primer in a ATP/protein concentration-dependent manner, and the majority of poly(A) products were below 150 nt in length (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>). These results suggest that FAM46B has strong selectivity on RNA molecules that are adenosine-rich close to 3′-end, and the base type at the very 3′-end of substrate RNA also impacts polyadenylation efficiency.</p>

<title>The catalytic center and potential RNA-binding area of FAM46B</title>
<p>All NTases contain three critical motifs in the catalytic center: hG[GS], [DE]h[DE]h and h[DE]h (h indicates a hydrophobic amino acid). To verify these functional motifs in FAM46B, we mutated corresponding key residues, namely Gly107, Ser108, Asp124, Asp126 and Glu200, individually into alanine and performed AMP incorporation and ATP consumption assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Unexceptionally, these mutants failed to hydrolyze ATP in the presence of A<sub>15</sub>, and lost polyadenylation activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">C</xref>). We also did mutagenesis analysis for the residues involved in NCD-HD interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D−G). Except for Lys123 (corresponding to Lys90 in xtFAM46B as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), mutation of other selected residues at NCD-HD interface substantially reduced PAP activity of FAM46B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>).</p>

<p>Surface electrostatic potential analysis reveals that positively-charged patches exist around the catalytic center of FAM46B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). The mutations of patch-involving residues Lys175, Lys202, Arg209, Arg274, Lys280 and His329 to alanine all deprived the PAP activity of FAM46B. In contrast, the mutation of Arg302, an HD residue located at the opposite side of the central cleft, still remained partially active (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). We also tested two non-charged residues close to the positively charged patches, namely Cys180 and Phe330. C180A had reduced PAP activity, and F330A was as potent as the wild type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). These data suggest that these positively-charged patches may be involved in the RNA binding. Similarly, the neck domain of ecPAP also possesses a positively-charged area that has been proved critical for RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p>

<p>Consistent with <italic>FAM46B</italic> transcription in human pluripotent cells, ChIP-seq data shows that, in contrast to <italic>FAM46A</italic>/<italic>C</italic>/<italic>D</italic>, the promoter region of <italic>FAM46B</italic> is marked with transcriptionally active histone marks (H3K4me3, H3K27ac). Notably, the co-binding site of pluripotency transcription factors OCT4 and NANOG is embedded in the intron of <italic>FAM46B</italic>, indicating <italic>FAM46B</italic> transcription might directly regulated by OCT4 and NANOG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). These data imply a strong coupling between <italic>FAM46B</italic> expression and human pluripotency.</p>

<title>Expression of FAM46B is coupled to human pluripotency</title>
<p>To explore the pattern of <italic>FAM46B</italic> transcription during hESC differentiation, we first employed a typical spontaneous differential model: embryoid body formation. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results showed that <italic>FAM46B</italic> expression level was gradually declined during embryoid formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). Importantly, <italic>FAM46B</italic> is also down-regulated in neuroectodermal and mesendormal cells differentiated from hESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), indicating that <italic>FAM46B</italic> inactivation might be required for lineage specification and germ layer formation during the embryonic development in humans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6C</xref>).</p>
<p>As FAM46B is still expressed in the early time of mesendoderm differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6C</xref>), we analyzed its transcription dynamics in detail during the mesendoderm differentiation from hESCs. We noticed that the mRNA level of <italic>FAM46B</italic> showed approximately 5-, 11- and 15-fold decrease at 24, 48 and 72 h after induced differentiation, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). In contrast, the mRNA levels of <italic>FAM46A</italic>/<italic>C</italic>/<italic>D</italic>, as well as other known canonical and non-canonical PAPs, remained steady. Subsequent qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that the mRNA level of <italic>FAM46B</italic> sharply declines following mesendodermal induction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>). In order to monitor the endogenous FAM46B protein, we knocked-in a 3 × Flag-tag to the 5′ end of <italic>FAM46B</italic> reading frame (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6D</xref>). Western blot analysis indicated that the FAM46B protein level decreased in a time-dependent manner upon mesendodermal induction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F</xref>). We also examined the transcriptional dynamics of <italic>FAM46</italic> family during human somatic cell reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>FAM46B</italic> expression level is gradually increased following pluripotency acquisition, while <italic>FAM46A</italic> is gradually decreased, and <italic>FAM46C/D</italic> are not expressed during the whole reprogramming process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6E</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that FAM46B is specifically expressed in human pluripotent cells and may play crucial roles in human pluripotent cells.</p>

<title>FAM46B is essential for the viability of hESCs</title>
<p>To explore the biological role of FAM46B, we tested its subcellular localization in hESCs. Immunofluorescent staining indicated a ubiquitous distribution of endogenous FAM46B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Subsequent nuclear/cytosolic fractionation assay revealed a cytoplasmic preference of FAM46B residence, though it also appeared in the nuclear fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). Given the differentiation-coupled down-regulation feature of FAM46B, we investigated whether FAM46B is directly associated with pluripotency maintenance of hESCs. Knock-down of <italic>FAM46B</italic> by siRNAs did not significantly alter the mRNA levels of the pluripotency-related genes <italic>OCT4, NANOG and SOX2</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7A and B</xref>). On the other hand, instead of causing cell differentiation, <italic>FAM46B</italic> knock-down severely deteriorated viability of hESCs as soon as within 30 h, as indicated by MTT assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>), and the growth defect was clearly observable under microscope (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7C</xref>). According to the flow cytometry analysis, apoptotic hESCs (characterized by the annexin<sup>+</sup> proportion) were increased after a 24-hour treatment of <italic>FAM46B</italic> siRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7D</xref>). We also tried to knock out <italic>FAM46B</italic> in human embryonic cells using CRISPR/Cas9 system. The surviving hESCs had at a least one chromosome copy intact, while perished hESCs had frame-shift insertions or deletions (data not shown) on <italic>FAM46B</italic> induced by Cas9 for both chromosome copies. These results suggest that FAM46B may not be directly involved in pluripotency maintenance, but is essential for the viability of hESCs.</p>

<p>To understand how FAM46B affects the viability of hESCs, we checked whether FAM46B plays a role in protein synthesis by using the fluorescent non-canonical amino acid labeling (FUNCAT) strategy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). In order to avoid severe cell death, hESCs had to be collected at 24 h after transfection of siRNAs. Newly synthesized proteins were labeled using homopropargylglycine (HPG) and detected via click chemistry. When FAM46B was knocked-down, the amount of newly synthesized proteins in hESCs was somewhat declined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8B</xref>). We measured mRNA half-life of 8 selected genes, which are functionally linked with FAM46 proteins or mediate pluripotency, in <italic>FAM46B</italic> conditional knock-out hESCs. Within 5 h of treatment of actinomycin D, mRNA levels of <italic>Wnt5A</italic>, <italic>NANOG</italic>, <italic>FAM46B</italic>, <italic>RICTOR</italic> and <italic>SKP2</italic> were substantially declined, whereas those of other genes remained relatively steady (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8C</xref>). These data indicate that FAM46B may be involved in maintaining the translation efficiency of at least some genes in hESCs through preventing degradation of their mRNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8G</xref>).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In this study, we have identified FAM46B as a novel type of eukaryotic non-classical PAP. The striking structural similarity with bacterial PAP distinguishes FAM46B from other known eukaryotic PAPs. Consistently, FAM46B also shares similar functional properties with its bacterial relatives but not eukaryotic non-classical PAPs, as proven by our biochemical analysis. First, like bacterial PAPs, FAM46B actively catalyzes polyadenylation without extra partners <italic>in vitro</italic>. For eukaryotic ceGld-2, a partner (ceGld-3) is indispensable for its enzymatic efficiency, as ceGld-3 promotes the stability of ceGld-2 by sheltering a hydrophobic area on its surface, and provides extra interface for binding the RNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). While FAM46B has no prominent hydrophobic area on the surface, and its large NCD contains plenty of potential RNA binding sites, a Gld-3-like partner thus seems unnecessary for FAM46B. Second, although favoring A-rich over U-rich sequence, FAM46B lacks strict discrimination on RNA substrates at least <italic>in vitro</italic>. This is also a feature inherited from bacterial PAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>These bacterial-like features of FAM46B provide valuable clues for explaining the biological role of FAM46B. The early embryos of metazoans are transcriptionally inactive, which entails robust cytoplasmic polyadenylation to stabilize the mRNAs and increase translational efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Except for FAM46B reported in this study, only a couple of eukaryotic cytoplasmic PAP have been identified and characterized, such as Gld-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). While Gld-2 is essential in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Xenopus</italic>, knock-out of this PAP shows no visible phenotype in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). This evidence implies that, other PAPs functionally overlapping Gld-2 are likely to exist in mammals. Given the fact that FAM46B is an active PAP with endogenously cytoplasmic localization and unique and dynamic expression profile in human pre-implantation embryos and hESCs/hiPSCs, it is tempting to speculate that FAM46B is involved in cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNA in the early stage of human embryogenesis. Interestingly, FAM46B and FAM46C have been found to be essential for the meiosis in mammalian oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Re-analysis of single-cell RNA-seq datasets of human germline and embryonic development covering stages from primordial germ cells (PGCs) to hatched blastocyst indicates that the mRNA levels of <italic>FAM46B</italic> and <italic>FAM46C</italic> dramatically increase in PGCs and the zygote stage of early development, till ZGA initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). These studies imply that FAM46B and/or FAM46C may function as early as during gametogenesis. According to our results, FAM46B is most likely involved in the overall translational control of the hESCs without significantly altering the transcriptional profile. Given its potent PAP activity, a reasonable speculation is that FAM46B may counterbalance the deadenylation of mRNAs to maintain the poly(A) tail length of mRNAs at a steady level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), so as to ensure the translational efficiency. Understanding the detailed mechanism on how FAM46B influence translation in hESCs required future studies based on transcriptome-wide characterization of mRNA poly(A) tail-lengths and quantitative proteomics.</p>
<p>The prominent negative correlation between expression level and cell differentiation suggests that FAM46B is not all-time needed during the embryonic development. The mRNA level of FAM46B in <italic>Xenopus</italic> shows high consistency: it grows steadily from two-cell stage until blastula stage and then sharply dives to almost zero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). Thus, it is possible that FAM46B also functions in non-mammals. On the other hand, functions of Gld-2 are mostly described in gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21–23</xref>), and its mRNA level remains unchanged after hESC differentiation. FAM46B and Gld-2 may account for cytoplasmic polyadenylation in different situations of early animal development. This arouses interesting questions: why the animal embryos require a bacterial-like PAP before they run into complexity? To answer this question, future studies are demanded to reveal the exact RNA substrates and putative regulatory factors of FAM46B, for which many possibilities need to be considered. For instance, some non-classical PAPs are found to catalyze the addition of single nucleotide to microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>), or require non-protein partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). In addition, it might be worthwhile to seek the connections between early animal embryos and bacteria in the control of poly(A) tail length. In contrary to eukaryotes, polyadenylation in bacteria usually leads to the degradation of regulatory RNAs and eventually causes translation inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In this context, the observation that hESCs are extraordinarily sensitive to FAM46B depletion is somewhat analogous to the situation in bacteria: even moderate overexpression of PAP I is lethal to <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>).</p>
<p>The crystal structure of FAM46B provides important clues in the future research of FAM46 proteins. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation is suggested to be active in early animal embryos and neuronal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Coincidently, existing evidence of FAM46 proteins reveals its relationship with development and neuronal disorders. It has been reported that FAM46A is expressed in tooth germs and may be involved in the formation of tooth enamel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). Mutations in FAM46A are found responsible for several autosomal recessive disorders in humans, including osteogenesis imperfecta and retinitis pigmentosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62–64</xref>). Overexpression of FAM46D is closely associated with autism spectrum disorder-like behaviors in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). Human FAM46B shows 55%, 55% and 43% sequence identity to human FAM46A, FAM46C and FAM46D, respectively, which implies that these FAM46 proteins would share extensive structural and biochemical similarity to FAM46B. Thus, the feature as bacterial-like PAPs is the key to understand the functional mechanisms of FAM46 proteins in their various biological roles.</p>
