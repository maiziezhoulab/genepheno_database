<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The histone variant H2A.Z is an essential and conserved regulator of eukaryotic gene transcription. However, the exact role of this histone in the transcriptional process remains perplexing. In vertebrates, H2A.Z has two hypervariants, H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2, that have almost identical sequences except for three amino acid residues. Due to such similarity, functional specificity of these hypervariants in neurobiological processes, if any, remain largely unknown. In this study with dissociated rat cortical neurons, we asked if H2A.Z hypervariants have distinct functions in regulating basal and activity-induced gene transcription. Hypervariant-specific RNAi and microarray analyses revealed that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 regulate basal expression of largely nonoverlapping gene sets, including genes that code for several synaptic proteins. In response to neuronal activity, rapid transcription of our model gene <italic>Arc</italic> is impaired by depletion of H2A.Z.2, but not H2A.Z.1. This impairment is partially rescued by codepletion of the H2A.Z chaperone, ANP32E. In contrast, under a different context (after 48 h of tetrodotoxin, TTX), rapid transcription of <italic>Arc</italic> is impaired by depletion of either hypervariant. Such context-dependent roles of H2A.Z hypervariants, as revealed by our multiplexed gene expression assays, are also evident with several other immediate early genes, where regulatory roles of these hypervariants vary from gene to gene under different conditions. Together, our data suggest that H2A.Z hypervariants have context-specific roles that complement each other to mediate activity-induced neuronal gene transcription.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>Epigenetic regulation of activity-induced gene transcription is pivotal in mediating neuronal responses that underlie several transcription-dependent downstream brain processes, yet it remains poorly understood. Thus, understanding roles of such epigenetic processes and their core components, such as variant histone H2A.Z, is necessary to comprehend brain development and function. In vertebrates, H2A.Z has two hypervariants, H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2, which are encoded by different genes and differ by only three amino acids. Despite such similar sequences, we provide evidence suggesting that they regulate nonoverlapping gene cohorts in neurons and play context-specific, nonredundant roles in activity-induced transcription of immediate early genes. Together, our findings represent a substantial departure from the current H2A.Z biology by shifting the focus to independent contributions of H2A.Z hypervariants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Activity-induced gene transcription, an integral component of neural plasticity, is conducted at the chromatin level by enabling the transcription machinery to access and “read-out” DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Greer and Greenberg, 2008</xref>). Several activity-induced neuronal immediate early genes (IEGs) are accessed independent of signal by a transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase II (Pol II) that pauses proximal to the promoter until an activity signal is received (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Saha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Adelman and Lis, 2012</xref>). Activity-induced “turn-on” signals release the paused Pol II, which then efficiently transcribes the gene by running through spools of nucleosomes (productive elongation). Nucleosomes, the fundamental chromatin unit, regulate Pol II elongation by acting as either barriers or facilitators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Owen-Hughes and Gkikopoulos, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Teves et al., 2014</xref>). Such activity-dependent nucleosomal role selection primarily depends on post-translational modifications of the histone tails and nucleosomal remodeling, including turnover of different histone variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Michod et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In mammals, three of the four canonical histones, H2A, H2B, and H3, have diversified into several variant histones with distinct amino acid sequences that can influence transcriptionally relevant nucleosomal properties and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Weber and Henikoff, 2014</xref>). Recently, a few studies have unveiled important roles of histone variants H2A.Z and H3.3 in neuronal gene transcription underlying brain development and function. For example, H2A.Z, which is conserved from yeast to human and has been implicated in both transcriptional activation and repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Soboleva et al., 2014</xref>), plays a role in memory consolidation and cerebellar development in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Zovkic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, H3.3, which differs from canonical H3 histones by only four to five amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Filipescu et al., 2013</xref>), regulates embryonic and adult neuronal gene expression patterns, thereby playing an essential role in plasticity and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Maze et al., 2015</xref>). This example of H3.3 illustrates how very small dissimilarities in sequences of two closely related histone proteins may produce large differences in neuronal gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Maze et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar small differences also exist within the H2A.Z histone class. In vertebrates, H2A.Z has two very closely related paralogs that have been referred to as “hypervariants”: H2A.Z.1 (formerly H2A.Z) and H2A.Z.2 (formerly H2A.V; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Talbert et al., 2012</xref>). Two nonallelic genes, <italic>H2afz</italic> and <italic>H2afv</italic>, which are driven by independent promoters on different chromosomes, encode these H2A.Z hypervariants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Dryhurst et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Matsuda et al., 2010</xref>). H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 differ by only three amino acids, which are located far apart on the polypeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) and are structurally similar to their respective counterpart in that there are no usable difference in their antigenicity (e.g., hydrophobic vs hydrophilic, ring structure vs linear, or large vs small in residue size). Thus, there are currently no antibodies available to distinguish between H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2. Due to this limitation, our understanding of H2A.Z is most likely a portmanteau of both hypervariant functions. Such a composite picture of their function would not be a concern if these hypervariants were functionally redundant and homogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Soboleva et al., 2014</xref>). However, a few structural and functional features suggest the contrary. Recently resolved crystal structures of H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes revealed subtle differences in the H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 L1 loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Horikoshi et al., 2013</xref>), but it remains unknown whether such differences manifest any functional consequences. In H2A.Z.1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, which are embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Faast et al., 2001</xref>), H2A.Z.2 is apparently unable to compensate for the loss of its twin isoform, thereby suggesting a unique role for H2A.Z.1 during early embryonic development. Similar functional inequality of H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 has also been recently reported in melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Vardabasso et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, there remains an untested possibility that these two H2A.Z hypervariants may not be functionally identical, but instead have discrete nonoverlapping roles (functional specificity) in gene transcription. We tested this hypothesis in neurons and report here that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 have independent and context-specific roles in basal and neuronal activity-induced gene transcription.</p>

<p>Several web-based software programs were used to design eight (four each) hypervariant-specific shRNA for RNAi. The shRNA were inserted into pLKO.1-puro (designed by RNAi consortium or TRC; obtained from Addgene) following the protocol on the Addgene website. Self-inactivating HIV lentivirus particles were produced by transfecting 293T cells with the shRNA vector, envelope (pMD2.G; Addgene), and packaging plasmids (psPAX2; Addgene). For construction of exogenous tagged constructs, DNA sequences encoding HA-H2A.Z.1, HA.IS1, HA-ISB, MYC-H2A.Z.2, MYC-IS2, and MYC-ISB were generated each with 5′ EcoRI and 3′ NotI restriction sites, using Life Technologies GeneArt Gene Synthesis “strings.” These EcoRI-NotI DNA fragments were cloned into the System Biosciences lentiviral plasmid CD811A-1, using the corresponding restriction sites on the vector. Subsequently, DNA constructs were characterized by restriction mapping using EcoRI and NotI enzymes (New England Biolabs), and inserted elements were validated by sequencing. These constructs were packaged into lentiviruses as mentioned above.</p>

<title>Dissociated neuronal culture, RNAi, and cell treatment</title>
<p>Cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 18 (E18) Sprague Dawley rats of either sex. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and the University of California Merced animal care committee’s regulations [NIEHS Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval: ASP#01-21; and University of California Merced IACUC approval: ASP#13-0007 and ASP#16-0004]. Dissociated cortical neurons were plated in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 25 μM glutamate (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 mM L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), either B27 (Invitrogen) or NS21, and maintained in a similar medium without the glutamate. NS21 was prepared in the laboratory as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Neurons were routinely used between 10 and 14 d <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV), a stage when synapses have formed and are effective. For infection with recombinant lentiviruses, the viral supernatant was diluted in neuronal media and cells were infected between DIV5 and DIV7 at a multiplicity of infection ranging from 2 to 5 for 4–7 d. To induce gene transcription under resting conditions using synaptic circuits, we cotreated neurons with 50 μM bicuculline (Bic; Sigma-Aldrich) and 75 μM 4-aminopyridine (4AP; Acros Organics; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Papadia et al., 2005</xref>). To induce gene transcription extrasynaptically, we blocked neuronal activity with 1–2 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX; Calbiochem) and activated the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway (via PKC) with 1 μM phorbol ester myristate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>). To induce gene transcription at the intranuclear level, neurons were treated with 100 μM 5, 6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole (DRB; Sigma-Aldrich) alone, or in combination with 250–500 nM triptolide (Trip; Tocris) for 1 h followed by washout with preconditioned media. To induce genes after homeostatic changes, a previously described protocol using prolonged treatment of TTX for 48 h followed by its washout was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Saha et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s3C">
<title>Electrophysiological recordings</title>
<p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed on dissociated cortical neurons coexpressing GFP and shRNA by an experimenter blinded to the identity of the treatment. Miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were assessed for frequency and amplitude as detailed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Saha et al., 2011</xref>). For visualization of infected neurons using GFP coexpression, the shRNA component was subcloned from the pLKO.1 to the pLKO.3G backbone as detailed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Saha et al., 2011</xref>). To ensure adequate knockdown, PCR was performed in sister neuronal cultures with the same batch of viruses to confirm their efficacy.</p>

<sec id="s3D">
<title>RNA extraction and gene transcription quantification</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated from dissociated neurons using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN) with in-column DNase (QIAGEN) digestion. cDNA was synthesized using MuLV reverse transcriptase (Promega), random primers (Promega), oligo dTs (Promega), and RNase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific). qPCR was performed using iTaq Universal Sybr Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and the Bio-Rad CFX Connect real-time PCR Detection System. Pre-mRNA was estimated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Saha, et al., 2011</xref>).

<title>Expression microarray and data analysis</title>
<p>Gene expression analysis was performed using RNA obtained from four biological replicates. The Agilent Whole Rat Genome 4x44 multiplex format oligo arrays (014879, Agilent Technologies) were used following the Agilent 1-color microarray-based gene expression analysis protocol. Using 500 ng of total RNA, Cy3-labeled cRNA was produced according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For each sample 1.65 μg of Cy3-labeled cRNAs were fragmented and hybridized for 17 h in a rotating hybridization oven. Slides were washed and then scanned with an Agilent Scanner. Data were obtained using the Agilent Feature Extraction software (v9.5), using the 1-color defaults for all parameters. The Agilent Feature Extraction Software performed error modeling, adjusting for additive and multiplicative noise. Then, “gProcessedSignal” values were extracted for each probe and sample and used as the baseline expression measurements and quantile normalization was performed to normalize the samples. Probe-based expression data were collapsed down to a single measurement per gene by taking the median of all probes associated with each gene. Next, the average expression was calculated across all samples for each gene and the bottom 10% of genes with the lowest average expression was removed. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by first performing a two-sample Student’s <italic>t</italic> test for each gene followed by Benjamini Hochberg correction. Genes were defined as differentially expressed if they had <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 and a fold change of 1.25 or greater. For the heat map depicting expression of these DEGs, the expression values were normalized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, and hierarchical clustering of these genes was performed. GO terms that were enriched for these DEGs were identified using the online tool DAVID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://david.ncifcrf.gov">http://david.ncifcrf.gov</ext-link>/). GEO accession number for these datasets is GSE96886.</p>

<title>Sample preparation for electrophoresis</title>
<p>Neurons were lysed in ice-cold 1× RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1% NP-40) and supplemented with 1:100 protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Lysed neurons were sheared by sonication, cell debris pelleted at 15000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C, and the clarified supernatant transferred to a prechilled 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube. Total cell extracts were denatured at 95°C for 5 min, using either home-made 5× Laemmli buffer, BOLT 4× Sample buffer (Life Technologies) and BOLT 10× reducing agent (Life Technologies), 2×-, or 4× Laemmli sample buffer (both from Bio-Rad). To obtain synaptic fractions, cell pellets were treated with 1 ml ice-cold Syn-PER reagent (Thermo Scientific catalogue number 87793) and supplemented with 1:100 protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Neurons were incubated on ice for 10 min, gently triturated 10 times, centrifuged at 1200 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C, and supernatant was transferred to ice-cold microcentrifuge tubes, then recentrifuged at 15,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4°C. The pellet was then resuspended in 20 µl 2× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad). Acid-extracted histone fractions were prepared using a protocol described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Shechter et al., 2007</xref>).

<p>Neurons were fixed with formaldehyde for 5–10 min, lysed in the sonication buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5% SDS, and inhibitors for proteases and phosphatases), and then sonicated for sixteen cycles (bursts and intervals of 30 s each) with the Bioruptor (Diagenode) to obtain 200- to 1000-bp genomic DNA fragments. A fraction of the sonicated sample was then immunoprecipitated overnight at 4°C in the 1× IP buffer with 2- to 5-μg antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes were immunoprecipitated with Pierce Protein A/G Magnetic Beads, washed once with low salt buffer, three times with high salt buffer, once with LiCl buffer, and once with Tris-EDTA buffer.

<p>Rat brains were harvested at E18 and individually embedded in 22 × 22 mm cryomolds using optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) and flash frozen in 2-methylbutane, which was cooled to −20°C on a dry ice/ethanol slurry. Brains were sectioned on a Leica cryostat at 20 μm and processed for single-molecule FISH according to the RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex kit instructions (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). The following probes were used with the RNAscope fluorescent multiplex reagent kit: Rn-H2afv (20 ZZ probes targeting 414–1815 of NM_001106019.1; part# 495451), Rn-Hz1fz-C2 (13 ZZ probes targeting 12–792 of NM_022674.1; part# 495441-C2), 3-plex Positive Control Probe, rat (part# 320891), and 3-plex Negative Control Probe (part# 320871). Images were acquired on a Zeiss 880 confocal microscope using a 40× oil-immersion lens. The image acquisition parameters were set using 3-plex negative controls (cDNA probes against bacterial RNAs not present in rat tissue) in each of the three channels (fluorescein isothiocyanate, CY3 and CY5) so that any signal above the level of background was acquired. At least three 212 × 212 μm <italic>z</italic>-stack images (1-μm steps) of somatosensory cortex were acquired per rat. Images were processed and analyzed using FIJI software (NIH v.2).

<p>NanoString probes were designed for indicated pre-mRNAs by NanoString technologies and assays were performed following the manufacturer’s protocol. Data were processed in R (version 3.3.2), using the limma package (version 3.30.8) from Bioconductor (version 3.4). Data were log2 transformed, then batch-adjusted within each experiment and time point to account for sample processing errors. The pre-mRNA measurements were normalized using pre-mRNA housekeeper genes. Sample quality and processing were reviewed and confirmed using MA-plots and heat maps at each step. Pairwise comparisons were performed using the limma-voom methodology as previously described. Statistical hits were defined by requiring one sample group mean log2 signal at least 2, absolute fold change above 1.5, and Benjamini Hochberg adjusted <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01. Heat maps were generated using group mean log2 normalized abundances, centered to the indicated control group mean. Violin plots were generated using the same values, centered to the treated scrambled for the respective group of treatments. Gene class changes per experiment and time point were tested using group mean values in a nonparametric, paired Wilcoxon test, with gene as the pairing factor, to test for coordinated gene changes between treated shH2A.Z.1 or treated shH2A.Z.2 and the corresponding treated scrambled of the same experiment time point.</p>

<title>H2A.Z hypervariants and strategy to target them independently</title>
<p>First, we asked if both H2A.Z isoforms, H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), are expressed in the brain. Using the smFISH approach and specific probes that bind to <italic>H2afz</italic> or <italic>H2afv</italic>, we detected both H2A.Z isoforms in the E18 rat brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). While there were significantly more <italic>H2afz</italic> particles compared to <italic>H2afv</italic>, we observed that the majority of DAPI-positive cells expressed both RNAs. Further studies were performed in dissociated cells obtained from E18 rat brains.</p>
<p>Next, we used RNAi to target these hypervariants independently. Both genes have been duplicated during evolution and have multiple mammalian “gene copies” that have variable noncoding regions despite having the same coding region. For example, in rat, when compared to the annotated <italic>H2afz</italic> on chromosome 2, an unnamed “pseudogene” on chromosome 16 (rat rn6 location: 71438461-71439260) codes for an mRNA that retains the <italic>H2afz</italic> coding sequence in totality amid dissimilar noncoding regions. Therefore, to ensure knockdown of these probable pseudogene mRNAs as well, the coding region was targeted for RNAi. Initially, we designed four shRNA against each of the <italic>H2afz</italic> and <italic>H2afv</italic> mRNA coding regions and evaluated their knockdown efficacy by qPCR. Only one of these four shRNA pairs efficiently knocked down each hypervariant independently; others knocked down both hypervariants to some degree. Interestingly, these efficient shRNAs against <italic>H2afz</italic> (sh<italic>H2afz</italic>) and <italic>H2afv</italic> (sh<italic>H2afv</italic>) targeted the same region on the respective mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). These 24-bp target regions on <italic>H2afz</italic> and <italic>H2afv</italic> mRNAs differ by only 5 bp. Because of such scant difference, we tested whether sh<italic>H2afz</italic> and sh<italic>H2afv</italic> were indeed specific for their respective hypervariant targets.</p>
<p>Lentivirus-mediated delivery of sh<italic>H2afz</italic> to dissociated rat cortical neurons significantly knocked down <italic>H2afz</italic>, but not <italic>H2afv</italic>, mRNA at all tested times after viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). Similarly, <italic>H2afv</italic>, but not <italic>H2afz</italic>, mRNA was knocked down by sh<italic>H2afv</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). We also noted that loss of one hypervariant was not compensated by significantly enhanced expression of the other hypervariant. Because efficient knockdown was noted between days 4 and 7 after infection, we decided to use this timeline for the rest of our assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>). At the protein level, as detected by a commercial anti-H2A.Z antibody that does not discriminate between hypervariants, infection with sh<italic>H2afz</italic> or sh<italic>H2afv</italic> viruses partially depleted endogenous H2A.Z levels without affecting the expression of other histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>). Although we were unable to completely abolish H2A.Z signal on infection with both sh<italic>H2afz</italic> and sh<italic>H2afv</italic> viruses, H2A.Z protein depletion was more pronounced on coinfection. We suspect that the protein remaining after coinfection is nucleosomal H2A.Z protected in the heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic>,<italic>F</italic></xref>). The cumulative effect of such coinfection suggests that neurons express both hypervariants, and that they are sensitive to their respective shRNA only.</p>
<p>To test the above stated possibility further, we coexpressed sh<italic>H2afz</italic> or sh<italic>H2afv</italic> with either tagged HA-H2A.Z.1 or tagged Myc-H2A.Z.2. Protein expression of HA-H2A.Z.1 was attenuated by sh<italic>H2afz</italic>, but not sh<italic>H2afv</italic>. Similarly, MYC-H2A.Z.2 protein expression was sensitive to sh<italic>H2afv</italic>, but not sh<italic>H2afz</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>G</italic>,<italic>H</italic></xref>, left panels). To test sh<italic>H2afz</italic> and sh<italic>H2afv</italic> specificity even further, we exchanged their 24-bp target sequence in our exogenous constructs with the expectation that shRNA sensitivity of these constructs will also be reversed. As expected, HA-H2A.Z.1-IS, the <italic>H2afz</italic> mRNA with the sh<italic>H2afv</italic> 24-bp target sequence, is sensitive to sh<italic>H2afv</italic>, but not sh<italic>H2afz</italic>. Similarly, Myc-H2A.Z.2-IS is sensitive to sh<italic>H2afz</italic>, but not <italic>shH2afv</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>G</italic>,<italic>H</italic></xref>, right panels). Taken together, we show that sh<italic>H2afz</italic> and sh<italic>H2afv</italic> are specific for <italic>H2afz</italic> and <italic>H2afv</italic> mRNAs respectively, and that we can efficiently knockdown each targeted hypervariant independently.</p>

<title>H2A.Z hypervariant depletion alters expression of nonoverlapping sets of genes</title>
<p>To examine the impact of individual H2A.Z hypervariant knockdown on basal level of neuronal gene transcription, we performed a genome-wide microarray analysis of RNA obtained from dissociated cortical neurons depleted of H2A.Z.1 or H2A.Z.2. Gene expression levels in these samples were compared to samples from neurons treated with a scrambled shRNA (referred to as control neurons hereafter). The degree of change in the mRNA levels for every gene, whose transcription was altered due to H2A.Z.1 or H2A.Z.2 deficiency (&gt;1.25-fold), is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> as a heat map. A total of 338 genes were differentially expressed due to depletion of H2A.Z.1 (154 genes were upregulated and 184 were downregulated), while H2A.Z.2 depletion altered expression of 271 genes (94 genes were upregulated and 177 were downregulated). Only 24 genes were sensitive to depletion of either H2A.Z isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic>,<italic>C</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). Such relative dearth of common genes affected by depletion of either hypervariant suggests that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 regulate, directly or indirectly, independent gene cohorts. Functional gene ontology analysis of H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 target genes revealed that targets of the former are enriched for ionotropic postsynaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic></xref>). Three of the top 10 molecular GO pathways belonged to this category. This finding contrasts with H2A.Z.2 target genes, where none of the hits were related to synaptic function. Interestingly, knockdown of H2A.Z.1, but not H2A.Z.2, led to altered expression of several candidate genes linked to psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia (<italic>Neurexin1</italic>, <italic>Shank3</italic>, <italic>CaMK2G</italic>, <italic>Vamp7</italic>, <italic>Gsk3b</italic>, <italic>Tuba8</italic>, <italic>Grm8</italic>, etc.).</p>

<title>H2A.Z hypervariant depletion changes synaptic protein expression</title>
<p>Because glutamatergic synaptic function was indicated as a hypervariant-specific GO term in the above analysis, and to test whether H2A.Z hypervariant depletions have any impact on the physiologic health of neurons, we performed electrophysiological analyses of membrane and excitatory synaptic properties. Resting membrane potentials and input resistances were not significantly different between control and H2A.Z.1- or H2A.Z.2-depleted neurons. Presynaptic function and/or synaptic density, as inferred by mEPSC frequency, was also not significantly different between conditions (mEPSC frequency per 3 s for control, H2A.Z.1-, and H2A.Z.2-depleted neurons were 0.31 ± 0.31, 0.14 ± 0.06, and 0.13 ± 0.07, respectively). However, mEPSC amplitude, typically indicative of postsynaptic function, was significantly diminished in neurons depleted of either H2A.Z hypervariant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic>,<italic>B</italic></xref>). To better understand mechanisms of such mEPSC amplitude reduction in H2A.Z hypervariant-depleted neurons, we assessed mRNA and protein levels of several postsynaptic molecules, including many from our microarray screen. A few interesting cases representing diverse effects of hypervariant depletion are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3<italic>C</italic>,<italic>D</italic></xref>.</p>

<p>A contrasting effect of hypervariant depletion was noted in two instances: postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and SHANK3. PSD-95 is the anchoring protein encoded by <italic>Dlg4</italic> and found exclusively in the postsynaptic density, while SHANK3 is another member of the postsynaptic density that is encoded by the high-confidence autism candidate gene <italic>Shank3</italic>. These two gene products were strongly reduced in neurons depleted of H2A.Z.1, but not H2A.Z.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>). Compared to control, PSD-95 band intensities were 48.58 ± 12.4%, 102.34 ± 26.72%, and 65.95 ± 17.42% in H2A.Z.1, H2A.Z.2, and both KD, respectively (<italic>N</italic> = 3). Such an effect of H2A.Z.1 KD on PSD-95 must be indirect (not regulated at the gene transcription level), as <italic>Dlg4</italic> mRNA levels remained unchanged in H2A.Z.1-depleted neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). For SHANK3, compared to control, band intensities were 20.25 ± 7.6%, 47.74 ± 20.35%, and 15.34 ± 12.6% in H2A.Z.1, H2A.Z.2, and both KD, respectively (<italic>N</italic> = 3). However, the effect on SHANK3 is interesting, as <italic>Shank3</italic> mRNA levels are upregulated specifically in response to H2A.Z.1 depletion, perhaps as a response to cellular feedback pathways triggered by loss of the protein.</p>
<p>We also tested levels of the ligand-gated ion channel GluA2 (AMPA receptor; coded by <italic>Gria2</italic>, also called GluR2) and postsynaptic density protein HOMER1 (coded by <italic>Homer1</italic>) after H2A.Z hypervariant depletion. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3<italic>D</italic></xref>, we observe no notable difference in signal of either GluA2 or HOMER1B/C after H2A.Z.1 or H2A.Z.2 knockdown. However, the activity-induced short <italic>Homer1a</italic> mRNA isoform was downregulated by H2A.Z.1 loss and upregulated by H2A.Z.2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). Further studies are required to confirm if such effects are direct influences of H2A.Z hypervariants on <italic>Homer1a</italic> transcription.</p>
<p>Together, we find that depletion of both H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 leads to decreased amplitude of mEPSCs, which may be explained by altered expression of postsynaptic proteins. The effects of H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 knockdown on the tested synaptic proteins, however, are apparently mediated by transcription-independent means in most cases given the lack of change at the pre-mRNA level.</p>

<title>H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 depletion differentially impact <italic>Arc/Arg3.1</italic> transcription</title>
<p>To study direct roles of H2A.Z hypervariants on transcriptional regulation of a model gene, we chose to study the IEG <italic>Arc/Arg3.1</italic> (referred to as <italic>Arc</italic> from here on), which responds rapidly to neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Guzowski et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Saha et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Arc</italic> was chosen for several reasons: (1) it is a neuron-specific IEG, which has been extensively studied previously by us and others, (2) its promoter and transcriptional start site (TSS) regions are enriched with H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes (our unpublished observations), and (3) it is one of the genes recently shown to be regulated by H2A.Z in cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Zovkic et al., 2014</xref>). Neuronal activity was stimulated in dissociated neurons by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist (Bic)-induced disinhibition and K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker (4AP)-induced increased burst frequency (Bic + 4AP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Papadia et al., 2005</xref>). Using the Bic + 4AP protocol, we induced gene transcription and evaluated <italic>Arc</italic> mRNA abundance at 15 min after treatment. Basal and induced <italic>Arc</italic> mRNA levels were unaffected by H2A.Z.1 depletion but were significantly diminished in H2A.Z.2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p>

<p>Because mRNA abundance is not necessarily a reflection of transcription per se but rather the net result of both synthesis and decay rates, we next evaluated the direct <italic>Arc</italic> transcription product: its pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Wu and Brewer, 2012</xref>). We detected no significant differences in the basal level of <italic>Arc</italic> pre-mRNA with H2A.Z hypervariant depletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>, 0-min time point). After Bic + 4AP treatment, <italic>Arc</italic> pre-mRNA levels increased significantly within 15 min and continued to increase with time in control neurons. However, in agreement with the mRNA data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>), the pre-mRNA response in H2A.Z.2-depleted neurons was attenuated at the early time point (15 min) and was also significantly reduced at later points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast, H2A.Z.1 depletion had no effect on <italic>Arc</italic> pre-mRNA levels at 15 min. However, at later time points, H2A.Z.1-depleted neurons had significantly less <italic>Arc</italic> pre-mRNA than in control neurons and yet had significantly more than in neurons depleted of H2A.Z.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). These results suggest that although the loss of H2A.Z.1 impaired <italic>Arc</italic> transcription significantly at later time points, loss of H2A.Z.2 had a much stronger effect at all time points. At the protein level, hypervariant-specific effects on activity-induced ARC abundance were generally reflective of <italic>Arc</italic> pre-mRNA expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>). When both hypervariants were depleted, pre-mRNA results were not significantly greater than H2A.Z.2 depletion alone, and were in fact intermediate between the two hypervariants. While trying to knockdown both H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2, we had to titer our viral infection and infect with less of each virus kind to avoid causing viral overload-induced cell death. Therefore, less knockdown was achieved in the dual KD cells compared to their single KD counterparts. Such reduced knockdown may explain the intermediate effect of knocking down both H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 on <italic>Arc</italic> transcription.</p>
<p>Because some synaptic alterations were noted due to H2A.Z hypervariant depletion and because Bic + 4AP treatment is a synapse-dependent activity induction protocol, we next tried to induce <italic>Arc</italic> nonsynaptically by jump-starting the MAPK pathway, otherwise employed by activity-induced gene transcription signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Rosen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Wiegert and Bading, 2011</xref>). The MAPK pathway was extrasynaptically activated via PKC using PMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>) in the presence of TTX to prevent any extracellular input via neuronal activity, and this treatment induced rapid transcription of <italic>Arc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>). When H2A.Z hypervariant-depleted neurons were stimulated using this protocol, the outcome was similar to what was seen with the Bic + 4AP protocol, both at the pre-mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic>,<italic>E</italic></xref>). These observations suggest that consequences of H2A.Z hypervariant depletion on activity-induced <italic>Arc</italic> transcription are most likely not limited to effects of changing synaptic components. Supporting this assertion is the observation that H2A.Z hypervariant depletion had no effect on activity-induced activation of the MAPK pathway as indicated by phospho-ERK1/2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic>,<italic>E</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>To further test the specificity of the H2A.Z.2 depletion-induced phenotype, we attempted to rescue rapid <italic>Arc</italic> induction by combining shRNA-mediated knockdown with coexpression of shRNA-insensitive H2A.Z.2 (Myc-H2A.Z.2-IS). Several such experimental designs were unsuccessful, likely due to lack of regulatory post-translational modifications on exogenous constructs in the absence of endogenous proteins and/or perturbation of a critical balance of endogenous levels of these hypervariants and their chaperones. The latter possibility is based on a recent study where it was demonstrated that phenotype loss due to depletion of ANP32E, an H2A.Z chaperone that removes nucleosomal H2A.Z, could be rescued by codepletion of ANP32E and H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Alatwi and Downs, 2015</xref>). Accordingly, we codepleted ANP32E (92.0 ± 0.1% knockdown on day 5 after infection) with H2A.Z.2 and observed a partial rescue of rapid <italic>Arc</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 4<italic>F</italic></xref>). Taken together, our data show nonredundant roles of H2A.Z hypervariants in the regulation of <italic>Arc</italic> transcription and hint at the importance of a fine balance between histones and their chaperones in mediating such responses.</p>

<title>H2A.Z hypervariants are present near the <italic>Arc</italic> TSS and regulate its transcription</title>
<p>H2A.Z is enriched near <italic>Arc</italic> TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Zovkic et al., 2014</xref>). To identify specific hypervariant(s) in this enrichment, we exogenously expressed distinctly tagged hypervariants (HA-H2A.Z.1 and MYC-H2A.Z.2) in neurons and probed for their expression using antibodies against the HA- or MYC-epitope tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Usually, protein overexpression is concerning, because it may cause, among other things, artifacts that include ectopic subcellular localizations and inaccurate protein complex formations. Despite such limitations, we reasoned that increased dosage of tagged-H2A.Z hypervariants in the free-floating nucleoplasmic pool may not have any negative consequences as H2A.Z incorporation into its functionally relevant complex (nucleosomes) is tightly regulated by chaperone-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Billon and Cote, 2013</xref>), and so this overexpression will not necessarily have unwanted nucleosomal incorporation of H2A.Z despite its artificial abundance.</p>

<p>To verify nucleosomal incorporation of tagged-H2A.Z hypervariants, we performed co-IP assays. These assays, with anti-IgG, anti-H2A.Z, anti-HA and anti-MYC from nuclear lysates, or anti-HA and anti-MYC from mono-nucleosome preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic>–<italic>D</italic></xref>), detected stable association of both hypervariants with other nucleosomal histones H2B, H2A, H3 and H4 suggesting that tagged-H2A.Z molecules are incorporated into nucleosomes. Interestingly, (1) HA and MYC IPs probed for their respective hypervariants revealed very little association between HA-H2A.Z.1 and MYC-H2A.Z.2, suggesting that very few H2A.Z nucleosomes contain both hypervariants; and (2) we detected a unique band in H2B, presumably representing an unidentified post-translationally modified state of H2B, in the precipitate with MYC-H2A.Z.2, but not HA-H2A.Z.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic>,<italic>D</italic></xref>). These data suggest that certain H2A.Z.2-containing nucleosomes may have unique post-translational signatures and possibly unique functions.</p>
<p>To confirm that functional incorporation of tagged-H2A.Z molecules into the <italic>Arc</italic> promoter region did not interfere with transcriptional activity, we expressed HA-H2A.Z.1 and MYC-H2A.Z.2 in mature neurons and induced <italic>Arc</italic> transcription with PMA + TTX.

<p>Next, we performed ChIP assays to detect H2A.Z and its hypervariants near the <italic>Arc</italic> TSS. We tested several anti-H2A.Z antibodies and found the ChIP grade antibody from Millipore to be most efficient. Using this antibody, we detected significant enrichment of H2A.Z near the <italic>Arc</italic> TSS (primer pair 1, 2, and 3) compared to <italic>Arc</italic> gene body (primer 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). Primer pairs 1 and 3 roughly represent the −1 and +2 (often referred to as +1) nucleosomes across the <italic>Arc</italic> TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Kim et al., 2010</xref>), while primer pair 2 denotes a region across the TSS, which instead of being nucleosome-free, houses a nucleosome (+1) in <italic>Arc</italic> (see H3K4.me data in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Like total H2A.Z, both MYC-H2A.Z.2 and HA-H2A.Z.1 were also enriched near the TSS compared to the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). Although strong signals were obtained near the TSS with both anti-HA and anti-MYC ChIP compared to empty vector controls, these signals cannot be directly compared as their apparent difference is likely to be due to dissimilarity in antibody efficiency. For example, this trend is reversed when similar ChIP assays were performed after overexpressing hypervariants with swapped tags (data not shown). Taken together, we conclude that both H2A.Z hypervariants are present near the <italic>Arc</italic> TSS.</p>
<p>To distinguish the potentially different roles of H2A.Z hypervariants in activity-induced <italic>Arc</italic> transcription at the gene level, we treated neurons with Bic + 4AP for various time periods and performed ChIP with anti-H2A.Z, anti-MYC, anti-HA, and anti-acetylated H2A.Z (Ac-H2A.Z) antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>). Acetylation of H2A.Z is an important epigenetic modification associated with active or primed promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Soboleva et al., 2014</xref>). On Bic + 4AP treatment, H3-normalized total H2A.Z levels were unchanged at any of the three nucleosomes across the <italic>Arc</italic> TSS at all time points tested (see Discussion). However, ChIP signal for Ac-H2A.Z drops significantly at all three nucleosomes at 15 min after treatment and remains reduced in the +1 and +2 nucleosomes after 30 min. Although total level of H2A.Z remained unchanged, we detected a significant drop of H2A.Z-normalized MYC-H2A.Z.2 and HA-H2A.Z.1 at the +2 nucleosome 15 and 30 min after treatment, suggesting ongoing activity-induced nucleosomal turnover of H2A.Z (nucleosomal remodeling). Interestingly, at the +1 nucleosome, only MYC-H2A.Z.2 levels dropped significantly at 15 min after treatment, indicating a possible H2A.Z.2-specific role for this nucleosome at this early time point. This inference is corroborated by our data in that the most severe effect on <italic>Arc</italic> induction was found after the depletion of H2A.Z.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>B–E</italic></xref>).</p>

<sec id="s4F">
<title>H2A.Z.2 is required for RNA Pol II pausing near the <italic>Arc</italic> TSS</title>
<p>To study the underlying mechanism of H2A.Z.2’s role in rapid <italic>Arc</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), we tested the effect of its knockdown on histone acetylation and promoter proximal RNA Pol II pausing based on recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Saha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Vardabasso et al., 2015</xref>).

We observed no such effect of H2A.Z.2 depletion on H3 or H4 acetylation in neurons (data not shown). This effect is presumably a cell-type-specific phenomenon relevant to dividing cells. Instead, we noted that H2A.Z.2 depletion led to a decrease in Ac-H2A.Z levels globally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>) and near the <italic>Arc</italic> TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic>,<italic>C</italic></xref>). Note that the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7<italic>C</italic></xref> are normalized by total H2A.Z, the level of which remained unaltered after hypervariant knockdown. The effect was not mimicked by H2A.Z.1 depletion. This suggests that H2A.Z.2 depletion results in selective loss of acetylation, not total H2A.Z, near the TSS.</p>

<p>Presence of TSS proximal H2A.Z highly correlates with another chief component of rapid IEG transcription, RNA Pol II pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Day et al., 2016</xref>). We have previously shown that RNA Pol II is loaded and paused near TSS of <italic>Arc</italic> and other rapidly induced IEGs, and underlies the ability of these genes to respond to activity within a few minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Saha et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we tested whether there is a relation between Pol II pausing and H2A.Z hypervariants at the <italic>Arc</italic> TSS. Using ChIP with an antibody against RPB1 (N-terminus), the largest Pol II subunit, we found that RNA Pol II pausing at the <italic>Arc</italic> TSS is diminished significantly in neurons depleted of H2A.Z.2, but not H2A.Z.1. While it is unlikely that our anti-RPB1 antibody precipitates nonspecific proteins or is less efficient after hypervariant depletion, we sought to corroborate our findings with another antibody to further ensure that H2A.Z.2 depletion was affecting paused Pol II. We performed ChIP with an antibody specific to RPB1 phosphorylated at serine 5 (pSer5) residue of C-terminal domain heptad repeats. pSer5-RPB1 represents the pool of RPB1 that is transcriptionally engaged, but has not entered productive elongation (paused). Our data indicate that actively engaged Pol II at the +1 nucleosome of <italic>Arc</italic> is significantly reduced by the loss of H2A.Z.2, but not H2A.Z.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7<italic>E</italic></xref>). This hypervariant-specific loss of Pol II pausing provides an explanation for our observations at 15-min post-Bic + 4AP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic>,<italic>C</italic></xref>), where <italic>Arc</italic> pre-mRNA levels were minimal in H2A.Z.2-, but not in H2A.Z.1-, depleted neurons.</p>

<title>H2A.Z.1 plays context-dependent roles in <italic>Arc</italic> transcription</title>
<p>To determine a potential role for H2A.Z.1 in <italic>Arc</italic> transcription, we hypothesized that it may facilitate Pol II recruitment or elongation during active transcription. To test these possibilities, we induced <italic>Arc</italic> transcription using the DRB washout protocol with or without Trip. DRB is a nucleoside analog that inhibits mammalian transcription by interfering with the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor complex that enables RNA Pol II pausing in the presence of negative elongation factor (NELF), and then facilitates productive elongation once NELF falls off in response to external signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Kwak and Lis, 2013</xref>). Because DRB can be washed out, DRB washout assays have been used to achieve rapid and synchronized transcription elongation without additional extranuclear signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). When control neurons were subjected to this assay, we observed a rapid and robust <italic>Arc</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic></xref>). DRB washout resulted in significant upregulation of <italic>Arc</italic> pre-mRNA levels within three minutes, which then continued to increase with time to reach &gt;100-fold at 15 min. Depletion of H2A.Z.2 resulted in, as we saw with Bic + 4AP and TTX + PMA assays, an attenuated response at the early time point that then partially recovered at later time points while remaining significantly less than the normal response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic></xref>). In contrast, depletion of H2A.Z.1 had no effect on DRB washout-triggered robust <italic>Arc</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic></xref>), indicating that H2A.Z.1 is likely not involved in the productive elongation phase.</p>

<p>Next, to test for any role of H2A.Z in RNA Pol II recruitment, a phenomenon that sustains robust responses by providing the gene promoter with a chain of Pol II complexes, we washed out DRB in the presence of Trip, a diterpene triepoxide isolated from natural sources. Trip inhibits Pol II recruitment to promoters by inhibiting TFIIH, the pre-initiation complex component that mediates Pol II binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Titov et al., 2011</xref>). When DRB washout was performed in the presence of a low concentration of Trip, <italic>Arc</italic> transcription was significantly reduced at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic></xref>) suggesting that the slightest interference with Pol II recruitment compromises the robustness of the response. Had H2A.Z.1 played a role in Pol II recruitment, its depletion would have had an effect comparable to washout with Trip in control cells. However, that does not seem to be the case as the <italic>Arc</italic> response is significantly different between these two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic>, </xref>compare broken black line with green line). Moreover, control and H2A.Z.1-depleted neurons responded similarly to induction in the presence of Trip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic>, </xref>compare broken black and green lines), suggesting that H2A.Z.1 is unlikely to be required for Pol II recruitment.</p>
<p>To test the roles of H2A.Z hypervariants in another neurobiological context, we next performed the TTX washout assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Rao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Saha et al., 2011</xref>). This assay involves treating neurons with TTX for 48 h to induce homeostatic synaptic changes, followed by TTX washout to trigger rapid and robust network activity resulting in <italic>Arc</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8<italic>B</italic></xref>). Consistent with other induction assays so far, H2A.Z.2 depletion had an attenuating effect on early transcriptional response, followed by partial recovery at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8<italic>B</italic></xref>). Surprisingly, depletion of H2A.Z.1 significantly reduced the <italic>Arc</italic> response throughout, even the early time points. This is in contrast with the insensitivity of the <italic>Arc</italic> response at early time points in all induction assays, including 15-min postinduction with Bic + 4AP under resting (control) conditions. Together, our data suggest that H2A.Z.1 exerts context-dependent effects on activity-induced <italic>Arc</italic> transcription.</p>

<title>Gene- and context-specific roles of H2A.Z hypervariants in rapid IEG transcription</title>
<p>In a previous study, we identified two groups of IEGs classified based on the presence or absence of paused Pol II near the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Saha et al., 2011</xref>). We refer to these two groups as rapid IEGs (genes with paused Pol II) and delayed IEGs (genes without paused Pol II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Saha and Dudek, 2013</xref>). Because H2A.Z.2 likely regulates <italic>Arc</italic> transcription via RNA Pol II pausing, we next asked if the roles played by these hypervariants are universal across other rapid IEGs. Several rapid IEGs, identified in our previous screen, were then studied under two neurobiological contexts: (1) activity induced in previously untreated neurons (Bic + 4AP assays); and (2) activity induced after homeostatic changes (TTX washout assays). Responses of a few IEGs in control and H2A.Z hypervariant-depleted neurons are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, and salient inferences drawn from these data are noted in the following paragraph.</p>

<p>All IEGs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref> respond to activity under both normal and homeostatic conditions. With some genes, such responses are more robust at early time points after 48 h of TTX treatment (<italic>Npas4</italic>, <italic>cFos</italic>, <italic>Cyr61</italic>, etc.). In general though, most rapid IEGs maintained similar temporal dynamics of expression in both conditions; <italic>Btg2</italic> was an exception in that its response peaked at different times under different conditions. In most of these instances, depletion of either H2A.Z.1 or H2A.Z.2 had either no effect or reduced gene transcription. <italic>Fbxo33</italic> was an exception to this observation, with H2A.Z.1 depletion resulting in a significantly stronger transcriptional response at the early time point in the Bic + 4AP condition only. Several genes (<italic>Cyr61</italic>, <italic>Btg2</italic>, and <italic>Dusp1</italic>) resembled <italic>Arc</italic> in that H2A.Z.2 depletion caused the most severe reductions. In contrast to <italic>Arc</italic> and these genes, H2A.Z.1 or H2A.Z.2 knockdown exerted statistically similar effect on several rapid IEGs (<italic>Npas4</italic>, <italic>cFos</italic>, <italic>Nr4a3</italic>, etc.) under both contexts. Interestingly, we noticed that H2A.Z hypervariant depletions induced different outcomes under different contexts in a few cases. For example, H2A.Z.2 depletion did not alter <italic>Btg2</italic> and <italic>Dusp1</italic> responses significantly at the early time point under normal conditions, but impaired them at the same time point after 48 h of TTX. Interestingly, these two genes are insensitive to H2A.Z.1 depletion for both contexts at all tested time points. Collectively, our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref> suggest that H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 do not have generalized roles in rapid IEG transcription; instead, they play gene-specific roles, which may vary further under different neurobiological contexts.</p>
<p>To further investigate the role of H2A.Z hypervariants in IEG transcription, we conducted NanoString analyses, a multiplexed gene expression analysis system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Geiss et al., 2008</xref>), on control and hypervariant-depleted cells under the different neurobiological contexts described above using all IEGs identified in our previous screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Saha et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10<italic>A</italic>,<italic>B</italic></xref> shows the results for rapid IEGs and non-IEGs (control genes) displayed as heat maps. Notably, results of the NanoString analyses were consistent with our initial qPCR analyses of rapid IEGs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>. Although there appeared to be gene-specific regulation due to loss of H2A.Z.1 and/or H2A.Z.2, overall comparison of all rapid IEGs tested in control neurons to those tested in hypervariant-depleted neurons suggests that loss of either hypervariant generally resulted in diminished transcription of rapid IEGs at each time point under both neurobiological contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10<italic>C</italic>,<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p>

<title>Gene- and context-specific roles of H2A.Z hypervariants in transcription of delayed IEGs</title>
<p>Because we saw gene-to-gene variation in H2A.Z hypervariant regulation of rapid IEG transcription, we asked if these hypervariants might also be involved in regulating transcription of delayed IEGs. Based on the lack of a role for paused Pol II in the delayed IEG transcription, we expected to find no effect of hypervariant depletion. However, we found a context-dependent regulation of delayed IEGs, and some trends are noted along the following lines: at 60-min postinduction, depletion of H2A.Z.1 appears to result in downregulation of <italic>Cox2</italic>, <italic>Klf4</italic>, and <italic>Nur77</italic> with Bic + 4AP induction, yet results in upregulation of the same genes on induction after TTX-induced changes. Differential regulation between neurobiological contexts was also evident after loss of H2A.Z.2 in <italic>Cartpt</italic> and <italic>Fam46a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11<italic>A</italic></xref>). Interestingly, group statistical comparisons of delayed IEG responses in hypervariant-depleted neurons to control neurons show that loss of H2A.Z.1 only has a significant effect at the early time point on induction after 48 h of TTX. However, on induction in normal neurons (Bic + 4AP assays), H2A.Z.1 depletion only significantly affects the group at the late time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11<italic>B</italic></xref>). Overall, these data suggest that the roles of H2A.Z hypervariants in regulating transcription of delayed IEGs may vary depending on specific genes and cellular states.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>H2A.Z is enriched in nucleosomes near promoters and enhancers of many vertebrate genes and therefore is postulated to play a critical role in gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Farris et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Raisner and Madhani, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Zlatanova and Thakar, 2008</xref>). However, roles of the hypervariants H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 in these processes have often been presumed to be redundant, and have not been categorically questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Soboleva et al., 2014</xref>). In the current study, we have demonstrated several instances of H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 nonredundancies: (1) H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 depletion in cortical neurons affects basal expression of predominantly nonoverlapping sets of genes; (2) depletion of these hypervariants has differential effects on important synaptic molecules like PSD-95 and SHANK3; (3) H2B, perhaps when modified in a certain way, interacts with MYC-H2A.Z.2, but not HA-H2A.Z.1; (4) H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 depletion differently influence activity-induced <italic>Arc</italic> transcription kinetics; (5) in normal neurons, H2A.Z.2, but not H2A.Z.1, is required near the <italic>Arc</italic> TSS for RNA Pol II pausing; (6) activity-induced transcription of certain IEGs is sensitive to depletion of only one of the two hypervariants (e.g., <italic>Btg2</italic> and <italic>Dusp1</italic> response is less after H2A.Z.2, but not H2A.Z.1, knockdown); and (7) certain IEGs appear to be differentially sensitive to one or both hypervariants in a context-dependent manner (<italic>Fbxo33</italic> and <italic>Maff</italic> after H2A.Z.1 depletion, <italic>Fam46a</italic> after loss of H2A.Z.2). Taken together, our data strongly suggest that H2A.Z hypervariants have important, nonredundant roles and/or functional specificity that should be considered for a full understanding of the part played by H2A.Z in gene transcription.</p>
<p>Three lines of evidence inspired our hypothesis about functional specificity of H2A.Z hypervariants. First, several instances have been observed in nature where genes duplicated during evolution encode very similar protein products that have achieved functional diversity. An important example is found in yeast where several paralogous ribosomal proteins are functionally dissimilar to their nearly identical counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Komili et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Steffen et al., 2012</xref>). Because mechanisms that work are often preserved in nature, we reasoned that the three amino acid differences in these hypervariants might be enough to allow functional diversity. Second, all three variant amino acid residues reside in functionally pertinent regions thereby making them suitable to mediate alternative functionalities. H2A.Z.1<sup>14S</sup>/H2A.Z.2<sup>14A</sup> is located in the H2A.Z N-terminal tail, which is heavily acetylated and is linked to H2A.Z transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bruce et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Valdés-Mora et al., 2012</xref>). H2A.Z.1<sup>38T</sup>/H2A.Z.2<sup>38S</sup> is located at the edge of the L1 loop, which plays an essential part in intranucleosomal interactions of H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Horikoshi et al., 2013</xref>). Such intranucleosomal interactions are also facilitated by the unstructured region of H2A.Z C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Wratting et al., 2012</xref>), which houses the H2A.Z.112<sup>128V</sup>/H2A.Z.2<sup>128A</sup> variation. Third, knockout of H2A.Z.1 results in embryonic lethality in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Faast et al., 2001</xref>) indicating that H2A.Z.2 cannot compensate for the loss of its paralog. Together, these observations suggest that H2A.Z hypervariants have nonredundant functions that have not yet been adequately explored.</p>
<p>Our study into functional specificity of H2A.Z hypervariants in activity-induced <italic>Arc</italic> transcription revealed a few interesting aspects of H2A.Z biology. Overall, <italic>Arc</italic> transcription requires both H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2. Depletion of either hypervariant had unique effects on <italic>Arc</italic> transcriptional kinetics that were not compensated by the other paralog. In normal previously untreated neurons (i.e., without homeostatic changes induced by silencing), H2A.Z.2, but not H2A.Z.1, was found to be necessary for the rapid phase of activity-induced <italic>Arc</italic> transcription (within 15 min of treatment) by facilitating RNA Pol II promoter proximal pausing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Pol II pausing near promoters is facilitated, among other factors, by the position of the +1 nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Kwak and Lis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Jimeno-González et al., 2015</xref>). Although exact mechanisms remain unknown, it is presumed that the +1 nucleosome acts as a physical barrier to the transcriptionally engaged Pol II. In mammals, the presence of H2A.Z in the +1 nucleosome is positively correlated with Pol II pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Ku et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Day et al., 2016</xref>). In our study, considering that (1) H2A.Z.2 is required for Pol II pausing near the <italic>Arc</italic> TSS and (2) Bic + 4AP treatment removes MYC-H2A.Z.2 from the +1 nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), we suggest that H2A.Z.2-containing nucleosomes play a dual role in mediating activity-induced transcription. In the resting state before activity, the +1 H2A.Z.2-containing nucleosome would maintain a rigid barrier to Pol II, thereby facilitating its pausing. After activity, dynamic turnover of this nucleosome allows Pol II to commence productive elongation. If true, such a dual-role model could fuel further queries about possible activity-induced signals that convert a rigid nucleosomal barrier into a dynamic gate for Pol II productive elongation. Although this model holds true for activity induced under both normal and prolonged TTX treatment-enabled conditions for <italic>Arc</italic>, further investigation into other IEGs revealed the potential for both gene- and context-specific roles of H2A.Z hypervariants in gene transcription. However, future studies will be required to determine if these hypervariants are directly or indirectly involved in the transcription of other IEGs investigated in this study.</p>
<p>One of our observations was puzzling and therefore difficult to interpret: although there was turnover of MYC-H2A.Z.2 in response to acute increases in neuronal activity, the total levels of H2A.Z (as reported by the Millipore anti-H2A.Z antibody) near the <italic>Arc</italic> TSS did not change over the entire duration o<italic>f</italic> testing. This could be due to weak efficiency of the commercial H2A.Z antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic>, </xref>compare signals), which was the best anti-H2A.Z ChIP antibody in our hands. We believe that, as has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Zovkic et al., 2014</xref>) and is also shown by our anti-MYC ChIP data, activity does indeed induce H2A.Z turnover at the <italic>Arc</italic> TSS.</p>
<p>In comparison to the Pol II pausing-related defined role of H2A.Z.2 in <italic>Arc</italic> transcription, the exact role of H2A.Z.1 in the process is less apparent. In normal, unsilenced neurons, lack of H2A.Z.1 impairs only the late segment of activity-induced <italic>Arc</italic> transcription (30 min and later). As suggested by our DRB washout assays, this is most likely via indirect mechanisms (discussed further below). However, after subjecting neurons to homeostatic plasticity-related changes with TTX exposure for 48 h, H2A.Z.1 depletion also impairs early responses of <italic>Arc</italic> transcription. This repurposing of H2A.Z.1 after prolonged lack of activity is likely mediated by a context-dependent newfound ability to facilitate Pol II pausing. Alternatively, these data could also be explained by heterogeneity of nucleosomal composition in the cell population (discussed further below).</p>
<p>Considering that we could not detect strong interactions of tagged H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 in our co-IPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), indicating that they likely do not often coexist in the same nucleosome, and yet show H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 enrichment at the same nucleosomal positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>), it is possible that these <italic>Arc</italic> TSS nucleosomal loci are populated by different H2A.Z hypervariants in different alleles and/or cells in the population. In normal neurons, only the fraction of these alleles and/or cells that have H2A.Z.2, and therefore paused Pol II, responds to activity. After prolonged TTX treatment, additional alleles and/or cells with H2A.Z.1 attain Pol II pausing via unknown mechanisms and facilitate an enhanced response after TTX washout. This explanation aligns with the noticeably more robust expression of <italic>Arc</italic> after prolonged TTX treatment and washout in comparison to disinhibition-induced activity under previously untreated conditions (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8<italic>B</italic></xref>). Also, the effect of H2A.Z.1 depletion on late, not early, <italic>Arc</italic> transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic>,<italic>D</italic></xref>) falls within the scope of this explanation. On induction of activity in resting conditions, H2A.Z.1-containing alleles and/or cells undertake <italic>Arc</italic> transcription in a Pol II pausing-independent “delayed” fashion, as delayed IEGs do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Saha et al., 2011</xref>), thereby accounting for impairments at later time points in H2A.Z.1-depleted neurons. These are exciting possibilities that will require further probing.</p>
<p>Additional experiments will also be required to understand the relevance of the H2A.Z chaperone ANP32E in regulating H2A.Z functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Mao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Obri et al., 2014</xref>). In our hands, several traditional “rescue” attempts involving expression of shRNA-insensitive H2A.Z.2 failed to reverse the loss of <italic>Arc</italic> transcription in H2A.Z.2-depleted neurons. However, the phenotype loss could be partially rescued by codepletion of ANP32E. Because ANP32E removes H2A.Z from nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Mao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Obri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Gursoy-Yuzugullu et al., 2015</xref>), it is likely that the presence of ANP32E in H2A.Z.2-depleted neurons facilitates continued removal of nucleosomal H2A.Z.2 and subsequent fallouts thereof, including loss of Pol II pausing and inability to respond rapidly. However, codepletion of the chaperone along with the histone preserves nucleosomal H2A.Z.2, at least in part, enabling <italic>Arc</italic> to rapidly respond to some extent. A similar precedence of H2A.Z and ANP32E codepletion partially rescuing phenotype loss due to depletion of one of these factors exists in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Alatwi and Downs, 2015</xref>). Our findings, combined with this previous report, advocate for the need to approach the complex biology of H2A.Z hypervariants and their chaperones together.</p>

<p>Collectively, our current studies indicate that H2A.Z hypervariants mediate activity-induced IEG transcription in a context-dependent (H2A.Z.1) or context-independent (H2A.Z.2) fashion, where the extent of their involvement in the transcriptional process varies from gene to gene. Our data also suggest spatial and temporal cooperation of these hypervariants in manifesting the maximum gene response under a given circumstance. Natural extensions of the current work will be to test the above hypothesis about allele/cell-specificity of these hypervariants, and to investigate molecular mechanisms connecting H2A.Z hypervariants and paused Pol II. Additionally, sequentially mutating H2A.Z.1 to H2A.Z.2 could provide insight into which amino acid differences are necessary for functional specificity. Particular attention may be paid to the H2A.Z.1<sup>14S</sup>/H2A.Z.2<sup>14A</sup> variation, where H2A.Z.1, but not H2A.Z.2, could be potentially phosphorylated. It will also be of interest to learn about hypervariant-specific H2A.Z chaperones, if any, and understand how these hypervariants differentially regulate expression of several crucial synaptic molecules. Finally, it is our hope that the data presented here will increase appreciation for functional specificity of H2A.Z hypervariants and promote tool-building efforts to enable a comprehensive understanding of diverse roles played by these paralogs at different genes and under different neurobiological contexts.</p>

<p>Reviewing Editor: Leonard Maler, University of Ottawa</p>
<p>Decisions are customarily a result of the Reviewing Editor and the peer reviewers coming together and discussing their recommendations until a consensus is reached. When revisions are invited, a fact-based synthesis statement explaining their decision and outlining what is needed to prepare a revision will be listed below. The following reviewer(s) agreed to reveal their identity: Ian Maze</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>The reviewers both agree that this is now a well done and useful addition to the literature on the regulation of IEGs. One reviewer finds that some controls are not accurately described and some results over-interpreted. This reviewer gave many detailed suggestions on how to improve this manuscript so that it is suitable for publication in eNeuro and I have copied these comments, in full, below.</p>
<p>The authors should address all the points made below and carefully respond with details of their revisions. This Ms will not require re-review but I will carefully go over the revised Ms and the authors' detailed response to this review. If the revisions prove complete, I will be able to accept this Ms for publication in eNeuro.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2</p>
<p>The authors present a compelling set of data describing the gene specific targets of H2A variants. In general, I believe this dataset will be of interest to those who work on H2A.Z and IEGs and their regulation of expression. While interesting, several aspects of uncontrolled or over interpreted results slightly diminish my enthusiasm. I suggest ways to fix some of the manuscript. However, the entire document should be closely looked at.</p>
<p>Overview of review: </p>
<p>• I am mostly concerned about the lack of controls related to ChIP experiments. In general, ChIP data is difficult to interpret and even more so without antibody controls or controls for whether the antibody precipitates the intended target. For these experiments, I think the authors should be more specific about what they did (including the exact antibody used) as opposed to making conclusions about what they think is going on. </p>
<p>• There are slight inconsistencies with some data that do not seem to be addressed. For example, the H2A mediated control of Arc levels does not seem to line up with the H2A mediated control of synaptic activity (see below). The authors should specifically address these data and how they are consistent. </p>
<p>• The authors should show a time line for treatments and measurements. There are many experimental approaches in this manuscript that are trying to say something similar and I found it difficult to determine whether I was looking at data from neuronal cultures, what the time frame of treatment was, type of culture etc. </p>
<p>• If the authors are going to say anything about changes to an antibody signal on an immunoblot it should be accompanied by quantification unless it is truly obvious in multiple examples such as that seen in Figures 4D and 4E. </p>
<p>Specifics of review: </p>
<p>Figure 1B: Why does every nucleus not show H2afz or H2afv staining? Is this a technical limitation? One possibility is that this is due to cell specific expression of these variants. </p>
<p>1. How many times has this been done? </p>
<p>2. The authors should quantify these puncta in some manner? </p>
<p>3. The authors should quantify the overlap? </p>
<p>Figure 1D-G: MW markers please. Full representative westerns for each antibody should be shown in a supplemental file. </p>
<p>Figure 3A: These data appear convincing. How are these experiments being blinded? Was any ICC done to confirm that the recorded cell was knockdown for the respective H2A. Not necessary but is good practice especially because it seems as though from Figure 1B that not every cell has each H2A variant. Also, it is unclear how long the cells were transfected before mEPSC recordings. This is important information as changes in gene expression can occur considerably faster than remodeling of the synapse. </p>
<p>Figure 3D: The immunoblot analysis looks as though there are no changes. I am unclear as to what the authors are trying to say with this data. The Shank3 antibody does not look convincing. A knockout control would be needed to confirm this antibody. To say anything substantial about this data, quantification of several westerns would be needed. The actin signal looks overexposed and thus would be hard to normalize. Genomic analysis is many times more sensitive than protein analysis, and many many times more than immunoblot analysis. Immunoblots are not a great tool for detecting small changes. It is important that with such small changes the authors take care in quantifying such data or making appropriate interpretations from the unquantified data. It seems that the authors do not need this data and it could be taken out. It is barely mentioned/discussed in the text and does not line up well with the gene expression data. Stating that the antibody signal is modestly reduced does not mean anything. The signal is clearly unchanged. Also, I am sure the authors are aware that immunoblots do not show protein levels they show antibody signal. Determining protein levels by immunoblot requires comparison to knockout controls to determine specificity of signal followed by careful quantification of signal based on a control signal. Then one needs to use immunoblot techniques that have the capacity to detect small changes (i.e. I125 labeled antibody or fluorescent imaging technology). Alternatively, one could use SILAC quantitative mass spec to measure protein level in their different samples. </p>
<p>Figure 4: These data indicate that loss of H2A variants leads to a decrease in activity induced Arc expression. One would predict that this would lead to the inability to recycle GluR1 (i.e. more surface GluR1). This should then lead to increased synaptic activity. However, the authors show that reduced H2A variants in Figure 3 have reduced postsynaptic signaling. What are the authors thought on this? </p>
<p>Figure 6: Is there equal pulldown of Myc or HA in treated ChIP samples as compared to untreated. This data could arrive from just having less protein coming down in the precipitated samples. Not sure I understand this data correctly in context of other findings. If Bic+AP leads to a reduction in H2A binding to Arc (Figure 6C), how is H2A required for activity induced Arc expression (figure 4D)? </p>
<p>Figure 7: Where are the controls showing that these antibodies can immunoprecipitate the intended proteins? This data is not interpretable without such information. Alternatively, the authors could do the ChIP in the knockout for each protein to confirm that the information being measured is indeed specific to the protein being pulldown. Otherwise, I do not believe anything can be learned from these data. Moreover, I object to the over interpretation in this section. Fore example, the authors state the following on lines 543-547: </p>
<p>“Here, we tested whether there is a relation between Pol II pausing and H2A.Z hypervariants at the Arc TSS. Using ChIP with anti-RPB1 (N-terminus), the largest Pol II subunit, we found that RNA Pol II pausing at the Arc TSS - notable from the enrichment of RPB1 near nucleosome +1 at the TSS (primer 2 in Figure 7D) - is diminished significantly in neurons depleted of H2A.Z.2, but not H2A.Z.1.” </p>
<p>Besides being a complicated way to state their point there are several issues with the interpretation that RNA Pol II pausing at the Arc TSS is happening based on the data. Experimentally, the authors applied antibody raised against the N-terminus of RPB1 to their neuronal samples prepared as described in their ChIP protocol. They then immunoprecipitated these samples and detected Arc signal by qPCR. Based on the data, they detected less Arc signal in anti-RPB1 immunoprecipitates derived from of ChIP lysates that were previously transfected with H2A.Z.2 shRNA, but not H2A.Z.1. Here are some possible ways in which this could have happened: </p>
<p>1. The antibody to RPB1 has diminished capacity to precipitate RPB1 protein in samples previously transfected with H2A.Z.2 thus you get less Arc signal. </p>
<p>2. The antibody to RPB1 precipitates a complex of proteins of which another protein interacts with the Arc TSS and is no longer does so when H2A.Z.2 shRNA has been transfected. </p>
<p>3. The H2A.Z.1 shRNA did not knockdown this variant in these experiments. </p>
<p>4. This is a completely non-specific immunoprecipitation that artificially interacts with Arc DNA and is affected by H2A.Z.2. </p>
<p>I like figures 8, 9, 10 and 11</p>
