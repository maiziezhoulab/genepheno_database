<abstract>
<p>Loss of MeCP2 (Methyl CpG binding protein 2) in Rett syndrome (RTT) causes brain weight decrease, shrinkage of the cortex with reduced dendritic arborization, behavioral abnormalities, seizures and cardio-respiratory complications. The observed monoamine neurotransmitters reduction in RTT suggested antidepressants as a possible therapy. We treated MeCP2-null mice from postnatal-day 28 for two weeks with desipramine, already tested in RTT, or mirtazapine, an antidepressant with limited side-effects, known to promote GABA release. Mirtazapine was more effective than desipramine in restoring somatosensory cortex thickness by fully rescuing pyramidal neurons dendritic arborization and spine density. Functionally, mirtazapine treatment normalized heart rate, breath rate, anxiety levels, and eliminated the hopping behavior observed in MeCP2-null mice, leading to improved phenotypic score. These morphological and functional effects of mirtazapine were accompanied by reestablishment of the GABAergic and glutamatergic receptor activity recorded in cortex and brainstem tissues. Thus, mirtazapine can represent a new potential pharmacological treatment for the Rett syndrome.</p>

<body>
<p>Rett syndrome is an X-linked progressive neurodevelopmental disorder with an incidence of 1:10,000 newborn girls. Mutations in the gene encoding MeCP2 (Methyl CpG binding protein 2) are the main cause of the disorder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The classical clinical course includes a normal development during the first two years of age and then a progressive general regression, with reduction of head growth, weight loss, repetitive stereotyped hand movements, motor disabilities, and cardiorespiratory dysfunctions representing the principal cause of death<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p>
<p>Several clinical features are recapitulated in MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> (null) mice, including reduction in brain weight and volume<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. A reduction in thickness of the somatosensory cortex was found in MeCP2-null mice at six weeks of age with shrinkage of layers II-III and V, accompanied by smaller neuronal size and reduced apical dendrite diameter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Autistic-like behavior, motor and respiratory deficits were associated with a deficit of noradrenaline (NE), serotonin (5HT) and dopamine (DA) in Rett patients and MeCP2-null mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, interconnected to a dysfunction of GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p>
<p>The alterations in monoaminergic signaling have suggested the possibility to ameliorate the Rett clinical phenotype through an antidepressant treatment. Desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant inhibiting the reuptake of NE and 5HT, was shown to stabilize the respiratory pattern, and increase the life-span but without brain weight, body weight and locomotor activity improvement in MeCP2-null mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. However, desipramine was reported to have severe side-effects, including cardiac complications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. On the other hand, mirtazapine, an high tolerable noradrenergic and specific serotoninergic tretacyclic antidepressant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, is virtually devoid of anticholinergic side-effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, and has few cardiorespiratory side-effects although overdosage induces sedation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Mirtazapine has been reported to enhance cognition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and to stabilize sleep similarly to drugs that stimulate GABAergic transmission<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Here, MeCP2-null mice were treated with mirtazapine or desipramine for two weeks and the morphological and functional effects were analyzed.</p>

<title>Reduction in body and brain weight and cortical thickness in MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> mice</title>
<p>MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> mice display body and brain loss of weight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.
MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> male mouse model is generally considered a faithful model of the
cortical dysfunction in Rett syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. We used the Bird strain because it presents
more significant alterations in brain weight, and volume of cortex and cerebellum, than those observed in the Jaenisch strain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. To obtain a reference before pharmacological treatment, we evaluated body and brain weight in MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> mice (KO) and Wild Type (WT) littermates at 6 weeks of age (p42). Compared to WT mice (n = 8), KO mice (n = 9) showed 34.7% reduction in body weight (WT = 18.73 ± 0.21 g; KO = 12.23 ± 1.05 g; <italic>t-test</italic> p = 0.002) and 19.04% reduction in brain weight (WT = 0.42 ± 0.01 g; KO = 0.34 ± 0.01 g; <italic>t-test</italic> p &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Nissl stained brain sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>; n = 6 WT; n = 6KO), collected at regular intervals every 400 μm from 0 μm until 1,200 μm along the antero-posterior axis of the somatosensory cortex, revealed significant reduction in the thickness of KO mice cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Table 1</xref>; <italic>t-test</italic> p &lt; 0.001 or p = 0.002 at interval 400–800 μm), and a significant reduction in layers II-III and VI compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl.

<title>Mirtazapine rescues the brain weight but not the body weight of MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> mice</title>
<p>Mirtazapine produces robust antidepressant effects already after two weeks of treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. To evaluate if antidepressants had an effect on body and brain weight, WT and MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> (KO) mice were treated for 2 weeks with vehicle (VEH), or the control drug (desipramine 10 mg/Kg – DMI10) or the testing drug at two different concentrations (mirtazapine 10 or 50 mg/Kg – MIR10/MIR50). Mice were weighed every day during the 14 days of treatment, and at p28, the KO-VEH group showed around 30% lower body weight with respect to the WT-VEH group and this difference was maintained until p41 irrespective of the drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g,h</xref>; n = 7 WT VEH = 21.81 ± 0.68 g; n = 8 WT DMI10 = 19.05 ± 0.62 g; n = 6 WT MIR10 = 20.46 ± 0.84 g; n = 6 WT MIR50 = 20.61 ± 1.50 g ; n = 7 KO VEH = 16.22 ± 1.20 g; n = 17 KO DMI10 = 14.40 ± 0.96 g; n = 7 KO MIR10 = 16.13 ± 1.22 g; n = 15 KO MIR50 = 15.20 ± 0.98 g; <italic>t-test</italic>, p = 0.002 VEH; p = 0.005 DMI10; p = 0.017 MIR10; p = 0.002 MIR50). Thus, the two drugs neither rescued nor reduced the body weight.</p>
<p>After 24 hours from the last injection, mice were euthanized and brains were weighed. The brain weight in untreated KO mice was 0.34 ± 0.008 g (n = 8 KO UNT), corresponding to 80% of the average brain weight in untreated WT mice (n = 6 WT UNT; 0.42 ± 0.01 g, t-test p &lt; 0.001). The brain weight was not affected by drug treatments in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i</xref>; n = 6 WT UNT = 0.42 ± 0.01 g; n = 7 WT VEH = 0.44 ± 0.01 g; n = 7 WT DMI10 = 0.41 ± 0.01 g; n = 6 WT MIR10 = 0.41 ± 0.02 g; n = 6 WT MIR50 = 0.42 ± 0.01 g; One Way ANOVA, p = 0.503). Treatment of KO mice with vehicle had no significant improvement on brain weight with respect to KO UNT mice (n = 7 KO VEH = 0.35 ± 0.009 g, 82.1% of WT UNT; t-test). We observed a slight but not significant increase in brain weight with desipramine (DMI10 = 86.3%), and mirtazapine 10 mg/Kg (MIR10 = 86.0%) (n = 8 DMI10 0.36 ± 0.010 g, n = 6 MIR10 0.36 ± 0.013 g). However, treatment with mirtazapine 50 mg/Kg led to an increase in brain weight up to 87.8% of the weight in WT untreated mice, which was significantly different from KO UNT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1l</xref>; n = 8 KO MIR50 0.37 ± 0.010; t-test p &lt; 0.05) and was close to significance with respect to KO VEH (t-test p = 0.054). Thus, mirtazapine has a positive effect on the weight of RTT brains.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Hippocampal structure is not affected by the loss of MeCP2 or drug treatments</title>
<p>To investigate which brain structures were involved in the increase of brain weight by mirtazapine treatment, we evaluated the effects of absence of MeCP2 and treatments on the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. 1a</xref>). The specific contribution of each layer to the total thickness (=100%) is a constant along the rostro-caudal axis of the hippocampus in both mouse and rat, as previously demonstrated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Using the same strategy, we analyzed three Nissl stained sections for each animal (n = 5 WT UNT, n = 5 KO UNT, n = 3 KO VEHIC, n = 3 KO DMI10, n = 3 KO MIR10, n = 4 KO MIR50) and measured the thickness of the different hippocampal laminas along a line drawn perpendicularly to the CA1 pyramidal layer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. 1b</xref>). The proportion of each layer in WT UNT resulted to be as follows, CA1 <italic>stratum pyramidalis</italic> = 8.7%, CA1 <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> = 32.5%, <italic>stratum lacunosum-molecolare</italic> = 19.6%, <italic>stratum molecularis</italic> = 27.3%, <italic>stratum granularis</italic> = 10.6%. No significant difference in thickness of the hippocampal layers was found between WT and KO mice or treatments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig 1c</xref>, <italic>One Way</italic> ANOVA; p = 0.67 (pyr. l.); p = 0.56 (strat. ra); p = 0.91 (s. lac.); p = 0.95 (mol. l.); p = 0.37 (granul.)). Hence, the gross anatomical structure of the hippocampus was not affected by the loss of MeCP2 nor by treatment with antidepressants.</p>

<title>Mirtazapine treatment rescues the thickness of somatosensory cortex in MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> mice</title>
<p>The thickness of somatosensory cortex was measured to determine if the pharmacological treatment could improve the abnormal cortical organization observed in MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>; n = 6 WT UNT; n = 6 WT VEH; n = 6 WT DMI10; n = 5 WT MIR10; n = 6 WT MIR50; n = 6 KO UNT; n = 6 KO VEH; n = 6 KO DMI10; n = 5 KO MIR10; n = 6 KO MIR50). In WT animals, mirtazapine and desipramine treatments showed no effects on cortical thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>; <italic>One Way</italic> ANOVA; p = 0.086). The total cortical thickness of KO untreated mice was 85.7% of WT (considered as 100%), and treated KO mice showed a statistically significant recovery of total cortical thickness compared with KO VEH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>; <italic>One Way</italic> ANOVA; KO DMI10, p = 0.001; KO MIR10, p = 0.038; KO MIR50, p &lt; 0.001). The cortical thickness of KO mice treated with desipramine, mitarzapine 10 mg/Kg, or mirtazapine 50 mg/Kg reached the 90.6%, 88.6%, 92.9% of WT, respectively. When individual cortical layers were analyzed, treatments showed no effects in WT cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, n = 6 for each group). However, we found an increase in the thickness of layer VI of somatosensory cortex in MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> mice treated with desipramine and mirtazapine 50 mg/Kg, compared with KO UNT (<italic>One Way</italic> ANOVA; KO DMI10 p = 0.018; KO MIR50 p = 0.021). These results confirmed that antidepressants treatment, in particular mirtazapine, can contribute to improve the cortical cytoarchitecture in MeCP2 null mice.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Mirtazapine treatment rescues MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> cortical neurons morphology</title>
<p>To gain further insight regarding the effect of mirtazapine treatment on cortical neurons, we investigated the fine morphology of layer II-III pyramidal neurons of somatosensory cortex in MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> and WT mice using Golgi staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, n = 10 neurons/animal, n = 3 mice/genotype; in total n = 30 neurons/genotype). Since treatments had no effect on WT cortices and thickness of KO cortex was not affected by the vehicle, in agreement with the 3 R principle for animal use reduction, we focused this analysis on WT untreated, KO untreated and KO treated with mirtazapine 50 mg/kg. In KO untreated mice, pyramidal neurons showed a significantly smaller area of their somata with respect to WT and this deficit was fully restored by mirtazapine 50 mg/Kg (WT UNT = 273.26 ± 17.54 μm<sup>2</sup>; KO UNT = 207.21 ± 5.08 μm<sup>2</sup>; KO MIR50 = 261.59 ± 17.35 μm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>; p &lt; 0.05 ANOVA vs. KO untreated and not significant vs. WT UNT). By Sholl analysis, KO UNT mice showed a reduced number of crossings in the region from 120 to 150μm from the soma in apical dendrites (p &lt; 0.05), and a marked reduction along the basal dendrites between −40 and −140 μm from the soma (p &lt; 0.001; p &lt; 0.05), with respect to WT UNT mice. Treatment with mirtazapine 50 mg/Kg rescued these deficits back to WT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>; p &lt; 0.001, ANOVA).</p>
<p>In keeping with previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, the diameter of apical dendrites of the layer II-III pyramidal neurons at 10 μm (proximal) and 100 μm (distal) from the soma showed a significant reduction in KO mice at both distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>; p &lt; 0.05 ANOVA). Treatment with mirtazapine led to a full recovery of this morphological deficit (Proximal: WT UNT = 2.18 ± 0.15 μm; KO UNT = 1.65 ± 0.08 μm; KO MIR50 = 2.17 ± 0.15 μm; Distal: WT UNT = 1.47 ± 0.14 μm; KO UNT = 1.25 ± 0.09 μm; KO MIR50 = 1.49 ± 0.11 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>; p &lt; 0.05, ANOVA), thus providing evidence that mirtazapine can restore the fine morphology of cortical neurons in MeCP2 null mice.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Mirtazapine rescues the number and type of dendritic spines in MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup></title>
<p>It was previously reported that the density of spines in primary and secondary apical dendrites was similar between WT and KO mice (Jaenisch and Bird strains)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Using sections labeled with Golgi staining, we investigated not only the spine density (number of spines/50 μm) in primary and secondary apical dendrites, confirming the results of previous studies (WT UNT n = 23.22 ± 2.12; KO UNT n = 22.60 ± 3.45), but also in basal dendrites wherein we observed a significant reduction in KO mice compared to WT (WT UNT n = 21.30 ± 2.61; KO UNT n = 18.32 ± 1.78) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>; n = 10 neurons/animal, n = 3 mice/genotype; in total n = 30 neurons/genotype). Treatment with mirtazapine 50 mg/Kg caused a complete rescue of basal dendrite spine density without altering the number of spines in apical dendrite (apical: KO MIR50 n = 26.07 ± 2.40; basal KO MIR50 n = 22.77 ± 1.90) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>; p &lt; 0.05, ANOVA). When the spine type was considered, no difference in the number of mushroom and thin spines could be observed but the number of stubby spines resulted significantly reduced in both apical and basal dendrites from KO mice and was completely recovered by mirtazapine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>; p &lt; 0.05, ANOVA). In conclusion, mirtazapine treatment acts on the number and spine types to rescue the Rett phenotype on both apical and basal dendrites.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Mirtazapine improves phenotypic score and cardiorespiratory functions</title>
<p>Phenotypic outcomes of treatments were assessed starting from an evaluation of the general health conditions of animals at p28 and p47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). At p47, the group of mirtazapine-treated mice showed a lower phenotypic score (median = 3.5 ± 0.38; n = 4) in comparison to desipramine group (median = 4.5 ± 0.32; n = 5), indicating a significantly lower severity of disease symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>; p &lt; 0.05, <italic>Mann-Whitney U test</italic>). In the late stage of the disorder, RTT patients develop cardiorespiratory dysfunctions which are responsible for 26% of deaths<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. To investigate if antidepressants treatments can modify the abnormal cardiorespiratory pattern of MeCP2-null mice, we used the MouseOX instrument<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The data continuously recorded during 10 minutes of the test are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>. Oxygen saturation in KO mice treated either with vehicle (median = 77.09 ± 0.3%; n = 14) or mirtazapine (median = 77.47 ± 0.9%; n = 15), was slightly, but not significantly, lower than WT injected with vehicle (median = 90.91 ± 0.3%; n = 18), while in KO treated with desipramine (median = 77.18 ± 0.5%; n = 15) it was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>; p &lt; 0.01). On the contrary, in KO mice treated with vehicle, we observed a significant reduction in heart rate (beats per minute = bpm, median = 677.06 ± 2.4 bpm; n = 14; p &lt; 0.01) and breath rate (breaths per minute = brpm, median = 173.61 ± 0.7 brpm; n = 14; p &lt; 0.001) in comparison to WT mice treated with vehicle (median = 734.99 ± 1.3 bpm; median = 205.01 ± 0.9 brpm; n = 23). This deficit was unmodified by desipramine (median = 619.79 ± 6.2 bpm; median = 171.51 ± 0.7 brpm; n = 15; p &lt; 0.001 vs. WT VEH) while it reverted back to WT levels after mirtazapine treatment (median = 710.08 ± 3.5 bpm; median = 196.24 ± 1.4 brpm; n = 13; not significant vs. WT VEH; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). We also recorded, for the first time in an animal model of Rett syndrome, the pulse distention. Pulse distention was not significantly altered in KO mice treated with vehicle (median = 500.62 ± 14.1 μm; n = 14) with respect to WT treated with vehicle (median = 434.41 ± 3.8 μm; n = 16), and mirtazapine (median = 501.38 ± 6.2 μm; n = 15) treatment did not affect this parameter. On the contrary, desipramine significantly reduced pulse distention in MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> mice (median = 304.97 ± 7.6 μm; n = 15; p &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Therefore, mirtazapine can rescue the irregular pattern of respiration described in both human and RTT mice, without eliciting unwanted side-effects.</p>

<title>Mirtazapine normalizes anxiety and hopping behavior</title>
<p>MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> mice were previously shown to display reduced anxiety levels in the elevated plus maze<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Our results confirmed that KO mice treated with vehicle (KO VEH), spent more time in the open compartment of elevated plus maze (27.50 ± 3.56%; 82.51 ± 10.67 seconds; n = 14) than WT animals injected with vehicle (9.88 ± 0.98%; 29.64 ± 2.94 seconds; n = 16; p &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). KO mice treated with mirtazapine showed a significant reduction in the time spent in open arms (15.72 ± 2.67%; 47.17 ± 8.01 seconds; n = 13; p &lt; 0.001) with respect to the KO VEH group, while desipramine was less effective (19.60 ± 3.54%; 58.79 ± 10.61 seconds; n = 13; p &lt; 0.01). Mirtazapine did not produce any effect on WT animals (13.10 ± 3.03%; 39.29 ± 9.10 seconds; n = 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>).</p>
<p>Another behavior which increases in response to elevated anxiety is self-grooming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>), which was significantly reduced in KO VEH mice (median = 14 ± 2.54 episodes; n = 15) with respect to WT VEH (median = 21 ± 2.57 episodes; n = 19; p &lt; 0.01), in accordance with the increased preference for open arms observed in the elevated plus maze test. Treatment with mirtazapine 50 mg/Kg was able to partially restore the number of grooming episodes during observation (median = 16 ± 3.81 episodes; n = 14; p &lt; 0.05 vs. KO VEH) while desipramine was not significantly different from the KO VEH group (median = 11.50 ± 2.91 episodes; n = 14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we observed a typical behavior of MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> mice consisting in paroxysmal repetitive jump on the wall of the cage without control (hopping behavior), which is almost undetectable in WT VEH mice (1.44 ± 0.76 episodes; n = 18). Following treatment of KO mice with desipramine, the hopping behavior was less evident (7.57 ± 3.25 episodes; n = 14) than in KO VEH (12.5 ± 6.27 episodes; n = 14) while it was almost completely abolished after treatment with mirtazapine (1.54 ± 1.14 episodes; n = 14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>). The results regarding hopping behavior are particularly interesting because this uncontrolled jumping could be a sign of seizure events.</p>

<title>Mirtazapine normalizes the GABA and glutamate-currents recorded in MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> cortical and brainstem tissues</title>
<p>To test if the reduction of hopping behavior, after the treatment with mirtazapine, could reflect a stabilization of cortical transmission, we investigated if mirtazapine could normalize excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> mice. Transgenic mice lacking MeCP2 show reduced expression of GABAA receptor subunits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and reduced GABA release in brain neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Antidepressant treatments are known to rescue GABA levels and GABA deficits in patients with mood disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Accordingly, the effects of mirtazapine on GABAA receptor functionality were investigated. After two weeks of treatment with mirtazapine (50 mg/Kg) or vehicle, MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup> and WT mice were sacrificed and cell membranes were isolated from cortex and injected into Xenopus oocytes for electrophysiological analysis. This approach was chosen to measure the activity of all receptors expressed in the mouse cortex by using a limited number of animals. In this assay, the native receptors, still embedded in their natural lipidic environment with their associated molecules are transplanted into oocyte membranes maintaining their full functionality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The oocytes were injected with the membranes isolated from the mouse cortices of n = 4 WT UNT, n = 3 KO UNT or n = 3 KO MIR50 p42 mice. Each sample was obtained from the cortex of a single mouse and injected into the oocytes at the same protein concentration. The currents were recorded from 1 to 4 days after injection. Following injection of the mouse brain membranes in oocytes, no treatment with mirtazapine was carried out.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6a</xref> shows a typical example of GABA-current traces recorded in 3 oocytes, 2 days after injection with cortex membranes. In the same oocytes, glutamatergic-currents (GLU) were recorded in the presence of cyclothiazide (CTZ), a positive allosteric modulator that inhibits AMPA receptor desensitization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> often used to characterize the GLU receptors transplated into oocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The currents were detected in all injected oocytes indicating the functional incorporation of the receptors. A lack of response was observed in non-injected cells (<italic>data not shown</italic>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>, the KO UNT-injected oocytes displayed a significant reduction of the GABA-current amplitude (WT UNT, 100 ± 4.77%, n = 80; KO UNT 57.67 ± 8.87%, n = 46, p &lt; 0.001) whereas in KO MIR50-injected oocytes the amplitude was increased up to values comparable to those recorded in WT UNT-injected oocytes (88.24 ± 9.85%, n = 48). The dose-current response curves of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref> shows a left shift for KO UNT-injected oocytes revealing that the receptor affinity for GABA was altered. Half-maximal effective GABA concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of KO UNT-injected oocytes was significantly reduced compared to WT (WT UNT, EC<sub>50</sub> = 98 ± 4.38 μM, <italic>n</italic><sub>H</sub> = 1.11 ± 0.04, n = 36; KO UNT, EC<sub>50</sub> = 78.73 ± 4.92 μM, <italic>n</italic><sub>H</sub> = 1.15 ± 0.08, n = 39, p &lt; 0.05).

The GLU + CTZ-current amplitude was significantly reduced in KO UNT-injected oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>, WT UNT, 100 ± 12.73%, n = 12; KO UNT, 10.76 ± 1.87%, n = 12, p &lt; 0.001), and was fully recovered in KO MIR50-injected cells (74.2 ± 8.93%, n = 12).</p>
<p>By using the same approach, GABA and GLU + CTZ currents were analyzed in brainstem cell membranes extracted from n = 3 WT UNT, n = 3 KO UNT and n = 3 KO MIR50 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>). GABA-currents recorded in KO UNT-oocytes showed a trend towards a decrease with respect to WT UNT-injected oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f</xref>, WT UNT, 100 ± 3.51%, n = 90; KO UNT, 87.21 ± 5.93%, n = 77, p = 0.057), while EC<sub>50</sub> and <italic>n</italic><sub>H</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6g</xref>) remained similar (WT UNT, EC<sub>50</sub> = 93.74 ± 5.21 μM, <italic>n</italic><sub>H</sub> = 1.16 ± 0.05, n = 13; KO UNT, EC<sub>50</sub> = 97.8 ± 4.30 μM, <italic>n</italic><sub>H</sub> = 1.24 ± 0.06, n = 18). In KO MIR50-injected cells, the currents were significantly increased (117.65 ± 81.68%, n = 79, p &lt; 0.001) without changes in receptor affinity (EC<sub>50</sub> = 95.10 ± 3.96 μM, <italic>n</italic><sub>H</sub> = 1.18 ± 0.07, n = 15) with respect to WT UNT and KO UNT-injected oocytes.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>At present, there is no cure for the Rett syndrome. Some approaches tried to reverse the symptoms of this disorder through reintroduction of MeCP2 gene or reactivation of the normal allele<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. An alternative approach is through pharmacological treatments, and administration of neurotrophins or neurotransmitter precursors acting on factors downstream the MeCP2 function. A deficit in monoamine levels was reported in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of both Rett patients and MeCP2-null mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Antidepressants are therefore considered as strong candidates for the Rett syndrome and this study provides significant evidence that the antidepressant mirtazapine has great potential for future clinical trials, as discussed below. Indeed, our findings demonstrate that 2 weeks of mirtazapine treatment is sufficient to increase brain weight and re-establish somatosensory cortex architecture, normalize cardio-respiratory patterns and anxiety levels, abolish hopping behavior and restore the glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission in both cortex and brainstem in p42 MeCP2-null mice.</p>
<p>Results presented here, showing an increased brain weight in KO mice treated with mirtazapine are in keeping with previous findings that patients chronically treated with antidepressants (including mirtazapine) show a significant increase in the volume of hippocampus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In this context, the significant increase observed in the neuronal soma size and dendritic arborization in KO mice treated with mirtazapine may represent a possible mechanism contributing to the restoration of brain weight. In fact, measurement of cortical morphology represents a robust parameter to evaluate a possible pharmacological treatment since alterations in cortical morphology in MeCP2-null mice are highly reproducible in different laboratories, including ours, and closely resembles those observed in patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Indeed, simplified dendritic arbor structures of the layers II-III pyramidal neurons were found in the cortex of post-mortem brains from Rett patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Our results confirm previous findings that thickness of the somatosensory cortex of MeCP2-null mice, especially in layers II-III and V, and diameter of proximal and distal dendrites from soma are significantly reduced at p42 compared to WT mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. We also confirmed the reduction in soma area of MeCP2-null mice neurons and the reduction in apical dendritic arborization with no changes in the total number of spines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The fact that we observed a reduction of stubby spines in apical dendrites of KO mice, even if the spine density was not altered with respect to WT, could be explained by the variability of shapes assumed by the different spine types. This variability is highlighted when the mean values for different spine populations were compared among multiple samples, leading to a different significance with respect to the total number of spines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.</p>
<p>We analyzed also the arborization not only of apical dendrites, but also of basal dendrites which resulted to be the most affected in p42 MeCP2-null mice. We found that basal dendrites of MeCP2-null mice are less developed and have reduced number of stubby spines compared to WT mice.</p>
<p>Our experiments demonstrated that mirtazapine was able to restore the thickness of MeCP2-null mice somatosensory cortex, especially of layers II-III and VI. These macroscopic effects of mirtazapine were accounted by the full restoration of the normal microscopic structure of layer II-III pyramidal neurons including size of somata, diameter of apical dendrites, arborization of basal dendrites and density of spines in particular, of stubby spines.</p>
<p>We found that mirtazapine treatment in MeCP2-null mice was able to restore both the glutamatergic and GABAergic responses which were reduced in MeCP2-null cortical neurons, in keeping with previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. The current reduction observed in oocytes injected with cortical membranes from MeCP2-null mice could be a consequence of many factors such as an impaired receptor-channel function or an altered receptor subunit composition. These results could be explained by an altered number of GABAergic synapses or by abnormalities in density and composition of GABAA receptors of the MeCP2-null mouse cortex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, given that the properties of the GABA and glutamate receptors in their native membrane are retained after transplantation into the oocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Therefore, our results should be considered in line with the reported reduction in GABAA receptor density in young human brains affected by Rett Syndrome and in the cerebrum of MeCP2 deficient mouse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Such change could be also related to the different GABA affinity of the GABA receptors that we found in this study, in analogy to what observed in cortical tissue deriving from Angelmann syndrome patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. In addition, we showed that mirtazapine was able to normalize GLU-currents, in agreement with the reported reduction in glutamate transmission in the cortex of MeCP2-null mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>.</p>
<p>Deficits in the monoamine system, involving norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT), in brainstem are linked to breathing disturbances and NE application on brainstem slices of MeCP2-null mice is able to restore a regular respiratory rhythm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Moreover, desipramine is able to rescue respiratory rhythm and extend the life-span in a mouse model of the Rett syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Mirtazapine is a noradrenergic and specific serotoninergic antidepressant able to increase BDNF levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> and to induce the release of serotonin through the modulation of α2-adrenoreceptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, thus modulating the cardiorespiratory system. In the present study, we found that mice treated with mirtazapine showed a better phenotypic score than those treated with desipramine or untreated. In addition, mirtazapine was able to rescue both the heart and breath rate deficits observed in MeCP2-null mice, without affecting O<sub>2</sub> saturation and pulse distention which, together with the heart rate, are significanlty reduced by desipramine. Therefore, mirtazapine can rescue the irregular pattern of respiration, described in both human and RTT mice, without eliciting unwanted cardiovascular side-effects. Desipramine was shown to reduce apneas in MeCP2-null mice and to prolong their survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Nevertheless, desipramine may induce autonomic dysfunction leading to inability to control blood pressure, prolonged QT intervals, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death in predisposed children and adolescents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In particular, prolonged QT intervals are caused by the ability of desipramine to bind to the hERG K + channel in hearth muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. This is a worrying side-effect considering that cardiorespiratory dysfunction with prolongation of the QT interval is the main cause of death of RTT patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Therefore, an alternative drug is highly needed and mirtazapine appears as a strong candidate because of its limited respiratory and cardiac effects including very little orthostatic hypotension<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.</p>
<p>Our recordings of whole brainstem membranes showed significantly decreased glutamatergic responses, and a slight reduction of GABAergic transmission, and these deficits were completely rescued in whole brainstem membrane preparations from mirtazapine-treated animals. Previous studies reported an imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission in the ventrolateral medulla at postnatal day 7 likely due to decreased GABA release and GABAA receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. In addition, treatments which enhanced GABAergic transmission improved respiratory patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> alike the effect observed with a BDNF-mimic molecule<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Although we cannot compare our results with these previous studies because our whole brainstem preparations do not allow for resolution of neurotransmission activity in specific neuronal populations, the functional effects on breathing and heath-beat control, together with a clear normalization of both GABAergic and glutamatergic currents in the brainstem, represent a strong evidence of the efficacy of mirtazapine treatment.</p>
<p>Although normally, the antidepressant effects are visible after few hours from the treatment, several studies demonstrated that chronic treatment (&gt;14 days) with mirtazapine induces the increase of neurological responsiveness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Besides, Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2013 described that SSRI and tricyclic antidepressant show an evident therapeutical effect with a chronic (14 or more days) but not acute (&lt;10 days) treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. To evaluate the behavioural effects of chronic treatment with mirtazapine, we decided to test MeCP2-null mice when the symptoms of the pathology are evident, that is from the 5–6th weeks of age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p>
<p>Mirtazapine treatment was shown to display a nootropic effect in schizophrenic patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> due to increased release of NA and DA in prefrontal cortex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. In this context, it is interesting to note that mirtazapine also normalized the anxiety behavior. MeCP2 mutant mice were described to spend increased times in open arms of the elevated plus maze, an abnormal behavior which has been explained as due to abnormal perception of safeness or incapability to interpret danger in the MeCP2-null mice, two functions which require higher cognitive functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Similar results on anxiety and Glutamate normalization were obtained by treating MeCP2-null mice with IGF1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. One possible explanation of these similarities as well as those observed for breathing and the recovery of brainstem hyperexcitability could be that mirtazapine may act through mobilization of one or more neurotrophic factors, an hypothesis which is worth of further investigations. In conclusion, our results strongly support mirtazapine as a candidate drug to treat the Rett syndrome.</p>

Wild-type (WT) C57/BL6 male mice (Charles River Laboratories, Calco, LC, Italy) were crossed with female MeCP2 heterozygous mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine; strain: B6.129P2(C)-Mecp2tm1.1Bird/J, stock: 003890) to obtain the Rett model mice with genotype MeCP2<sup>−/y</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. We used male hemizygous mice because they consistently display the most evident and severe symptoms of the disorder much earlier than heterozygous female mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. MeCP2 is an X-linked gene, and thus, heterozygous female mice show a different MeCP2 expression depending on the mosaicism derived from the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Even if, it is likely that the hormonal changes could influence the outcome of the pathology, the variability of the phenotype due to the XCI in female mice could be confounding. All mice were kept in ventilated caging under 12:12 h light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum.

Data were analyzed with Any-maze program (Ugo Basile instrument, Varese, Italy) dividing the cross into central zone, open arms, closed arms. The percentage of the time spent in the zones vs the total time of the test, the number of grooming and the frequency of hopping behaviour were analyzed.</p>

<title>Vital parameters measurements</title>
<p>The Oxygen Saturation (% = percentage of hemoglobin saturated by O<sub>2</sub>), the Heart (bpm = number of beats per minute) and Breath Rate (brpm = number of breaths per minute) and the Pulse Distention (μm = distention of the arterial blood vessels due to a cardiac pulse) were detected by the non-invasive MouseOX instrument (STARR Life Sciences, Holliston, Ma, USA). A collar clip was placed on the neck of p42 mice (n = 5–22) keeping for 20 minutes, and then substitued with the infrared pulse oximeter clip connected to the instrument. Ten minute readings were taken from each mouse. We excluded from the analysis the data equal to zero and the animals with O<sub>2</sub> saturation lower than 50%, because these data are due to signal failure in the infrared signal.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were conducted using SigmaPlotTM software (SigmaStat, Systat Software Inc, San Jose, CA, USA).</p>
<p>The Student’s t-test was used for two-sample comparisons. For multiple sample comparisons, <italic>One-Way</italic> ANOVA was performed, followed by Student-Newman-Keuls Method post-tests. ANOVA on Ranks was used for morphological analysis of Golgi staining.</p>
<p>For behavioral analysis, outlier exclusion was performed through GraphPad Software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) with a Grubbs’ test, considering critical value of Z higher than 2.5. The non-parametric data obtained with MouseOX and behavioral test were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U test (2-tailed) between each group and the control.</p>
