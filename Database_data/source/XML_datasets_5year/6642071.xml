<title>Background</title>
<p>Betaine is known to act against various biological stresses and its levels were reported to be decreased in schizophrenia patients. We aimed to test the role of betaine in schizophrenia pathophysiology, and to evaluate its potential as a novel psychotherapeutic.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Using <italic>Chdh</italic> (a gene for betaine synthesis)-deficient mice and betaine-supplemented inbred mice, we assessed the role of betaine in psychiatric pathophysiology, and its potential as a novel psychotherapeutic, by leveraging metabolomics, behavioral-, transcriptomics and DNA methylation analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The <italic>Chdh</italic>-deficient mice revealed remnants of psychiatric behaviors along with schizophrenia-related molecular perturbations in the brain. Betaine supplementation elicited genetic background-dependent improvement in cognitive performance, and suppressed methamphetamine (MAP)-induced behavioral sensitization. Furthermore, betaine rectified the altered antioxidative and proinflammatory responses induced by MAP and in vitro phencyclidine (PCP) treatments. Betaine also showed a prophylactic effect on behavioral abnormality induced by PCP. Notably, betaine levels were decreased in the postmortem brains from schizophrenia, and a coexisting elevated carbonyl stress, a form of oxidative stress, demarcated a subset of schizophrenia with “betaine deficit-oxidative stress pathology”. We revealed the decrease of betaine levels in glyoxylase 1 (<italic>GLO1</italic>)-deficient hiPSCs, which shows elevated carbonyl stress, and the efficacy of betaine in alleviating it, thus supporting a causal link between betaine and oxidative stress conditions. Furthermore, a <italic>CHDH</italic> variant, rs35518479, was identified as a <italic>cis</italic>-expression quantitative trait locus (QTL) for <italic>CHDH</italic> expression in postmortem brains from schizophrenia, allowing genotype-based stratification of schizophrenia patients for betaine efficacy.</p>

<sec>
<title>Interpretation</title>
<p>The present study revealed the role of betaine in psychiatric pathophysiology and underscores the potential benefit of betaine in a subset of schizophrenia.</p>

<title>Evidence before this study</title>
<p id="p0010">Almost all of the presently available antipsychotics are designed to act on the monoamine receptors or transporters, and their limited efficacy demands novel drug development paradigms. Metabolomic profiling approach in disease biology has been instrumental in deciphering mechanistic insights into disease pathophysiology, enabling the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Altered brain metabolome has been a consistent observation in schizophrenia, and it is also reflected in the peripheral samples. Betaine (glycine betaine or trimethylglycine) is one such metabolite that was observed to be decreased in the plasma samples of patients with first-episode schizophrenia. This prompted us to test the role of betaine in schizophrenia pathophysiology, and to evaluate its potential as a novel psychotherapeutic, by leveraging metabolomics, behavioral-, transcriptomics and DNA methylation analyses.</p>
<sec id="s0010">
<title>Added value of this study</title>
<p id="p0015">We showed that the lack of betaine, stemmed from the genetic loss of Chdh activity in mice, resulted in remnants of psychiatric behaviors and schizophrenia-related molecular perturbations in the brain. Interestingly, the betaine supplementation elicited genetic background-dependent improvement in cognitive performance. Furthermore, betaine supplementation showed psychotropic action in pharmacological animal models of schizophrenia and rectified the altered antioxidative and proinflammatory responses characteristic of the model. In agreement with these observations, betaine levels were seen decreased in the postmortem brains from schizophrenia, and a coexisting elevated carbonyl stress (a form of oxidative stress) demarcated a subset of schizophrenia with “betaine deficit-oxidative stress pathology”. We further showed that the decreased betaine levels were consistent with the elevated carbonyl stress, in glyoxylase 1-deficient hiPSCs and betaine supplementation was efficacious in alleviating elevated carbonyl stress. We also identified a <italic>cis</italic>-expression quantitative trait locus (QTL) for <italic>CHDH</italic> expression in postmortem brains from schizophrenia, enabling genotype-based stratification of schizophrenia patients for betaine efficacy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="p0025">There is an urgent need for novel medicines with new actions for psychiatric illness, because almost all of the present therapeutics are designed to act on the monoamine receptors or transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0005">1</xref>], and there is a substantial population where the presently available drugs are unsatisfactory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0010">2</xref>]. Altered brain metabolome and its reflection in peripheral samples is a growing observation in schizophrenia, which could be beneficial for deciphering molecular pathophysiology of schizophrenia and thereby identifying novel druggable targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0015">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0020">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0025">[5]</xref>]. Betaine (glycine betaine or trimethylglycine) is a metabolite that is reported to be decreased in the plasma sample of patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FESZ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0015">3</xref>]. In their report, they examined the plasma metabolites from FESZs and healthy controls in order to identify biomarkers for schizophrenia. The reduction of the betaine level was replicated in the second sample set, suggesting future use of betaine as a clinical biomarker for schizophrenia.</p>
<p id="p0030">In vertebrates, betaine is ingested from the diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0025">5</xref>] and is also endogenously synthesized in mitochondria from its precursor choline using choline dehydrogenase (CHDH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0020">4</xref>]. To date, several biological functions of betaine have been proposed, which include (i) osmotic regulator (compatible solute) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0030">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0035">7</xref>]; (ii) antioxidative/anti-inflammatory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0040">8</xref>]; (iii) supplier of methyl donor <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0045">9</xref>]; and (iv) mitigator of noxious elevated homocysteine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0050">10</xref>] (Supplementary Fig. 1). The latter two are endowed through acceleration of the turnover of the methionine–homocysteine cycle (constituting one‑carbon metabolism together with the folate cycle), where betaine serves as a substrate in the betaine–homocysteine <italic>S</italic>-methyltransferase (BHMT) reaction, converting homocysteine to methionine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0055">11</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>).<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Methionine–homocysteine cycle and biosynthesis of betaine.

<p id="p0035">In this study, we aimed to test the role of betaine in schizophrenia pathophysiology, and to evaluate its potential as a novel psychotherapeutic. Using <italic>Chdh</italic> (a gene for betaine synthesis)-deficient mice and betaine-supplemented inbred mice, we assessed betaine-related metabolite dynamics and the effects of betaine deficits and supplementation, by leveraging metabolomics, behavioral-, transcriptomics and DNA methylation analyses. Further, we queried whether betaine deficits and the associated pathology are observed in postmortem brains from schizophrenia. We examined the efficacy of betaine in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) manifesting elevated carbonyl stress, which is a tributary of oxidative stress and caused by accumulation of “advanced glycation end products” (AGEs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0060">12</xref>] (Supplementary Fig. 2). The enhanced carbonyl stress is known to underlie the pathophysiology of a subset of schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0065">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0070">14</xref>]. Lastly, we searched for genetic variants that can be used as a biomarker to predict “betaine-responders”.</p>

<title>Study approval</title>
<p id="p0045">All the animal experiments were performed in compliance with relevant laws, and guidelines were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee at RIKEN (permission numbers: H29–2-204 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0015">3</xref>] and 2016–058 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0020">4</xref>]) and the Chiba University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (permission number: 31–342). Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) study was approved by the Human Ethics Committee at RIKEN for iPSC study (Wako-daisan 25–14). The subject for hiPSC study gave informed, written consent to participate in the study after being provided with, and receiving an explanation of study protocols and objectives. Experiments in postmortem brain samples were approved by Fukushima Medical University, Japan (1685 and 2381) and Niigata University School of Medicine, Japan (G2015–0827). All procedures of postmortem brain study were carried out with the informed written consent of the next of kin.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p id="p0050">The inbred C57BL/6NCrl (B6N) and C3H/HeNCrl (C3HN) mouse strains were obtained from Japan's Charles River Laboratories (Yokohama, Japan). The animals were housed in groups of four in standard cages, in a temperature and humidity-controlled room with a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 08:00). The animals had free access to standard lab chow and tap water. All animal experiments were done using male animals (six to 15 animals/group, depending on experiments) between 9:30 am and 5:00 pm. In the study using the <italic>Chdh</italic> KO mice, the wild-type littermates by intercross between heterozygotes were used as control. All the analyses were conducted between nine and 14 weeks of age, except for the novel object recognition test (NORT) using the ICR strain (purchased from Japan SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan), which was started at 7 weeks of age.</p>

<title>Postmortem brain samples</title>
<p id="p0055">Postmortem brain tissues (BA17; Brodmann Area 17) from schizophrenia and age-matched control samples were obtained from the Postmortem Brain Bank of Fukushima for Psychiatric Research and Brain Research Institute, Niigata University, Japan (in total <italic>n</italic> = 24 for schizophrenia and <italic>n</italic> = 31 for control) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0075">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0080">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0085">[17]</xref>]. Each individual with schizophrenia fulfilled the diagnostic criteria established by the American Psychiatric Association (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-IV) and had no history of any other neurological disorder or substance abuse. The age matched control samples were with no history of neuropsychiatric disorders. Also, neuropathological evaluation in the control brain samples ruled out any pathological abnormalities characteristic of neurological disorders, though some brains showed indication of mild senility.</p>

<title>Estimation of betaine and other metabolites</title>
<p id="p0065">Choline, methionine, betaine, cystathionine, cystine, <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and <italic>S</italic>-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) levels were estimated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Cysteine, homocysteine and glutathione (GSH) were measured as their reduced forms by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The plasma levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (CRE), aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and cholinesterase (CHE) were measured using dry-chemistry analysis (Fuji Dri-Chem 3500 V; FUJIFILM Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).</p>

<title>Behavioral analyses</title>
<p id="p0070">All behavioral tests relevant to psychiatric illnesses, except for the methamphetamine (MAP)-induced behavioral sensitization test, were performed according to the previously published methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0090">18</xref>]. For the MAP-induced behavioral sensitization test, see the Supplementary Methods. When the effect of betaine supplementation on impairment of the NORT performance by chronic PCP treatment was examined, male ICR mice at 7 weeks of age were given betaine (2.5% as monohydrate in drinking water) or water until the day 29. Either PCP (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (saline) was subcutaneously administered once a day to the ICR mice from the day 15 to the day 26. The NORT experiment was started at the day 26 as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0095">19</xref>]. The mice were habituated in the experimental environment for 3 days. The training and test sessions were conducted at the days 29 and 30, respectively.</p>

<p id="p0115">In vertebrates, betaine is biosynthesized by two biochemical reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>). The first step, oxidation of choline to betaine aldehyde, is mediated by choline dehydrogenase encoded by the <italic>Chdh/CHDH</italic> gene, and in turn, betaine aldehyde is converted into betaine by betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase. To create an animal model with lowered betaine level, the first coding exon, exon 2 of the <italic>Chdh</italic> gene, was targeted by the CRISPR/Cas9n on the genetic background of the inbred B6N mouse (Supplementary Fig. 3a and b).

<title>Betaine levels and effects of betaine supplementation in <italic>Chdh</italic>-deficient mice</title>

Total homocysteine levels in the brain after betaine supplementation was also unchanged in the two inbred strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>h).

<title>Effects of betaine supplementation in inbred mouse strains</title>
<p id="p0155">To determine the therapeutic potential of betaine in psychiatric disorders, betaine was administered via drinking water (2.17% betaine) for 3 weeks to the two inbred mouse strains; B6N and C3HN. In general, efficacy of drugs, in particular neurotropics, varies with respect to the individual patients or genetic backgrounds. The same 15 distinct behavioral phenotypes as evaluated in the <italic>Chdh</italic>-deficient mice were measured. Notably, betaine supplementation elicited the differential behavioral effects in the two strains. In the novel object recognition test (NORT), B6N mice showed significantly longer stay time at a novel object in the retention session in the betaine-supplemented group compared to the water-drinking control, suggesting improved cognitive memory performance in the B6N strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0020">Fig. 4</xref>a). In contrast, C3H mice showed no significant improvement in the performance by betaine supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0020">Fig. 4</xref>a). Although we do not know the reason for the difference between the two strains, it may be related to the much lower preference to a novel object at the basal level when compared to familiar one in C3H mice. Both B6N and C3HN mouse strains showed better performance with betaine supplementation in the Y-maze test, which assessed the spatial working memory ability, compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0020">Fig. 4</xref>b). However, no significant changes were observed in the NORT or Y-maze test, resulting from the genetic loss of Chdh activity (Supplementary Fig. 6), potentially due to the supplementation of betaine from the chow and/or intestinal bacterial flora. There were no significant differences between the betaine-administered and control groups in B6N or C3HN animals in the other behavioral tests, and importantly no behavioral measures were impaired by betaine treatments in both strains (data not shown). No gross abnormalities in blood chemistry were also observed (data not shown).<fig id="f0020"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Betaine supplementation improved cognitive performance and elicited gene expressional changes.

These results suggest that betaine's action against MAP-induced sensitization involves, at least in part, antioxidant/proinflammatory response system.</p>

<title>Altered oxidative stress and proinflammatory conditions, and working memory deficit were rescued by betaine administration in in vitro and in vivo phencyclidine models</title>
<p id="p0175">We further pursued betaine's action against oxidative stress conditions in in vitro phencyclidine (PCP) model. Chronic administration of PCP, a noncompetitive <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, produces schizophrenia-like behaviors in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0200">40</xref>]. This psychotomimetic effect is known to be partly associated with oxidative stress given by PCP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0095">19</xref>]. Because the deteriorating effect of PCP on neuronal system is also observed in the primary neuron culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0205">41</xref>], we examined the expressional changes of the same genes as in the MAP treatment experiments, plus <italic>Sod3</italic> (this gene is expressed in rat brain but not in mouse brain), in this paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0030">Fig. 6</xref>a).

<p id="p0190">To investigate the relationship between betaine system abnormality and oxidative stress conditions in schizophrenia, we specifically focused on the carbonyl stress in the postmortem brain samples. AGEs analysis identified the three schizophrenia brain samples (#SZ01, #SZ05 and #SZ12) that showed a strong band (~30 kDa protein(s)) having Nε-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0035">Figs. 7</xref>k and l), one of AGEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0060">12</xref>]. The three samples showed betaine levels of below average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0035">Fig. 7</xref>a), although the correlation of the two measures (betaine levels and CEL modification levels) did not fulfill a statistical significance possibly due to the sample number limitation. This finding suggests a relationship between elevated carbonyl stress and lowered betaine levels. Furthermore, these three patients displayed relatively high symptom scores evaluated by using the Diagnostic Instrument for Brain Studies (DIBS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0210">42</xref>] (Supplementary Table 13). Collectively, the results of postmortem brain study highlighted the existence of a subset of patients with schizophrenia characterized by “betaine deficit-oxidative stress” pathology, manifesting relatively severe psychotic symptoms.</p>

<title>Betaine's potency in alleviating carbonyl stress in <italic>GLO1</italic>-deficient hiPSCs</title>
<p id="p0195">Because coexistent betaine pathology and elevated carbonyl stress were evident in a subset of schizophrenia cases, the efficacy of betaine supplementation in mitigating the carbonyl stress in isogenic lines of <italic>GLO1</italic>-deficient hiPSCs was tested. We firstly confirmed that there were no missense variants in the genome of the subject (mentally healthy) for the genes in the carbonyl stress pathway (Supplementary Fig. 2). The <italic>GLO1</italic>-deficient hiPSC lines were prepared by harnessing the CRISPR-Cas9 system, and they contained homozygous <italic>GLO1</italic> KO alleles (KO-1, KO-2 and KO-3) causing frameshift mutations in exon 1 and premature stop signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0040">Figs. 8</xref>a and b), and showed no protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0040">Fig. 8</xref>c). As controls, three lines (WT-1, WT-2 and WT-3) were established that were proven to harbor the normal <italic>GLO1</italic> alleles. The <italic>GLO1</italic>-deficient hiPSC samples displayed a major band of ~55 kDa (called “band A") with increased modification by carboxymethyllysine (CML), another species of AGEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0060">12</xref>] (representative picture in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0040">Fig. 8</xref>c). When betaine was added to cell culture, concentration at 500 μM significantly suppressed the CML modification of “band A" (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0040">Fig. 8</xref>d), indicating betaine's efficacy against elevated carbonyl stress. The <italic>GLO1</italic>-disrupted hiPSCs showed comparable morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0040">Fig. 8</xref>b) with those of the WT, but they manifested reduced differentiation potential into neural lineage, which could not be rescued by the betaine supplementation (data not shown).<fig id="f0040"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Betaine suppressed accumulation of advanced glycation products (AGEs) in hiPSCs and a genetic variant affected <italic>CHDH</italic> expression in brain.

Three hiPSC lines for each genotype (WT-1-3 and KO-1-3) were established. (b) Phase contrast images of WT-1 and KO-1 are presented. WT-2-3 and KO-2-3 showed morphology similar to WT-1 and KO-1 (data not shown). Scale bar: 400 μm. (c) Cell (WT-1 and KO-1) lysates were analyzed in western blotting using an antibody against carboxymethyllysine (CML), a typical type of AGEs. Note that the signal around 55 kDa (arrow head; “band A") was greatly enhanced by depletion of the intact GLO1 proteins. The filter was also probed with anti-GAPDH antibody as a loading control and anti-GLO1 antibody to show a loss of the GLO1 protein in the <italic>GLO1</italic> KO (−/−) cells. (d) KO-1 was cultured for four days in the absence or presence of indicated concentrations (5, 50, or 500 μM) of betaine. The results of western blot analysis of the cell lysates are presented (top).

<title>Pharmacogenetic evaluation of betaine efficacy in schizophrenia</title>
<p id="p0205">We have revealed the differential efficacy for betaine in the mouse strains with distinct genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Fig. 5</xref>). Since a subset of schizophrenia patients were characterized with betaine deficit-oxidative stress pathology and the betaine treatment was effective in alleviating carbonyl stress, we speculated that the efficacy for betaine might have a genetic predisposition. <italic>Cis</italic>- eQTL analysis of common genetic variants in <italic>BHMT1, CHDH</italic> and <italic>GLO1</italic> genes in postmortem brain tissues revealed a significant association of a <italic>CHDH</italic> variant, rs35518479, with its expression levels in the brain (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0040">Fig. 8</xref>f, Supplementary Figs. 10a and b).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="p0210">In the present study, we provided a proof of concept for the potential of betaine in the treatment of schizophrenia from the analyses of both mouse and human samples, along with the identification of “betaine deficit-oxidative stress” pathology in a subset of schizophrenia, which may result in relatively severe symptoms. Our systematic examination of betaine's role (see Supplementary Fig. 1) showed that the betaine's action as a psychotropic is imparted partially through antioxidant/proinflammatory effects. In addition, a regulation of DNA methylation capacity may be possible, from metabolomics/methylome analyses of mouse and human samples. Notably, analyses of two different inbred mouse strains highlighted an interaction of genetic background × drug (e.g. betaine), and distinct pharmacogenetic profiles (e.g. MAP) according to genetic background. Also, no differences in the brain betaine levels were observed between the two strains, before and after betaine supplementation (data not shown), ruling out strain (genetic) differences in brain betaine turnover.</p>
<p id="p0215">Although the more detailed mechanism of betaine's biological effects remains to be clarified in the future study, it is worth noting that methionine, the primary enzymatic product of BHMT (betaine-homocysteine methytransferase), functions as a powerful antioxidant molecule. Furthermore, it should be pursued whether the expressional modulation of genes for antioxidant/proinflammatory cascades by the betaine treatment is mediated via epigenetic changes elicited by the methylation of histone or DNA, where SAM is used as a methyl donor.</p>
<p id="p0220">Betaine, tri-methylglycine, is very simple in the chemical structure. It receives step-wise breakdown to glycine in mammals: betaine to di-methylglycine, di-methylglycine to mono-methylglycine, and mono-methylglycine to glycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>). It is unlikely that these downstream compounds may play a positive role to exert betaine's effect, because di- and mono-methylglycine were under the detection limit (data not shown) in mouse and postmortem human brain samples, probably reflecting very rapid degradation of di-methylglycine into glycine by demethylation. In addition, the concentration of glycine seemed relatively stable even by the manipulation of the <italic>Chdh</italic> gene or the supplementation of betaine in mice, excluding the idea stated above.</p>
<p id="p0225">In this study, we detected a substantial accumulation in CEL adduct of ~30 kDa protein(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0035">Fig. 7</xref>k) and CML adduct of ~55 kDa protein(s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0040">Fig. 8</xref>c) in postmortem brain and <italic>GLO1</italic>-KO iPSCs, respectively. It was unexpected to see AGEs in a relatively protein-specific manner under carbonyl stress, since the Maillard reaction (Supplementary Fig. 2) is deemed to occur non-enzymatically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0060">12</xref>]. Molecular identification and characterization of the specifically modified proteins and the mechanism of the specific modifications remain to be studied.</p>
<p id="p0230">Although we did not address in this study, another known function of betaine is osmotic regulation (Supplementary Fig. 1), and the deficits in brain betaine levels may contribute to cellular osmotic perturbation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0030">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0035">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0215">43</xref>], which is reported to inhibit methionine uptake, inhibit protein synthesis, and affect the mRNA translation by dysregulation of phosphorylation and mTOR signaling cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0220">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0225">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0230">[46]</xref>]. These pathways are shared with those identified in the transcriptomics analysis of <italic>Chdh</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0015">Fig. 3</xref>f). Although taurine, <italic>myo</italic>-inositol, glycine and glutamine are thought to play major roles as osmolytes in the brain because of their higher cellular contents; betaine is favored in neural cells as an osmolyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0030">6</xref>]. Thus, the osmotic issue should be pursued in future studies.</p>
<p id="p0235">Since betaine has already been approved as a therapeutic drug for homocystinuria, an autosomal recessive inherited disorder due to a deficiency of cystathionine beta synthase (CBS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb0235">47</xref>], it has the advantage of being repositioned for psychiatric illness. The utility is also substantiated by our observation that betaine can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and is well tolerated with no serious adverse effects.</p>
<p id="p0240">Interestingly, we identified an eQTL for <italic>CHDH</italic> expression, which substantiates genotype-based stratification of schizophrenia patients for betaine efficacy. Future studies are warranted to validate the utility of “betaine deficit-oxidative stress pathology” as a biomarker and to identify other genetic underpinnings for betaine's efficacy. It is also worthwhile to test the availability of betaine in clinical setting for schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric conditions.</p>
