<abstract>
<p>The time and costs associated with the sequencing of a human genome have decreased significantly in recent years. Many people have chosen to have their genomes sequenced to receive genomics-based personalized healthcare services. To reach the goal of genomics-based precision medicine, health information management (HIM) professionals need to manage and analyze patients' genomic data. Two important pieces of information from the genome sequence are the risk of genetic diseases and the specific medication or pharmacogenomic results for the individual patient, both of which are linked to a patient's genetic variations. In this review article, we introduce genetic variations, including their data types, relevant databases, and some currently available analysis methods and systems. HIM professionals can choose to use these databases, methods, and systems in the management and analysis of patients' genomic data.</p>
