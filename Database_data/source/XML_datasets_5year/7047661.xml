<abstract id="ABS1">
<p id="P1">Beverages make important contributions to nutritional intake and their role in health has received much attention. This review focuses on the genetic determinants of common beverage consumption and how research in this field is contributing insight to what and how much we consume and why this genetic knowledge matters from a research and public health perspective. The earliest efforts in gene-beverage behavior mapping involved genetic linkage and candidate gene analysis but these approaches have been largely replaced by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS have identified biologically plausible loci underlying alcohol and coffee drinking behavior. No GWAS has identified variants specifically associated with consumption of tea, juice, soda, wine, beer, milk or any other common beverage. Thus far, GWAS highlight an important behavior-reward component (as opposed to taste) to beverage consumption which may serve as a potential barrier to dietary interventions. Loci identified have been used in Mendelian randomization and gene√óbeverage interaction analysis of disease but results have been mixed. This research is necessary as it informs the clinical relevance of SNP-beverage associations and thus genotype-based personalized nutrition, which is gaining interest in the commercial and public health sectors.</p>
