<abstract>
<p>Enterotypes are used for classifying individuals based on the gut microbiome. A number of studies are available to find the Enterotypes in
healthy individuals; however, most of them lack comparisons at the world level. We analyzed the healthy human gut microbiomes of 495
datasets available in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) database derived from fifteen countries from four continents. Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes were the two most abundant phyla in the healthy human gut, worldwide. A high ratio of Proteobacteriato Actinobacteria and
a low abundance of Prevotella were identified as the indicators of IBD. Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Bifidobacterium were identified as the
Enterotypes in the inter-continental comparisons. At the intra-continental level, two (Bacteroides and Ruminococcaceae), four
(Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Clostridiales), and two (Prevotella, Bacteroides/Bifidobacterium) Enterotypes were identified in the
American, European, and Asian continents, respectively. In addition, a high abundance of the unknown genus of Ruminococcaeae was
observed in the Colombian human gut microbiome. A substantial impact of the geographical distance was observed on human gut
microbiome variations, demonstrating a cumulative effect of factors, including dietary habits, genetics, lifestyle, environment, and climate,
etc.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Healthy human harbors trillions of microbial cells with health
promoting effects inside its gut, in a ratio of 1:1 with respect to the
human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref>, which is known as the "gut microbiome". The
beneficial roles of the gut microbes have prompted a large number
of studies towards exploring their roles in healthy individuals.
Initial studies have focused on a limited number of healthy
individuals from different regions and demonstrated differences in
their gut microbiomes primarily due to inter-individual variations
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref>. With the advancements in the sequencing technologies, more
studies, including the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) initiative
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref> and the METAgenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract
(MetaHIT) consortium project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref>, have been initiated, which
focused on a larger number of healthy human individuals and
reconfirmed the inter-individual variations among the gut
microbiomes. The compositional makeup of the gut microbiome is
known to vary in healthy individuals, however, only to a very
minute extent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>.</p>
<p>Due to the underlying inter-individual variations, healthy
individuals can be clustered separately based on the differences in
the enrichment of the microbial taxa in their guts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>. These
enriched taxa are termed as Enterotypes and have been found to be
independent of age, gender, body mass index(BMI), and
geography. However, the methodologies and a few parameters
used for determining the Enterotypes are known to affect the
clustering of samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09">9</xref>. For example, two independent studies
conducted on the human gut microbiomes of healthy individuals
from The United States of America (USA) demonstrated different
numbers of Enterotype clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>. These differences could be
attributed to the two different methods used for Enterotypedetermination
in these studies. The other factor, viz., the variable
region of 16S rRNA gene used for metagenomic sequencing is
shown to moderately affect Enterotype-determination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09">9</xref>. The type
of metagenomic sequencing, viz., 16S rRNA gene or Whole Genome
Shotgun (WGS) based method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09">9</xref>, is known to weakly affect the
Enterotype determination. In addition to being widely used as the
potential biomarkers for healthy human gut, the Enterotypes have
recently been used in context to predicting their associations with
diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> and dietary intervention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>.</p>
<p>An initial study conducted on the healthy individuals from the
European countries, Japan, and USA demonstrated an existence of
three Enterotypes in the healthy human gut microbiome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>.
Another study conducted only on the individuals from the USA
found only two Enterotype clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>. Further, the identified
Enterotypes were not only limited to the originally identified taxa,
viz., Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Ruminococcus, but Bifidobacterium
and Enterococcaceae were also observed as Enterotypes in the
individuals from Saudi Arabia and Taiwan, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>.
The Enterotypes have been determined at individual country level
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, intra-continental level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, and also at inter-continental level
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>[8]. Although, a few of these studies included a large number of
samples in the Enterotype-determination at inter-continent level,
however the numbers of countries included in these studies were
limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to the characterization of the Enterotypes, the impact of
different factors, including age, geography, birth mode, antibiotics,
diet, and genetics, on healthy human gut microbiome has been
investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>. However, the effect of geography has been
comparatively less studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>. In addition, these studies
included only a limited number of countries ranging from one <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
to twelve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>[23] for their analyses. Of these, a human gut microbiome
study on twelve countries demonstrated that latitude was
positively and negatively correlated with the abundances of phyla
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>. In another study,
the microbiome analysis of native Tibetan and Han Populations
living at different altitudes showed a significant influence of
altitude on the microbiome structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>. Similarly, a recent study
revealed geographical patterns of active and standing human gut
microbiome in health and disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>. Besides, there are a few
studies which explored the effect of geographical location on the
healthy human gut microbiome by using a combination of different
microbial profiling methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>. Interestingly, the gut microbial
variation with respect to the geographical distance was not
quantified in any of these studies.</p>
<p>In the present study, we have conducted a comprehensive
Enterotype analysis by using publicly available 16S rRNA gene
amplicon data from fifteen countries belonging to four continents,
viz., Asia, Africa, America (North and South), and Europe. We have
determined the compositional variation and diversity (alpha and
beta) patterns present within the healthy human gut microbiomes
with respect to their geographical locations followed by their
quantifications.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Data retrieval of publicly available human gut microbiome datasets:</title>
<p>The publicly available raw 16S rRNA gene based metagenomic
datasets from fifteen countries, viz., Burkina Faso, Egypt, India,
Malaysia, China, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, Italy, Sweden,
Spain, USA, Argentina, and Colombia were retrieved from the
European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena)
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Preprocessing of the datasets:</title>
<p>Paired-end sequences generated by the Illumina sequencing
method were merged using the fastq-join method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> with default
parameters. The QIIME software package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> was used for the
downstream preprocessing analysis. After, the raw fastq sequences
were converted into their corresponding fasta files and quality
value files using python scripts available in the QIIME
environment. This was followed by quality filtering process using
the parameters, including, minimum length (150 bp), maximum
length (1000 bp), and Q value (20). Further, the quality filtered
reads were removed using the reference based chimera filtering
method, usearch61 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, using the green genes database v13_8
(gg_13_8) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>. This was followed by the operational taxonomic unit
(OTU) identification step, which was carried out by usearch61
method implemented in the vsearch tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> using the reference
based OTU picking method against the gg13_8 database. The
representative OTUs were used to elucidate the taxonomic
inference of the reads by aligning them with the 16S rRNA gene
sequences of the gg13_8 database using an identity cut-off of 97%
using PyNAST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>. For calculating the ratio of taxa abundance at
the phylum level (Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes and
Proteobacteria/Actinobacteria) the country level relative
abundances of the taxa, was used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Diversity analysis:</title>
<p>The alpha diversity of the datasets were calculated using three
alpha diversity based methods, including Shannon index, Observed
species, and Phylogenetic diversity (PD) whole tree. The t-test was
employed for the determination of the significance among the alpha
diversities of the countries. The microbial diversity among the
datasets was estimated by calculating the beta diversity indices
using weighted and unweighted unifrac distances. Further, a
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out using the
weighted and unweighted unifrac distances to calculate the
similarity and dissimilarity among the datasets based on their
microbiome structure and diversity. PCA results were visualized
using the Emperor tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> present within the QIIME software.
Further, jackknifed beta diversity was calculated using the
unweighted and weighted unifrac distances to check the robustness
of the beta diversity results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Enterotype determination:</title>
<p>To determine the Enterotype clusters in the human gut microbiome,
a widely used enterotyping pipeline (http://enterotyping.embl.de)
was used. The optimum number of the clusters was identified using
the Calinski-Harabasz (CH) index, whereas robustness of the
clusters were accessed using the Silhouette index. The Kruskal-
Wallis test was implemented to check the significant differences
(p &lt; 0.05) of taxa abundance and diversity across Enterotypes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Core OTUanalysis:</title>
<p>The OTUs were considered as core OTUs of a given continent if
they were present in at least 80% of the human gut microbiome
samples with a relative abundance of at least 0.001 in any two
countries of a given continent. Further, the shared and unique
genera among the continents were calculated by only considering
the presence or absence of the genera in the continents. To identify
the shared genera at the inter-continental level, at first the presence
of the given genus is confirmed in all the countries of a given
continent. The genera from all the countries which qualified this
stepwere further compared to identify those genera which were
shared by all the continents. Similarly, unique genera were
identified for the continents which were present uniquely in a given
continent and was absent in all other continents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Correlation analysis between the geographical distance and human gut microbiome:</title>
<p>The latitude and longitude of the countries analyzed in this study
were retrieved using the ggmap R package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>. The geographical
distance between the countries was calculated using the script
available in the QIIME package. Further, a correlation between the
gut microbiome distance (weighted and unweighted unifrac
distance) and the geographical distance were calculated using the
Mantel Correlation method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>. Mantel correlations were
calculated between two distance matrices and the square of the
Mantel correlation value explain the percent of variability present
in one matrix due to the other matrix. The correlation between the
latitude with bacterial (Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) abundance
was calculated using the Spearman's correlation. A p-value &lt; 0.05
was considered for the statistical significance. A flowchart of
methodology and bioinformatics tools used for the present analyses
is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="s3">
<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>We used 597 datasets representing healthy human gut microbiome
from fifteen countries for this analysis. A total number of
31,126,235raw read sequences were obtained from these 597
datasets. The quality-filtering step resulted in a total number of
29,229,968reads. After removing the chimeric sequences, a total
number of 28,427,739 read remained in the processed datasets.
Following this, OTUs were predicted per sample and those samples
containing low number of predicted OTUs (&lt; 250 OTUs) were
removed from the further analyses. This resulted in 495 datasets
belonging to fifteen countries. In order to estimate the number of
OTUs per country, all the OTUs predicted in each dataset of a
country were combined together. The total number of predicted
OTUs was found to vary from 1,257 to 5,660 (
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).The
sequencing depth also varied enormously among different
countries, which is known to introduce biases during the estimation
of rare taxa. In order to account for this bias, we performed a
rarefaction analysis to estimate a minimum number of reads
required to capture the complete diversity of each sample
(Available with Authors) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>[34]. The sampling was found to be
sufficient to capture the complete diversity of each dataset. Further,
taxonomic assignments were carried out for the datasets of each
country and the number of known genera identified in the samples
varied from 57 to 152 (Table 1).</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Composition Analysis:</title>
<p>In the present study, we have retrieved 24 phyla, 56 classes, 114
orders, 202 families, and 427 genera across all the 495 samples.
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were found as the most abundant
phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), however, their relative abundances varied among
different countries. At the country level, Colombian and Burkina
Faso datasets were found to be at the extremes with Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes as the most enriched phyla, respectively. In order to
determine the proportion of Firmicutes (F) to Bacteroidetes (B) in
healthy human gut microbiome, we determined F/B ratio of the
datasets from all the countries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The F/B ratio was found
to be &gt; 1 for most of the Asian countries, except for Malaysia. Four
out of six Western countries exhibited F/B ratio &gt; 1. For those
Western countries, which did not follow this trend, a very small
difference was observed between the percentage abundances of
these two phyla. We further observed positive and negative
correlations of the relative abundances of the phyla Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes with latitude, respectively as observed previously
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, however, no statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05) was observed
(Available with Authors).</p>
<p>The phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were found to be the
next major taxa in the healthy human gut microbiome (Figure 2).
The phylum Actinobacteria is an important part of healthy human
gut microbiome. Particularly, Bifidobacterium of Actinobacteriais of
high relevance as it is one of the commonly used probiotics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,
because of its important roles in the immune system maintenance
and protection against pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>. Interestingly, Actinobacteria
is the keystone taxon of microbiome due to its high degree of
ecological connectedness to interact with other microbes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>. In our
analysis, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria was found to be
less in the human gut microbiome as compared to that of Firmicutes
and Bacteroidetes and is consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>.An
overall higher abundance of phylum Actinobacteria was observed
in the Asian continent as compared to that in the remaining three
continents (Figure 2). Of all the Asian countries, Japan showed a
highest relative abundance of this phylum, which is in
corroboration with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>. Further analysis revealed
Bifidobacterium as the most abundant genus of the phylum
Actinobacteria in the Asian and the European countries (Available
with Authors).</p>
<p>It is known that in the human gut, Bifidobacterium has high
abundance of glycoside hydrolases to degrade starch than the other
microbes residing in the gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>. The populations of the Asian
countries, including, Japan, China, and India, are known to
consume high starch based diet on a regular basis. This might have
possibly led to a high abundance of Bifidobacterium in the Asian gut
microbiome as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>. Proteobacteria was found
as the next most abundant phylum in our study in the healthy
human gut microbiome after the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes,
and Actinobacteria. In our analysis, Egyptian human gut
microbiome showed the highest relative abundance of the phylum
Proteobacteria followed by those of India, Malaysia, and Italy
(Figure 2). The phylum Proteobacteria is known to significantly
explain the existing variability of the human gut metagenome at the
functional level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Alpha Diversity Analysis:</title>
<p>The overall alpha diversity showed differences within the datasets
of the different countries, but without any statistical significance
(p &lt; 0.05)(Figure 3A). Of these, the Shannon based alpha diversity,
which represents the richness and evenness of the taxa, revealed a
similar diversity pattern across the European countries. Within the
Asian continent, also a similar pattern was observed, except for
India and Malaysia, which exhibited very low alpha diversities in
comparison to the other Asian countries. The African continent
showed a high diversity in Egypt as compared to Burkina Faso.
Further, Colombia exhibited a very high alpha diversity as
compared to the other countries in the American continent. Among
all the fifteen countries, Colombia and India exhibited the highest
and the lowest diversities, respectively. This indicates Colombia to
be the most and India to be the least diverse in the richness and
evenness of the taxa.</p>
<p>The PD whole tree based index was used to infer the phylogenetic
diversity of different datasetsto resolve the effect of
phylogenetically related taxa on the overall alpha diversity. A lot of
variation in the phylogenetic diversity was observed within the
datasets of all the four continents, except for Asia (Figure 3B).
Although all the European datasets exhibited a similar alpha
diversity in terms of the evenness and richness of the taxa,
however, differences were observed among their phylogenetic
diversities. Maximum and minimum phylogenetic diversities were
observed for Swedish and Italian datasets, respectively. However,
the datasets of the American and African continents exhibited
similar trends of the Shannon and Phylogenetic based alpha
diversities. Among the Asian samples, only few minor differences
were observed between the Shannon and Phylogenetic alpha
diversities in different countries. Overall, Sweden exhibited the
most phylogenetically diverse gut microbiome, whereas Italy was
the least diverse in its gut microbiome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Beta Diversity Analysis:</title>
<p>In order to estimate the beta diversity, a PCA was performed on all
the datasets using weighted unifrac distance metric (Figure 4A).
This metric encompasses the effect of the abundance of taxa, which
impacts robust clustering of the datasets than their separation into
different clusters. Only the Asian datasets exhibited a distinct
cluster along the PC1 and PC2 axes. A clear separation could not be
obtained for all the other continents using this method. Hence, we
opted for an unweighted approach as it is known to demonstrate an
effect of only the presence and absence of the taxa on the separation
of the gut microbial datasets in three-dimensional (3D) spaces. This
analysis resulted in a clear separation of the samples belonging to
the Asian, American, European, and African continents (Figure 4B).
However, a mixed cluster was observed for a few datasets
primarily belonging to the South American population followed by
some datasets from the other countries, including, Egypt, India,
Italy, Malaysia, and Sweden. It is interesting to note that although
the Asian datasets differed from the samples of the other
continents, however, they exhibited a large variation in the gut
microbiomes among themselves, which is shown by the spread of
the datasets along the PC2 axis. Similar findings were observed for
the American datasets. Further, a better separation of the datasets
into distinct clusters using the unweighted unifrac distance method
indicated significant roles of the less abundant taxa for the
distinction of the datasets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3d">
<title>Enterotype Analysis:</title>
<p>We identified three optimal and robust Enterotype clusters using
the Principle Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) from the gut microbiome
of the 495 datasets (Figure 5). The genera Bifidobacterium, Prevotella,
and Bacteroides were the highly abundant Enterotype taxa in the
cluster 1, cluster 2, and cluster 3, respectively (Figure 6 (A - C)). A
majority of the datasets from the Asian countries, including Japan,
Taiwan, China, and Thailand were clustered into the Enterotype
cluster 1 (Available with Authors). Thus, this cluster, dominated
by the genus Bifidobacterium, might represent a signature taxon for
the Asian-population. Cluster 1 also contained a few samples from
some of the non-Asian countries, primarily including Colombia and
Italy. The Enterotype cluster 2, which is mainly driven by the
genusPrevotella, demonstrated a mixed cluster of various countries
from different continents. A majority of the datasets from Burkina
Faso, India, Indonesia, and Sweden were the members of this
cluster. Further, a majority of the human gut microbiome datasets
from Spain, Argentina, USA, Egypt, and Malaysia were clustered
into the Enterotype cluster 3 with Bacteroides as the major driving
genus for this cluster. Thus, this cluster might represent signature
taxa for the Western-population.</p>
<p>Previously, Gorvitovskaia et al. had compared the worldwide
population using a dataset of 747 healthy human individuals from
the countries belonging to the four continents, viz., Asia, America,
Europe, and Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>. They obtained two dominant Enterotypes,
including Bacteroides and Prevotella. However, in our study, we also
observed a third Enterotype cluster dominated by the Asian
countries, represented by the genus Bifidobacterium. It is important
to note that Gorvitovskaia et al. used only Japan as a representative
country of the Asian continent, however,we have used seven Asian
countries, including Japan, India, China, Taiwan, Indonesia,
Thailand, and Malaysia. Earlier studies have demonstrated
Bifidobacterium as a dominant Enterotype of Saudi Arabia [14]. The
existence of this third Enterotype in our analysis could be mainly
due to the enrichment of the genus Bifidobacterium in the Asian
countries.In order to explore the geographic regional effects on the healthy
human gut microbiome, we determined the Enterotype in each
continent. We identified two, four, and two Enterotype clusters in
the healthy human gut microbiomes of the American, European
and Asian continents, respectively (Figure 7). For the African
dataset, we found a very high number of the optimum clusters
(Available with Authors)which may be due to a less number of the
datasets included in our study, so the Enterotypes could not be
determined. The Enterotype clusters identified in the Asian
population were clearly separated into two clusters and exhibited
no overlap. This indicated the occurrence of two sub-types of the
Asian population based on the human gut microbiome. Enterotype
cluster 1 of the Asian continent was dominated by the genus
Prevotella (Available with Authors). This genus has been observed
as one of the driving Enterotypes in the healthy human
gutmicrobiomes ofthe Indian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, Indonesian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, and Kazakh
populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>. However, the relative abundances of two genera,
including Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium were found to be high in
cluster 2 (Available with Authors). This is in corroboration with a
previous study, which was carried out using the Asian countries,
including China, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>. It is
important to note that, we have included two more Asian countries,
viz., India and Malaysia, in our analysis in addition to those
included in the above mentioned study. Thus, the cluster 2 is driven
by two dominant Enterotype genera viz., Bacteroides or
Bifidobacterium. In a recent study, Enterobacteriaceae was identified
as the third Enterotype in the Taiwanese population and was
suggested as an Asian sub-Enterotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, however, we did not
identify this taxon as an Enterotype.</p>
<p>The Enterotype clusters identified in the American continent were
also clearly separated into two clusters and exhibited no overlap.
This indicated the occurrence of two sub-types of the American
population dominated by the Enterotypes Bacteroides and
Ruminococcaceae. The datasets from the USA were distributed
almost equally between these two Enterotype clusters. A few
previous studies carried out on adults and children of the USA also
demonstrated Bacteroides as the driving Enterotype of the healthy
gut microbiome of this country <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>.
Most of the Argentinean
datasets belonged to the Enterotype cluster Bacteroides, whereas,
most of the Colombian datasets comprised a part of the Enterotype
cluster driven by an unknown genus of Ruminococcaceae. This
indicated that this unknown genus of Ruminococcaceae might be a
potential Enterotype of the Colombian population. The Colombian
gut microbiome exhibited very interesting results. In a very recent
analysis with 441 Colombian human gut microbiome samples, no
discrete Enterotype clusters of Bacteroides and Prevotella could be
obtained [46]. A lack of Bacteroides and Prevotella Enterotypes in this
population has been attributed to its gut microbial composition
which is neither Western nor non-Western.</p>
<p>We also investigated the top ten highly abundant genera in each
country (Available with Authors)and observed a high abundance
of the members of the unknown genus of Ruminococcaeae in the
Colombian human gut microbiome. The genus Bifidobacterium was
absent in the top ten highly abundant genera in the Colombian
datasets, thus confirming its very low abundance. Thus, it is an
intriguing question that how a majority of the Colombian datasets
still got clustered into the Enterotype cluster driven by the genus
Bifidobacterium in our inter-continental analysis. The difference in
the relative abundances of Bacteroides and Prevotella was found to be
very low in the Colombian datasets as compared to those of the
other countries. This might have prohibited the clustering of the
Colombian datasets in the Enterotype clusters driven by these two
genera and might have forced these samples to be a part of the third
Enterotype cluster. A large dominance in the number of the
samples from the Asian continent might be responsible for the
formation of the third Enterotype cluster, which was primarily
driven by the genus Bifidobacterium.</p>
<p>Unlike the Asian and American continents, the European continent
was found to harbor four Enterotype clusters, which were
dominated by the genera including, Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides,
Prevotella and Clostridiales. Interestingly, the clusters belonging to
the genera Bacteroides and Clostridiales were partly overlapping. This
indicated that the European population could be further divided
into three sub-populations based on the gut microbiome. Two of
these sub-populations were dominated by the genera
Faecalibacterium and Prevotella, while the third sub-population
comprised a mixture of the individuals carrying the genera
Bacteroides and Clostridiales as the dominant taxa. This also indicated
that the European population is more diverse as compared to the
Asian and American populations in terms of the dominating genera
in their gut microbiomes.At the continent level, we could not detect any distinct Enterotype
clusters in the African continent. However, during our intercontinental
comparisons, a majority of the datasets from Burkina</p>
<p>Faso got classified into the Enterotype cluster driven by the
genusPrevotella(Figure 5). The genus Prevotella has been identified
as one of the driving Enterotype taxon in the adult rural African
population in an earlier study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>. It is well known that the African
diet consists of high fiber rich plants, which has been shown to
increase the abundance of Prevotella in the gut microbiome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>. In
our inter-continental comparison analysis, the majority of the
Egyptian datasets exhibited Bacteroides and Prevotellaas the
dominant Enterotype (Figure 5). In an earlier study carried out on
healthy Egyptian children, the genus Bacteroides has been identified
as the driving Enterotype taxon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>. However, this genus is also
identified as the major driving Enterotype taxon in the Autism
Spectrum Disorder and their neurotypical siblings in the Egyptian
children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>. Interestingly, a recent study revealed the presence of
Prevotella enriched Enterotypes clusters in the healthy Egyptian
children [45]. Thus, the Enterotype status of the Egyptian
population remains unclear and requires further investigation.</p>
<p>The members of the microbiome residing in the same niche are
known to cross-talk among themselves, thus, might also affect the
growth and survival of one another. In order to delineate the effect
of the dominant driving taxa on the overall microbial diversity, we
inferred the species richness in the Enterotype clusters. This
analysis revealed a statistically significant lower microbial diversity
(p-value &lt; 0.05) only in the datasets belonging to the Enterotype
cluster driven by Bacteroides (Available with Authors) which is in
corroboration with an earlier study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. A lower microbial
diversity within the Bacteroides enriched human gut microbiome
samples indicate a higher competition for the growth and survival
of Bacteroides with the other microbes residing in the same niche.
Prevalence/Indicators of Inflammatory Bowel Disorder:
Inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD) is a very common gutassociated
disorder throughout the world. A dysbiosis in the
members of the phylum Proteobacteria has been linked to induce
metabolic syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref> and an overabundance of this phylum
ascompared to that in healthy gut microbiome has been linked with
IBD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>. On the other hand, a reduced relative abundance of
Collinsella spp. of Actinobacteria has been implicated in IBD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>.
This indicated that an increase and decrease in the relative
abundances of the members of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria,
respectively, can be linked to IBD.</p>
<p>During the last century, IBD was more prevalent in the Western
countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,however, recently it has been observed to increase in
the Asian and African countries as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>. Towards this, we
explored the ratio of Proteobacteria (P) and Actinobacteria (A) in
our samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) (Available with Authors). Interestingly, P/A
was found to be &lt; 1 for all the Asian datasets with an exception of
Malaysia. Recently it has been reported that the incidences of IBD
are on a constant rise in Malaysia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>. All the western countries
from the American and European continents, except for Sweden,
exhibited a P/A ratio &gt; 1. The other exceptions were Burkina Faso
and Egypt, which exhibited P/A ratio &gt;1, with Burkina Faso
demonstrating the highest P/A value among all the fifteen
countries. Recent studies showed an increase in the reporting of the
IBD cases in the Egyptian and African population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>. Thus, the
high P/A ratio as exists in the healthy human gut microbiome may
be a factor associated with the increasing incidences of IBD.
Another important indicator of predisposition towards IBD could
be the enrichment level of the genus Prevotella in the healthy human
gut microbiome. Recent investigation of the role of Prevotella
Enterotypes in the healthy and disease gut microbiome revealed a
less association of this genus with IBD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. Thus, an enrichment of
genus Prevotella in the human gut microbiome may confer beneficial
health effects with respect to IBD. Interestingly, from our analysis,
we observed a high enrichment of the genus Prevotella in the Asian
and African countries (Available with Authors). A high abundance
ofPrevotella has been linked with the dietary habits viz., intake of
more plants and fiber based diets which are very common in Africa
and Asia. However, the Western countries from the American and
European continents, except for Sweden, exhibited a lower
enrichment of the genus Prevotella.</p>
<p>Taken together, a higher P/A ratio and a lower abundance of
Prevotella in the human gut microbiome might be the factors
associated with the rising incidences of IBD. For example, the
Western countries exhibited a higher P/A ratio and a lower
abundance of Prevotella and are known to exhibit higher incidences
of IBD. On the contrary, the Asian countries exhibited a lower P/A
ratio and a higher abundance of Prevotella thus corroborating with
comparatively lesser incidences of IBD. African countries exhibited
a higher ratio of P/A and also a higher abundance of Prevotella. This
indicated that these two factors have been counter-balancing each
other and might be eventually promoting healthier phenotype. A
shift in the trends of these factors might act as the indicator for the
occurrence of IBD.</p>

<title>Core Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs):</title>
<p>Though the individual gut microbiomes differ from each other,
there exists a core set of microbial members, which performs
essential functions in the healthy human gut. Towards this, we
identified 11, 98, 55, and 15 core OTUs in the African, Asian,
European, and American continents, respectively (Available with
Authors). In addition to the core OTUs in different continents, we
identified a total of 115 genera which were present across all the
four continents (Available with Authors). Although the continents
share these common genera, however with varyingabundances
(Available with Authors). A majority of the shared taxa were
found to be belonging to the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes,
Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. At the family level, a majority of
the shared taxa across the continents were found to be belonging to
Lachnospiraceae, Coriobacteriaceae, Veillonellaceae,
Enterobacteriaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae.</p>
<p>The functional roles of the core taxa were analysed
comprehensively by performing thorough literature survey
(Available with Authors).The members of the family
Lachnospiraceae are the known producers of short chain fatty acids
(SCFAs), including acetate, butyrate, and propionate by the
degradation of the complex polysaccharides. These SCFAs are
further utilized by the host for their energy needs. The members of
the family Ruminococcaceae are well known butyrate producers of
butyrate from carbohydrate. Some members of the family
Veillonellaceae have been known to produce propionate from
lactate. Coriobacteriaceae family is found to be implicated in the
bile acid metabolism processes. Further, recent studies indicated the
association of family Erysipelotrichaceae with the lipid metabolism
of host. These results indicate that the healthy human gut
microbiome consists of the common microbial members which are
mainly responsible for fulfilling the metabolism and energy
requirements of the host. In addition to the presence of the common
genera across the continents, we also observed 58, 70, 10, and 25
unique genera, which were found to be exclusively present in the
continents, Asia, Africa, Europe, and America, respectively
(Available with Authors).</p>

<title>Correlation between the Geographic Distance and the Microbiome Variation:</title>
<p>We have investigated the effect of the overall geographical distance
of the fifteen countries on the healthy human gut microbiome
variations based on the weighted and unweighted unifrac distance
metrics. The weighted unifrac distance reflects the effect of the
abundance of the microbial taxa. A Mantel correlation value of 0.34
(Rw) was observed between the geographical distance and the
weighted unifrac distance matrix. This implied that 11% (Rw2) of the
healthy gut microbiome variations based on the abundant taxa
might be explained by the geographical distance. A higher Mantel
correlation value of 0.64 (Ru) was observed between the
geographical distance and the unweighted unifrac distance matrix.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the unweighted unifrac distance reflects
the effect of only the presence and absence of the microbial taxa and
is independent of the relative abundance of the taxa. This implied
that 40% (Ru2) of the gut microbiome variations based on the taxa
present in gut, including rare taxa, might be explained by the
geographical distance. These observations indicate that the
geographical variations might be affecting the diversities of the
rarer abundant taxa more than these of the highly abundant taxa.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The present study has demonstrated significant differences among
the healthy human gut microbiomes of different countries, in terms
of the composition, diversity, and Enterotypes. Three dominant
Enterotype clusters driven by the taxa Bifidobacterium,Prevotella,
andBacteroideswere identified across the worldwide population. The
generaBifidobacteriumand Bacteroides were identified as the major
Enterotype taxa of the Asian and Western (American and
European) populations, respectively, whereas, the African datasets
were distributed between Prevotella and Bacteroides. The Enterotype
clusters driven by the genera Bacteroides and Prevotella were more
robust as compared to the third cluster. The composition of the
third cluster might vary with respect to the datasets included in the
analysis. The members of the family Ruminococcaceae were
identified as the signature taxa of the Colombian
population.Besides these distinctions in the gut microbiomes, core
taxa conserved across the continents were identified with
predominant involvements in the process of metabolism and
energy production.The low abundant taxa were identified as the
important factors for the distinction of the microbiomes from
different geographical regions. Such, low abundant taxa were also
found to be predominantly affected by the geographical distances.
In addition, a higher P/A ratio and a lower abundance of Prevotella
might be an indicator of the rising incidence of IBD, however,
comprehensive studies on IBD patients are required to confirm this
hypothesis. It is important to note that the possibility of our
observations being affected due to the differences in the variable
regions of the 16S rRNA gene used in the independent studies,
cannot be ruled out. This analysis provides a snapshot of the effect
of the geographical factor on the healthy human gut microbiome
which may be impacted by various other factors, including dietary
habits, genetics, lifestyle, environment, and climate, etc.</p>
