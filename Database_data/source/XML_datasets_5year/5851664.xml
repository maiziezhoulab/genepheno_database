<p>Cocaine self-administration persistently reduces MHCI in dopamine neurons, resulting in relapse to cocaine seeking.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) is an important immune protein that is expressed in various brain regions, with its deficiency leading to extensive synaptic transmission that results in learning and memory deficits. Although MHCI is highly expressed in dopaminergic neurons, its role in these neurons has not been examined. We show that MHCI expressed in dopaminergic neurons plays a key role in suppressing reward-seeking behavior. In wild-type mice, cocaine self-administration caused persistent reduction of MHCI specifically in dopaminergic neurons, which was accompanied by enhanced glutamatergic synaptic transmission and relapse to cocaine seeking. Functional MHCI knockout promoted this addictive phenotype for cocaine and a natural reward, namely, sucrose. In contrast, wild-type mice overexpressing a major MHCI gene (H2D) in dopaminergic neurons showed suppressed cocaine seeking. These results show that persistent cocaine-induced reduction of MHCI in dopaminergic neurons is necessary for relapse to cocaine seeking.</p>

<body><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) is a cell surface protein that is responsible for antigen presentation to immune cells. Antigen peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum via transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). In mouse endoplasmic reticulum, antigens bind to the light chain [β-2 microglobulin (β2M)] and a heavy chain (for example, H2D or H2K) of MHCI. This complex is then transferred to the cell surface and recognized by appropriate T cells. Double-knockout (KO) mice of β2M and TAP are defective in stable assembly and intracellular transport of MHCI, which results in impaired surface expression of MHCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Consequently, these double-KO mice are often used as functional MHCI KO mice. Although MHCI is expressed in nearly all nucleated cells, including neural cells, the brain has traditionally been considered an immune privileged region. However, MHCI plays an important role in synapse elimination in addition to its immune system role in mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>). Recently, the neuron-specific role of MHCI has gained much attention, particularly in brain regions related to learning and memory, such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>). In these brain regions, MHCI binds and signals via a key MHCI receptor, paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB), which is expressed in neuronal subsets throughout the brain, including glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>). PirB also functions as a β-amyloid receptor, and its activation leads to interaction with cofilin, an actin-severing protein that facilitates actin depolymerization, and results in altered synaptic plasticity and synaptic loss associated with Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>). Furthermore, in functional MHCI KO mice, elimination of long-term depression and enhancement of long-term potentiation leads to extensive synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>), which ultimately results in learning and memory deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). Although MHCI is highly expressed in the dopaminergic neuron-rich, ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region important for brain reward functions, the contribution of MHCI to this function has not previously been considered.</p><p>Addiction is a homeostatic disorder of brain reward function that is characterized by vulnerability to relapse of reward-seeking behavior even after long abstinence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>). Although drug addiction remains a serious public health problem worldwide, there are still no effective pharmacological drugs available. Hence, further understanding of the mechanisms underlying drug addiction is important for identifying novel factors that can be targeted for pharmacological treatment. In a previous study, we established a novel, drug self-administration system for mice, using an intrathecal microdialysis technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). Our method enabled daily 24-hour unlimited access to addictive drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>), which models human drug addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>). We applied this system to various transgenic mice to identify genes involved in the pathogenesis of drug addiction. Accordingly, we found that MHCI expressed in dopaminergic neurons plays a key role in decreased glutamatergic synaptic transmission and reward-seeking behavior. Moreover, repeated cocaine intake persistently reduced MHCI expression in dopaminergic neurons, and this deficiency contributed to the underlying mechanism of relapse to cocaine seeking.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Enhanced reward-seeking behavior in functional MHCI KO mice</title><p>We used our novel drug self-administration system on adult male wild-type (WT) and double-KO mice of β2M and TAP1 (β2M<sup>−/−</sup>TAP1<sup>−/−</sup>), both of which are necessary proteins for MHCI function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>), for analysis of cocaine (Coc) or vehicle (Veh) self-administration. Upon a nose-poke into the active hole (active nose-pokes), mice received an intrathecal cocaine infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), paired with a brief tone and light illumination as the conditioned stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). This protocol enabled WT and β2M<sup>−/−</sup>TAP1<sup>−/−</sup> mice to acquire similar cocaine self-administration behavior during the 10-day acquisition period (fig. S1A). After a 10-day extinction period, active nose-poke reinstatement in response to the conditioned stimulus without cocaine was used to measure relapse to cocaine-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Cocaine- and sucrose-seeking behavior in WT and functional MHCI knockout (KO) mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Computed tomography image showing a mouse with a microdialysis probe implanted into the supracerebellar cistern.

The groups exhibited no differences in nose-poke frequency into a dummy hole with no reinforcement (inactive nose-pokes), locomotor activity during this period, or active nose-pokes during other periods, suggesting that increased active nose-pokes are due to enhanced cocaine seeking rather than general hyperactivity (fig. S1, B to D). In contrast, cocaine-induced locomotor activity was enhanced in β2M<sup>−/−</sup>TAP1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, particularly during the acquisition period (fig. S1D), indicating that MHCI also contributes to cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization. Consistent with this, β2M<sup>−/−</sup>TAP1<sup>−/−</sup> mice showed greater behavioral sensitization after seven daily cocaine injections than WT mice, and this enhancement was significantly larger in β2M<sup>−/−</sup>TAP1<sup>−/−</sup> mice than single-KO mice of β2M or TAP1 (fig. S1E).</p><p>Next, we analyzed the contribution of MHCI to reward-seeking behavior for a natural reward such as sucrose (fig. S2A). Although much larger increases in active nose-pokes were observed for sucrose than vehicle in both genotypes during the acquisition period, active nose-pokes during reinstatement were similar between sucrose and vehicle groups in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref> and fig. S2B), showing transient reinforcement of sucrose, consistent with another report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>). In contrast, β2M<sup>−/−</sup>TAP1<sup>−/−</sup> mice showed more active nose-pokes for sucrose than vehicle during the reinstatement period. However, because an ascending fixed-ratio (FR) schedule of reinforcement during the acquisition period amplifies cue-induced sucrose reinstatement, it is possible that increasing FR may augment sucrose reinstatement in WT mice in this experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>). The numbers of inactive nose-pokes and locomotor activity in all periods, active nose-pokes during other periods (fig. S2, B to D), and sucrose preference (fig. S2, E and F) were similar between genotypes. These results indicate that MHCI plays a crucial role in suppressing reward-seeking behavior, and its deficiency contributes to relapse to reward seeking for cocaine as well as a natural reward.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cocaine-induced persistent reduction of MHCI in dopaminergic neurons</title><p>We found that MHCI, an immune protein, plays a key role in suppressing reward-seeking behavior. Given that previous studies have demonstrated cocaine-induced modulation of immune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>), it is possible that cocaine intake may impair MHCI function, causing relapse to cocaine-seeking behavior. Therefore, we analyzed MHCI expression levels in brain regions associated with cocaine addiction in WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>). First, we used an experimenter-administered cocaine injection procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Seven daily cocaine injections caused behavioral sensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) that persisted for at least 10 days of abstinence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>). On the day after abstinence, mice were decapitated for mRNA analysis by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the brain regions examined, mRNA levels of H2D [a classical MHCI gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>)] were specifically reduced in the VTA of cocaine-injected mice after abstinence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). H2D protein levels were also decreased in VTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Alternatively, cocaine-induced interferon-γ mRNA elevation in VTA returned to control levels during abstinence (fig. S3A), suggesting that persistent H2D mRNA reduction is unlikely due to a transient inflammatory response induced by cocaine injection.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Cocaine-induced decrease of MHCI expression in the VTA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimenter-administered cocaine injection procedure.

Repeated cocaine intake led to decreased H2D and H2K [another classical MHCI gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>)], concomitant with altered expression of MHCI-related genes (fig. S3B). Furthermore, we observed statistically significant negative correlation between H2D mRNA and the number of active nose-pokes divided by the number of inactive nose-pokes during the reinstatement period in WT mice (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.26, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (fig. S3C). Conversely, H2D reduction was not observed with the sucrose self-administration protocol (fig. S3E). Collectively, these findings indicate that cocaine persistently reduced MHCI expression in the VTA, which possibly contributed to relapse to cocaine-seeking behavior.</p><p>We also compared cocaine-induced increases in expression of dopamine transporter (DAT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and dopamine receptor D2, candidate molecular markers associated with cocaine addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>). Expression levels of DAT and TH were elevated in VTA with the experimenter-administered cocaine injection procedure (fig. S3A), whereas expression levels of all dopamine-related genes were considerably higher in β2M<sup>−/−</sup>TAP1<sup>−/−</sup> mice with the cocaine self-administration model (fig. S3D). With sucrose self-administration, a similar but not significant pattern of dopamine-related gene expression was observed in β2M<sup>−/−</sup>TAP1<sup>−/−</sup> mice (fig. S3E). These results suggest that enhanced dopamine-related gene expression is also caused by reduced MHCI expression.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Expression of MHCI in dopaminergic neurons</title><p>Because MHCI is expressed in the VTA and substantia nigra of the midbrain, with dopaminergic neurons present in both regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><italic>25</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27"><italic>27</italic></xref>), we performed immunohistochemistry to determine the VTA cell types that express MHCI under normal conditions.

In contrast, H2D overexpression in dopaminergic neurons suppressed the relapse to cocaine seeking. Dopaminergic neuronal activity is a primary reward signal in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37"><italic>37</italic></xref>), which is regulated by glutamatergic synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>). MHCI is necessary for decreased glutamatergic synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>); therefore, our findings suggest that postsynaptic MHCI expressed at dopaminergic neurons is critical for decreased glutamatergic synaptic input and suppressed relapse to cocaine seeking. Because MHCI consists of multiple genes with compensatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>), we used global KO β2M and TAP1 mice for functional MHCI KO. Although H2D overexpression, predominantly in dopaminergic neurons, suppressed the relapse to cocaine seeking, it is important to confirm that MHCI (particularly in dopaminergic neurons) contributes to the relapse to cocaine seeking using conditional KO mice. Furthermore, repeated cocaine intake persistently reduced MHCI expression, which was accompanied by increased glutamatergic synaptic transmission to VTA dopaminergic neurons, and ultimately, enduring cocaine-seeking behavior. Altogether, these results suggest that cocaine-induced reduction of MHCI expression in VTA dopaminergic neurons may be an underlying mechanism for relapse to cocaine seeking.</p><p>In our previous study, we developed intrathecal drug administration as an alternative to intravenous administration to allow 24-hour unlimited access to cocaine in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>). We rigorously investigated cocaine self-administration behavior and observed similar behaviors with intrathecal and intravenous self-administration methods, except for the appearance of escalation and binge patterns. However, it is important to compare the molecular effects of cocaine between these methods in future studies because there may be differences due to the different administration routes.</p><p>Among the brain regions examined, repeated cocaine intake persistently reduced MHCI expression only in the VTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). This suggests that MHCI plays a key role in reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior particularly in this region. The VTA is an important region for cue-induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>) and drug-induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><italic>40</italic></xref>) reinstatement, as well as the initiation phase of cocaine self-administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"><italic>41</italic></xref>). Here, we also show that H2D overexpression specifically in VTA dopaminergic neurons attenuates cue-induced reinstatement. In contrast, cocaine-induced locomotor activity did not recover in mice overexpressing H2D in VTA dopaminergic neurons (fig. S6, F to H), although it was enhanced in β2M<sup>−/−</sup>TAP1<sup>−/−</sup> mice lacking MHCI function throughout the brain (fig. S1D). These findings imply that MHCI expressed in other brain regions, such as the NAc, contributes to cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>).</p><p>Regarding the relapse mechanism for cocaine seeking, a persistent increase in glutamatergic synaptic transmission to VTA dopaminergic neurons has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32"><italic>32</italic></xref>). This persistent increase may be attributable to enhanced potentiation and suppressed depression of glutamatergic synaptic transmission to dopaminergic neurons. Accordingly, increased expression of genes for synaptic potentiation (for example, brain-derived neurotrophic factor) was identified after repeated intake of addictive drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42"><italic>42</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45"><italic>45</italic></xref>). However, contribution of genes for synaptic depression to drug addiction has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we show that MHCI plays a key role in synaptic depression, with cocaine intake causing persistent reduction of MHCI expression in VTA dopaminergic neurons. These results support our idea that repeated cocaine intake induces persistently reduced MHCI expression and leads to enduring enhancement of synaptic transmission in VTA dopaminergic neurons, overall resulting in long-lasting cocaine-seeking behavior.</p><p>Accompanied by increased glutamatergic synaptic transmission, repeated cocaine intake also up-regulated dopamine-related gene expression. Because dopamine-related gene expression is regulated by neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46"><italic>46</italic></xref>), this observed up-regulation may be attributable to increased synaptic transmission induced by suppressed MHCI expression. A tendency of MHCI reduction was detected before abstinence from cocaine intake, although up-regulation of dopamine-related gene expression was observed after abstinence (fig. S3A). Hence, persistent cocaine-induced reduction of MHCI expression may increase glutamatergic synaptic transmission, which possibly up-regulates dopamine-related gene expression in VTA dopaminergic neurons.</p><p>Cocaine also has non-neuronal actions at immunocompetent cells in the central nervous system. Activation of central immune signaling pathways is considered to play a significant role in cocaine addiction via modulation of neuronal-glial interactions, although this effect is complementary and these pathways alone do not produce relevant addictive phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>). It should be noted that immune activation generally induces MHCI expression, whereas cocaine intake suppresses MHCI expression in dopaminergic neurons despite activation of immune signaling pathways. Thus, the effect of cocaine is complex, contributing to the activation of central immune signaling pathways and decreased MHCI expression, both of which may lead to the establishment of neural circuits underlying cocaine addiction. The detailed relationship between these two effects of cocaine on immune signaling factors should be investigated in future studies, although significant contribution of immune signaling factors to cocaine addiction can be expected.</p><p>Although our study focused on a role of MHCI in adults, MHCI is highly expressed in the developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47"><italic>47</italic></xref>) and contributes to neural circuit organization. Deficiency of MHCI function leads to abnormal neural circuits such as strengthened projections from the retina to lateral geniculate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>), increased glutamatergic synaptic transmission to cortical and hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28"><italic>28</italic></xref>), and lack of left-right synapses and circuit asymmetry via NMDAR regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48"><italic>48</italic></xref>). Given that dopaminergic neurons are implicated not only in drug addiction but also in neurodevelopmental disorders, MHCI in dopaminergic neurons may be involved in these disorders. Recent clinical studies have revealed strong association between the <italic>MHC</italic> locus and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49"><italic>49</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50"><italic>50</italic></xref>) and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51"><italic>51</italic></xref>). Consequently, our finding that MHCI plays a critical role in decreased glutamatergic synaptic transmission to dopaminergic neurons and reward-seeking behavior potentially provides a novel landmark in the pathogenesis of drug addiction as well as insight into the molecular basis of neurodevelopmental disorders.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study design</title><p>The present study was designed to determine whether MHCI plays a role in relapse to cocaine seeking.

Daily 24-hour sessions of cocaine self-administration were conducted without any initial priming under unlimited drug-access conditions.

This was followed by an FR2 schedule for 5 days, during which two active nose-pokes were required for cocaine infusion. Each response was reinforced by 12 μg of cocaine infusion over 30 s through the dialysis membrane. We had previously confirmed that this dose is suitable for unlimited cocaine self-administration sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>). As conditioned stimuli, an active nose-poke was accompanied by a brief tone, with each cocaine infusion signaled by illumination of a light above the hole that remained on for 60 s, during which nose-pokes were still counted but no cocaine infused. Nose-pokes in the inactive hole (inactive nose-pokes) were also recorded but had no consequences. In β2M<sup>−/−</sup>TAP1<sup>−/−</sup> and WT mice, the number of active nose-pokes for cocaine but not vehicle almost doubled when the schedule was changed from FR1 to FR2, confirming similar motivation for cocaine self-administration (fig.

This extinction period was followed by a reinstatement period where conditioned stimuli without cocaine infusion were activated by active nose-pokes.

GAD67-GFP knock-in mice were immunostained with anti-GFP antibody for identification of GABAergic neurons (fig. S4D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56"><italic>56</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings</title><p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed as described previously, but with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57"><italic>57</italic></xref>). Briefly, 250-μm horizontal slices including the VTA were prepared from mice the day after the end of the cocaine self-administered extinction period. Mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 25 ml of ice-cold sucrose solution containing 220.0 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10.0 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26.0 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 30.0 mM glucose, 3.0 mM pyruvate-Na, and 1.0 mM ascorbic acid–Na. Brains were rapidly removed and submerged in cold oxygenated sucrose solution for 1 min. After removing the forebrain, cerebellum, and top of the brain with razor blades, slices were cut into sucrose solution using a linear slicer (PRO 7, Dosaka) with a ceramic blade (7550/1/C, Campden Instruments Limited). Slices were placed in an interface storage chamber (BSC3; Scientific Systems Design Inc.) containing standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) consisting of 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.0 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2.0 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26.0 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.0 mM ascorbic acid–Na, and 20.0 mM glucose, aerated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 33°C for 2 hours. Slices were kept at room temperature until recordings.</p><p>Patch electrodes were fabricated from 1.5-mm diameter borosilicate capillary tubing (GD-1.5; Narishige) using a P97 horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments). Electrode resistance ranged from 3 to 6 megohms when filled with solution containing 117 mM cesium methanesulfonic acid, 20 mM Hepes, 0.4 mM EGTA, 2.8 mM NaCl, 5.0 mM TEA-Cl, 2.5 mM MgATP, and 0.25 mM NaGTP. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. For spine analysis, the pipette solution also included 0.2% biocytin. Individual slices were transferred to a recording chamber, perfused at 2 ml/min with aerated standard ACSF containing 100 μM picrotoxin, and maintained at 32°C. Dopaminergic neurons in the medial terminal nucleus of the VTA were identified in current clamps by the presence of large hyperpolarization-activated currents (Ih) during hyperpolarizing pulses from −70 mV (fig. S8). A tungsten bipolar electrode was placed approximately 100 μm rostral to the recording site, and EPSCs were evoked by 300-μs subthreshold stimuli at 0.1 Hz. Neurons were held at −70 or 40 mV as indicated for recordings. Recorded currents were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 1 to 10 kHz using DigiData1322A and pCLAMP9 software (Molecular Devices).</p><p>For analysis of AMPAR/NMDAR ratio, dopaminergic neurons were voltage-clamped at +40 mV. After observing stable EPSCs for several minutes, EPSCs were recorded in the absence and presence of 50 μM D(−)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5) to measure total and AMPAR currents, respectively. For analysis, 10 to 20 EPSCs were averaged for each recording. NMDAR currents were calculated by subtracting the AMPAR current from total current. AMPAR/NMDAR ratio was estimated by dividing peak AMPAR-mediated EPSC by peak NMDAR-mediated EPSC. It should be noted that the effect of functional MHCI KO on AMPAR/NMDAR ratio was observed after daily cocaine self-administration for 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), but not 24 hours after single experimenter injection (20 mg/kg body weight) (fig. S9). NMDA-induced currents were recorded by perfusing 50 μM NMDA for 10 min at +40 mV. For mEPSC analysis, neurons were held at −70 mV in the presence of 50 μM AP5 and 0.5 μM tetrodotoxin, and spontaneous activity was recorded for 20 min. Detection criteria were set at &gt;7 pA. Data were analyzed using Clampfit 9 (Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Spine analysis</title><p>After electrophysiological recordings, slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C overnight. Biocytin was detected with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated to streptavidin (1:500; Molecular Probes). Imaging was performed as described before, but with a slight modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55"><italic>55</italic></xref>). Briefly, sequential <italic>z</italic>-series scans were acquired using a confocal microscope (FV1000-D, Olympus) at high zoom (×2.0) with a 100× oil immersion lens. For analysis of spine morphology, three-dimensional information was acquired every 0.5 μm from approximately 10 sequential <italic>z</italic>-series sections. In each slice, two to three secondary dendrites (80 μm in length on average) were analyzed. Spine density, spine head diameter, and spine neck length were analyzed using Neurolucida (MBF Bioscience). There was no effect of genotype or treatment (cocaine/vehicle self-administration) on neck length (fig. S5F).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Microinjection of rAAV-2 in VTA</title><p>See the Supplementary Materials for construction of rAAV-2 expressing EGFP or H2D. WT mice were deeply anesthetized and placed in a stereotaxic instrument (Narishige). A hole was made on each side of the skull with a dental drill, and a Hamilton microsyringe with 32-gauge needle (Hamilton) was vertically inserted into the VTA (2.7 mm posterior, 0.5 mm lateral, and 4.0 mm ventral to bregma). A 0.2-μl volume of rAAV-2 (titer, 6.0 × 10<sup>11</sup>) encoding H2D or EGFP under control of the TH promoter was microinjected into each side for 5 min. The needle was kept in place for an additional 5 min before it was slowly withdrawn. Microinjections were followed by surgery for self-administration. Mice were individually housed in the colony room and allowed to recover for 14 days, during which the dialysis probe was flushed daily with Ringer’s solution to maintain patency. After cocaine self-administration experiments, brains were removed and sliced to verify the needle location (fig. S10). H2D or EGFP expression levels were confirmed in these slices. Staining was performed as described in the section on immunohistochemistry, except for slice preparation. Briefly, the forebrain, cerebellum, and top of the brain were removed with razor blades, and 200-μm coronal slices were cut into PBS using a vibratome (DTK1500, Dosaka).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are presented as means ± SEM. Group means of WT and β2M<sup>−/−</sup>TAP1<sup>−/−</sup> mice administered cocaine or vehicle were compared using two-way ANOVA (genotype × treatment) followed by least significant difference post hoc analysis. mRNA levels before and after abstinence (fig. S3A) were compared using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc analysis. Paired <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare cocaine versus vehicle and EGFP versus H2D expression groups.</p></sec></sec>
