<abstract>
<p>Understanding the genetic factors underlying neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric
disorders is a major challenge given their prevalence and potential severity for
quality of life. While large-scale genomic screens have made major advances in this
area, for many disorders the genetic underpinnings are complex and poorly understood.
To date the field has focused predominantly on protein coding variation, but given
the importance of tightly controlled gene expression for normal brain development and
disorder, variation that affects non-coding regulatory regions of the genome is
likely to play an important role in these phenotypes. Herein we show the importance
of 3 prime untranslated region (3'UTR) non-coding regulatory variants across
neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We devised a pipeline for
identifying and functionally validating putatively pathogenic variants from next
generation sequencing (NGS) data. We applied this pipeline to a cohort of children
with severe specific language impairment (SLI) and identified a functional,
SLI-associated variant affecting gene regulation in cells and post-mortem human
brain. This variant and the affected gene (<italic>ARHGEF39</italic>) represent new putative
risk factors for SLI. Furthermore, we identified 3′UTR regulatory variants
across autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder NGS cohorts demonstrating their
impact on neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our findings show the
importance of investigating non-coding regulatory variants when determining risk
factors contributing to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. In the
future, integration of such regulatory variation with protein coding changes will be
essential for uncovering the genetic causes of complex neurological disorders and the
fundamental mechanisms underlying health and disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders affect more than 15% of the
population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> and span a range of
complex phenotypes including schizophrenia (SCZ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD),
intellectual disability, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), and language/communicative impairments. Great strides have been made in
understanding the genetic factors contributing to these disorders by screening large
cohorts of affected individuals using next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches
such as whole-exome sequencing (WES) and more recently, whole-genome sequencing
(WGS). However, for many neuropsychiatric disorders, the underlying genetic causes
can be convoluted sometimes involving rare variation across a large number of
causative genes, small contributions from common variants or no clear genetic causes
despite high heritability of the disorder. As such, neuropsychiatric and
neurodevelopmental disorders currently suffer from a high degree of missing
heritability that demands new and different approaches when attempting to identify
and assess genetic variation that could contribute to these disorders.</p>
<p>WES has been a recent method of choice for uncovering causes of neuropsychiatric
disorders such as intellectual disability and ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> due to its ability to rapidly and cheaply
survey the protein coding portions of the genome. However, by design WES only surveys
around 1% of the total genome sequence meaning that the majority of genomic
variation in each individual cannot be assessed via this method. The importance of
surveying non-protein coding DNA—which makes up ~99% of the human
genome—is becoming apparent with the growing popularity of WGS studies. WGS has
now successfully been used to identify hot-spots in the genome that are particularly
susceptible to <italic>de novo</italic> mutations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup>
mutation parent-of-origin effects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> novel
genes underlying intellectual disability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup>
and the prevalence of disruptions of non-coding regulatory regions in autistic
individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> These studies make it
clear that we must take the contribution of non-coding variation seriously if we are
to fully understand the genetics of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental
disorders.</p>
<p>Within non-coding regions of the human genome, regulatory elements such as promoters,
enhancers and untranslated regions are strong candidate regions for pathogenic
variation because they direct how much, when and where a gene is expressed. Variation
in regulatory regions such as single nucleotide variants (SNV’s) or small
indels, as well as larger scale copy number variants have all been shown to
significantly affect gene expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Regulatory variants that result in significantly
reduced gene expression could mimic loss of function coding mutations. Conversely,
given that for many genes too much expression or expression at the wrong place or
time can be as detrimental as gene loss, mutations that increase gene expression or
change its timing/location can also contribute to disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Altered gene expression patterns are a common
feature of neuropsychiatric disorders such as ASD and SCZ and in some cases these
changes in gene expression can be linked directly to genomic/pathogenic
variation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> This evidence points to a strong link between aberrant gene
expression and neurological disorders, suggesting that variants in non-coding
regulatory elements are excellent candidates to fill in some of the missing
heritability of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
<p>To this end, we chose to investigate non-coding variation in an NGS cohort, focusing
specifically on a well-characterised regulatory region that strongly influences gene
expression: the 3 prime untranslated region (3′UTR). 3′UTRs of genes have
long been considered likely candidates for pathogenic mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> and have been
implicated in a range of neurological disorders. Sequencing of genes involved in
tinnitus, Parkinson’s disease, Tourette’s syndrome and ASD have linked
common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and rare variants in 3′UTR
regions to these disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> In addition, a number of key considerations make
these regions strong candidates for pathogenicity and highly amenable to study.
First, 3′UTR regions are found at the end of all protein coding genes in the
genome and are comprehensively annotated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup>
making their identification routine. Second, 3′UTR regions directly affect the
amount of protein produced from a gene transcript via interactions with small
regulatory RNA molecules known as microRNAs. Because these microRNA interactions are
based on complementary nucleotide pairing with short sequences (7–20 bp)
in the 3′UTR regions, they can be accurately predicted from sequence data in a
high throughput manner. Finally, the functional effects of observed variants can be
tested in the lab using simple, scalable assays. Functional testing to show that
putative causative variants have cellular consequences is crucial for determining
pathogenicity of both coding and non-coding variation and the potential scalability
of these assays makes testing microRNA binding site (MBS) variants particularly
attractive for large-scale NGS studies.</p>
<p>Given all these factors, we designed an approach for using NGS data to identify and
functionally test the effects of variation in the 3′UTRome. Herein we show the
efficacy of this method using WES data from a cohort of children classified as having
a neurodevelopmental disorder: specific language impairment (SLI). SLI, the failure
to acquire age appropriate language skills in the absence of any explanatory factors
(e.g. intellectual disability), affects up to 8% of school age
children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> Despite strong evidence for genetic underpinnings of
language impairment, efforts to identify causative factors via linkage and
association studies have found multiple genomic regions, all predicted to have small
effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Thus, like many other
neurodevelopmental disorders, SLI seems to have a heterogeneous set of genetic risk
factors contributing to the phenotype. We used WES data from a cohort of 43 affected
children with severe SLI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> to demonstrate
that it is possible to identify putative causative variants in non-coding 3′UTR
regions using NGS data sets. Importantly we showed that variants can have direct
functional consequences for gene expression by affecting miRNA binding sites, making
them strong candidates for pathogenicity. To show the wider relevance of this class
of variation we demonstrated that non-coding 3′UTR variants that disrupt miRNA
binding sites are found across a range of neurological phenotypes, emphasising their
potential relevance to neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<title>Cloning of constructs for functional assays</title>
<p>To generate the microRNA expression constructs for miR-215, -342 and -346, regions
encoding the primary transcripts were PCR amplified using the primers listed in
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref> ('miRNAs').
The PCR products were then cloned using <italic>Age</italic>I and <italic>Eco</italic>RI
restriction sites in the pLKO.1 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
and the sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.</p>
<p>miR-433 was initially cloned in the same way, but this construct did not express
functional miR-433 when tested in cells (data not shown). As such an alternative
approach was undertaken. MicroRNA primary transcripts have been successfully used
to drive expression of synthetic short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to facilitate gene
knockdown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> In such hybrid
constructs, the sequence of the shRNA replaces the sequence that creates the
stem–loop of the endogenous miR. Because we knew that miR-342 was
successfully expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>),
we inserted the stem–loop of miR-433 (which is responsible for generating
the mature miR-433 sequence) into a plasmid already containing an expression
cassette for miR-342. To facilitate removal of the miR-342 stem–loop from
the miR-342 expression vector unique <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Sal</italic>I restriction
sites were engineered at the 5′ and 3′ (respectively) of the miR-342
stem–loop. The miR-433 stem–loop was amplified using primers
containing <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Sal</italic>I restriction sites (detailed in
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>) and the PCR product was
cloned in place of the miR-342 stem–loop using <italic>Xba</italic>I and
<italic>Sal</italic>I. The sequence was confirmed via Sanger sequencing. Expression and
functionality of this mir-433 construct was confirmed in a 'positive
control' reporter assay (see below; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure
S1A</xref>).</p>
<p>'Positive control' reporter constructs were used to confirm that all
cloned microRNAs were expressed and able to regulate gene expression by
interacting with ideal target sites in a reporter assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Positive control reporters were generated
as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> Briefly, oligonucleotides containing two
high-sensitivity binding sites for the cognate miRNAs were designed. To clone the
reporter cassettes, sense and antisense oligonucleotides were generated and
annealed to each other to form overhangs compatible with <italic>Kfl</italic>I restriction
sites—allowing directional cloning into compatible sites. Oligonucleotides
used for the generation of the reporters are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref> ('miRNA positive control
reporters').</p>
<p>The 3′UTR regions for each candidate gene spanning the patient identified
variants (approximately 300–400 bp; see Figure 3a) were cloned into
the pGL4.24 luciferase expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as reporter
constructs. Control human genomic DNA (Novagen, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA)
was used to PCR amplify the regions of interest (using the primers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>; '3′UTR'). The
sequences were confirmed via Sanger sequencing and shown to contain the
control/reference allele. PCR products were cloned downstream of the
luciferase reporter gene using <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Fse</italic>I restriction sites.
Vectors carrying the alternative allele or with a deletion of the MBS were
generated using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent
Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions and using the primers
in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref> ('3′UTR
SDM'). The presence of the desired changes was confirmed via Sanger
sequencing.</p>

<sec>
<title>Cell culture and transfection</title>
<p>We performed the reporter assays in human HEK293 cells and for comparison in a
mouse neuronal cell line: Neuro2A (N2A) cells. Cell lines were obtained from ATCC
(LGC Standards, Teddington, UK) and are routinely screened for mycoplasma
contamination. Both cell lines are a suitable cellular model as they are easy to
culture and reach very high transfection efficiency. The protein machinery that
microRNAs use to regulate gene expression is ubiquitous and we and others have
previously shown that this machinery is functional across different cell
types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> All the experiments were carried out using cells grown
in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) media supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and
2 m<sc>m</sc> penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were kept for the
entire length of the experiments at 37 °C in the presence of 5%

<p>3.0 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells were seeded in each well of a 24-well plate

constructs were co-transfected into cells alongside the microRNA expression vector
and a Renilla reporter (pRL-TK) for internal normalisation. Forty-eight hours

60 min at room temperature or at 4 °C overnight. Secondary
antibodies were applied for 30–60 min at room temperature. Antibodies
were used as follows: ARHGEF39 (rabbit polyclonal, catalogue #131551,
manufacturer NovoPro Bioscience, Shanghai, China) at 1/2000 concentration,
B-actin (mouse monoclonal, catalogue #A5441, manufacturer Sigma-Aldrich) at

concentration and secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody (donkey
polyclonal, catalogue #16284, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 1/5000

<p>We utilised the Genotype-Tissue Expression project portal (GTEx) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gtexportal.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.gtexportal.org</ext-link>; GTEx Analysis Release V6p) to determine
associations between individual SNPs and the expression of their corresponding
protein coding genes. We assessed genes for single-tissue eQTL values and
generated the multi-tissue eQTL comparison plot using the online ‘Gene
Association’ tool. Plots for individual brain regions were generated using
the ‘Test your own’ tool. Descriptions of the association and

<title>Variant identification in further NGS cohorts</title>
<p>We searched Pubmed for original research articles reporting human whole-genome or
whole-exome data. Articles were selected that interrogated large cohorts related
to neurodevelopmental and/or neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as
parent-of-origin effects. Data sets could only be included for which variant call
files including variants and genomic coordinates were made available online. The
reported statistics from each research article were used to determine the number
of potentially protein altering variants and classify these variants as exonic,
frameshift, missense or nonsense changes. To determine the number of variants in
MBSs, we used the BEDTools intersectBED function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> to overlap genomic coordinates of all reported variants
with the genomic coordinates of all MBSs obtained from the Targetscan 6.2
database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup></p>

<title>3′UTR variants within MBSs can be identified from WES data</title>
<p>We designed a pipeline to identify and assess the functionality of both common and
rare SNVs identified in non-coding 3′UTR regions of the genome and applied
this to a WES data set from a cohort of 43 children with severe SLI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Chen
<italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> identified all SNVs
present in the WES data throughout the genome. To rule out likely false positives,
only SNVs with &gt;10x sequence coverage were retained (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> for SNV numbers identified in different
regions of the genome in this data set). From all filtered variants we extracted
only those SNVs that were within the 3′UTR region of a gene
(<italic>N</italic>=6606, over 4651 3′UTR regions) from these data. For the
majority of 3′UTRs in the genome (62.7% of 3′UTRs annotated by
Ref-Seq), the first ~200 bp had a read depth ⩾10 allowing the reliable
identification of variants in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).
The highest density of MBSs is also found in this initial region of the
3′UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), suggesting that a large
number of binding sites can be assessed per gene, even using the limited region of
the 3′UTR covered by standard exome sequencing.</p>
<p>To determine if any of the 3′UTR variants fell within MBSs, we separately
searched for all predicted sites using the TargetScan algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> and overlaid these with the WES identified
SNVs. Eight 3′UTR SNVs were thus identified within a sequence predicted to
be bound by a microRNA. Three of these were rare variants, only found in a single
individual and each in the 3′UTR of different genes: <italic>BTN2A1</italic>,
<italic>CENPJ</italic> and <italic>MTMR3</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These
were considered to be private mutations as they were not present in other data
sets (dbSNP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> 1000
genomes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> ExAc
browser<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup>), indicating that they
have a population frequency of less than 0.00082%. The presence of these
rare variants in each of the relevant probands was confirmed with bi-directional
Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Five
of these SNVs were identified from dbSNP as SNPs found in the general population
(frequency &gt;0.1%); four are common (population frequency&gt;1%)
and one is rare (0.3%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>A common variant within an MBS is associated with SLI</title>
<p>To determine the relevance of the common (SNP) variants to SLI we took advantage
of genome-wide SNP data from the SLI Consortium (SLIC) sample. This data set
comprised 285 SLI families recruited from five centres across the UK; The Newcomen
Centre at Guy’s Hospital, London (now called Evelina Children’s
Hospital); the Cambridge Language and Speech Project (CLASP); the Child Life and
Health Department at the University of Edinburgh; the Department of Child Health
at the University of Aberdeen; and the Manchester Language Study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> The 43
probands sequenced herein are a subset of this cohort. Two common SNPs (rs1054528
and rs190191374) were not genotyped in the SLIC (SLI Consortium) data set and thus
could not be assessed. However, three of the five common SNPs were directly
genotyped or imputed from the SLIC data set (rs72727021 (imputed), rs383362
(genotyped) and rs1049232 (genotyped)) and thus we could use these data for a
candidate association analysis. Genotype data were available for 983 parents and
children from these 285 SLI families. As previously described, various
quantitative measures of language-related abilities were available for children in
this cohort.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> Measures of
expressive (ELS) and receptive (RLS) language were obtained using the Clinical
Evaluations of Language Fundamentals (CELF-R).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> Verbal IQ (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ) were assessed
using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> and reading and spelling ability were measured with the
Wechsler Objective Reading Dimensions (WORD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> In addition, the phonological short-term memory of
adults and children was assessed with a 28-item test of non-word
repetition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> Association was
assessed within and between family units using the QFAM test in PLINK. This
quantitative test of association employs an adaptive permutation procedure to
account for the dependence between related individuals. One SNP (rs72727021),
located in the 3′UTR of the <italic>ARHGEF39</italic> gene (also known as
<italic>C9orf100</italic>), was associated with the non-word repetition measure in the
SLI cohort (empirical <italic>P</italic>=7.7 × 10<sup>−3</sup>)
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The alternative
‘C’ allele of rs72727021, which has a population frequency of
4.7% (10.8% in 120 CEPH individuals in 1000 genomes pilot phase I),
is carried by 23% of the SLIC probands (MAF=12.3%) and is
associated with a reduction of 10 points (0.66 s.d.) on the non-word repetition
test in these individuals.</p>
<p>We sought to find supportive evidence for the association between rs72727021 and
non-word repetition in other data sets; however, to our knowledge a replication
data set does not exist. We nonetheless queried the association in two independent
data sets: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)
cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> and the Colorado Learning
Disabilities Research Centre (CLDRC) data set.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> Although no significant association was found in these
data sets, a lack of support from these cohorts may reflect variations in sample
ascertainment since the SLIC population was specifically selected for severe
language phenotypes, or the differences in tests used to generate the language
ability metrics. Further investigations in specifically selected samples will be
needed to clarify the genetic association between rs72727021 and language
phenotypes.</p>

<sec>
<title>Functional validation of a WES 3′UTR variant located within an
MBS</title>
<p>From our exome data we have identified four candidate variants located in MBSs
that may be related to the SLI phenotype: one common variant (rs72727021) that is
associated with non-word repetition in the SLI cohort and three rare (private)
variants. Because these MBSs were identified via <italic>in silico</italic> predictions,
we first set out to functionally validate the predicted interaction between these
3′UTR-binding sites and their cognate microRNAs using a reporter assay. We
cloned an approx. 300–400 bp region from each genes 3′UTR,
spanning the predicted miRNA-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).
This was inserted into an expression vector downstream of the luciferase reporter
gene as part of its 3′UTR. We then determined the ability of the relevant
microRNAs to regulate the predicted binding site within the 3′UTR of each
gene. The binding sites identified within the 3′UTRs of <italic>BTN2A1</italic>,
<italic>CENPJ</italic> and <italic>MTMR3</italic> were not regulated by their predicted
microRNAs (miR-342, miR-433 and miR-346, respectively) in these reporter assays,
suggesting they are not functional binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure
3b</xref>). As such we conclude that the rare variants found within these
binding sites are unlikely to disrupt microRNA-3′UTR interactions, and thus
unlikely to directly contribute to SLI via this regulatory mechanism. However,
3′UTRs can have other functions, and as such we cannot rule out that the
presence of these variants might affect other 3′UTR-dependent
post-transcriptional processes and lead to SLI-related phenotypic outcomes.</p>
<p>The binding site within the 3′UTR of <italic>ARHGEF39</italic> is predicted to be
recognised and bound by both miR-215 and miR-192. The seed sequence for these
microRNAs are identical and both microRNAs have the same confidence score (as
predicted by Targetscan), suggesting that they are equally able to bind this site.
Given this equivalence, we used miR-215 to demonstrate the functionality of this
site. The <italic>ARHGEF39</italic> 3′UTR reporter containing the reference allele
of the rs72727021 SNP was significantly downregulated by miR-215 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). miR-215 was also able to significantly repress
the expression of endogenous <italic>ARHGEF39</italic> as demonstrated via western
blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3c and d</xref>). These data demonstrate
that the MBS found in the 3′UTR of <italic>ARHGEF39</italic> is functional, and that
miR-215 downregulates expression by interacting with this site when the reference
'A' allele is present.</p>
<p>We then went on to determine how the presence of the SLI-associated alternative
'C' allele affected this regulatory relationship. Introducing the
alternative 'C' allele into the 3′UTR of the reporter construct
abolished regulation by miR-215 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). To
confirm the specificity of this interaction we also made a variant where the
miR-215-binding site in the 3′UTR was completely deleted. As expected
miR-215 could no longer regulate the reporter construct when the deletion was
introduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Interestingly this loss of
regulation was not significantly different to the control vector (lacking a
3′UTR) or the vector carrying the alternative 'C' allele of
rs72727021 in its 3′UTR. To confirm that this regulation also occurred in a
neuronal cell line and was not a cell-type-specific effect, we also performed
these assays in Neuro2A cells and saw equivalent results (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Together this demonstrates that the <italic>ARHGEF39</italic> 3′UTR can be
downregulated by miR-215 when the rs72727021 reference allele ‘A’ is
present. If the SLI-associated 'C' allele is present, miR-215 regulation
is abolished leading to higher expression, and this effect is as severe as a
complete deletion of the miR-215-binding site.</p>

<sec>
<title><italic>In vivo</italic> brain expression differences are associated with
rs72727021</title>
<p>In addition to these functional assays, we also identified strong support for the
relevance of this variant in controlling <italic>ARHGEF39</italic> expression levels
<italic>in vivo</italic>. We interrogated eQTL data from the GTEx portal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> across all 44 tissue/cell types present
in the database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) and found that the
rs72727021 SNP was significantly associated with <italic>ARHGEF39</italic> expression in
the human brain. Individuals that were heterozygous or homozygous for the
alternative ‘C’ allele had significantly higher <italic>ARHGEF39</italic>
expression in regions of the brain (cortex <italic>P</italic>=6.3e-5; frontal
cortex <italic>P</italic>=9.8e-6; cerebellum <italic>P</italic>=4.3e-4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). This mirrors the loss of repression (higher
reporter gene expression) we observed when the alternative 'C' allele
was present (compared with the reference 'A' allele) during <italic>in
vitro</italic> functional assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). To
support the specificity of this <italic>in vivo</italic> data we checked the GTEx portal
for eQTL effects related to the other four common variants identified in this
cohort (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). No significant differences in
expression were observed for these variants in the human brain, further supporting
the significance of our findings.</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings show that we have identified a common non-coding
SNP with a significant association to SLI and a functional effect on gene
expression in both cell models and the human brain. We believe these data
represent the first time an SLI-associated SNP has been reported to have direct
functional consequences.</p>

<title>Wider relevance of 3′UTRome variation to
neurodevelopmental/neuropsychiatric disorders</title>
<p>Herein we designed and tested an approach that would allow the identification and
functional validation of 3′UTRome variants from NGS data. We tested this
approach using a cohort of language impaired children given the complex genetic
underpinnings of this disorder. To illustrate the potential relevance of this
approach for wider neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, we chose a
selection of recent NGS studies searching for pathogenic or <italic>de novo</italic>
variation in large cohorts and for which variant call files were made available
online. These studies included whole-exome and WGS data sets from cohorts of
bipolar disorder, SCZ, ASD and a study investigating parent-of-origin signatures
of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup> We determined the number of variants in
3′UTR regions that altered MBSs via intersection of these variants with
Targetscan coordinates (as described above) and identified 37 MBS variants in
total. In all studies tested at least one MBS variant was found, and up to 12
<italic>de novo</italic> variants could be identified per cohort (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<sec>
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Herein we demonstrate an approach for identifying and validating the functionality of
non-coding variants from NGS data. We used this approach to identify a non-coding SNP
in an MBS that is associated with SLI and has functional consequences for gene
expression. We also demonstrated the presence of such 3′UTR-MBS variants in
wider cohorts of neuropsychiatric disorders including SCZ, ASD and bipolar
disorder.</p>
<p>This work represents the first report of functional effects for a non-coding SNP
associated with SLI and highlights a possible role for the rs72727021 variant
and/or the <italic>ARHGEF39</italic> gene (in which the variant is found) in language
disorder. Little is currently known regarding the <italic>ARHGEF39</italic> gene, but it is a
member of the ARHGEF family of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors. These
proteins act as molecular switches to regulate diverse processes including
transcriptional regulation, cell migration, cell growth and dendritic
development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref></sup> Other members of this
family have previously been implicated in language impairment
(<italic>ARHGEF19</italic>),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup>intellectual
disability (<italic>ARHGEF6</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref></sup> and
moderate intellectual disability with speech delay (ARHGEF9).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Future studies into the expression pattern and function of
this gene may reveal a potential role for <italic>ARHGEF39</italic> in the development of
language relevant circuitry in the brain.</p>
<p>Given the importance of non-coding DNA for regulating gene expression and the
straightforward approach we propose for assessing these variants, we strongly
recommend that analysis of 3′UTRome MBS variation be included routinely for all
NGS data/pipelines. Although (by design) current WES platforms do not sequence
the entire 3′UTR, we have shown that we can extract functional variants from
exome sequence data using our SLI cohort. Furthermore, we have shown that other
existing WES data sets investigating SCZ and ASD contain <italic>de novo</italic> variants in
MBSs that may contribute to the aetiology of these neuropsychiatric disorders
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). To date, it is estimated that more than one
million exomes have been sequenced using WES. The methodology we propose here is
immediately applicable to any of these existing WES data sets for which raw sequence
reads or called variants are available. The widespread availability of WES data makes
it a cost-effective and practical way to discover functionally relevant non-coding
SNVs related to these neurological phenotypes.</p>
<p>Studies of complex disorders are increasingly making use of WGS, and including our
pipeline when assessing WGS data from large cohorts will allow unprecedented
identification of functional, non-coding risk factors. In the WGS data sets we
surveyed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) even when cohorts were relatively
small,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup> selection criteria were conservative (for example, only
allowing <italic>de novo</italic> variants to be included<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup>), or
when variants were only included from a small number of candidate genes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup> at least one 3′UTR-MBS variant was
identified per cohort, suggesting that this class of variants will be highly
prevalent across WGS studies. Further supporting the relevance of these variants to
phenotypes, the MBS variants we identified in these cohorts were often located in the
3′UTRs of genes previously implicated in their respective disorders. For
example, in the bipolar cohort four MBS variants across six probands were identified
in a leading candidate gene, <italic>ANK3</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup> In ASD cohorts, MBS variants were identified in
<italic>BRD1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> and
<italic>CHD2</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> both of which have
been previously linked to autism via identification of putatively pathogenic <italic>de
novo</italic> protein-coding mutations and copy number variants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref></sup> Indeed, taken together, these findings argue for
examination of the 3′UTR regions of candidate genes across a range of disorders
within existing NGS data sets. Our findings suggest it is likely that new
3′UTR-MBS variants will be identified via this approach that may help to
explain some of the missing heritability of neurodevelopmental/neuropsychiatric
disorders.</p>
<p>NGS has brought astonishingly rapid advances in the high throughput identification of
variants related to phenotypes. Unfortunately our ability to determine which variants
have functional consequences has not kept pace. Yet, if a genetic variant does not
have molecular consequences for a gene or a cell, it is unlikely that it will be
causative or pathogenic, making functional analysis crucial. Algorithms are widely
used to predict functional/pathogenic consequences; however, these have very high
false-positive/negative rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref></sup> reinforcing the importance of functional testing
when attempting to link genetic variation to phenotypes. A major strength of our
approach is that it provides a simple, high throughput method for validating the
functional, molecular consequences of non-coding 3′UTRome variants. Because the
functionality of a microRNA-3′UTR interaction can be determined via a simple
set of reporter gene assays in any cell model, this approach facilitates high
throughput and reliable assessment of the consequences of identified 3′UTR
variants.</p>
<p>In summary, we report an accessible, rapid and biologically relevant method for
assessing non-coding variation that adds significantly to our ability to identify
causative variants from NGS data—a major challenge facing the future of
genomics. Neuropsychiatric disorders suffer from a high degree of missing
heritability and one of the ways we can address this issue is to look beyond a
‘protein-centric’ view of the genome and also address the relevance of
non-coding variation. Adding this simple pipeline to the standard WES/WGS toolkit
is expected to reveal a wealth of functional variation in largely overlooked
non-coding regions of the genome and will help to identify new links between genes
and disorders. Furthermore, by not stopping at identification but performing rigorous
functional characterisation of the molecular consequences of these variants, we will
shed new light on not only the causes of neurological disorders but the fundamental
molecular mechanisms underlying health and disease.</p>

<p>Workflow for identification of non-coding 3′UTRome variants in next
generation sequencing (NGS) data. This flowchart demonstrates how variants can be
identified in non-coding regulatory regions of the genome using NGS data. First, a
list of all variants found within the 3′UTR regions of any genes was
generated from WES data (<italic>N</italic>=6606). This was overlapped with all
predicted microRNA-binding sites in the genome (via targetscan 6.2)
(<italic>N</italic>=54 199) to create a list of variants that lie within
miRNA binding sites in the 3′UTR of known genes (<italic>N</italic>=8). The
identified variants fell into two categories; three rare variants found in a
single proband and five common variants that were annotated in dbSNP. Common
variants were further assessed using candidate SNP analysis in a GWAS study of a
large SLI cohort. One of the common variants showed association with a
quantitative measure of language impairment. SNVs that pass the bioinformatic
screening (<italic>N</italic>=4) are characterised using reporter assays to
demonstrate functionality of the wild-type site and consequences of patient
identified variants. For each stage the number of variants/sites identified in
each category in our SLI study is shown in brackets. 3'UTR, 3 prime
untranslated region; GWAS, genome-wide association study; SLI, specific language
impairment; SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism; SNV, single-nucleotide variant;
WES, whole-exome sequencing.</p>

<p>Identification of non-coding variants in exome sequencing data. (<bold>a</bold>) Average
read depth profile across the 3′UTRome in the SLI WES data set. On average,
we reached &gt;10 × coverage for the first ~200 bp of the 3′UTR
of a gene. For some genes, high coverage extended beyond this boundary, allowing
variants to be called further along the 3′UTR region. (<bold>b</bold>)
Distribution of all predicted microRNA-binding sites across the human
3′UTRome. In total, 54 199 miRNA-binding sites were predicted by
Targetscan. These sites were mapped to their respective genomic positions, showing
that 8127 sites were located within the first 200 bp of a 3′UTR
region. This means that ~15% of all predicted miRNA-binding sites are
located within the first 200 bp of the 3′UTR. This represents the
region with the highest density of miRNA-binding sites in the 3′UTRome and
is also the region for which we have sufficient depth of sequencing in the exome
data to reliably call variation (see dotted red lines). 3'UTR, 3 prime
untranslated region; SLI, specific language impairment; WES, whole-exome
sequencing.</p>

<p>Functional consequences of 3′UTR variants identified in SLI exomes.
(<bold>a</bold>) 3′UTR fragments of <italic>BTN2A1</italic>, <italic>CENPJ</italic>,
<italic>MTMR3</italic> and <italic>ARHGEF39</italic> that spanned the predicted
microRNA-binding sites were cloned downstream of the bioluminescent luciferase
reporter gene. Schematic illustrates the length of the 3′UTR (depicted by a
straight line) relative to the end of the protein coding sequence of each gene
(depicted by a white box), the cloned fragments that was used in reporter assays,
and the identity and position of the 3′UTR variants identified in the SLI
cohort. (<bold>b</bold>) Luciferase reporter assays were used to demonstrate if
predicted binding sites were functionally regulated by the predicted microRNAs.
Candidate 3′UTR regions (shown in part <bold>a</bold>) were cloned downstream of
the luciferase reporter gene. These UTR reporter constructs (3′UTR: +)
were co-expressed with the microRNA that was predicted to regulate each UTR. To
determine specificity of this regulation, control reporters were also tested that
lacked any cloned fragment (3′UTR: −). Expression of the reporter gene
was the same with (+) or without (−) the 3′UTR fragment for
<italic>BTN2A1</italic>, <italic>CENPJ</italic> and <italic>MTMR3</italic>, showing that these sites
were not regulated by these microRNAs (miR-342, miR-433 and miR-346). In contrast,
reporter gene expression was significantly lower when the <italic>ARHGEF39</italic>
3′UTR fragment was present (+) compared to the reporter without any
3′UTR (−), showing that miR-215 represses gene expression by
interacting with the 3′UTR when the reference allele 'A' is
present. No differences in reporter activity were observed in the absence of
miR-215 co-expression (data not shown). (<bold>c</bold>) miR-215 regulates endogenous
<italic>ARHGEF39</italic>. Cells transfected with the miR-215 vector (miR-215; +)
displayed lower expression of endogenous <italic>ARHGEF39</italic> than mock-transfected
cells (miR-215; −), shown via western blotting. β-Actin was used as a
loading control. Full scans of blots with ladders to indicate band size are given
in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>. (<bold>d</bold>)
Quantification of western blot data shown in part (<bold>c</bold>). The relative
expression of <italic>ARHGEF39</italic> (normalised to β-actin) was calculated via
densitometry and indicates significant repression of endogenous protein when
miR-215 is present. (<bold>e</bold>) To determine if the presence of the alternative
'C' allele disrupts this regulatory relationship, we introduced the
'C' allele into the reporter gene 3′UTR. The presence of the
SLI-associated 'C' allele abolished repression of the reporter gene by
miR-215, showing its biological relevance. To show specificity of this effect the
entire miR-215-binding site was deleted from the <italic>ARHGEF39</italic> 3′UTR
reporter ('DEL') and this construct was also not regulated by miR-215.
Deleting the entire miR-215 binding site ('DEL') was not significantly
different to the effect of introducing the 'C' allele and neither of
these were significantly different from the construct that had no 3′UTR
cloned fragment present ('3′UTR −'). Significant differences
between groups were calculated using an ANOVA test followed by <italic>post hoc</italic>
Tukey calculation. Only statistically significant differences are noted.
Significance is indicated by *<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 and
**<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01. All results are reported as the average±s.d.
of three biological replicates. 3′UTR, 3 prime untranslated region; SLI,
specific language impairment.</p>

<p>rs72727021 is associated with ARHGEF39 expression in the human brain. (<bold>a</bold>) A
multi-tissue eQTL comparison was made for rs72727021 and ARHGEF39 using the GTEx
database gene association tool across 44 tissue types. For each tissue is shown:
the number of RNA-Seq samples with genotype (‘Samples’), the effect
size (‘Beta’), the significance for that tissue
(‘<italic>P</italic>-value’) and the posterior probability likelihood that an
effect exists in each tissue in the cross-tissue meta-analysis
(‘post-prob’). Tissues are listed by effect size and those with a
post-prob &gt;0.9 and <italic>P</italic>-value below <italic>P</italic>&lt;1.13e-3 (to account for
multiple testing correction) are considered likely to have an effect in that
tissue and be significantly associated. (<bold>b</bold>) The three tissues with the most
significant associations also had the highest effect sizes and all were found in
the brain. Rank normalised gene expression for each of these tissues; frontal
cortex (BA9), cortex and cerebellum are shown, plotting expression for each
individual/sample with their corresponding genotype. In these three tissues,
ARHGEF39 expression is higher when the rs72727021 alternative allele
('C') is present in the heterozygous (‘CA’) or homozygous
(‘CC’) state.</p>
