<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par1">Temperament traits are of high importance across species. In humans, temperament or personality traits correlate with psychological traits and psychiatric disorders. In cattle, they impact animal welfare, product quality and human safety, and are therefore of direct commercial importance. We hypothesized that genetic factors that contribute to variation in temperament among individuals within a species will be shared between humans and cattle. Using imputed whole-genome sequence data from 9223 beef cattle from three cohorts, a series of genome-wide association studies was undertaken on cattle flight time, a temperament phenotype measured as the time taken for an animal to cover a short-fixed distance after release from an enclosure. We also investigated the association of cattle temperament with polymorphisms in bovine orthologs of risk genes for neuroticism, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and developmental delay disorders in humans.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p id="Par2">Variants with the strongest associations were located in the bovine orthologous region that is involved in several behavioural and cognitive disorders in humans. These variants were also partially validated in independent cattle cohorts. Genes in these regions (<italic>BARHL2</italic>, <italic>NDN</italic>, <italic>SNRPN</italic>, <italic>MAGEL2</italic>, A<italic>BCA12</italic>, <italic>KIFAP3</italic>, <italic>TOPAZ1</italic>, <italic>FZD3</italic>, <italic>UBE3A</italic>, and <italic>GABRA5</italic>) were enriched for the GO term neuron migration and were differentially expressed in brain and pituitary tissues in humans. Moreover, variants within 100 kb of ASD susceptibility genes were associated with cattle temperament and explained 6.5% of the total additive genetic variance in the largest cattle cohort. The ASD genes with the most significant associations were <italic>GABRB3</italic> and <italic>CUL3</italic>. Using the same 100 kb window, a weak association was found with polymorphisms in schizophrenia risk genes and no association with polymorphisms in neuroticism and developmental delay disorders risk genes.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="Par3">Our analysis showed that genes identified in a meta-analysis of cattle temperament contribute to neuron development functions and are differentially expressed in human brain tissues. Furthermore, some ASD susceptibility genes are associated with cattle temperament. These findings provide evidence that genetic control of temperament might be shared between humans and cattle and highlight the potential for future analyses to leverage results between species.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par4">Temperament traits are of high importance across species. In humans, temperament traits include personality and behavior phenotypes such as extraversion, openness and neuroticism, and are genetically correlated with several psychiatric disorders, both common (such as major depression and anxiety disorders) and less common (such as schizophrenia and autism) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In cattle, and other livestock species, temperament traits are of welfare and commercial importance because more docile animals can grow faster, are easier to transport and feed, and can have superior meat quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, reactive animals can also endanger the safety of their contemporaries and also their human handlers.</p>
<p id="Par5">Several studies on animal species have suggested that phenotypic and genetic overlap for temperament between humans and other mammalian species. A long-running genetic study of behavior in foxes found an overlap between genes that are involved in aggression, sociability and anxiety in this species and autism spectrum and bipolar disorders in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In cattle, several risk genes for human behavior and psychiatric disorders are also associated with temperament, docility and aggressiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In terms of phenotypes, many studies have documented that characteristics such as hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli, fear in novel situations, visual thinking/ability to recall detail, are shared between animals and autistic people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par6">Temperament in cattle is measured as the response of the animal to handling or forced movement by humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Various measures for cattle have been proposed, including an electronically recorded phenotype called flight time. Flight time is defined as the time taken for an animal to cover a short-fixed distance after release from an enclosure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Animal responses to this test have been shown to be repeatable over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and thus, flight time is routinely used by the cattle industry to measure temperament. More generally, flight time belongs to a group of restraint tests that measure both the animal’s response to human proximity and physical restraint. Estimated heritabilities for cattle temperament are moderate (average of 0.36 with a range of 0.05 to 0.70) with the variation in reported estimates due, in part, to study designs, but also to breed differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par7">In humans, temperament is interchangeable with personality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and is generally measured by using one of two taxonomies: the five-factor model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] or Cloninger temperament scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The “Big-five” model has five domains: Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness, while Cloninger’s model has four main dimensions: Novelty Seeking, Harm Avoidance, Reward Dependence and Persistence. An important point to note is that variation of temperament domains/dimensions is thought to be influenced by activity in specific neurotransmitter pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Based on twin and family studies, heritabilities for personality traits in humans are estimated to be around 0.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par8">There is growing empirical evidence that suggests that orthologous genes control complex traits in different mammalian species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. For instance, Pryce et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] showed that genes associated with height in humans are also associated with stature in cattle. In a recent comparison between humans, cattle and dogs, Bouwman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] found that the genetic architecture of stature in cattle is similar to that in humans, in that it is highly polygenic with many polymorphisms of small effects; multiple loci associated with stature were shared across the three-species investigated. A comprehensive review of known mutations in genes that affect body size in domestic species, mice and humans identified many common genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par9">Here, our aim was to test the hypothesis that, as for stature, a common set of genes control temperament across two mammalian species, namely humans and cattle. We hypothesized that genetic loci that contribute to variation between individuals will be shared across these species, and hence we used humans as a model organism for cattle to investigate the effect of genes related with human behavior and psychiatric disorders in cattle temperament. In particular, we tested the enrichment of polymorphisms associated with cattle temperament in genes that are involved in four human psychiatric and personality disorders traits, which have been most comprehensively studied: neuroticism (NEU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], schizophrenia (SCZ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and developmental delay disorders related to brain and/or cognition (DDD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>

<title>Phenotypes and genotypes</title>
<p id="Par10">The phenotype used was flight time, which is the electronically recorded time taken for an animal to cover 1.7 m after being released from the weighing box. This temperament phenotype was measured for three tropically adapted beef cohorts: The Cooperative Research Centre-CRC dataset (Brahman and TropComp1) and a Tropical composite dataset 2 (TropComp2, with a different breed composition). The number of animals and other details of these cohorts can be found in (see Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Table S1) and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Prior to the analysis, we pre-processed phenotypes using a natural logarithm transformation and standardized it to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 within each cohort.</p>
<p id="Par11">Animals in the cohorts were genotyped in commercial bovine arrays, either the Illumina BovineSNP50 or the Zoetis HD50K (50K markers). Monomorphic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and those with more than 10% of animals with GenCall scores lower than 0.6 were excluded. Animals with GenCall scores lower than 0.9 were also removed. Following standard protocols for bovine data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], genotypes were imputed twice, first to SNPs on the Illumina Bovine HD (HD) array and then to whole-genome sequence (WGS). The former was performed in FImpute2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] using a reference panel of 1500 cattle of relevant breeds genotyped for the HD array. The latter was done using Eagle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], Minimac3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and a multi-breed reference panel of 472 sequenced animals, average of 11× coverage, from the 1000 Bull Genomes Project run 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The estimated imputation accuracy was reasonably high (average Minimac r<sup>2</sup> = 0.88).</p>
<p id="Par12">SNPs were then processed through a standard bovine quality control pipeline, filtered out within each cohort on minor allele frequency (MAF), which had to be lower than 10<sup>−4</sup>, extreme deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), pHWE had to be lower than 10<sup>−10</sup>, and imputation quality (Minimac r<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.6). MAF and HWE filters were implemented using PLINK1.9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Only autosomal SNPs were kept for further analysis. These filtering steps resulted in a similar number of imputed sequence variants as reported in other cattle studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Details of the genetic similarity (principal components (PC)) between the three cohorts are in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>. Due to the different levels of cross-breeding in the composite animals, even the first PC (proportional to indicine content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]) could differentiate between the cohorts.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Cattle cohorts included in the meta-analysis. <bold>a</bold> Tropical composite (Santa Gertrudis) and <bold>b</bold> Brahman bulls. <bold>c</bold> Distribution of the first principal component (PC) for all three cohorts.

<title>Meta-analysis</title>
<p id="Par13">We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on cattle flight time for three populations and conducted a meta-analysis of the results for a combined sample of 9223 animals and 28.4 million imputed biallelic variants, including both SNPs and small insertions and deletions (INDEL). The number of animals and variants varied slightly between cohorts, ranging from 2112 to 4586 animals and 24.8 to 28.2 million variants.

<title>Validation test of variants identified in the meta-analysis</title>
<p id="Par15">Statistically significant variants in the meta-analysis were tested for replication using GWAS summary statistics for docility scores in five independent cohorts of <italic>Bos taurus</italic> breeds (Angus, Charolais, Hereford, Limousin, and Simmental) from the Irish national breeding program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Docility score is a temperament phenotype in cattle that reflects cattle response to human handling on an ordinal scale (1 = “Aggressive” to 10 = “Docile”) and is recorded by trained classifiers. On this scale, we assume docility score to be positively correlated with flight time. Variants identified in the meta-analysis with a P &lt; 0.05 in the validation GWAS were considered validated. To approximate a null distribution for the number of variants expected by chance in the validation GWAS using this criterion, we also ran a permutation test (10,000 replicates per cohort, 50,000 in all five cohorts). The number of animals and variants for the validation cohorts and a sign test of concordance for the latter are in (see Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Tables S2 and S3), respectively. A summary of the methodology for the GWAS in these validation cohorts is also available in Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>.</p>

<title>Mapping and functional annotation of genes from the meta-analysis</title>
<p id="Par16">Two methods were used to annotate the variants that were identified in the meta-analysis to putative candidate genes. First, we identified protein-coding genes within 200 kb of the clumping window that contained the top associated variant. Second, we ran a gene set-based association analysis using summary statistics from the meta-analysis in fastBAT/GCTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] using the combined genotypes for the three populations as a linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference panel.</p>
<p id="Par17">Functional annotation of human orthologous genes identified in the meta-analysis was carried out using STRINGv11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. We also investigated differential expression (DE) of human orthologous genes identified in the meta-analysis in GTEx v6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] tissues using FUMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p>

<title>Enrichment of NEU, SCZ, ASD and DDD genes in cattle temperament</title>
<p id="Par18">We located bovine orthologous genes associated with NEU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], SCZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and DDD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] using the UMD3.1 bovine reference genome. The orthology annotation was done as follows. Highly conserved genes were obtained using bovine orthologs genes from Biomart Ensembl 94 with the following quality control criteria for the genes: they had to be at least 60% identical to target human genes, to have a protein-coding function, and to be located on autosomal chromosomes. Given that the genes involved in developmental delay disorders are related to a very broad spectrum of disease/phenotypes with varying levels of evidence for functional consequence, DDD genes were further filtered to have a “confirmed” status, “loss of function” mutation consequence, and to be related to “Brain/Cognition” phenotypes.</p>
<p id="Par19">SNPs and INDEL were mapped to genes based on boundaries of ±100 kb of the gene start and end sites. We chose this window size because of the levels of LD in the tropically adapted animals used in the analysis. A previous study used a window of 500 kb for <italic>Bos taurus</italic> breeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] which have longer tracts of LD when compared with <italic>Bos indicus</italic> and composite breeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In addition, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] showed that even at 70 kb the levels of LD in tropically adapted beef cattle are not small (0.1 3 &lt; r2 &lt; 0.16). Thus, a 100-kb window provided an intermediate compromise. In total, we tested the effects for 263, 577, 101 and 63 bovine orthologous genes that are involved in SCZ, NEU, DDD, and ASD, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Tables S4–S7). The total number of variants in these gene sets in our larger cohort (TropComp2) were 584,889, 382,996, 287,480 and 159,455 variants for SCZ, NEU, DDD, and ASD, respectively.</p>

All validated variants were located on chromosome 21 and were mostly breed-specific (only 5 out of the 73 validated variants segregated in two breeds). When looking at the meta-analysis of identified variants within individual cohorts, we found that 30 out of 99 polymorphic variants were associated with docility scores in Charolais animals (P &lt; 0.05 in the validation GWAS). The number of validated variants for Limousin and Simmental animals was 24 out of 99 and 24 out of 74, respectively. No variants were validated in the Angus and Hereford cohorts although 83 and 101 out of 115 were polymorphic.

This was the case for instance, for the top signal from the meta-analysis (SNP rs137773155 on chromosome 21, bp 1,058,688) which was validated in the Simmental population but with an allele substitution effect in the opposite direction to that estimated in the meta-analysis, e.g. a copy of the C allele at this SNP decreased the flight time in tropically adapted cattle but increased the docility score in the Simmental animals.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Validation of variants identified in the meta-analysis (115 variants) in five independent <italic>Bos taurus</italic> cohorts (P &lt; 0.05 in validation cohort).

<title>Enrichment of NEU, SCZ, ASD and DDD genes in cattle temperament</title>
<p id="Par29">There were two salient characteristics of the bovine orthologous genes involved in the four disorders tested. First, there was very little overlap between the NEU, SCZ, ASD and DDD gene sets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>, top panel). For instance, there was no single gene that was common among the four gene sets. Second, these gene sets tend to be very large in physical size (gene length) as is typical for brain-associated genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>, bottom panel).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Bovine orthologous of genes involved in schizophrenia (SCZ), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), developmental delay disorders (DDD) and neuroticism (NEU). <bold>a</bold> shows the overlap between them. <bold>b</bold>–<bold>e</bold> show the decile distribution of the physical size of genes within each set.

<p id="Par30">We found no difference between the percentage of variance explained by variants located in or close (100 kb) to 577 NEU and 101 DDD susceptibility genes and variants in random gene sets of similar size. That is, the 450,283 and 332,396 variants that mapped to bovine orthologous to the NEU and DDD genes in the largest animal cohort (TropComp2) explained negligible variance, not different from zero, of the additive genetic variance in a model with one genomic relationship matrix (GRM) for these variants and another one with the remaining variants in the bovine genome (Eq. (<xref ref-type="" rid="Equ2">2</xref>) in “<xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec2">Methods</xref>”). Results were similar for the other two bovine cohorts with no enrichment in bovine temperament of genes involved in NEU and DDD.</p>
<p id="Par31">We found evidence of an association stronger than expected by chance between variants in the 63 ASD risk genes and cattle flight time. Out of the 183,880 SNPs in or close (100 kb) to bovine ASD orthologs in the meta-analysis, there were 13 SNPs associated with cattle flight time (P &lt; 1×10<sup>−4</sup>) located in two regions on chromosomes 2 and 21 (see Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S1). Each of the two lead SNPs explained 0.9% of the additive genetic variance for cattle flight time (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">2</xref>). The two candidate genes in these regions included bovine orthologs for the <italic>gamma</italic>-<italic>aminobutyric acid type A receptor beta3 subunit</italic> (<italic>GABRB3</italic>), and <italic>cullin 3</italic> (<italic>CUL3</italic>). Moreover, SNPs in and around the ASD genes explained a significantly higher percentage of the additive genetic variance in cattle temperament when compared to random gene sets of similar size in the largest cohort available (TropComp2). Variants in and around 63 bovine ASD orthologs explained 6.5% of the additive genetic variance in the model with two GRM (Eq. (<xref ref-type="" rid="Equ2">2</xref>)) in the largest cattle cohort, while on average random gene sets of similar size (same number of genes and similar size of genes) as in the ASD set only explained 1% of the additive genetic variance (P = 0.04 over 250 random permutations, (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>)). Using data from a bovine gene expression atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], we also confirmed that ASD genes are differentially expressed in bovine brain tissue [see Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Table S10, Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>, and Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S2].<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Estimated lead variants within ± 100 kb of ASD genes associated with cattle flight time in the meta-analysis</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Chr</th><th align="left">Bp</th><th align="left">A1/A2</th><th align="left">Freq (A1)</th><th align="left">b (A1)</th><th align="left">P</th><th align="left">%Vg<sup>a</sup></th><th align="left">Dir<sup>b</sup></th><th align="left">Variant type</th><th align="left">Candidate genes<sup>c</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="char" char=".">113,546,307</td><td align="left">T/C</td><td align="char" char=".">0.222</td><td align="char" char=".">− 0.082</td><td align="left">2.3 × 10<sup>−5</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">0.90</td><td align="left">–</td><td align="left">Intergenic</td><td align="left"><italic>CUL3</italic> (59 kb)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">21</td><td align="char" char=".">4,115,188</td><td align="left">A/G</td><td align="char" char=".">0.344</td><td align="char" char=".">− 0.072</td><td align="left">8.0 × 10<sup>−6</sup></td><td align="char" char=".">0.90</td><td align="left">-+-</td><td align="left">Intergenic</td><td align="left"><italic>GABRB3</italic> (28 kb)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Lead variants are obtained using clumping for all variants with P &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, clumping windows of 5 Mb and r<sup>2</sup> = 0.1</p><p><sup>a</sup>%Vg = 2*Freq<sub>A1*</sub>Freq<sub>A2*</sub>b<sup>2</sup>/Vg*100, Vg = 0.259 (TropComp2)</p><p><sup>b</sup>Direction of SNP effect in each cohort of the meta-analysis (TropComp1, Brahman, TropComp2)</p><p><sup>c</sup>Protein-coding genes within 200 kb of the clumping window.

<p id="Par32">Some evidence of an association stronger than expected by chance was also found for the 584,889 variants in or close to the 263 SCZ susceptibility genes in the largest cattle cohort. Combined together these variants explained 5.6% of the additive genetic variance in the model with two GRM (Eq. (<xref ref-type="" rid="Equ2">2</xref>)). Although this result was not statistically significant (P = 0.14 over 250 replicates), random sets of genes of similar size to SCZ genes explained, on average, only 2% of the additive genetic variance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>). The weak enrichment of SCZ genes was robust to an increasing number of permutations in the randomized permutation test (P = 0.13 over 1000 replicates). Moreover, the SCZ genes had very little overlap with the ASD genes (3 of 263 SCZ genes were also involved in ASD, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par33">Genome-wide association meta-analysis of three cattle cohorts measured for the temperament trait of flight time identified significant independent associations at two genomic regions on bovine chromosomes 3 and 21. Variants in these regions were validated in independent cattle cohorts and mapped to 10 human orthologous genes. These genes are biologically enriched in neuron migration and differentially expressed in brain and pituitary human tissues. The human genomic region (15q11-q13) that is orthologous to the top associated region in the flight time meta-analysis (start of bovine chromosome 21) encompasses genes that have been implicated in several behavioural and cognitive disorders, including childhood obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] and the genetic disorders Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Mouse and rat models have shown that copy number variation in this region is involved in feeding disorders, delayed motor skills development, and altered circadian rhythm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In cattle, variants in this region, located at the start of chromosome 21, are associated with aggressiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. There is also growing evidence for the role of synaptic plasticity in the domestication of the fox and dog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In fox, for instance, genomic regions that differentiate tame and aggressive animals include <italic>GABBR1</italic> and <italic>GABRA3</italic> and other receptor-coding genes. The closely-related <italic>GABRB2</italic> is also associated with anxiety in chickens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Genes identified in the meta-analysis of cattle temperament add support to this body of evidence.</p>
<p id="Par34">There are some limitations to our findings. One potential caveat could be the effect of residual population stratification on these results which would increase the number of false positives. In order to control for population stratification, models for each cohort included all available covariates: age, contemporary group (year, stud, sex), the GRM fitted as a random effect, as well as genomic control (<inline-formula id="IEq31"><alternatives><tex-math id="M85">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

We adopted this conservative approach to control for larger traces of LD due to small effective population size in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par35">Another potential caveat is the incomplete validation of the variants identified in the meta-analysis. This may be explained by the lower heritability of docility score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], the fact that it is a different but correlated trait to flight time, and different genetic backgrounds of the validation cohorts (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>) to the breeds included in the meta-analysis (<italic>Bos indicus</italic> and composite <italic>Bos taurus</italic> and <italic>Bos indicus</italic>) (see Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S3). It is important to note that the three breeds for which variants were validated, Charolais, Limousin, and Simmental (continental breeds), are genetically and phenotypically more related to each other, than the Angus and Hereford animals (British breeds) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Moreover, there was more power to estimate variant effects in these continental breeds as these cohorts had the largest sample sizes in the validation GWAS (31,049 Charolais, 35,159 Limousin and 8632 Simmental). In addition, the opposite than expected direction of association for Limousin and Simmental cattle may be due to different haplotypes, at the chromosome 21 locus, between these two breeds and Charolais. However, overall our results provide evidence that the genomic regions associated with temperament in the meta-analysis might also be of importance in other breeds.</p>
<p id="Par36">There was enrichment for associations with bovine temperament for ASD genes, weaker enrichment for SCZ, but a lack of enrichment for NEU and DDD genes. These results could be due to several reasons: inadequate mapping of susceptibility genes from the human GWAS, lack of concordance of traits between humans and cattle, and different age-of-onset between the diseases. With regard to the mapping of susceptibility genes, NEU and SCZ genes are derived mainly from GWAS data, in which a SNP association may map to multiple genes. In contrast, the ASD and DDD susceptibility genes used here were identified through whole exome sequencing studies in proband-parent trios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] with some evidence that they are causally associated. However, for ASD only about 10 to 15% of cases can be attributed to rare germline mutations and thus, for most cases, its etiology is polygenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], showing relatively weak genetic correlations with other psychiatric and personality disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Another potential explanation, based on the evidence for distinct developmental profiles in social communication difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], is the substantially different age-of-onset for ASD when compared to NEU and SCZ. Temperament in beef cattle is measured in young animals that just reached puberty, 10 to 14 months in our cohorts, and thus it is possible that flight time could be better suited to capture the effect of early age-of-onset disorders, such as ASD. Therefore, the combination of susceptibility genes mapping, number of known de novo mutations, and age-of-onset make ASD a unique disorder among those tested.</p>
<p id="Par37">As noted before, we are not the first to suggest a connection between ASD and animal behavior. Kukekova et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] found an overlap between genes involved in aggression, sociability and anxiety in foxes and genes involved in ASD. One of these overlapping genes is <italic>MAGEL2</italic> and is located in the region containing the most significant variant in the meta-analysis (P = 3 × 10<sup>−10</sup>) that explains 2.2% of the additive genetic variance of cattle temperament (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec13">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="Par38">Our analysis of genetic factors that contribute to variation in temperament traits shared across humans and cattle revealed an association of ASD susceptibility genes with cattle temperament, with <italic>GABRB3</italic> and <italic>CUL3</italic> being the most strongly associated genes. Overall, the genes identified in the meta-analysis contribute to neuron development functions and are differentially expressed in human brain and pituitary tissues. These findings provide quantitative molecular evidence that genetic control of temperament traits might be shared across humans and cattle and highlight the potential for future analyses to leverage results between species, exploiting potential species-specific advantages in experimental designs.</p>
