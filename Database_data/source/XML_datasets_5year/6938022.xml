<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par1">Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is a rare form of infantile-onset leukodystrophy. The disorder is caused primarily by mutations of <italic>MLC1</italic> that leads to a series of phenotypic outcomes including vacuolation of myelin and astrocytes, subcortical cysts, brain edema, and macrocephaly. Recent studies have indicated that functional interactions among MLC1, GlialCAM, and ClC-2 channels play key roles in the regulation of neuronal, glial and vascular homeostasis. However, the physiological role of MLC1 in cellular homeostatic communication remains poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the cellular function of MLC1 and its effects on cell–cell interactions.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p id="Par2">MLC1-dependent cellular morphology and motility were analyzed by using confocal and live cell imaging technique. Biochemical approaches such as immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation, and surface biotinylation were conducted to support data.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p id="Par3">We found that the altered MLC1 expression and localization led to a great alteration in cellular morphology and motility through actin remodeling. MLC1 overexpression induced filopodia formation and suppressed motility. And, MLC1 proteins expressed in patient-derived <italic>MLC1</italic> mutants resulted in trapping in the ER although no changes in morphology or motility were observed. Interestingly knockdown of <italic>Mlc1</italic> induced Arp3-Cortactin interaction, lamellipodia formation, and increased the membrane ruffling of the astrocytes. These data indicate that subcellular localization of expressed MLC1 at the plasma membrane is critical for changes in actin dynamics through ARP2/3 complex. Thus, our results suggest that misallocation of pathogenic mutant MLC1 may disturbs the stable cell-cell communication and the homeostatic regulation of astrocytes in patients with MLC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par28">Patients with MLC exhibit abnormalities in brain ion and water homeostasis, resulting in diffuse cerebral white matter signaling on spectroscopic MRI, abnormal swelling of the white matter, and macrocephaly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. To date, research has demonstrated that mutations of two genes, <italic>MLC1</italic> and <italic>HepaCAM</italic> (also known as <italic>GlialCAM</italic>), are associated with the development of several forms of MLC: the MLC1 type (MIM #604004), the recessive MLC2A type (MIM #613925), and the remitting and dominant MLC2B type (MIM #613926) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Similar to findings observed in patients with MLC, <italic>Mlc1</italic>- and <italic>GlialCAM-</italic>null mice exhibit increased wet weight and normal dry weight of the brain, in addition to progressive white matter vacuolation and intramyelinic edema. Astrocytes from such mice exhibit regulatory volume decrease (RVD) and reduced levels of volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recent studies have identified a functional network among MLC1, GlialCAM, and ClC-2: GlialCAM targets MLC1 and ClC-2 to specialized glial domains and modifies the biophysical function of ClC-2 in oligodendrocytes. MLC1 is also important for proper localization of GlialCAM and ClC-2, as well as changes in ClC-2 currents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, the molecular function of MLC1 itself remains to be fully elucidated.</p>
<p id="Par29">Interestingly, although major causative mutations of MLC are found in the <italic>MLC1</italic> gene, which is expressed specifically in astrocytes, the abnormal phenotypes are observed mainly in oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Astrocytic dysfunctions have been shown to result in abnormal myelin structure and leukodystrophy in other cases as well. For example, mutations in the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene and the eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2B (EIF-2B) gene lead to Alexander’s disease and vanishing white matter disease, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In addition, astrocytes promote myelin formation by secreting cytokines and growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and form heterotypic interactions with OLs via gap junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These findings suggest that <italic>MLC1</italic> mutation in astrocytes are associated with pathogenic alterations in oligodendrocytes in patients with MLC, which then destabilize interactions between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and disrupt astrocyte-assisted homeostasis. Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated that stabilization of contact between communicating cells is important for astrocytic regulation of ion and water homeostasis in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par30">During the early stages of cell–cell contact, cell migration should be slowed or paused to ensure appropriate translocation of cell adhesion molecules and the stabilization of cellular interactions. In moving cells, filopodia and lamellipodia formation occur in response to environmental factors, aiding in the regulation of cell migration. Lamellipodia are broad, transient, sheet-like membrane protrusions at the leading edge that play a key role in driving cell migration. In vivo studies have revealed that lamellipodia formation occurs in a variety of cell types during migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thus, inhibition of lamellipodia formation may be critical for delaying cell migration and initiating cell–cell contact. In a previous study, the authors used electron microscopy to identify branched actin filament networks in lamellipodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, the nucleation of actin branches and elongation of actin filaments are known to generate the major driving force for lamellipodia formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Components of the actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3) complex are essential for the initiation of actin polymerization and the organization of actin networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The ARP2/3 complex nucleates new (daughter) filaments from the sides of existing (mother) filaments in response to stimulation by nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) such as Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), suppressor of cyclic AMP repressor (SCAR; also known as WASP-family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE)), and WASP and SCAR homologue (WASH) complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Additionaly, CORTACTIN is associated with actin dynamics at the leading edge of migrating cells by activating ARP2/3 complex and stabilizing new actin branch points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. CORTACTIN-induced actin branching implies that modulation of interaction between ARP2/3 complex and CORTACTIN may be related to regulation of actin dynamics.</p>
<p id="Par31">In the present study, we demonstrated that MLC1 regulates cellular morphology and motility via remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton: Localization of MLC1 protein at the plasma membrane induced filopodia formation and compensatory decreases in lamellipodia formation, greatly reducing cellular motility and promoting/stabilizing cell–cell interactions. Our findings provide evidence for a functional correlation between surface expression of MLC1 and actin dynamics, suggesting that the pathogenesis of MLC is associated with unstable cell–cell communication and disturbances in ion and water homeostasis.</p>

<title>MLC1 regulates morphological changes via remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton</title>
<p id="Par32">To investigate the functional role of MLC1, we firstly analyzed the effect of MLC1 over-expression in the heterologous expression system (COS-7 cells). The human MLC1 was fused with GFP to monitor its expression and distribution patterns. Interestingly, the cells expressing MLC1-GFP showed increased spiky membrane protrusions compared to the GFP-expressing cells. Phalloidin staining indicates that the MLC1-GFP expression induces the structural changes of filamentous actin (F-actin): Filopodia formation was increased, but lamellipodia structures were diminished (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>a, b). The expression of MLC1-GFP proteins in the transfected cells was confirmed by immunoblotting with GFP-specific antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>c). To eliminate the possibility that the morphological changes were caused by a large GFP-tag itself or perturbation of any cell signaling by the protein tagging at the C-terminal end of MLC1, we examined the effect of MLC1 with a relatively small tag (Myc) on the putative loop between predicted transmembrane domain 3 and 4. The morphological changes were replicated in the cells expressing Myc-tagged MLC1, suggesting that the observed morphological change was not induced by GFP tag, but caused by the expression of MLC1 (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1).
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>MLC1 induces morphological changes. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with MLC1-GFP (<bold>a</bold>) or GFP (<bold>b</bold>), followed by immunofluorescence staining with anti-GFP (<italic>green</italic>, transfection marker) antibody and phalloidin (<italic>magenta</italic>, fibrous actin). <italic>Empty</italic> and <italic>filled</italic> arrowheads (magnified image) indicate fibrous actin bundles and branched actin networks, respectively.

<p id="Par33">Since the previous studies had reported that the MLC1 mutants found in MLC disease patients are mainly localized in subcellular organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], we wondered whether patient-derived MLC1 mutants could affect actin remodeling near the plasma membrane. To test the effect of mutant MLC1, we examined morphological changes in COS-7 cells expressing either wildtype or mutant MLC1 proteins (P92S and S280 L) tagged with GFP. As previously reported, two tested mutant MLC1 proteins were mainly trapped in the intracellular organelles, especially colocalized with the ER-specific marker, GRP78 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>a) and partially co-localized with the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi matrix protein, GM130 (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Figure S2A). Interestingly, unlike to the wildtype MLC1, the cells expressing patient-derived mutants failed to exhibit morphological changes in the plasma membrane: Lamellipodia remained intact, and a dense actin network was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>a). To quantify the morphological changes of the cells expressing either wildtype or mutant MLC1, the total number of filopodia per cell was counted. The number of filopodia was three times higher in wildtype MLC1-expressing cells than in GFP-expressing control cells; however, the filopodia number of the P92S and S280 L mutant MLC1 was decreased to 43.9 and 22.2% of the wildtype, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>b). In contrast, filopodia length was not altered by the expression of either wildtype or mutant MLC1, indicating that MLC1 may not be involved in the F-actin elongation process, but in the branching of actin filaments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>c).
<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Effect of patient-derived MLC1 mutants on cellular morphology. <bold>a</bold> Heterologously expressed GFP, MLC1-GFP, and patient-derived mutants (P92S- and S280 L-GFP) in COS-7 cells were stained with anti-GFP antibody (<italic>green</italic>, MLC1), GRP78 (<italic>blue</italic>, ER), and phalloidin (<italic>magenta</italic>, fibrous actin). <italic>filled</italic> and <italic>empty</italic> arrowheads indicate branched actin networks and fibrous actin bundles, respectively. Scale bar: 25 μm (<italic>upper</italic>) and 5 μm (<italic>bottom</italic>). The number of filopodia per cell (<bold>b</bold>) and average length of filopodia (<bold>c</bold>) in cells transfected with GFP (<italic>n</italic> = 27 cells and 763 filopodia), MLC1-GFP (<italic>n</italic> = 24 cells and 1788 filopodia), P92S-GFP (<italic>n</italic> = 13 cells and 425 filopodia), and S280 L-GFP (<italic>n</italic> = 17 cells and 281 filopodia) were analyzed by FlioQuant. <bold>d</bold> Surface expression of wildtype and mutant MLC1 in COS-7 cells was analyzed via surface biotinylation (total = 10% of surface).

<p id="Par34">Since P92S and S280 L were mainly localized at the perinuclear membrane with only a small fraction reaching the plasma membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>a), we further examined the ability of wildtype and mutant MLC1 proteins for targeting to the plasma membrane. The endogenous transferrin receptor (TfR) was also examined as a plasma membrane marker. Similar to the previous studies, the total expression level of P92S and S280 L mutant was decreased to 50.1 and 42.5% of the wildtype, respectively (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Figure S2B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition, surface biotinylation assay showed that the fractions of MLC1 mutant proteins reaching to the plasma membrane relative to their total protein expressions were significantly decreased compared to the wildtype MLC1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>d, e; the relative surface expression level of P92S and S280 L mutant was decreased to 42.1 and 40.6% of the wildtype, respectively). Interestingly, the severity of deceasing filopodia numbers is somewhat correlated with the degree of decreasing surface expression levels of MLC1 proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>b, e). These results suggest that the localization of MLC1 at the plasma membrane may be linked to the filopodia formation via actin remodeling.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec4">
<title>MLC1 regulates cellular motility</title>
<p id="Par35">Since actin remodeling, especially through the inhibition of actin branching, is well known to be associated with both cellular morphology and motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], we investigated the effect of MLC1 on collective cellular motility by carrying out a wound healing assay. Interestingly, the wildtype MLC1-GFP expressing cells exhibited significant decreases in wound healing activity, however, the mutant (P92S and S280 L) MLC1-expressing cells exhibited normal movement compared to the cells expressing GFP alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>a, b). Since the wound healing assay was performed with transiently transfected cells, the untransfected cells may interfere with the movements of transfected cells with wildtype or mutant MLC1. Also, we cannot exclude the the negative effect of MLC1 on cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], which might affect cell-to-cell interaction and group migration. Thus, we examined the MLC1-dependent cell motility at the single-cell level by taking time-lapse images of live cells over 550 min. As observed in the wound healing assay, only the cell expressing wildtype MLC1 showed significantly decreased cellular motility. The trajectory of wildtype MLC1-expressing cells exhibited restricted boundaries, while those with MLC1 mutants and GFP-expressing cells were instead extended (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>c, d; Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>: Video S1, Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>: Video S2, Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">7</xref>: Video S3, Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM8">8</xref>: Video S4). The mean velocity of wildtype MLC1-expressing cells was significantly reduced by more than 2-fold (44.2% of the GFP control), but it was not significantly affected by the expression of either P92S or S290 L mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>e). However, the directionality of movement appeared to be random in all cases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>f). Thus, both the collective cell migration and single-cell motility results indicate that subcellular localization of MLC1 can significantly affect cell motility as well as morphological alterations.

<title>Subcellular localization of MLC1 can alter cellular morphology and motility</title>
<p id="Par36">To ensure proper targeting of wildtype MLC1 at the plasma membrane, overexpressed MLC1 should escape from the ER and Golgi body over the time course. Thus, we examined whether the subcellular localization of wildtype MLC1 can affect alterations in both morphology and motility during the surface-targeting process. Indeed, some cells transfected with wildtype MLC1 also exhibited mutant-like intracellular localization of MLC1 proteins. From the randomly selected regions of interest (ROIs), 17.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 30) of cells showed that the wildtype MLC1 proteins was trapped intracellularly with a small fraction of surface expression at 24 h after transfection. We classified MLC-expressing cells based on the subcellular distribution of MLC1 proteins: PM-MLC1 cells, in which MLC1 is found at the plasma membrane, and ER-MLC1 cells, in which the significant fraction of MLC1 proteins are trapped in the ER. To detect surface-expressed MLC1 accurately, we placed the Myc-tag in the putative extracellular loop between the third and the fourth transmembrane domains. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the exclusive accessibility of the Myc-tag from the extracellular side (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>: Figure S3). Interestingly, the PM-MLC1 cells exhibited abnormal spiky membrane protrusions with the significant surface expression of MLC1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>a, marked with triple asterisks), while the ER-MLC1 cells exhibited normal morphology with feeble MLC1 signals at the cell surface (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>a, an asterisk), which is somewhat similar to cells expressing patient-derived mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>a). An intermediate distribution of MLC1 with weak surface MLC1 signals and relatively few filopodia was also observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>a, double asterisks). Moreover, the polarized distribution of surface MLC1 resulted in asymmetric filopodia formation: The region with higher surface expression of MLC1 induced well-developed filopodia formation while reduced surface expression could not. These asymmetric filopodia formation indicates that localization of MLC1 at the plasma membrane is critical to the morphological changes of the cell membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>b). We also compared cellular motility between PM- and ER-MLC1 cells via live-cell imaging over 500 min. Kymographs of the PM- and ER-MLC1 cells indicated that cellular motility is regulated by the subcellular localization of MLC1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>c). The mean velocity of ER-MLC1 cells was significantly higher than that of PM-MLC1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>d), although no changes in directionality were observed as in the cases of patient-derived MLC1 mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>e). The live-cell imaging allowed us to gain an insight to the functional correlation between subcellular localization of MLC1 and cellular motility. Freely moving cells began to express MLC1 at the initial stage (at 75 min, searching stage), migrated to the target cell, and formed cell-cell contact (at 150 min, contacting stage). After contact, MLC1 translocated from intracellular compartments to the contact point on the plasma membrane (<italic>empty</italic> arrowhead at 225 min, translocating stage). Finally, filopodia formation was increased at the cell-cell contact point, and interactions remained stable for the remainder of the imaging period (at 480 min, stabilizing stage) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>f and Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">9</xref>: Video S1). These results indicate that the translocation of MLC1 stabilizes cell-cell contact by decreasing in cell motility.

<title>MLC1 acts as a negative regulator of actin branching</title>
<p id="Par37">How does the surface expression of MLC1 induce the morphological changes of the cell via actin cytoskeletal remodeling? Previous studies reported that inhibition of the actin-related protein, ARP can induce filopodia formation and reduce lamellipodia formation by inhibiting the branching of actin filaments, thereby decreasing cellular motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Since the ARP2/3 complex is a known indicator of actin branching points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and CORTACTIN is known as stabilizer of actin branch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], we wondered whether the MLC1 at the plasma membrane could perturb the branching of actin filament and inhibit lamellipodia formation. Thus, we tested whether MLC1 proteins could interact with ARP2/3 complexes in the COS-7 cells. Indeed, MLC1 can interact with both ARP2 and ARP3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>a, b). We had tried to replicate MLC1-ARP2/3 complex interaction in the primary astrocytes, but commercial antibody against MLC1 failed to immunoprecipitate MLC1 protein in primary astrocyte lysate. Then, we tested whether MLC1 proteins could affect the interaction between ARP3 and Cortactin in the primary astrocytes. Immunoprecipitation assay with anti-ARP3 or Cortactin antibody revealed that binding of ARP3 to Cortactin was enhanced by downregulation of Mlc1(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>c). These results indicate that Mlc1 may act as a negative regulator of actin branching and lamellipodia formation. These results inspired us to test the effect of Mlc1 knockdown on the actin remodeling and subcellular localization of Arp3 in the S100β-positive matured primary astrocytes. Before examining the effect of Mlc1 knockdown, the efficiency of Mlc1-specific shRNA (shMlc1) was evaluated in the mouse primary astrocytes with recombinant AAV (rAAV) encoding both shMlc1 and GFP. Infection with shMlc1 virus significantly reduced the endogenous Mlc1 expression level in the primary astrocyte culture, which indicated that shMlc1 is useful to silence Mlc1 (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S4A). Interestingly, Arp3 was co-localized with fibrous actin bundle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>a) and dense actin network (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>b) in shScr- and shMlc1-infected primary astrocytes, respectively. Immunofluorescence staining showed that knockdown of Mlc1 repressed filopodia formation but induced lamellipodia formation as indicated by Phalloidin staining pattern (in both of AraC-treated astrocyte culture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>b) and canonical astrocyte culture (Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>: Figure S4C)). Taken together, these results indicate that Mlc1 does not affects subcellular localization of Arp3 but may competes with Cortactin for interaction with Arp3 resulting in reduced stability of actin branch and morphological change.

<p id="Par38">Additionally, we found that MLC1 stabilizes membrane structure of primary astrocytes. The real-time image of shMlc1-transfected primary astrocytes showed dynamic membrane ruffling, which indicated that actin filament reorganization has actively occurred. Instead, the membrane structures are somewhat static in the primary astrocytes transfected with shScr (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>c; Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">10</xref>: Video S1 and Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM11">11</xref>: Video S2). Collectively, these results indicate that the expression of Mlc1 may interferes branching of actin filament and stabilization of membrane fluctuation.</p>

<title>Discussions</title>
<p id="Par39">Actin filaments provide cells with mechanical support, track intracellular trafficking, and provide the driving force for cell movement, all of which are critical to cellular physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Various proteins are involved in the regulation of actin dynamics, playing key roles in the maintenance of monomeric actin molecules, the nucleation and elongation of actin filaments, branch formation, filament–filament interactions, and the delivery of cargo. Among these proteins, the ARP2/3 complex is well known to aid in the formation of branched actin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the present study, we investigated the molecular function of MLC1 and its effects on cell–cell interactions. We observed that MLC1 proteins compete with Cortactin for interaction with the ARP2/3 complex, thereby decreasing the formation of branched actin filaments. In addition, mutant MLC1 proteins (P92S and S280 L) were associated with reduced levels of expression and plasma membrane targeting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>d, e). Such decreases in the expression of mutant MLC1 may be related to altered protein stability, as suggested in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These results suggest that MLC1 may inhibit actin branching by disturbing interactions between the ARP complex and actin nucleation factors near the plasma membrane. This hypothesis is supported by the strong correlation between plasma membrane targeting of wildtype MLC1 over the course of subcellular localization and its effects on cellular morphology and motility (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par40">MLC1 protein is known to be highly expressed in primary astrocytes, as well as in lymphocytes and monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Petrini et al. demonstrated that MLC1 in monocytes was distributed from the perinuclear area to the filopodia or podosomes. MLC1 expression was found to be decreased in macrophages isolated from patients with MLC and this was because MLC1 proteins were trapped in the ER. Patient-derived cells also exhibited a reduced ability to adhere to plastic supports and an altered cytoskeletal structure in both actin and tubulin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In this study we replicated the observations, suggesting that MLC1-dependent changes in cellular morphology and motility represent general effects that can be observed regardless of their cellular origins.</p>
<p id="Par41">In cultured primary astrocytes, the trafficking and membrane expression of MLC1 is known to be regulated by caveolin-mediated trafficking and phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Previous studies have attempted to restore expression of MLC1 mutants by facilitating protein folding (e.g., lowering the temperature to 33 °C or treating the cells with glycerol as a chemical chaperone) or decreasing protein degradation using a FDA-approved proteasomal inhibitor (Velcade®) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It was reported that a mutation in <italic>GlialCAM</italic> affects the trafficking of MLC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In the heterologous expression system, pathogenic mutant GlialCAM could not accumulate at the cell–cell junction, and MLC1 exhibited a dispersed pattern of expression. Thus, the authors speculated that GlialCAM may act as a carrier protein during membrane trafficking and targeting of MLC1. Interestingly, MLC2B-type MLC is caused by a point mutation of GlialCAM. In patients with this form of the disease, typical clinical symptoms of MLC can be observed in the early stages, although they may improve thereafter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Such findings suggest that other mediators of MLC1 trafficking can compensate for the actions of GlialCAM. Since our data provide evidence for the role of MLC1 in actin dynamics, regulating actin filaments and modulating protein stability/surface trafficking of MLC1 may aid in the treatment of MLC.</p>
<p id="Par42">The <italic>MLC1</italic> gene was initially identified as a putative cation channel purely based on amino acid sequence alignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, electrophysiological analyses revealed that MLC1 did not directly mediate any ionic currents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Previous studies have reported that MLC1 can form a multi-protein complex with various membrane transport proteins including Kir4.1, AQP4, TRPV4, and the β-subunit of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in cultured primary astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Functional studies have indicated that mutations of MLC1 attenuate TRPV4-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and RVD-induced Cl<sup>−</sup> currents upon hypoosmotic stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. A recent study reported that reduced volume-regulated anion current and impaired RVD are related to MLC1 and LRRC8A, the main subunit of VRACs. Downregulation of either MLC1 or LRRC8A decreases the VRAC current [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In addition, research has demonstrated that developmental myelination and myelin maintenance are normal in <italic>Mlc1</italic>-null and <italic>GlialCAM</italic>-null mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In this report, intrinsic neuronal excitability remained unaltered in both MLC mouse models. However, the extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration increased upon network activation due to the dysfunction of astrocytic MLC1, thereby disturbing [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> dynamics and leading to network hyperexcitability. These data indicate that MLC1 may regulate other ion channels instead of forming an ion channel itself. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that MLC1 directly or indirectly affect a membrane transport function that permeates a solute other than Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Cl<sup>−</sup>. The previous study did not suggest any relationship between TRPV4-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx and actin remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]; however, it is worth noting that increased intracellular calcium concentration can stabilize postsynaptic F-actin via calcium sensor caldendrin and lead to transient and global reorganization of actin filament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par43">Because our results indicate that MLC1 is important for the regulation of cellular motility as well as stable cellular communication, the impairments in oligodendrocyte volume regulation observed in patients with MLC and mouse models may be related to unstable communication between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes caused by MLC1 dysfunction. Since the surface area of astrocyte should respond to the hypotonic challenges, increased filopodia formation induced by surface expression of MLC1 may serve as a membrane reservoir in astrocytes that can readily respond to the astrocytic volume increase. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying MLC1-induced alterations in morphology and motility remain to be elucidated. The proteomic analysis for identifying proteins differently interacting with wildtype or mutant MLC1 would deepen our understanding how the actin-cytoskeltal remodeling can be induced by the expression of a multi-passing membrane protein, MLC1 in the plasma membrane. It will be interesting to see whether wildtype and pathogenic mutants take a distinct phosphorylation status and their effects on the morphological and motility changes of astrocyte. Also, how the astrocytic morphology and motility changes induced by the <italic>MLC1</italic>-mutations are linked to the pathological outcomes of MLC disease warrants further investigation in vivo.</p>
<p id="Par44">In summary, the results of the present study demonstrate that the membrane protein MLC1 modulates cellular morphology and motility in a subcellular targeting-dependent manner: Expression of MLC1 protein at the plasma membrane promotes filipodia formation and decreases cellular motility, neither of which occurs when it is expressed in intracellular organelles. Our findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis of astrocyte dysfunction-induced forms of leukodystrophy, especially MLC disease.</p>

(A) Knockdown of MLC1 in mouse primary astrocytes was performed by viral infection and was confirmed via Western Blotting with anti-MLC1 antibody. GFP expression levels were analyzed to evaluate the efficiency of AAV infection. Similar GFP expression level in the astrocytes treating with either shMlc1 or the scrambled shMlc1 (shScr) virus indicates that the infection efficiency was similar.
