<abstract>
<p>Migraine is a complex brain disorder, and understanding the complexity of this prevalent disease could improve quality of life for millions of people. Familial Hemiplegic Migraine type 2 (FHM2) is a subtype of migraine with aura and co-morbidities like epilepsy/seizures, cognitive impairments and psychiatric manifestations, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). FHM2 disease-mutations locate to the <italic>ATP1A2</italic> gene encoding the astrocyte-located α<sub>2</sub>-isoform of the sodium-potassium pump (α<sub>2</sub>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase). We show that knock-in mice heterozygous for the FHM2-associated G301R-mutation (α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup>) phenocopy several FHM2-relevant disease traits e.g., by mimicking mood depression and OCD. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies showed impaired glutamate uptake in hippocampal mixed astrocyte-neuron cultures from α<sub>2</sub><sup>G301R/G301R</sup> E17 embryonic mice, and moreover, induction of cortical spreading depression (CSD) resulted in reduced recovery in α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> male mice. Moreover, NMDA-type glutamate receptor antagonists or progestin-only treatment reverted specific α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> behavioral phenotypes. Our findings demonstrate that studies of an <italic>in vivo</italic> relevant FHM2 disease knock-in mouse model provide a link between the female sex hormone cycle and the glutamate system and a link to co-morbid psychiatric manifestations of FHM2.</p>

<body>
<p>Familial Hemiplegic Migraine type 2 (FHM2) is a chronic and hereditary disorder with severe episodic attacks of migraine with aura (MA) fulfilling the classic migraine criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. FHM2 is a rare form of migraine with aura that involves motor aura (weakness) and frequently accompanied by co-morbid epilepsy/seizures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, and in a subset of FHM2-families cognitive impairments and/or different psychiatric manifestations such as mood depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) have been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> as well as co-occurrence of obesity and other migraine forms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p>
<p>In the majority of FHM2-families, the disease is caused by haploinsufficiency due to loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>ATP1A2-</italic>gene, which encodes the α<sub>2</sub>-isoform of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (a sodium pump)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The sodium pump directs ion gradients (3Na<sup>+</sup><sub>out</sub>/2K<sup>+</sup><sub>in</sub>) which, in conjugation with other pump-independent functions, are implicated in various basic and specialized cellular functions. In the adult brain, the α<sub>2</sub>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is predominantly expressed in astrocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, and the astrocytic glutamate transporters of the EAAT family (excitatory amino acid transporters) uses the steep Na<sup>+</sup>-gradient maintained by the sodium pump as driving force for glutamate clearance from the synaptic cleft<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Moreover, the α<sub>2</sub>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase do also co-localized with EAAT1 (GLAST) and EAAT2 (GLT-1)) in the astrocytic plasma membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p>
<p>Ovarian hormones significantly influence migraine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, and women have a higher prevalence of migraine after puberty, with a lifetime prevalence of 25% compared with 8% in men. A link between the female sex hormone cycle and the glutamate system was recently demonstrated since the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) raloxifene was shown to upregulate EAAT2 and EAAT1 expression in rat primary astrocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p>
<p>One of the characteristic symptoms of FHM2 is the aura phenomenon appearing before the onset of the hemiplegic migraine. It is widely accepted that cortical spreading depression (CSD) is the molecular mechanism behind aura<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. CSD gives rise to a propagating wave of neuronal and glial depolarization, which is accompanied by a massive distribution of ions between the extracellular space and intracellular department<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Two FHM1 knock-in mouse models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and an <italic>Atp1a2</italic> mouse model harboring the W887R mutation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> revealed increased susceptibility to CSD compared to WT mice supporting CSD as a trigger to migraine. In this regard, it is noteworthy that while most of the <italic>ATP1A2</italic> mutations (and also the W887R mutation) are associated with pure FHM2, the <italic>ATP1A2</italic> G301R mutation represents a particular severe phenotype with an early onset.</p>
<p>In this study, we have generated an α<sub>2</sub>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase knock-in (KI) mouse model (α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup>) by introduction of the FHM2-associated G301R mutation described in two FHM2-families<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice displayed several behavioral phenotypes mimicking compulsive behavior and OCD, decreased sociability and stress-induced depression-like phenotypes. Interestingly, the α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice displayed female-specific behaviors in several tests, and those behaviors—and the compulsive behaviors—were rescued by drug treatments targeting the female sex hormone cycle or the glutamate system. Altogether our results link the female sex hormone cycle and the glutamate system and a link to co-morbid psychiatric manifestations of FHM2.</p>

<title>Cloning of the targeting construct for generating α<sub>2</sub>

<p>On the basis of 129/SvJ <italic>Atp1a2-</italic>gene fragments covering intron 6 to intron 13, the final targeting construct (total 16 691 bp) was generated using the pSC-B cloning vector as backbone (3.5 kb, Stratagene Corp, La Jolla, CA, USA). The targeting construct contained unmodified <italic>Atp1a2-</italic>gene stretches of 2.1 kb and 4.4 kb for cross-over (= recombination arms), a 2 × herpes simplex thymidine kinase (2 × TK) cassette (in <italic>Sac</italic>II site in multiple cloning site) conferring sensitivity to 1-(2′-deoxy-2′fluoro-1-ß-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil (FIAU), a floxed neomycin (NEO) gene cassette (in <italic>Afl</italic>II site in intron 7) conferring resistance to G418, and a modified <italic>Atp1a2</italic> genomic DNA stretch, which harbored a third LoxP site (abolishing a <italic>Bst</italic>EII site in intron 8) in addition to the G→A mutation in exon 8 (G→A in position 901 <italic>post</italic> start codon in mRNA, NCBI accession NM_178405, mouse strain C57BL/6) that introduced the G301R mutation. A detailed cloning strategy is listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Note that the second of two LoxP sites in the targeting constructs was introduced for the possibility of generating conditional α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/KO</sup> mice (by crossing to Cre-expressing mice).</p>

<title>Gene targeting by homologous recombination</title>
<p>Murine 129S1/Sv-derived CJ7 embryonic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> were electroporated with <italic>Pvu</italic>I-linearized targeting construct, and G418-resistant (350 μg/mL) and FIAU-sensitive (0.5 μM) colonies were selected and expanded (DAGMAR facility, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dagmar.au.dk" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://dagmar.au.dk</ext-link>)). Homolog recombination in ES cell clone IIH6 was confirmed by 5′end and 3′end PCR’s using primers located to the NEO cassette sequence and primers located to <italic>Atp1a2</italic> sequences flanking the <italic>Atp1a2</italic> sequences covered by the targeting construct, and a NEO PCR using the two NEO primers together (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Moreover, homolog recombination in ES cell clone IIH6 was confirmed by Southern blotting with a probe binding to <italic>Atp1a2</italic> sequence flanking the <italic>Atp1a2</italic> sequence in the 5′end of the targeting construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) (DAGMAR facility). The NEO cassette was removed by partial Cre-enzyme treatment leaving a single LoxP site in intron 7 obtained by transfecting IIH6 ES cells with linearized Cre-enzyme encoding plasmid (DAGMAR facility). Successful partial Cre-enzyme treatment was confirmed for the IIH6Cre14 clone by PCR and digestions of the PCR product generated specific band patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>

<sec disp-level="3">
<title>Generation and breeding of the transgenic α<sub>2</sub>
<sup>+/G301R</sup> knock-in (KI) mice</title>
<p>ES cells (IIH6cre14 clone) were individually injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts, which were then introduced into pseudo-pregnant female mice that gave birth to chimeric mice (DAGMAR facility). Two male chimeric mice were mated with C57BL/6J^BomTac^ (denoted C57BL/6J in this paper) female mice (Taconic Farms Inc, Bomholt, Denmark), and germ line transmission was obtained. Heterozygous α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice were identified by PCR genotyping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>; protocol will be provided upon request) and subsequent <italic>Bst</italic>EII digestion, which generated a specific band pattern; note, that all mice were also retro-genotyped. In initial crossings between heterozygous α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> male and female mice, homozygous α<sub>2</sub><sup>G301R/G301R</sup> pups were born, however they died neonatally in agreement with other mouse models targeting the <italic>Atp1a2-</italic>gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. From four independent crossings, the α<sub>2</sub><sup>G301R/G301R</sup> mice, α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice, and (α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/+</sup>) littermates (WT) were born at the ratio 1:1:1 (9 α<sub>2</sub><sup>G301R/G301R</sup>, 10 α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup>, 10 WT) and generated fewer α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice than expected according to Mendel’s law of segregation. All <italic>in vivo</italic> studies were performed using α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice and WT obtained by crossing α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice (generation N ≥ 8) with C57BL/6J mice (Taconic Farms Inc). Ten independent, and randomly chosen, breedings of α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice with C57BL/6J mice that generated 80 offspring were assessed; the offspring distributed at the ratio 1:1 regarding sex (38 females, 42 males) and at the ratio 1:1 regarding genotype (43 α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> (23 females, 20 males), 37 WT (15 females, 22 males), and showed that breeding generated offspring with a normal distribution of females and males and the expected distribution of genotypes (where genotypes were distributed at the ratio 1:1 regarding sex) according to Mendel’s law of segregation. The α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice appeared grossly normal and were indistinguishable from WT mice by eye. Mice were housed in a room under a 12:12 light/dark cycle (lights on between 6:30A.M. and 6:30P.M.) in cages with littermates of same sex. Food and water were provided <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Experimental protocols involving mice, performed at Aarhus University and Copenhagen University, were done according to the Danish national and institutional regulations and approved by the Animal Experiments Inspectorate under the Danish Ministry of Justice (permit numbers 2012-15-2934-00621, 2013−15−2934−00815 and 2012-15-2934-00063). Moreover, experimental protocols involving mice, performed at Karolinska University, were done according to the European Communities Council Directive of 24 Nov. 1986 (86/609/EEC) and approved by the Northern Stockholm Laboratory Animal Review Board (permit number N132/12).</p>
<p>All behavioral experiments were done blind to genotype with age-matched littermates.</p>

<title>SDS-page Western blotting</title>
<p>Crossing of two heterozygous α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice generated newborn pups of all genotypes (homozygotes (−/−), heterozygotes (+/−) and WT (+/+)) which were decapitated, and to each brain, 0.3 mL ice-cold lysis-buffer (1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete<sup>TM</sup> (mini, EDTA-free), 04 693 159 001, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4)) was added, and next grinded 10 × using a 60 μm pestle in a glass rod (885301-0002 tissue grinder, Kimble Chase, Gerresheimer Glass Inc, Vineland, NJ, USA). The lysates were centrifuged 2 min, 1,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were aliquoted and samples were stored at −80 °C. Two adult male and female mice of each genotype were decapitated. The brains from two mice were dissected into hippocampus (HC), cortex (CTX), brain stem (BS) and cerebellum (CRBL) and the brain areas were stored on ice. Immediately hereafter, the brain areas from two mice were pooled and 0.4 mL (HC) or 0.8 mL (other) ice-cold lysis-buffer was added, and hereafter handling was as described above. Male and female α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice were mated, and vaginal plug was noted. Pregnant female mice were sacrificed 17 days after conception, and the embryos (E17.5) were dissected, measured, and the embryonic stage was confirmed by the length (in cm) and their visual appearance. The embryos were decapitated and the whole brains were collected and to each brain, 0.3 mL ice-cold lysis-buffer was added, and hereafter handling was as described above. The protein content in all samples was determined using a method adapted from Bradford<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> (protein assay kit 1, 500-001, Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc, Berkeley, CA, USA). In total, 25 or 30 μg of protein lysates in reducing sample-buffer (58 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1.7% (w/v) SDS, 0.002% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)) (no boiling) and a molecular weight standard marker (spectra<sup>TM</sup> multicolor broad range protein ladder (SM1841, Fermentas, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA, USA)) were separated by SDS-page using 10% uniform polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto 0.45 μm pore-sized polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (IPVH00010 Immobilon<sup>R</sup>-P, Millipore Corp, Bedford, MA, USA). The blots were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) in blocking solution (5% swine serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS (pH 7.4)) with 0.05% detergent (Tween-20) (PBS-T)). The blots were incubated with primary antibody (polyclonal rabbit anti-human α<sub>2</sub> aa 432–455, 07674 Upstate, Millipore Corp, polyclonal rabbit anti-rat α<sub>3</sub>, aa 320–514, 06172 Upstate, Millipore Corp, and monoclonal mouse anti-chicken α<sub>1</sub>, polypeptide 1020 aa, developed by Douglas M. Fambrough, obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by The University of Iowa, Department of Biology, Iowa City, lA 52242) over-night at 4 °C, diluted 1:5000 (α<sub>2</sub> antibody) and 1:1000 (α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>3</sub> antibodies) in blocking solution, followed by 3 × 10 min wash-steps in PBS-T at RT. The blots were then incubated with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated polyclonal swine anti-rabbit IgG, P0217, Dako Inc, Glostrup, Denmark) for 1 hour at RT diluted 1:1 000 in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBS-T, followed by 3 × 10 min wash-steps in PBS-T at RT. Note that blocking, incubations, and in-between washes were done on a rocking table. The blots were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ECL<sup>TM</sup> western blotting analysis system, RPN2109, Amersham<sup>TM</sup>, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) and visualization occurred by use of a scientific imaging system (LAS-3000 Luminescent Image Analyzer, Fuji film Corp, Kanagawa, Japan). After development, the blots were stripped at RT by incubating 15 min in H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 × 15 min in 0.1 M NaOH, 15 min in H<sub>2</sub>O, followed by 30 min in PBS-T. The blots were blocked for 1 hour at RT in blocking solution (5% swine serum in PBS-T).

The blots were then incubated with secondary antibody and developed as described above.</p>
<p>The SDS-page Western blotting experiments were performed at least twice using independent samples, and representative blots were subjected to densitometric analysis where the intensity of the bands was quantified as arbitrary units, AU or Quantum Level, QL (note that background stain in each lane was also determined in parallel and subsequently subtracted). Densitometry was performed using the Multi Gauge v3.2 software (Fuji film Corp), see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. The level of α<sub>2</sub>-protein relative to GAPDH in lysates made from WT E17.5 embryos and newborn pups was set to 100%. In the experiments where more than one WT lysate was tested, the specific level of α<sub>2</sub>-protein relative to GAPDH was normalized to the average level of α<sub>2</sub>-protein in WT lysates. The relative α<sub>2</sub>-protein level in lysates from the different genotypes in % is shown as means ± s.e.m (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). For adult Western blot quantification, ImageJ was used to obtain a numerical value corresponding to the intensity for each band of interest. The three α-isoform protein levels were measured relative to GAPDH for both genotypes and WT ratios were set to 100%. The relative α-isoform protein levels obtained for heterozygotes (+/−) are shown as means ± s.e.m. The specificity of the α<sub>2</sub> antibody was confirmed on a Western blot of rat brain microsomal preparation and allowed for recognition of a protein of 105 kDa (company product sheet), and specificity of the GAPDH antibody was confirmed on a Western blot of HeLa and JAR cell lysates and mouse placenta tissue and allowed for recognition of a protein of 37 kDa (company product sheet).</p>

<p>Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of a mixture of ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) (Sigma-Aldrich Co, St Louis, MO, USA), and they were given supplemental doses of ketamine every 20 min. Body temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a temperature controller and a heating blanket (model TC-1000 Temperature Controller, CWE Inc, Ardmore, PA, USA). The trachea was cannulated for mechanical ventilation with a small-animal ventilator (SAAR-830, CWE Inc). Catheters (100828 DiLab, VeruTech AB, Lund, Sweden) were placed into the left femoral artery and vein and perfused with physiological saline. The end-expiratory CO<sub>2</sub> (microCapstar End-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> Monitor, CWE) and blood pressure (Pressure Monitor BP-1, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) were monitored continuously in combination with blood gases in arterial blood samples (pO<sub>2</sub>: 115–130 mmHg; pCO<sub>2</sub>: 35–40 mmHg; pH: 7.35–7.45; ABL 700 Series; Radiometer Medical, Brønshøj, Denmark) to ensure that animals were kept under physiological conditions. Two craniotomies were performed with a dental drill; one (2-mm-diameter) placed over the barrel cortex was used for recording, and the other (1-mm-diameter) placed over the rostral parietal lobe was used for elicitation of cortical spreading depression (CSD). The dura was carefully removed and visible signs of brain damage or bleeding excluded mice from the experiment. During and after removal of the dura, the craniotomy sites were continuously superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) (aCSF composition in mM: 2.0 glucose, 126.0 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 22.0 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.45 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.0 Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.876 MgCl<sub>2</sub>). The craniotomies were covered with a drop of 0.75% agarose in saline. After the preparation and application of electrodes and probes, anaesthesia was changed to α-chloralose (50 mg/kg/hour, intravenous (i.v.), Sigma-Aldrich Co) that is the best regime to study cerebral blood flow<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.

Experiments were performed after a postoperative recovery period of at least 30 min in order to obtain a stable level of anaesthesia, a stable laser-Doppler baseline, and an arterial blood pressure of 80–110 mmHg. In the end, mice were killed by an overdose of anaesthesia and decapitated afterwards.</p>

<title>Induction of cortical spreading depression</title>
<p>CSD was elicited in the right somatosensory cortex by pressure injection of potassium acetate (KAc, 1 M), and propagated to the barrel cortex. KAc has the advantage over KCl that the tissue is similarly depolarized by K<sup>+</sup> while Ac serves as an anion substitution decreasing the Cl<sup>−</sup> concentration and hence the Cl<sup>−</sup> gradient across the plasma membrane. To allow for induction of single CSD, a micropipette was filled with KAc, connected to a picopump (World Precision Instruments) and inserted into the craniotomy at a depth of approximately 200 μm. KAc was injected during 1–2 s with a 4–6 psi pressure. If no CSD was elicited within 3 min, the injection was repeated until a CSD was elicited. If no CSD was elicited after 3 trials, the injection electrode was retracted to verify that it had not been clogged, before injections continued. Spontaneous CSD events were observed in few mice (1:8 WT mice and 1:9 α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice) after the first CSD event was induced. Notably, these rare spontaneous CSD events could be the result of e.g., remaining KAc in the tissue or KAc from a leaking electrode. The data, given as CSD propagation speed (for a single CSD event) (μm/s), was shown as mean ± s.e.m. and analyzed using Student’s two-tailed, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological recording</title>
<p>The electric signals of the CSD were monitored by two glass microelectrode recording both electrocorticographic (ECoG) signal and the direct current (DC). The DC was recorded to follow the voltage shift during the CSD. ECoG signal constitutes the total electrical signal (without the DC offset) from the cortex surrounding the electrode and is composed of spikes and spontaneous local field potentials, where the largest component is low (&lt;100 Hz) frequency signal. The glass microelectrodes used were single-barrelled, filled with 2 M saline. Two electrodes were placed at a depth of approximately 150 μm in the right somatosensory cortex and they were separated to allow for measurement of the CSD propagation speed. The DC signals were amplified using a differential amplifier (gain × 10, bandwidth 0.1–5 000 Hz, DP-311, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA), A/D converted (20 kHz) and low pass filtered (5 kHz). The ECoG signal was obtained by amplification of the DC signal using CyberAmp 380 (gain × 100, bandwidth 0.1–5 000 Hz; Axon Instruments Inc, Foster City, CA, USA); these signals were digitized using the 1401 plus hardware connected to a computer running the Spike 2.7 software (Cambridge Electronic Design). Stimulation of the mouse whisker pad was done to assess the evoked potentials. Mouse sensory barrel cortex was stimulated contralateral to the craniotomy, in the ramus infraorbitalis of the trigeminal nerve by a set of custom-made bipolar electrodes inserted percutaneously. The cathode was positioned corresponding to the hiatus infraorbitalis (IO) and the anode was inserted into the masticatory muscles. The thalamocortical IO stimulation was done with an intensity of 1.5 mA (ISO-flex, A.M.P.I., Israel) lasting 1 ms, in trains of 15 s at 0.5 Hz. The stimulation was controlled by a sequencer file running within the Spike2 software (version 7.02, Cambridge Electronic Design) and recorded with the same glass microelectrode as for ECoG signal. The amplitude of the local field potentials were summed over the duration of the stimulation (summa LFP) and presented as % relative to pre-CSD induction as means ± s.e.m. and analyzed using a linear mixed model, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>. Evoked potentials were recorded before the CSD and 15 min after the CSD (stimulations were not performed at 0–15 min in order to not perturb the ECoG signal with repeated stimulations which potentially could influence the rate of recovery of the ECoG signal).</p>

<title>Accelerating rotarod test</title>
<p>The rotating rod apparatus (Rota-rod/RS, PanLab Harvard Apparatus) was used to measure the ability of mice to improve motor skill performance/coordination with training. Mice were placed on the rod (3-cm-diameter) for three trials per day for four consecutive days. The first day consisted of 3 × training trials where no data were obtained. The next three days, the first trial of the day was a training trial where no data were obtained, whereas the following two trials were recorded using the SeDaCom software system (version 1.4.02, PanLab Harvard Apparatus). When a mouse fell off the rotarod, it was reintroduced to the rotarod once more, and if the latency to fall this time was more than 20 s, then this latency (s) was added to the latency to fall (s) obtained first. Each trial lasted a maximum of 5 min, and during this time, the rotating rod underwent a linear acceleration from 4 to 40 rpm. Thus, mice were scored for their latency to fall (s) for two trials a day, and the average of these latencies was the latency to fall (s) for a given mouse on that given day. Mice rested a minimum of 20 min between trials to avoid fatigue and exhaustion. The rotarod was cleaned with 70% ethanol and wiped with paper towels between each trial. The data, given as latencies to fall (s) at the indicated days, were shown as means ± s.e.m. and analyzed using two-way ANOVA, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>.</p>

<title>High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrochemical detection of monoamines and GABA</title>
<p>After decapitation, the brain was quickly removed from the skull and different brain regions were rapidly dissected, placed on dry ice, weighed (mg), and stored at −80 °C. At the day of HPLC analysis, the brain tissue samples were briefly sonicated in Eppendorf vials containing 200–800 μL (about 1:20 w/v) of 0.1 M perchloric acid (PCA) with antioxidants (0.2 g/L Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, 0.05 g/L Na<sub>2</sub>-EDTA) and centrifuged at 20 627 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for HPLC analysis of monoamines and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The perchlorate extracts were immediately used for analysis of monoamines and stored at 4 °C for maximally 2 weeks until analysis of GABA. Levels (pmoles/mg wet tissue) of noradrenalin (NA), dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) were assessed by reverse-phase HPLC with electrochemical detection, essentially as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, but using a mobile phase consisting of 10% methanol (v/v), 20 g/L citric acid monohydrate, 100 mg/L octane-1-sulfonic acid sodium salt, 40 mg/L EDTA dissolved in Milli-Q water and pH adjusted to 4.0 according to the protocol (Santiago <italic>et al.</italic> 2010). The Merck-Hitachi HPLC system consisted of an L-7100 pump, an L-7200 autosampler, a D-7000 interface and an electrochemical detector with in-built column oven (Decade, Antec, Leiden, The Netherlands), connected to a computer equipped with D-7000 version 2.0 chromatography software.

A mixture of external standards of monoamines and its metabolites (Sigma-Aldrich Co) was injected (0.5–1 pmol per compound) to identify and quantify the levels of NA, DA and 5-HT in the tissue samples. Before analysis of the level of GABA (nmoles/mg wet tissue) using o-phthalaldehyde (OPA)–sulphite derivatization and electrochemical detection according to the protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, the perchlorate extract (0.1 M PCA) was neutralized with NaOH (5.0 M) (~3 μL in 100 μL) and diluted 250 × or 500 × with milliQ water. A Shimadzu autosampler (SIL-10 AF, Shimadzu Corp, Kyoto, Japan) was set to add 2 μL OPA-sulphite solution to 100 μL diluted sample and after 1 min 5–20 μL of the derivatized sample was injected into the HPLC system. The same type of guard and analytical column as described above for monoamines was used. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1 M monosodium phosphate buffer and 0.5 mM EDTA with 25% methanol (v/v) water adjusted to pH 4.5 with 1 M phosphoric acid, and the OPA-sulphite solution consisted of 22 mg OPA (Sigma-Aldrich Co), dissolved in 0.5 mL sodium sulphite (1 M) to which was added 0.5 mL of absolute ethanol and 0.9 mL of sodium tetraborate buffer (0.1 M) adjusted to pH 10.4 with 5 M sodium hydroxide (this solution remained stable for 2 days when stored in a dark vial at 4 °C).

<p>Increased marble-burying behavior is well-recognized as a mouse trait that mimics the compulsive behavior of OCD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The marble burying protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> was followed. A mouse was placed in a clear plastic box (42 × 26 × 18 cm) containing 25 glass marbles (1.5-cm-diameter) evenly spaced upon a 5 cm deep layer of bedding (Tapvei 4HV aspen bedding, Tapvei Ltd, Korteinen, Finland), without food and water. After 30 min, the number of marbles buried to at least two-thirds of the depth was counted. The burying was documented by photography (Canon Digital IXUS 970 IS camera, Canon, Ōita, Japan). The marbles were cleaned with 3 × water and wiped with paper towels between each trial, and a clean plastic box with bedding was used per mouse. The data, given as marbles buried (n), were shown as means ± s.e.m. and analyzed using Student’s two-tailed, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> comparison test, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>.

<title>Elevated plus maze</title>
<p>Mice normally display an aversion of open spaces, which involves avoidance of open areas by confining movements to enclosed spaces or to the edges of a bounded space, and in elevated plus maze (EPM) this translates into preference of movement to the enclosed arms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. The EPM is a plus-shaped maze that is elevated 50 cm above the floor (Stoelting Co, Wood Dale, IL, USA). It consists of two opposite enclosed arms surrounded by 15-cm high opaque walls and two open arms of the same size (5 × 35 cm). The maze was set up in a dim lit room under a video camera (Panasonic WV-BP332 Surveillance camera, Panasonic Corp, Tokyo, Japan) connected to a computer under the control of the ANY-maze tracking system. Each mouse was placed in the center (5 × 5 cm) of the maze facing one of the open arms. Testing sessions of 10 min were carried out for each mouse and measured the distance (cm) and the number of entries and the time spent in the open arms. The maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol and wiped with paper towels between each trial. The percentage of entries into the open arms was calculated as follows: (open arm entries (n)/(open arm entries (n) + closed arm entries (n))) × 100, and percentage of time (s) spent in the open arms was calculated as follows: ((total time (s) in open arms)/(600 s)) × 100. The experiment was repeated implementing a stress-protocol where the mouse was placed 30 min on a 20 × 20 cm transparent platform raised 1 m above the floor prior to the Elevated plus maze experiment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.

<title>Three-chamber social preference</title>
<p>The three-chamber apparatus is a Plexiglas rectangle with two transparent partitions that make left, center (center, C), and right chambers (each chamber is 20 × 43 cm) (Stoelting Co). Each partition has a square opening (8 × 5 cm) in the bottom center, moreover, the left and right chamber each have a 5 cylindrical wire cage (7-cm-diameter) which was used as an inanimate object or the cage housing a stranger mouse. The three-chamber unit and wire cups were cleaned with 70% ethanol and wiped with paper towels between each trial. The mouse was placed in the center of the three-chamber unit and after 5 min of habituation, the doors were opened. In the next 10-min session, the mouse was allowed access to all three chambers, and in one of the chambers an age- and gender-matched C57BL/6 J mouse (stranger, S) that had never been exposed to the mouse being tested, was placed in one of the two wire cages. The wire cage on the other side remained empty (empty, E). The movement of the mouse was recorded by a Panasonic WV-BP332 Surveillance camera (Panasonic Corp) connected to a computer under the control of the ANY-maze tracking system. Time spent in each chamber (chamber time (s)), entries into each chamber (chamber entries (n)), and time spent within a ~2 cm zone proximal to each wire cage (sniffing time (s)) were measured. The data, given as chamber time (s), sniffing time (s) and chamber entries (n), were shown as means ± s.e.m. and analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>.

<title>Tail suspension</title>
<p>Mice with a stress-induced depression-phenotype are immobile for a longer time period compared to controls when tested in the tail suspension test (TST), and they will terminate their escape-like behaviors earlier than controls leading to less movement of the body (detected by absolute turn angles). We used the tail suspension test (TST)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> to test the α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice for a stress-induced depression-like phenotype and the tail suspension test protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> was followed. The mouse was suspended by the tail using adhesive tape to a horizontal bar (mouse-tip was raised 60 cm from the ground). The mouse was recorded (Canon Digital IXUS 970 IS camera, Canon) for 6 min and mice that climbed their tail were excluded from the experiment (in total four WT mice and one α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mouse were omitted due to tail climbing). The majority of the films were examined manually (all blindly), and the full immobility time (s) per mouse was determined by use of a stopwatch (data not shown). Additionally, all the films were analyzed using the ANY-maze tracking system. Alignment between the manual examination and the ANY-maze recordings were ensured and “88% immobility” in the ANY-maze settings generated an average difference of 6.8% between manual immobility time (s) examination and ANY-maze tracking of immobility time (s), n = 33 mice (comparison not shown). Moreover, the ANY-maze tracking system was used to examine the absolute turn angles (degrees) per mouse, the number of rotations (n) and the mobility time (s). The ANY-maze-generated data were presented in three time intervals on the x-axis adding to 6 min in total. Data from male and female mice were comparable (confirmed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> comparison test) and subsequently pooled. The pooled data, given as immobility (s), mobility (s), absolute turn angles (degrees), and number of rotations (n) in the given time intervals, were shown as means ± s.e.m. and analyzed using two-way ANOVA, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>.

<title>Stress-induced sucrose preference</title>
<p>The stress-induced sucrose-preference test models the specific depression-like syndrome denoted anhedonia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. In the stress-induced sucrose-preference test, normal mice experience pleasure from drinking a sweet solution, and reduced preference for a sweet solution over pure water represents an anhedonic phenotype (= decreased ability to experience pleasure). The stress-induced sucrose preference protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> was modified. Mice were housed with littermates of same genotype and sex. No previous food or water deprivation was applied before the experiment. Every cage had access to a bottle with pure water and a bottle with 2% sucrose solution (1.07687.1000, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) which were weighed every day (and the exact time point was noted), and the placing of the bottles were swapped to prevent possible effects of side preference in drinking behavior. Before the experiment, the mice were habituated to the bottles for 3 days, and hereafter consumption was measured by weighing of the bottles. Weighing data in grams (g) were collected for each bottle in every cage over a period of 3 days (none), 2 days after completion of the first stress protocol (Stress I) and 2 days after completion of the second stress protocol (Stress II)). The first stress protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> involved 3 × foot shock (0.7 mA for 1 s) (Stress I). The second stress protocol involved a series of experiments distributed over a period of 11 days (Stress II): 2 × tail suspension tests for 6 min (see protocol above), 3 × fixations (inhibitory stress) using stress cones (mouse decapicone disposable mouse restrainers DC M200, Braintree Scientific Inc, Braintree, MA, USA) for 60 min, and 3 × forced swim tests (the mouse was released into a transparent cylinder (1 L beaker, Ø 10 cm) filled with 30 °C warm water with a depth of 13 cm for 6 min (the water was regularly changed between subjects). For every day, the percentage of sucrose intake was calculated as follows: (sucrose intake (g)/(sucrose intake (g) + water intake (g))) × 100, and the liquid intake given as: ((2% sucrose intake (g) + water intake (g)) per day/(n) mice in the given cage). For every cage, the average cage-intake of sucrose (%) and liquid consumption (g/mouse/day) over 3 days (None), and 2 days (Stress I and Stress II) were determined. Data from male and female mice were comparable (confirmed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> comparison test) and subsequently pooled. The pooled data, given as 2% sucrose intake relative to water intake (%) and liquid intake (g/mouse/day) at the given protocols, were shown as means ± s.e.m. and analyzed using Student’s two-tailed, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test with Welch’s <italic>post hoc</italic> correction where indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>.

<p>The G→A mutation in exon 8 encoding the FHM2-associated G301R-mutation was introduced by homologous recombination and resulted in α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> knock-in (KI) mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). Several analyses confirmed successful gene targeting and Cre-recombinase-treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a–d,f</xref>). The distribution of sex and genotypes among offspring after breeding of C57BL/6 J mice with α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice (backcrossed to N ≥ 8) was according to Mendel’s law of segregation (Materials and Methods), and the α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice appeared normal and indistinguishable from WT mice by eye. Crossing of two α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice generated homozygous (−/−) α<sub>2</sub><sup>G301R/G301R</sup>, heterozygous (+/−) α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup>, and WT (+/+) α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/+</sup> pups, which were identified by genotyping PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>). The α<sub>2</sub><sup>G301R/G301R</sup> pups died immediately after birth resembling the neonatally lethal phenotype previously reported for another mouse model targeting the <italic>Atp1a2</italic>-gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The design of all behavioral tests allowed for detection of potential gender-coupled differences, and the obtained male and female mice data were only pooled when this was statistically validated (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Moreover, all behavioral experiments were done blind to genotype with age-matched littermates. Additionally, since ovarian hormones can modulate migraine, they may also be able to influence FHM2-related phenotypes, and therefore, we conducted our assay, if applicable, to allow discrimination of female and male phenotypes.</p>
<p>Followed for a year, the body weight progression of male α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice was different from that of WT mice in a period of 4 months (interval: 60–190 days), whereas the body weight progression of female α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice was similar to that of WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1 g</xref>), showing that obesity was not a trait of female α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice.</p>

Interestingly, only female α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice displayed increased marble-burying behavior compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>), and both amantadine and memantine treatments rescued their behavior to that of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g,h</xref>). A subgroup (~30%) of normally cycling female rats displayed changes in marble-burying behavior along the estrous cycle, burying more marble during metestrous compared to proestrous of the menstrual cycle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, showing that marble-burying behavior is low in that menstrual phase where the estradiol level is low. Depoprovera treatment rescued the increased marble-burying behavior of female α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice to that of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4i</xref>), showing that this behavior was indeed influenced by the female sex hormones.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>FHM is an autosomal dominantly inherited subtype of migraine with aura, characterized by transient neurological signs and symptoms. FHM2 is a rare disease and, although more severe, it manifests largely as MA and fulfils the classic migraine criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. A genome-wide linkage scan showed a susceptibility locus for common migraine on chromosome 1q, and <italic>ATP1A2</italic> (or a flanking gene) was hypothesized to be involved in common migraine besides FHM2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Common migraine was recognized as the seventh disabler in the Global Burden of Disease Survey 2010 affecting ~14% of adults, and is the most costly neurological disorder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. The episodic nature of migraine attacks makes the disease difficult to treat and prevent. Moreover, in the majority of cases, migraine is caused by a poorly understood interplay of both genetic and environmental factors, and the frequent co-occurrence of a variety of other manifestations further complicates the pathological picture.</p>
<p>To reach a better understanding of the pathological spectrum of migraine, knowledge of the molecular pathway(s) involved and the co-morbid manifestations are warranted. To address these issues, we generated a knock-in mouse model introducing the FHM2-causing G→A mutation in the <italic>Atp1a2</italic> gene encoding the FHM2 mutation, α<sub>2</sub>G301R. The analyses of α<sub>2</sub>-protein expression all suggest that FHM2 is caused by α<sub>2</sub> haploinsufficiency, with WT protein levels of the brain-expressed paralogs α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>3</sub> isoforms in brain stem (BS), hippocampus (HS), cerebellum (CRBL) and cortex (CTX). These results are comparable to the expression of α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>3</sub> isoforms in total brain lysates reported for the α<sub>2</sub> W887R knock-in mouse model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p>
<p>Our results showed that the α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mouse displayed several behavioral phenotypes, which have relevance for FHM2/MA, co-morbid mood depression and OCD. Moreover, these manifestations occurred in patients from two FHM2-families harboring the α<sub>2</sub>G301R mutation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Both male and female α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice showed specific behavioral phenotypes most likely coupled to imbalance in the glutamate system and probably involving the NMDA receptor, and a mechanism(s) behind FHM2 may be the result of reduced glutamate clearance by astrocytes involving the α<sub>2</sub>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. We provide evidence that both genetic (the <italic>Atp1a2</italic> G301R mutation) and physiological (female sex hormone) factors modulate co-morbid psychiatric manifestations relevant to FHM2. Both clinical and epidemiological data on hormonal modulation of FHM2-related manifestations are limited, but other lines of evidence towards hormonal influence of FHM-related phenotypes exist, and are described below in relation to observed phenotypes for the α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice.</p>
<p>The initiation of CSD is largely dependent on high levels of extracellular glutamate and K<sup>+</sup> ions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The K<sup>+</sup> ions are released after neuronal activity, and believed to accumulate due to decreased removal of K<sup>+</sup> and glutamate by astrocytes. This leads to a wide-arching depolarization which compromise further neuronal firing. The NMDA receptor is a prime “target” for excessive extracellular glutamate, and this receptor does play an important role in the initiation, propagation and duration of CSD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. Although the male α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice showed CSD propagation speed and cerebral blood flow measurements comparable to male WT mice, this is not conclusive as several factors effect the variation of the propaganda speed (e.g, a CSD wave can spread in several directions from the point of induction and not necessarily move in a straight linear direction, which means that the time it takes for the CSD to spread from the site of elicitation can differ between the two electrodes. Moreover, the alignment of the two electrodes may be affected by e.g presence of blood vessels). However, the electrocorticography revealed that the recovery phase after CSD was affected.</p>
<p>In comparison, the α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/W887R</sup> KI mouse model displayed a decreased threshold for CSD induction and an increased CSD velocity of propagation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The differences between these studies, and the studies presented here, likely reflects the different assay conditions i.e., KAc was used for CSD induction in the right somatosensory cortex in the male α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice, whereas incremental current stimuli were delivered up to CSD induction in the occipital cortex in the α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/W887R</sup> KI mice. Moreover, the different use of anesthetics (α-chloralose versus urethane) could also explain the differences observed. Notably, previous studies of other anesthetics were shown to influence the CSD induction threshold and propagation speed differently<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>.</p>
<p>Moreover, in line with a previous study of two FHM1 knock-in mouse models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, the level of recovery of evoked potentials 15 min. after CSD is the same in WT and α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice, indicating that the spontaneous activity (ECoG signal) is affected whereas the evoked activity is not. The fact that the evoked potentials do not fully recover to <italic>pre</italic>-CSD levels, as observed for the two FHM1 knock-in mouse models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, probably reflects that some of the mechanisms that underlie this unfiltered EEG signal have not recovered within the time frame of the experiment. Further study of two different FHM1 knock-in mouse models showed that the female knock-in mice were more susceptible to CSD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> than male knock-in mice, and this sex difference was abolished by ovariectomy and senescence, proving a role for the female sex hormone cycle—besides the genetics—in the susceptibility to CSD. In this context, it is interesting that the α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice displayed additional female-specific behaviors related to both the glutamate system and the female sex hormone cycle, indicating that female α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice might be more sensitive to the (molecular) alterations that the α<sub>2</sub>G301R-mutation cause, and thus, the penetrance of specific behavioral phenotypes might therefore be higher compared to male α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice.</p>
<p>There is a preponderance of females among migraineurs suffering from FHM, sporadic hemiplegic migraine (SHM) and familial non-hemiplegic MA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. The levels of total estrogen and estradiol were elevated in migraineurs with aura at the two stages (menses and ovulation) investigated compared to control group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>. Notably, MA has been considered an absolute contraindication to the use of combined hormonal contraception<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>, and preliminary results showed that progestin-only contraception had a positive effect in the course of MA, reducing the number of days with migraine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>. Several of the female-specific behaviors of α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice were rescued to WT behaviors by a single Depoprovera treatment that reduced/stabilized the estrogen levels. A previous study has shown that treatment of fertile rats with a raloxifene-analog reproduced the effects observed after ovariectomy, proving that the raloxifene-analog functioned as an anti-estrogen in the cerebral brain areas investigated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>. Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of raloxifene-treated astrocytes demonstrated an increase in glutamate uptake<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, showing that an anti-estrogen effect mediated by the estrogen receptor enhances glutamate clearance of astrocytes.</p>
<p>There is increasing evidence that alterations in glutamatergic neurotransmission contributes to migraine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. EAAT2 is predominantly expressed in astrocytes and is crucial for glutamate uptake in the central nervous system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>. Moreover, previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicated a role for the α<sub>2</sub>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, in complex with EAAT1 and EAAT2, in astroglial glutamate uptake, i.e., glutamate clearance from the synaptic cleft<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. We showed that glutamate uptake is impaired <italic>in vitro</italic> in hippocampal-derived matured mixed cultures of astrocytes and neurons obtained from α<sub>2</sub><sup>G301R/G301R</sup> E17 embryonic mice compared to WT. In mixed cultures, neurons will support glutamate uptake, but to a much lower degree than the astrocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>. Although embryonic and adult neurons do express the α<sub>3</sub> isoform (which has a lower sodium affinity than the α<sub>2</sub> isoform), and thus, could support sodium-coupled glutamate uptake, it is unlikely that the difference in glutamate uptake observed between the mixed cultures derived from α<sub>2</sub><sup>G301R/G301R</sup> homozygous and WT E17 embryonic mice, represents a difference in neuronal glutamate uptake.</p>
<p>The α<sub>2</sub> isoform is expressed in a differential developmental manner: the α<sub>2</sub> isoform is mainly found in astrocytes and in a small subset of hippocampal neurons in the adult brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, which is in contrast to the newborn brain, where the α<sub>2</sub> isoform is predominantly found in neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>. This indicates that the reduced glutamate uptake in the matured mixed astrocyte and neurons cultures from the α<sub>2</sub><sup>G301R/G301R</sup> mice (mimicking adult conditions) should mostly be attributed to the lack of a functional α<sub>2</sub>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in astrocytes, however, lack of a functional α<sub>2</sub>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in the subset of neurons, which would normally express a functional α<sub>2</sub>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, could also account for a fraction of the reduced glutamate uptake observed.</p>
<p>Moreover, we observed higher levels of glutamate in lysates from various brain areas from adult female α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice compared to lysates from WT mice, although, it remains to be elucidated whether the increased glutamate level is derived from extra- and/or intracellular compartments. Altogether, these data support that the molecular mechanism behind FHM2 is coupled to the glutamate system and coupled to reduced glutamate clearance of astrocytes involving the α<sub>2</sub>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Estradiol has previously been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to enhance depolarization-induced presynaptic glutamate release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic> to increase both the total glutamate level and the extracellular glutamate level in the arcuate nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that estrogen plays a significant role in the auto-regulation of brain (and blood) glutamate levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref>. Furthermore, our results suggest that high levels (and/or fluctuating levels) of estradiol might aggravate the effects on the glutamate system caused by haploinsufficiency of the gene encoding the α<sub>2</sub>-isoform of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.</p>
<p>Studies of migraineurs with aura (between attacks) and migraine-prone children showed that they exhibited an increased responsiveness to aversive acoustic stimuli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>. Increased ASR behavior is also observed in patients with OCD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">76</xref>, and, to date, adult females from two different FHM2-families—one harboring the α<sub>2</sub>G301R mutation—have been diagnosed with OCD besides FHM2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">77</xref>. Moreover, accumulating evidence (neuroimaging, animal models, candidate gene and treatment studies) points to the fact that glutamate system defects might lead to OCD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">78</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">79</xref>, which is in agreement with cerebrospinal fluid from OCD-affected adults containing increased glutamate levels compared to controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">80</xref>. Notably, different psychiatric manifestations (including OCD) are reported to be co-morbid to MA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81">81</xref>.</p>
<p>A human study based on questionnaires to female outpatients with primary OCD showed that reproductive cycle events do influence the symptom severity of OCD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b82">82</xref>. The female-specific α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice behaviors mimicking compulsive behaviours of OCD could be rescued to WT behaviors by Depoprovera and memantine (an NMDA receptor antagonist<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b83">83</xref>), whereas OCD-related female- and male-specific α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice behavior could be rescued to WT behavior by treatment with amantadine (an NMDA receptor antagonist<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84">84</xref>). Our results showed that behaviors likely resulting from lack of proper glutamate clearance of astrocytes could be circumvented by treatment with amantadine or memantine, which both are proposed to allow normal synaptic transmission but decreasing over-activation of NMDA-receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84">84</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85">85</xref>. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are currently the first-line OCD-treatment, however, ~40–60% of OCD-patients remain refractory to treatment with SSRIs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b86">86</xref>.</p>
<p>The association between anxiety and migraine has been observed in both clinic- and community-based studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b87">87</xref>. Moreover, an epidemiological study reported the presence of anxiety disorders in 75.8% of the OCD patients studied<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b88">88</xref>. Notably, mild anxiety was reported in an FHM2-family during attacks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b89">89</xref>, however, the α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice did not appear anxious in the EPM assay. This is different compared to previous FHM2 mouse models, which showed an increased susceptibility to fear and anxiety<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b90">90</xref> and most likely, this could be either attributed to different mouse inbred strains, or the fact that different exons and mutations were knocked-out or introduced, respectively, mimicking the complex genotype-phenotype in FHM2 patients. To date, social phobia has not been reported for any FHM2 family. However, a population study showed association between migraine and social phobia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b91">91</xref>. Moreover, an epidemiological study reported a 43.5% prevalence of social phobia/anxiety in OCD making this anxiety disorder the most frequently observed anxiety disorder co-morbid to OCD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b88">88</xref>. The α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice showed behavior characteristic for decreased sociability, supporting clinical findings for migraine and OCD patients.</p>
<p>Population studies demonstrated that depression was co-morbid with migraine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b92">92</xref>, and mood depression was described for a FHM2-family harboring the α<sub>2</sub>G301R-mutation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Moreover, an epidemiological study reported that 63.3% of OCD-patients suffered from a mood disorder besides OCD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b88">88</xref>. In line with these studies, the α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice exhibited stress-induced depression. Altogether, our data support the opinions that co-morbid psychiatric manifestations to migraine/FHM2 should be considered part of the pathological spectrum.</p>
<p>The behavioral phenotypes of α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice are likely caused by an intricate interplay of effects that are generated by reduced glutamate clearance from the synaptic cleft, and they seem to be aggravated and extended in female α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice by effects of the female sex hormone cycle hereon. The alterations in the glutamate system in male and female α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice and the role of the female sex hormone cycle in female-specific α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mice behaviors, open up a range of possibilities for developing optimal strategies to successfully treat FHM2/migraine patients with co-morbid psychiatric manifestations.</p>
<p>Some clinical limitations apply to our study. Firstly, the experiments were performed in mice, which are imperfect models of human neurological disorders. Secondly, a few studies exist describing the therapeutic effects of different NMDA receptor antagonists on migraine or migraine related symptoms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b93">93</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b94">94</xref>, however, it is uncertain if FHM2 patients would benefit from treatment with amantadine, memantine or other NMDA receptor antagonists. Interestingly, a recent study showed that amantadine could improve obsessive compulsive symptoms when used as an adjunctive therapy to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in OCD-patients refractory to SSRI pharmacotherapy alone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b95">95</xref>. These results support the hypothesis that dysfunctional transduction of the glutamate signal via the NMDA receptor play a role in OCD, and thus, may play a similar role in OCD co-morbid to FHM2. Thirdly, the female sex hormone cycle might prove valuable as a target for treatment of females suffering from FHM2 and/or common migraine, however, this will require further clinical testing.</p>

<p><bold>Author Contributions</bold> K.L.H. and P.N. conceived the study. K.L.H. outlined the overall cloning strategy and initiated cloning of the targeting construct. P.B. further devised and cloned the targeting construct, designed screening procedures for generating the α<sub>2</sub><sup>+/G301R</sup> mouse model, and managed backcrossing and breeding of mice for all experiments. P.B. devised and performed body weight studies, accelerating rotarod test, estradiol assays, acoustic startle response test (PBS-controls), marble burying tests, tail suspension tests, stress-induced sucrose preference tests, dissected adult mice brains for Western blot analysis and glutamate assays, and made the bioinformatics. S.G. performed accelerating rotarod test, acoustic startle response tests (majority), elevated plus maze tests, and three-chamber social preference test, A.H. performed mice genotypings, glutamate assays, and Western blot analysis. T.J.I. performed quantifications of α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>3</sub> Western blot analysis, and marble burying tests with the memantine treatment. The electrophysiology (C.S.D. and C.B.F.) was performed by B.G. and M.L. The aspartate uptake was performed by N.B.L., E.G., A.A. B.H.C. and K.L.L. performed open field and grip strength tests, J.B.G. performed HPLC analysis. P.B. and K.L.H. interpreted the data. P.B. wrote the manuscript. K.L.H. directed the overall project and co-wrote the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p>
