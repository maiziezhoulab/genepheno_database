<abstract>
<p>Anatomical and functional brain abnormalities begin during fetal life in Down syndrome (DS). We hypothesize that novel prenatal treatments can be identified by targeting signaling pathways that are consistently perturbed in cell types/tissues obtained from human fetuses with DS and mouse embryos. We analyzed transcriptome data from fetuses with trisomy 21, age and sex-matched euploid controls, and embryonic day 15.5 forebrains from Ts1Cje, Ts65Dn, and Dp16 mice. The new datasets were compared to other publicly available datasets from humans with DS. We used the human Connectivity Map (CMap) database and created a murine adaptation to identify FDA-approved drugs that can rescue affected pathways. <italic>USP16</italic> and <italic>TTC3</italic> were dysregulated in all affected human cells and two mouse models. DS-associated pathway abnormalities were either the result of gene dosage specific effects or the consequence of a global cell stress response with activation of compensatory mechanisms. CMap analyses identified 56 molecules with high predictive scores to rescue abnormal gene expression in both species. Our novel integrated human/murine systems biology approach identified commonly dysregulated genes and pathways. This can help to prioritize therapeutic molecules on which to further test safety and efficacy. Additional studies in human cells are ongoing prior to pre-clinical prenatal treatment in mice.</p>

<body>
<p>The intellectual disability in Down syndrome (DS) is associated with delays in neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and brain growth that first become apparent during fetal development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Few efforts, however, have focused on developing prenatal therapies that can improve embryonic brain development and neonatal cognitive outcomes in DS. To date, human clinical trials have been mainly conducted on adolescents and young adults in whom processes that are critical for brain development and cognition are largely complete<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Our laboratory is focused on identifying and testing treatments that a pregnant woman can take orally following a prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 (T21). We hypothesize that therapies that specifically target signaling pathways and cellular processes that are perturbed in fetuses with DS will positively impact brain growth and wiring, leading to significant improvement of postnatal cognitive outcome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p>
<p>We previously analyzed cell-free fetal RNA (cffRNA) from the amniotic fluid (AF) of living human fetuses diagnosed with T21 and age and sex-matched euploid controls to compare real-time gene expression abnormalities that occur <italic>in utero</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Our findings suggested that fetuses with DS have genome-wide gene expression changes that affect multiple cellular processes and signaling pathways, including oxidative stress, ion transport, cell stress response and G-protein signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The use of cffRNA has, however, two major limitations: (1) the transcripts in the amniotic fluid are partly degraded and provide limited information compared to other human tissues, and (2) cffRNA from AF does not fully reflect brain development even though it contains several brain specific transcripts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p>
<p>To overcome these challenges, we developed a novel integrated human/murine systems biology approach by analyzing the transcriptome of multiple cell types and tissues from both humans with DS and mouse models. This included a newly generated dataset of gene expression in cultured human fetal amniocytes as well as a reanalysis of published datasets in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSCs-derived neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> and post-mortem human fetal brain tissue (cerebellum and cerebrum)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. We also generated new expression data using embryonic forebrains from the three most commonly used mouse models of DS (Ts1Cje, Ts65Dn and Dp16) and compared the mouse and human transcriptomes. Using these integrated analyses, we established a list of signaling pathways and cellular processes that can be further evaluated as candidates for prenatal treatment. We used the Connectivity map (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/CMap" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.broadinstitute.org/CMap</ext-link>) database for humans and adapted it to the mouse to test whether maternal treatment induces therapeutic effects in the pups. In contrast to other drug screening databases that contain only a limited drug library, the Connectivity Map (CMap) database contains more than 7,000 gene expression profiles generated before and after treatment of five different cell lines (MCF7, ssMCF7, HL60, PC3, SKMEL) with 1,309 FDA-approved compounds. It uses unbiased pattern-matching algorithms to identify drugs that can counteract an abnormal transcriptome signature in a disease state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p>
<p>Our goal was to use an objective transcriptome based approach, and to interrogate the CMap database for unbiased identification of FDA-approved molecules that have a rational basis for therapy, and can be further evaluated for safety and efficacy in preclinical trials.</p>

<title>Human Amniocytes</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Tufts Medical Center and Women and Infants’ Hospital (Tufts protocol ID: 5582, Women and Infants’ protocol ID: 01-0028). All methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines after obtaining informed consent from all pregnant women participating in this study. Second trimester amniocytes were obtained after centrifugation at 1,100 RPM for 5 min from residual second trimester AF samples of women carrying singleton fetuses undergoing clinically indicated genetic testing. The initial sample set consisted of fourteen flasks of amniocytes with the following metaphase karyotypes: 47, XX, +21 (<italic>N</italic> = 4); 47, XY, +21 (<italic>N</italic> = 3); 46, XX (<italic>N</italic> = 4); 46, XY (<italic>N</italic> = 3). Gestational ages ranged from 15 2/7 to 20 5/7 weeks. Amniocytes (10<sup>+5</sup> cells) were plated in 25 cm<sup>2</sup> cell culture flasks and incubated at 37 °C (20% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) until they reached 90–95% confluence. The optimized AmnioMax™ C-100 basal media and AmnioMax™ C-100 supplement (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) were used for culture. For RNA extraction amniocyte density was adjusted to 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml (10 ml total volume) and centrifuged at 1100 RPM for five min. The cell pellet (10<sup>6</sup> cells) was rinsed with ice-cold PBS 1X before proceeding to RNA extraction. RNA was extracted using TRIzol<sup><bold>®</bold></sup> Reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA). RNA concentrations were measured as absorbance at 260 nm and RNA quality was analyzed with the Bioanalyzer (Agilent Biotechnologies, Santa Clara, CA).</p>

<title>Mouse Embryonic Forebrain</title>
<p>All murine experiments were conducted according to international ethical standards detailed in the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Tufts University (Protocol B2013-20). Dp16 (B6-Dp(16Lipi-Zfp295)1Yey/J; Stock: 013530) and Ts1Cje males (B6-T(12;16)1Cje/CjeDnJ) were crossed with C57Bl/6J females (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). Ts65Dn females (B6EiC3Sn.BLiA-Ts(1716)65Dn/DnJ; Stock: 005252) were crossed with C57BL/6JEi × C3H/HeSnJ F1 hybrid (B6EiC3) males. The presence of a vaginal plug was defined as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5) and 10% weight gain at embryonic day 10 (Johnson <italic>et al</italic>. 2010). Embryos were recovered at E15.5 and the forebrain was dissected before storage at −80 °C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Total RNA was isolated from the developing forebrain of Dp16 (N = 6), Ts65D (N = 5), Ts1Cje (N = 5) embryos and their respective euploid littermates (N = 6, 6 and 5 respectively) using the RNA II kits, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Macherey-Nagel, Bethlehem, PA).</p>

<title>Human Amniocytes</title>
<p>RNA of amniocytes derived from seven fetuses with trisomy 21 (T21) and sex and gestational age-matched euploid fetuses was converted to cDNA and hybridized to Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Fourteen arrays were used (7 T21 and 7 euploid); each array corresponded to labeled cDNA from one amniocyte culture. Analyses were performed using a paired t-test and Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rates (BH-FDR) of 5% and 20% as a cut-off<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. We used paired t-tests to match for fetal sex and gestational age.</p>

<title>Mouse models embryonic day 15.5 forebrain</title>
<p>RNA was converted to cDNA and hybridized to Affymetrix mouse gene 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Twenty-three arrays were used to generate this dataset (6 Dp16 and 6 WT littermates, 5 Ts65Dn and 6 WT littermates); each array corresponded to labeled RNA from one individual embryonic forebrain. The gene expression data from the Ts1Cje embryonic forebrain were published previously (NCBI GEO ID: GSE62538). For each mouse strain, sex-genotyping was performed using <italic>Sry</italic> targeted primers (<italic>Sry-F</italic>: GCTGGGATGCAGGTGGAAAA; <italic>Sry-R</italic>: TGATGGCATGTGGGTTCCTG) as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Equal numbers of male and female embryos were used in all experiments.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were carried out on the normalized data using R software (version 2.13.1). Gene expression data from Dp16, Ts65Dn and Ts1Cje tissues were compared to their respective control littermates using an unpaired t-test and Benjamini-Hochberg cut-offs of 5% and 20%. Ts1Cje, Ts65Dn and Dp16 mouse models carry duplications of 77, 128 and 145 protein and non-protein-coding genes on the mouse chromosome 16, respectively.</p>

<p>Functional pathway analyses were performed using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) with the Developmental FunctionaL Annotation at Tufts (DFLAT), the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen, Redwood City, CA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. We compared the amniocyte dataset with our previously published data from the second trimester AF supernatant (NCBI GEO ID: GSE16176), and datasets generated by other groups using iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons (NCBI GEO IDs: GSE48611, GSE42956) as well as human post-mortem fetal cerebrum and cerebellum data (NCBI GEO ID: GSE1397) from fetuses with T21 and age and sex-matched euploid fetuses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Because of the limited number of differentially-regulated genes detected at FDRs off 5% and 20%, we used the top 1% up- and down-regulated genes in all of these datasets for a more comprehensive functional pathway analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="3">
<title>Embryonic Forebrain in Mouse Models of DS</title>

<title>Comparison of Pathway Abnormalities in Humans and Mice</title>
<p>We performed comparative analyses for the human cells and tissues and the mouse embryonic forebrain transcriptomes using GSEA/DFLAT, DAVID and IPA to identify pathway changes that were consistently dysregulated in the different species.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Screening for Molecules That Target Commonly Dysregulated Pathways</title>
<p>Probe sets that were statistically-significantly differentially up and down-regulated were used to query the CMap Database to identify molecules that show opposite gene expression responses. Potentially therapeutic molecules will have a negative enrichment score on a scale between 0 and −1.0. Because the CMap database uses exclusively human Affymetrix probe set identifiers, the murine gene sets had to be converted to the corresponding human Affymetrix probe set IDs. To accomplish this, murine genes were first converted to their human homolog (using an R algorithm and information from NCBI’s HomoloGene) and subsequently matched to Affymetrix U133A Plus 2.0 probe sets (using probe set annotation data downloaded from the Affymetrix website). Because of the limited number of differentially regulated genes at FDR 20%, we uploaded the list of top 1% up- and down-regulated human probes and the top 1% up- and down-regulated “humanized” murine probes to the human and murine-adapted CMaps.</p>
<p>To screen for relevant drugs that can reverse abnormal transcriptome signatures in both humans with DS and in mouse models, we ranked the CMap drug output for each cell type and tissue based on their enrichment scores and used a cut-off value of −0.7 to select the most relevant molecules. We performed a quality control check on the list of drugs proposed by the CMap using a known list of seven drugs that have been previously tested in preclinical and/or clinical trials in mouse models and humans with DS, respectively. To test the specificity of the CMap data output for DS, we also checked the connectivity score of three additional drugs that are being used as treatments for other unrelated conditions, including riluzole (autism spectrum disorder), streptomycin (antibiotic)and metformin (type 2 diabetes).</p>

<title>Primary Effects in Tissues and Cell Types Derived from Humans with DS</title>
<p>The differentially-regulated genes at BH-FDR cut-offs of 5% and 20% are shown in the “<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Results</xref>” section and “<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>”. A limited number of differentially-regulated genes were identified at an FDR of 5% (103, 8, 49 and 46 for the human amniocytes, Dp16, Ts65Dn and Ts1Cje mouse models, respectively). We therefore used an FDR threshold of 20%. This resulted in a higher number of differentially-regulated genes (786, 26, 74 and 71 for the human amniocytes, Dp16, Ts65Dn and Ts1Cje mouse models, respectively). We used these genes for the rest of the study to be able to identify commonly dysregulated genes between different human and mouse cell types and tissues. When we compared the expression of <italic>Hsa</italic>21 genes in multiple cell types and tissues derived from individuals with DS, we found that only a limited number of these genes were differentially-regulated in the cell types and tissues examined in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). All of these genes were located on the long arm of human chromosome 21 (21q) between <italic>AP001347.6</italic> and <italic>DSTNP1</italic>. Eight were non-protein coding genes. The largest number of differentially-expressed genes mapped to the 21q11-21q22.3 chromosomal region encompassing <italic>LIPI</italic> and <italic>ZBTB21</italic> (also known as <italic>ZNF295</italic>) and the remaining genes were distal to <italic>ZBTB21</italic> on 21q.3. Only two genes (<italic>TTC3 and USP16</italic>) were differentially-expressed in all human cell types and tissues, and 29 genes were overexpressed in at least two human cell types and/or tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="3">
<title>Primary Effects in the Mouse Embryonic Forebrains</title>
<p>When the three mouse models were analyzed as a group, we found that a little more than a third of the <italic>Hsa</italic>21 orthologous genes on <italic>Mmu</italic>16 (i.e. 56 protein-coding and non-coding between <italic>Lipi</italic> and <italic>Zbtb</italic>21) were differentially-regulated during forebrain development. Eleven genes were consistently dysregulated in all three models, fifteen genes were common to the Dp16 and Ts65Dn models, and twenty-one were common between Ts1Cje and Ts65Dn. Each mouse model had uniquely dysregulated genes: four in Dp16, six in Ts1Cje and ten in Ts65Dn (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="3">
<title>Similarities and Differences Between Humans with DS and Mouse Models</title>
<p>Most differentially-expressed genes on <italic>Hsa</italic>21 were located between <italic>LIPI</italic> and <italic>ZBTB21</italic> in a region that is orthologous to the distal region of <italic>Mmu16</italic> that is duplicated to different extents in the Ts1Cje, Ts65Dn and Dp16 models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Among these genes, only two (<italic>USP16</italic> and <italic>TTC3</italic>) were differentially-expressed in all human cell types and tissues, 11 were dysregulated in at least two human cell types/tissues and two mouse models and 18 genes were uniquely differentially- regulated in different human cell types and tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, multiple genes on <italic>Hsa</italic>21 that are orthologous to mouse chromosomes 10 (<italic>Mmu</italic>10) and 17 (<italic>Mmu</italic>17) were also statistically significantly differentially-regulated in at least two human cell types and tissues. Three of these, <italic>SLC37A1</italic>, <italic>PDE9A</italic>, <italic>RRP1B</italic> are orthologous to <italic>Mmu</italic>17, and five are orthologous to <italic>Mmu</italic>10 (<italic>PDXK</italic>, <italic>CSTB</italic>, <italic>YBEY</italic>, <italic>C21ORF33</italic> and <italic>UBE2G2)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="3">
<title>Comparison of the Genome-Wide Effects of Trisomy in Human and Mouse Tissues</title>
<p>We found that human cell types and fetal brain showed important signature similarities particularly between iPSCs, iPSCs-derived neurons, cerebrum and cerebellum. Amniocytes from fetuses with DS showed some similarities with the fetal cerebrum and iPSCs, but to a lesser extent than iPSCs-derived neurons and the fetal cerebellum. Up-regulated gene lists showed more signature similarities than down-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>When the Ts1Cje, Ts65Dn and Dp16 mouse models were compared, we observed that embryonic forebrains showed molecular signature similarities. These similarities were more pronounced when up-regulated gene lists were compared between models.</p>
<p>When human cell types/tissues and mouse models transcriptome profiles were compared, we observed that signature similarities between species were less obvious compared to the similarities within each species. Up-regulated gene lists were more consistent between humans with DS and all mouse models.</p>
<p>We performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the differentially regulated genes at FDR 20%, and observed that trisomic samples clustered together and were clearly separated from euploid samples in all cell types/tissues except amniocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Gene Dosage-Specific Effects and the Activation of Global Cell Stress and Compensatory Mechanisms in DS</title>
<p>Our functional pathway analyses of multiple human cell types and tissues indicated that the presence of an extra copy of <italic>Hsa</italic>21 resulted in very complex downstream effects that can be generalized into two different categories: (1) increases in the transcriptional activity of <italic>Hsa</italic>21 and target genes, leading to abnormal neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress response and increased inflammation; and (2) global cellular stress response with the activation of compensatory mechanisms, including DNA-repair signaling, abnormal regulation of cell cycle checkpoints and kinetochore organization, increased proteolytic activity and the activation of anti-apoptotic genes. The dichotomy between these two categories is not simple to explain as they are activated simultaneously and triggered by an imbalance of the kinase/phosphatase homeostasis, G-protein signaling abnormalities and the disruption of the cytoskeleton and microtubule networks.</p>

<p>In agreement with our gene expression studies, cellular similarities and differences were previously reported between humans with DS and mouse models.

Moran <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref> tested the effects of piracetam in the Ts65Dn mouse model. These results were mixed: piracetam treatment improved the performance of Ts65Dn mice in the visible platform version of the Morris water maze test and blocked the beginning of the dark phase hyperactivity seen in these mice. In contrast, piracetam did not improve the performance of Ts65Dn mice in the hidden platform version of the MWM. Additionally, piracetam treatment started at 4 weeks of age and mice were tested around 10 weeks of age. There is no information available on the effects of piracetam on Ts1Cje and Dp16 mice. Furthermore, the effects of piracetam treatment during the fetal and neonatal periods of life have not yet been investigated. More detailed behavioral and molecular studies on multiple mouse models are needed to better investigate the effects of piracetam. With regards to humans, only one double-blinded human clinical trial was conducted in a cohort of 25 children with DS of which only 18 completed the study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. The authors analyzed 72 primary outcome measures of attention, memory, perceptual abilities, executive function and fine motor skills. Forty-six of these measures produced better results with the piracetam group compared to the placebo group. Additionally, 11 of the 18 parents reported cognitive improvement with piracetam and only two parents reported an improvement with placebo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, fluoxetine gave positive enrichment scores in all tissues examined and the most positive average connectivity score (0.441). Previous studies reported that prenatal treatment with fluoxetine had long lasting therapeutic effects in the Ts65Dn mouse model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>. Another study on adult Ts65Dn mice, however, revealed that fluoxetine treatment at 0.2 mg/ml did not improve behavioral deficits, and resulted in seizures (in three Ts65Dn mice) and death (in four Ts65Dn animals), respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>. Fluoxetine has not been evaluated in other mouse models of DS. There are no human studies of fluoxetine for DS in the literature. A clinical trial of prenatal treatment with fluoxetine is just starting to enroll subjects in the United States. Our CMap results would suggest that this treatment may not be helpful and could be potentially harmful.</p>
<p>N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists MK801 and memantine were previously tested as potential treatments of adult phenotypic deficits in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome. Both treatments induced a significant increase of locomoter activity in Ts65Dn adult mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. Additionally, memantine treatment improved Ts65Dn performances in the Morris water maze test and rescued the number of vGlut1 granule cells in the hippocampus of aged Ts65Dn mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>. MK-801 and memantine have not been evaluated in other mouse models of DS, and their safety and efficacy for prenatal treatment is still unknown. Two randomized double-blinded studies tested the effect of 16-weeks memantine treatment on the cognitive and adaptive functions of adults with Down syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>. Although no significant differences were observed in the primary outcome measures, the authors reported significant improvement in one of the secondary measures (California Verbal Learning Test-II) after treatment.</p>
<p>As a proof of principle for our integrated approach, we tested the effects of apigenin, one of the molecules predicted by the CMap to treat dysregulated pathways in DS, on human amniocytes derived from fetuses with DS and on the Ts1Cje mouse model of DS. Apigenin treatment reduced oxidative stress in DS amniocytes and improved some aspects of brain morphogenesis, gene expression and postnatal behavior in the Ts1Cje mouse model (manuscript in preparation).</p>
<p>At the present stage of knowledge, the connectivity and pathways maps are only a part of an unknown global network dysregulation; therefore, discrepancies between our results and some published studies might be linked to unknown connections. Additionally, analyzing the transcriptome modifications gives only one picture of the problem as translational modifications can create protein variations in ways different from RNA variations, and as protein networks may react differently to drugs than RNAs due to protein modifiers acting upon protein stability or protein interactants.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, we used a novel human/mouse integrated approach to demonstrate both similarities and differences in gene expression and signaling pathways in humans with DS and mouse models. These similarities and differences should be taken into account when designing and testing therapeutic interventions with drugs that can specifically target these pathway abnormalities. Here, we used the human CMap to objectively discover and repurpose safe compounds to test hypotheses regarding prenatal treatment of DS. The CMap search identified 17 high priority molecules predicted to reverse pathway changes in both human cells and mouse models. To determine the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these compounds, we are currently testing their safety and efficacy <italic>in vitro</italic> (amniocytes and iPSCs from fetuses with DS) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (in multiple mouse models of DS).</p>

<title>Primary Effects of Trisomy in Humans with DS and Mouse Models.</title>
<p>Comparison of the Hsa21 and Mmu16 orthologous differentially regulated genes at FDR 20% in human cell types and tissues and embryonic forebrain from the Dp16, Ts65Dn and Ts1Cje mouse models of DS. Differentially regulated genes in all human and mouse cell types/tissues examined (Pink) and in at least two human cell types/tissues and two mouse models (Blue) are represented. It is important to notice that, in addition to the Hsa21 orthologous genes on the mouse Mmu16, a number of genes that are not triplicated in the Dp16, Ts65Dn and Ts1Cje mouse models and that are orthologous to the Mmu10 and Mmu17 in mouse are also significantly differentially regulated in humans with DS (Red).</p>

<title>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of cell types/tissues from humans with T21 and mouse models.</title>
<p>PCA analysis of the differentially-regulated genes lists at FDR 20% shows a clear separation between euploid and trisomic samples in all tissues examined.

<p>A negative connectivity score suggests that a particular drug reverses the transcriptomic signature in samples derived from humans with DS and mouse models. A complete rescue is associated with a connectivity score of −1.00. A positive connectivity score suggests that a particular drug will exaggerate the gene expression abnormalities in DS. A null score suggests no effects on the DS signature. CMap drug list was ranked from the highest to the lowest average connectivity score for all the cell types and tissues examined.</p>
