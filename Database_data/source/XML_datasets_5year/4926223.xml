<abstract>
<p>To investigate the role of synaptic zinc in the ASD pathogenesis, we examined zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) null mice. At 4–5 weeks of age, male but not female ZnT3 null mice exhibited autistic-like behaviors. Cortical volume and neurite density were significantly greater in male ZnT3 null mice than in WT mice. In male ZnT3 null mice, consistent with enhanced neurotrophic stimuli, the level of BDNF as well as activity of MMP-9 was increased. Consistent with known roles for MMPs in BDNF upregulation, 2.5-week treatment with minocycline, an MMP inhibitor, significantly attenuated BDNF levels as well as megalencephaly and autistic-like behaviors. Although the ZnT3 null state removed synaptic zinc, it rather increased free zinc in the cytosol of brain cells, which appeared to increase MMP-9 activity and BDNF levels. The present results suggest that zinc dyshomeostasis during the critical period of brain development may be a possible contributing mechanism for ASD.</p>

<body>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder with characteristic symptoms such as deficits in social communication and interaction, difficulty in verbal and nonverbal communication<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, and stereotyped behaviors such as body rocking and hand flapping<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. In most ASD cases, autistic symptoms manifest at approximately 1–3 years of age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, indicating that the disease process starts during early childhood. One baffling fact is that the prevalence of ASD seems to be rapidly increasing; the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that the prevalence of ASD may be as high as 1 in 68 in the USA (CDC 2014). In addition, the prevalence of ASD in certain areas of South Korea may be as high as 2.64% and is therefore more than two times as prevalent as in the United States of America (USA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Although heightened awareness of ASD by clinicians and parents may be a contributing factor for this rise, it is likely that certain unidentified factors are also causing a real increase in ASD incidence worldwide. Whichever is the case, the current high prevalence is a considerable clinical and socioeconomic challenge, especially because there are no effective preventive or therapeutic measures that can fundamentally change the course of the disease.</p>
<p>Diverse causes of ASD - genetic, epigenetic, and environmental - have been identified, but common pathological mechanisms as a whole are not yet completely understood. Because more than 200 genes have been identified that are potentially linked to ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, it is likely that a second hit during the critical period of brain development may play an important role in causing ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Some environmental factors, including infections, and prenatal or early postnatal nutritional deficiency, have been proposed as contributing conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. It is therefore of interest that dietary zinc deficiency may induce autistic-like behaviors in mouse models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Because the stabilization of the postsynaptic density protein Shank3, a gene that has been linked to ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, is induced by zinc<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, zinc deficiency around synapses may contribute to abnormal synaptic physiology in these mice. Alternatively, because zinc is involved in a number of critical changes during brain development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, zinc deficiency in the brain might cause structural changes in the brain that in some cases might lead to autism phenotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In fact, the plasma zinc/serum copper ratio and hair zinc levels were reported to be decreased in ASD children<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, which suggest that infantile zinc deficiency may be a risk factor for ASD.</p>
<p>One intriguing and unanswered feature of ASD is that brain growth during early childhood may be accelerated in certain cases of ASD. Kanner first noted macrocephaly in some ASD patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Since then, other investigators have reported similar findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. One interesting point is that the head circumferences of ASD patients are normal at birth, but they became larger between 6 and 14 months of age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. MRI studies have shown that large head size is correlated with large brain size<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Consistent with these findings, the brains of ASD patients have been found to contain a larger number of neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. This increase in brain size appears to be age-dependent. Courchesne <italic>et al</italic>., for example, reported that increased brain volume may occur largely during early childhood, followed by normalization to control values at older ages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The megalencephaly in ASD suggests that ASD brains may be developing under an altered trophic environment or altered developmental control. Levels of the neurotrophic factor BDNF are often increased in various models of ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and may underlie brain overgrowth.</p>
<p>Considering these findings, we proposed the hypothesis that BDNF upregulation may be a core pathogenic mechanism for megalencephaly and autism phenotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Previously, we demonstrated that MMP activation can lead to increased BDNF release and TrkB activation in cortical neuronal cultures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Conditions that raise MMP activity in the brain may, in certain cases, lead to a phenotype that includes a larger brain and autistic-like behavior. Because mammalian brains contain a large and dynamic pool of zinc in glutamatergic synaptic vesicles (synaptic zinc), it is plausible that synaptic zinc plays a role in MMP activation and BDNF upregulation around synapses. However, contrary to our expectations, a recent study by Helgager demonstrated that ZnT3 null mice, in which synaptic zinc is absent, show increased levels of BDNF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Hence, the absence of synaptic zinc, especially during brain development, may cause the upregulation of BDNF by an unidentified mechanism and may possibly induce large brain size and autistic phenotypes. In the present study, we used ZnT3 null mice to examine these possibilities.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Male ZnT3 null mice exhibit autistic behavior</title>
<p>To evaluate the autistic behavior in ZnT3 null or WT mice, behavior tests were carried out in a genotype-blinded manner with the following order, 3-chamber social behavior test (postnatal day or PND32), marble burying test (PND34), open field and reciprocal social interaction test (PND36) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Social behaviors of zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) null and wild-type (WT) mice were quantitatively investigated with 3-chamber tests. At 4 weeks of age, with experimenters blinded to genotypes, mice were placed in a 3-chambered box, and their behaviors were recorded with a computer-based motion analysis system. In the social interaction test, time spent in the empty chamber vs time spent in the chamber containing a stranger mouse (stranger 1) was measured. Compared with WT mice, male ZnT3 null mice spent more time in the empty chamber and less time in the chamber containing stranger 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>,c). The pattern observed in male ZnT3 null mice was consistent with reduced social interaction. Next, when a new stranger mouse (stranger 2) was placed in another chamber, male ZnT3 null mice tended to interact more with the now familiar stranger 1 than with stranger 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>,b), which indicated that novelty-seeking behavior was reduced in male ZnT3 null mice. By contrast, female ZnT3 null mice were not different in social interaction and social novelty behaviors from WT controls of the same sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Next, a test for reciprocal social interactions was conducted. Overall interacting time and total interaction time were significantly shorter in male ZnT3 null mice compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). By contrast, regional and total interaction times in female ZnT3 null mice were not different from WT female mice.</p>
<p>Next, we conducted marble burying tests to examine repetitive behavior. Compared with male WT mice, male ZnT3 null mice exhibited increased marble burying activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Female mice showed little difference between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). These data indicate that ZnT3 null mice tend to show more repetitive behavior in a male gender-specific fashion. In the open field test, male ZnT3 null mice spent significantly less time in the center of the cage than WT mice, another feature that is consistent with autistic-like behavior<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In addition, the total moving distance of male ZnT3 null mice was less than that of male WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Although these mice appear to have normal motor strength, a more formal test may be needed to rule out the possible contribution by subtle motor weakness herein.</p>
<p>Neither total moving distance nor time spent in the center area was different in the female groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). However, no significant differences were noted between female WT and female ZnT3 null mice in all behavior tests. Thus, having determined that autistic phenol types occurred in only the male ZnT3 null mice, subsequent experiments were conducted in male mice.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Brain size, neurite density, and neuronal numbers are increased in male ZnT3 null mice</title>
<p>Postmortem examinations of brains revealed that at 5 weeks of age, the brains of male ZnT3 null mice were clearly larger in size than those of male WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>,b). Although no difference was noted at 8 days of age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1a,b</xref>), the size difference was evident and statistically significant even at 15 days of age, and it became greater at 5 weeks of age. At 5 weeks of age, the frontal region in particular appeared substantially larger in male ZnT3 null mice than in WT mice; as a result, their brains had a more roundish appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The cerebral surface areas of female ZnT3 null mice were not larger than those of female WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1c,d</xref>). To estimate cortical sizes in living mice, T2-weighted MRIs of brains were obtained. Cortical sizes were found to be greater in male ZnT3 null mice than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). NeuN immunostaining revealed that the number of neurons in the frontal area was larger and western blotting determined expression of NeuN was significantly increased in cortex of ZnT3 null brains than in WT brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Finally, SMI32 (Neurofilament H Non-Phosphorylated) immunostaining revealed a marked increase in the density of SMI32 (+) neural processes in the cortical layers of male ZnT3 null mice. Consistently, SMI32 expressions in cortices of male ZnT3 null mice were significantly increased in Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Hence, male ZnT3 null mouse brains appeared to have undergone increased neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth during the early developmental stage, which raises the possibility that male ZnT3 null brains were developing in an environment with increased neurotrophic influence.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Levels of BDNF and TrkB are increased in male ZnT3 null mice</title>
<p>Consistent with this possibility, in several models of ASD such as a fragile X syndrome model (Fmr1−/−) of mice and valproate-treated mice, levels of the neurotrophic factor BDNF are increased<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Hence, we examined BDNF levels in maleZnT3 null mouse brains. Fluorescence immunohistochemical staining with an anti-BDNF antibody revealed that overall BDNF levels were significantly increased in male ZnT3 null brains compared with WT brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Western blot analysis of cortical tissues also showed that ZnT3 null brains contained higher levels of both the pro-form and the mature form of BDNF in cortex. In hippocampus, only the mature form was increased. Furthermore, the level of TrkB, the main BDNF receptor, also appeared to be increased in ZnT3 null brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>,c). Levels of NT4/5, NGF, and p75NTR were not altered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Intracellular free zinc levels and MMP activity are paradoxically increased in ZnT3 null mouse brains</title>
<p>In our previous study, we showed that zinc can activate MMPs and lead to BDNF release and TrkB activation in cultured cortical neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Hence, we explored whether the ZnT3 null state might, in addition to resulting in the disappearance of zinc in synaptic vesicles, somehow alter free zinc levels in the cytosol of developing neurons. To assess this trait, we performed Zinpyr-1 staining. The results were contrary to our expectation that the ZnT3 null state would lead to decreased free zinc levels: we observed only faint zinc fluorescence that was localized in certain cell bodies in WT brains, cultured cortical neurons and slice cultured hippocampus, but zinc fluorescence in ZnT3 null brains, cultured cortical neurons and slice hippocampus appeared to be more intense and more diffuse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Consistent with increased free zinc loads in male ZnT3 null brain cells, levels of metallothioneins 1 and 2 (<italic>Mt1/2</italic>), which are known to be induced by increases in cytosolic free zinc levels, were found to be substantially increased in ZnT3 null brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>,c). In contrast, mRNA levels of <italic>Mt3</italic> which is constitutively expressed regardless of cytosolic free zinc levels, did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Shank3 expression, modulated by zinc, was also significantly increased in the cortices of ZnT3 null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Next, we examined whether MMP levels and activity were altered in male ZnT3 null brains. Compared with WT brains, male ZnT3 null brains exhibited more intense staining in MMP zymograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). For instance, the superficial layers of the cortex as well as the corpus callosum showed increased MMP activity. Zymogram on protein electrophoresis gels also showed significant increases in the activity of MMP-9 in the male ZnT3 null brains compared with the WT brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). However, MMP activity was not altered in female ZnT3 null mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4a,b</xref>).</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Increases in <italic>BDNF</italic>, <italic>Mt1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> mRNA, BDNF/TrkB, and neurite outgrowth in cultured ZnT3 null cortical neurons</title>
<p>Fluorescence immunocytochemical staining with an anti-MAP2 antibody revealed that the neurite number was significantly increased in cultured cortical neurons from ZnT3 null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Neurite outgrowth was observed in the cultured ZnT3 null cortical neurons (arrows). Moreover, fluorescence immunostaining with an anti-BDNF antibody appeared that BDNF expression was increased in neuronal bodies and dendrites of cultured ZnT3 null neurons (arrows), which consistent with BDNF expression in ZnT3 null brain tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Densitometric analysis of BDNF expression also showed that cultured ZnT3 null neurons contained higher levels of BDNF than WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Hence, cultured ZnT3 null neurons also appeared to have undergone increased neurite outgrowth with increased neurotrophic influences. Based on quantified real time PCR analysis, <italic>Mt1/2</italic> and <italic>BDNF</italic> mRNA levels were increased in the cultured ZnT3 null cortical neurons compared with WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). The fact that <italic>Mt1/2</italic> mRNA levels were substantially increased, were consistent with possible increases in cytosolic free zinc levels in ZnT3 null cortical neurons. Again, the level of <italic>Mt3</italic> mRNA showed no difference between WT and KO cortical neurons in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). These were consistent with the results obtained in WT and ZnT3 null mouse brains. Additionally, mature BDNF and TrkB levels were markedly increased in cultured ZnT3 null cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Raising intracellular zinc levels increases MMP activity and BDNF expression</title>
<p>Because free zinc levels seemed to be increased in the hippocampus and cortex of ZnT3 null brains, we examined whether increasing intracellular zinc could activate MMP-9in cortical cell cultures. To increase intracellular zinc levels, we exposed cultured cortical neurons to 1 μM clioquinol (ClioQ), a zinc ionophore, or ClioQ plus 1 μM zinc (Zn) for 1 hour. Staining with Fluozin-3 revealed that ClioQ and, to a greater extent, ClioQ plus Zn, increased intracellular free zinc levels without significant neuronal cell death (few PI stained cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). As we observed in brains, ClioQ plus Zn markedly increased <italic>Mt1/2</italic> mRNA levels without significantly altering <italic>Mt3</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). MMP gel zymograms revealed that ClioQ plus Zn markedly increased MMP-9 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). ClioQ and ClioQ plus Zn significantly increased the pro and mature forms of BDNF as well as TrkB, as assessed by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Minocycline prevents changes in mixed cortical cultures and male ZnT3 null mice</title>
<p>Finally, we investigated a possible causal link between MMP-9 activation and BDNF upregulation, increased brain size, and autism phenotypes in ZnT3 null mice. We used minocycline to inhibit MMP-9 in cultures and in mice. In cultured neurons and astrocytes, in the ClioQ plus Zn experiments, minocycline markedly attenuated the MMP-9 activation that was induced by increased intracellular zinc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>,f). Furthermore, minocycline was effective at reducing BDNF and TrkB up-regulation in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6g</xref>).</p>
<p>After confirming that minocycline acts <italic>in vitro</italic> as an effective MMP inhibitor, we tested it in ZnT3 null mice. Administration of 50 mg/kg minocycline three times per week for 2.5 weeks substantially reduced MMP-9 activity in male ZnT3 null brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). The rationale of choosing 7–27 days for the MC treatment was mainly because the growth spurt in brain size occurred during this early stage of development (5 weeks may be too late). Minocycline treatment also decreased BDNF levels in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Furthermore, the brain size of male ZnT3 null mice was reduced by minocycline treatment to a size similar to normal control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). Finally, the 3-chamber tests showed that minocycline treatment resulted in a reduction in autistic-like behaviors in male ZnT3 null mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d–f</xref>). These results indicate that MMP activation contributed to the autism-related changes observed in ZnT3 null mice.</p>
<p>A diagram describes the mechanism by which minocycline reverses autistic behavior in the ZnT3 null mouse by decreasing MMP-9 activation and BDNF expression. Deletion of ZnT3 increases intracellular zinc and activates MMP-9 in the ZnT3 null brain via increased metallothionein-1/2. Activated MMP-9 induces excessive BDNF expression and neurite outgrowth/neurogenesis. Autistic-like behaviors appeared in ZnT3 null mice with megalocephaly. Minocycline administration ameliorated autistic-like behaviors in ZnT3 null mice by reducing the activation of MMP-9 and BDNF expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

<sec disp-level="1">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The central finding of the present study is that male ZnT3 null mice exhibit features characteristic of ASD such as reduced social interactions and increased repetitive behavior relative to age-matched male WT mice. By contrast, ZnT3 null female mice exhibit no behavioral differences compared with female WT mice. This male gender specificity is consistent with the male preponderance in autism prevalence in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> and suggests an important role for the early influence of male sex hormones on aberrant brain development in this model.</p>
<p>Earlier studies of the role of zinc in brain development indicated that severe zinc deficiency during the prenatal period is associated with retarded brain growth and functional abnormalities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>; in addition, overall neurogenesis is reduced, resulting in microcephaly. More recently, dietary zinc deficiency has been reported to cause autism phenotypes in mice, likely by reducing synaptic transmission<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Because the brain contains a dynamic pool of labile zinc, which is stored in synaptic vesicles through the action of ZnT3 (SLC30A3) and released upon depolarization to modulate synaptic physiology, it has been proposed that abnormalities in synaptic zinc levels may contribute to the above-mentioned brain dysfunctions such as microcephaly that are observed in nutritionally zinc-deficient animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Consistent with these ideas, dietary supplementation or injections of zinc have been shown to have beneficial effects in ASD patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.</p>
<p>However, contrary to our original expectation, in the present study, the specific genetic deletion of ZnT3 in male mice resulted in the enlargement of the brain, and especially of the frontal region. Enlarged brains, or megalencephaly, may commonly accompany ASD in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Although it is unclear whether neuronal and/or neurite overgrowth occurs in idiopathic ASD, functional MRI studies have suggested that most ASD brains may be hyperconnected<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, a finding that is consistent with the increased neurite arborization noted in the present study. In fact, in a few animal ASD models that exhibit increased brain sizes, for instance, the <italic>Pten</italic> KO mouse model and valproate model, neuronal connectivity is also increased<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Consistent with these findings, the present results demonstrated that in male ZnT3 null mice, neuronal number, cortical thickness, and possibly neuronal size were all increased compared with age- and sex-matched WT mice. Although we did not examine the mice for functional hyperconnectivity in this study, the overall increase in SMI-32 (+) and MAP2 (+) neurite density seems to be consistent with the hyperconnectivity hypothesis. Thus far, there is no evidence that mutations or SNPs of the ZnT3 gene are linked to ASD. However, a recent study suggested that allelic variants of the ZnT3 gene are gender-specific, in this case female-specific, and are associated with schizophrenia, another neurodevelopmental disorder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. An interesting possibility is that certain SNP’s in the ZnT3 gene or other genes involved in zinc homeostasis might be found to be associated with ASD.</p>
<p>To search for possible biochemical causes of the observed change in brain size, we focused on BDNF, a potent neurotrophic factor, the upregulation of which has been implicated in certain cases of ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. In male ZnT3 null mice, the level of mature BDNF was increased in both the hippocampus and neocortex over levels observed in WT mice. Moreover, the level of pro-BDNF was increased in cortex but not in the hippocampus. Hence, although BDNF may be upregulated throughout the forebrain, its specific pattern of expression may differ between brain regions. Although the precise mechanism for BDNF upregulation in ZnT3 null mice is unknown, this finding is consistent with the report by Helgager that showed increased BDNF levels in relatively young ZnT3 null brains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The combination of upregulated BDNF and increased brain size in male ZnT3 null mice suggests the interesting possibility that BDNF upregulation is one of the factors that causes large brains as well as autism phenotypes in these mice. Levels of TrkB, the tyrosine kinase receptor for BDNF that mediates most of its neurotrophic effects, were also increased in male ZnT3 null brains, whereas neither the levels of p75NTR, another neurotrophin receptor that favors the pro-from of BDNF, nor the levels of NGF and neurotrophin 4/5 were changed. BDNF and TrkB upregulation may be caused by zinc dyshomeostasis as seen in cultured cortical neurons exposed to clioquinol plus zinc. In addition to causing long-term increases in neurotropism, BDNF and TrkB may also alter short-term synaptic physiology as it modulates ion channels such as NMDA receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. BDNF phosphorylates NMDA receptors by activating Src and potentiating its function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. In fact, NMDA receptor hyperfunction has been implicated in the IRSp53 null mouse model of ASD, and an NMDA antagonist memantine reversed the autism phenotype in this model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>.</p>
<p>How the BDNF upregulation is brought about in ZnT3 null mouse brains is not known. Because zinc itself can increase BDNF expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, this finding in brains devoid of synaptic zinc was the opposite of our initial expectation. Another notable finding is that an enlarged brain and BDNF upregulation were observed by the time the mice were 15 days old, when the level of synaptic zinc is minimal in WT mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Hence, effect of the ZnT3 null state may not be due to the absence of synaptic zinc but to other unknown developmental changes caused by the absence of ZnT3. In fact, we found that zinc fluorescence, an indicator of free zinc levels, was substantially increased in cells in male ZnT3 null brains. Hence, it is possible that during the early developmental stage, the absence of ZnT3 may alter zinc homeostasis in non-vesicular compartments, including the cytosol. Such increases in free zinc levels in the cytosol may induce the upregulation of BDNF, as was shown in the results from cortical cell culture experiments. It is interesting that BDNF upregulation by zinc seems to be causally linked to MMP activation. In cultured neurons and astrocytes, the activation of MMPs increases BDNF levels, partly through induction and partly through proteolytic conversion of pro-BDNF to mature BDNF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Our results showed that the rise in free zinc levels, as shown in male ZnT3 null brain cells and as induced in cultured cortical cells by raising cytosolic free zinc levels with clioquinol plus zinc, was associated with increased MMP levels and activity. The mechanism of MMP induction/activation by zinc warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Although the precise mechanism that links ZnT3 deletion to autism remains to be determined, our results indicate that the upregulation of MMPs is critically involved. The inhibition of MMP activity with minocycline not only normalized the BDNF upregulation and increased brain size but also ameliorated autistic social behaviors in male ZnT3 null mice. The role of MMPs in ASD in general has not been extensively investigated. However, in an animal model of fragile X syndrome that is often associated with autism and macrocephaly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, MMP-9 activity in the brain was increased<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref> and MMP inhibition by minocycline reduces abnormal social behaviors in these mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Although clinical improvement was not obtained, minocycline treatment for 6 months did reduce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) BDNF levels in 3–12 year-old patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. The lack of effect on autism symptoms in this trial might have been due to the possibility that MMP activation and BDNF upregulation during the early stage may induce autism phenotypes, but BDNF upregulation at later stages may not play a large role in the maintenance of autism phenotypes. Despite the negative result on autism symptoms in this pilot trial, it may be useful to try minocycline at earlier time points of the disease, for instance, shortly after symptom onset. Since the MMP inhibitory effect of minocycline may also inhibit microglial activation and inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>, these effects may also mediate the beneficial effect of minocycline in male ZnT3 null mice.</p>
<p>It is intriguing that both zinc deficiency and zinc dyshomeostasis may be linked to ASD. While zinc deficiency may contribute to ASD through synaptic dysfunction, zinc dyshomeostasis during the critical developmental period may cause abnormal brain growth by the above mentioned pathway. Since megalencephaly may occur in a subset of ASD patients, zinc dyshomeostasis may be relevant in these cases.</p>
<p>Initially, we hypothesized that low levels of synaptic zinc would be the cause of ASD phenotype in ZnT3 null mice. However, what we found was, as described in the manuscript, rather substantial increases in free zinc levels in the cytosol of neurons in ZnT3 null mouse brains. That may explain why MMP activity and BDNF/TrkB levels were not decreased but increased. At this moment, it is unknown whether this mechanism – zinc dyshomeostasis, MMP activation, BDNF upregulation – operates in sporadic ASD cases, especially ones accompanied by megalencephaly. We hope that our study may provide a plausible and testable hypothesis in these human cases.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we propose the hypothesis that abnormalities in the zinc-metalloprotease-BDNF (ZMB) axis may be a common denominator mechanism that is involved in producing ASD associated with megalencephaly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. To further test this idea, we plan to utilize other genetic or toxin models of ASD and to examine the changes in synaptic zinc, MMP and BDNF in those models.</p>

<title>Autistic-like behaviors of male ZnT3 null mice.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) A time-table to evaluate the autistic behavior in ZnT3 null or WT mice. The order for the behavior tests is 3-chamber social behavior test at PND32, marble burying test at PND34, and reciprocal social interaction test or open field test at PND36. (<bold>b</bold>) Tracking of the movements of mice in 3-chambered boxes. Male ZnT3 null mice moved less and interacted less with stranger 1 (social interaction test) and stranger 2 (social novelty test) than the male WT mice. (<bold>c</bold>) Bars denote the percent of exploration time in the chamber for stranger 1 (social interaction) or stranger 2 (social novelty) by male (right group) and female (left) WT and ZnT3 null mice (mean ± SEM, WT male, n = 24; KO male, n = 37; WT female, n = 11; KO female, n = 12, ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>n.s</italic>.: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test). Female WT and ZnT3 KO mice showed little difference in either test, whereas male ZnT3 KO mice spent significantly less time in the stranger chambers in both tests. (<bold>d</bold>) Reciprocal social interaction test. Compared with male WT mice, the ZnT3 null mice exhibited diminished total sniffing time. By contrast, female mice showed no difference compared with WT in total interaction time (mean ± SEM, WT male, n = 18; KO male, n = 28; WT female, n = 11; KO female, n = 14, **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, <italic>n.s</italic>.: <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05; one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test, three-way repeated measures ANOVA). (<bold>e</bold>) Repetitive behavior: Marble-burying test. Bars indicate that the male ZnT3 null mice buried more marbles than male WT mice (mean ± SEM, WT male, n = 32; KO male, n = 18; WT female, n = 14; KO female, n = 13, **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, <italic>n.s</italic>.: <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05; two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test). (<bold>f</bold>) Open field test. Bars show the total distance moved and the time spent in the center. Male ZnT3 null mice moved less and spent less time in the center than male WT mice (mean ± SEM, WT male, n = 14; KO male, n = 15; WT female, n = 15; KO female, n = 10, *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <italic>n.s</italic>.: <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05; one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test).</p>

For the analysis, eight coronal slices from bregma +0.42 mm to −3.58 mm with a 0.5 mm interval were measured and analyzed using Image J software. Cortex size (whitened areas, arrows) of ZnT3 null brains was significantly larger than those of WT brains (mean ± SEM, WT, n = 8; KO, n = 10, *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction). (<bold>d</bold>) Photographs of NeuN-stained coronal sections of brains of male WT and ZnT3 null mice. The cortical thickness of ZnT3 null brains was greater than in WT brains. And NeuN expression in the cortex of ZnT3 null brain was greater than that in WT brains.

<title>Abnormalities in Zinc-MMP-BDNF (ZMB) axis may contribute to the emergence of megalencephaly and autistic-like behaviors in ZnT3 null mouse.</title>
<p>A diagram describing how the deletion of ZnT3 induces autistic-like behaviors with increased intracellular zinc and activated MMP-9 in ZnT3 null brains. Activated MMP-9 induces excessive BDNF expression and neurite outgrowth/neurogenesis. Autistic-like behaviors appeared in the male ZnT3 null mouse and were accompanied by megalencephaly. Minocycline administration ameliorated autistic-like behaviors in the male ZnT3 null mice by reducing MMP-9 activation and BDNF expression.</p>
