<p id="Par1">Several studies have linked the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIP12 (Thyroid hormone Receptor Interacting Protein 12) to the cell cycle. However, the regulation and the implication of this protein during the cell cycle are largely unknown. In this study, we show that TRIP12 expression is regulated during the cell cycle, which correlates with its nuclear localization. We identify an euchromatin-binding function of TRIP12 mediated by a N-terminal intrinsically disordered region. We demonstrate the functional implication of TRIP12 in the mitotic entry by controlling the duration of DNA replication that is independent from its catalytic activity. We also show the requirement of TRIP12 in the mitotic progression and chromosome stability. Altogether, our findings show that TRIP12 is as a new chromatin-associated protein with several implications in the cell cycle progression and in the maintenance of genome integrity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">TRIP12 (Thyroid Hormone Receptor Interacting Protein 12) is a 225 kDa HECT (Homologous to the E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus) domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase. It is also known as ULF (Ubiquitin Ligase for ARF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and UFD4 (Ubiquitin Fusion Degradation) in S. cerevisae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. TRIP12 contains protein interacting WWE (tryptophan and glutamate conserved residues) and β-ARM (β-Armadillo) domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Several functions are attributed to TRIP12. For instance, it ubiquitinates APP-BP1 (Amyloid Precursor Protein-Binding Protein 1) and BAF57 (Brg1-Associated Factor 57) turn over and is therefore described as a sensor of SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable) complex integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. TRIP12 is also known to control the histone ubiquitination after DNA breakage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and to contribute to p14/ARF (Alternate Reading Frame) degradation in response to DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. TRIP12 ensures the proteolysis of ASLX1 (Additional Sex Combs Like 1, Transcriptional Regulator), a regulatory component of the ubiquitin hydrolase BAP1 (BRCA1 Associated Protein 1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We showed that TRIP12 is implicated in the proteasome-mediated degradation of the transcription factor PTF1a (Pancreas specific Transcription Factor 1a) that plays an important role in the maintenance of the acinar phenotype in human pancreas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. TRIP12 is essential for cell viability as a homozygous mutation that disrupts the ubiquitin ligase activity leads to murine embryonic lethality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Importantly, TRIP12 plays an important role in the cell cycle. For instance, <sup>Trip12 mt/mt</sup> ES cells display reduced growth with increased expression of the p16/CDKN2A gene and an accumulation in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, by controlling the tumor suppressor protein p14/ARF, TRIP12 impacts TP53 protein level, a major regulator of the cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. TRIP12 expression is altered in several types of cancer, such as breast and pancreatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. High expression of TRIP12 is associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma after surgical resection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. TRIP12 is involved in radio-sensitization of head and neck squamous carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. TRIP12 mutations are also related to autism disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and intellectual disability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">Cell cycle progression is governed by sequentially organized events. Mitogen signaling pathways impose to the cell the exit of G<sub>1</sub> phase to duplicate its genome. The licensing of replication (Minute Chromosome Maintenance) to form the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). In S phase, the origins firing is dependent of the assembly of other proteins and the activity of CDKs (Cyclin Dependent Kinase). A multitude of additional factors are then recruited such as RPA (Replication Protein A), PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) and polymerases to constitute the fully functional replisome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. DNA replication is spatio-temporally ordered. Replication of euchromatin regions occurs in early S phase whereas heterochromatin regions in late S phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Subsequently, cells enter in a transition phase G<sub>2</sub> that ensures the complete DNA replication. In late G<sub>2</sub> phase, the initiation of mitosis is promoted by a complex comprising of the CYCLIN B1 and the Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1 (CDK1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This complex is inhibited by the phosphorylation of Tyrosine 15 residue on CDK1 by the WEE1 kinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Chromatin condensation, separation of duplicated centrosomes and the recruitment of proteins to the kinetochores, all mark the prophase. The resulting release of chromosomes activates the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) that controls the proper segregation of chromosomes and inhibits the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) complex. In metaphase, the correct attachment of chromosomes to the kinetochores inhibits the SAC allowing for progression and ending of mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Mitotic dysfunction leads to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy favoring the initiation of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. A prolonged activation of the SAC can provoke cell death or mitotic exit without separation of sister chromatids; named mitotic slippage. Improper separation of sister chromatids (anaphase bridges) induces the formation of micronuclei, which can be at the origin of DNA damages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The succession of the different cell cycle phases requires a perfectly coordinated expression and activation of multiple proteins. This coordination is ensured by a multi-layer regulation including transcription, mRNA degradation, translation, post-translation modification and protein degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. For instance, protein expression of CYCLIN A begins in S phase, peaks during G<sub>2</sub> phase and dramatically declines in mitosis. It combines a tight coordination of transcription, mRNA translation and protein degradation.</p>
<p id="Par4">Among the proteins that participate in cell cycle regulation, a significant proportion interacts with chromatin to modulate, for instance, the transcription (<italic>i.e</italic>.: transcription factors) and the chromatin structure (i.e.: histones, chromatin remodeling complexes, condensin). These proteins can bind to chromatin by recognition to a specific DNA consensus sequence <italic>via</italic> different DNA-binding domains. (<italic>i.e</italic>.: β-Helix-Loop-Helix, zinc fingers) but also <italic>via</italic> intrinsically disordered regions (IDR). IDRs are protein domains that lack a stable 3D structure under physiological conditions. IDRs can be predicted from the amino acid sequence according to their physicochemical properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. They interact with DNA in a nucleotide sequence-independent manner, thereby modifying chromatin structure and regulating gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">Our findings expose for the first time that TRIP12 protein expression is tightly regulated during cell cycle, and, that TRIP12 interacts with euchromatin through a new functional N-terminal domain. By means of this chromatin interaction, we further propose that TRIP12 participates in mitotic entry by controlling duration of DNA replication. We further demonstrate that TRIP12 is implicated in mitotic progression and in chromosome stability.</p>

<p id="Par6">The E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIP12 was shown to control the expression of important regulators of the cell cycle progression. However, the regulation of TRIP12 during the cell cycle is still unknown.

<p id="Par7">Next, TRIP12 protein level was measured following the same kinetics <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1E</xref><bold>)</bold>. Present in S phase, TRIP12 expression gradually increases to reach a maximal expression in G<sub>2</sub> phase and mitosis.

TRIP12 protein level was also measured in enriched cell populations in G<sub>1</sub>, early S, and G<sub>2</sub> phase <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1F</xref><bold>)</bold>. As expected, TRIP12 protein was barely detected in G<sub>1</sub> phase, appears in early S phase to reach a maximal expression in G<sub>2</sub> phase. These results clearly demonstrate that TRIP12 protein expression varies throughout the cell cycle while its mRNA remains at a constant level and, they suggest that TRIP12 protein is degraded during G<sub>1</sub> phase, or <italic>Trip12</italic> mRNA translation is tightly regulated, or a combination of both.</p>

<title>TRIP12 is a cell cycle-regulated nuclear protein associated with chromatin</title>
<p id="Par8">We tested whether TRIP12 cell-cycle regulation correlated with its sub-cellular localization. First, we first showed that TRIP12 is a nuclear protein but it is not present in all cells <bold>(</bold>Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1A</xref>). The specificity of TRIP12 nuclear staining was verified (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1B</xref>). Interestingly, TRIP12 nuclear staining did not colocalize with dense DAPI regions that correspond to peri-nuclear and peri-nucleolar heterochromatin regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2B</xref>), suggesting that TRIP12 preferentially colocalizes with euchromatin regions. TRIP12 nuclear localization was assessed during the cycle of asynchronous HelaS3 cells. We found that TRIP12 is barely detectable in late G<sub>1</sub> cells and appears in early S phase cells reaching a maximal detection in late S and G<sub>2</sub> cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2C</xref>). TRIP12 absent-cells observed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2B</xref> correspond to cells in G<sub>1</sub> phase. It is known that euchromatin regions are replicated early during S phase and are stained homogenously after EDU incorporation. On the contrary, heterochromatin regions are replicated late in S phase and form punctiform staining with EDU. Interestingly, TRIP12 staining corresponds to DNA regions with homogenous and not punctiform EDU staining <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2C</xref><bold>)</bold>, corroborating the localization of TRIP12 on euchromatin regions <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2B</xref><bold>)</bold>. Cell cycle-dependent presence of TRIP12 in the nucleus was confirmed in G<sub>1</sub>-, early S- and G<sub>2</sub>-phase enriched cell populations (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1C</xref>).

TRIP12-chromatin association was also confirmed by chromatin-bound protein fractionation <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2F</xref><bold>)</bold>. The colocalization with chromatin during metaphase was also observed using a HA-tagged TRIP12 construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2A</xref>).

<title>TRIP12 is associated with chromatin through a N-terminal intrinsically disordered region</title>
<p id="Par9">We identified several IDRs in the TRIP12 sequence that could potentially act as chromatin interacting-domains, notably one in the N-terminus located between the amino-acids 1 and 440 <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3A</xref><bold>)</bold>. An analysis in metaphasic cells showed that TRIP12 colocalization with chromatin is mediated by its N-terminal IDR. Whereas the deletion of the C-terminal HECT domain (TRIP12(1-1552)-GFP) does not affect the capacity of the fusion protein to colocalize with chromatin, the deletion of the IDR (TRIP12(446-1992)-GFP) abolishes it <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3B</xref><bold>)</bold>. In parallel, the subcellular localization of full-length TRIP12-GFP and four TRIP12-GFP deletion constructs in cells in interphase led us to conclude that, similar to endogenous TRIP12, TRIP12(1-1992)-GFP localizes exclusively in the nuclear compartment. More importantly, the TRIP12(1-445)-GFP localizes in the nucleus demonstrating that the N-terminal IDR is sufficient for the nuclear localization of TRIP12; suggesting that this region contains a nuclear localization signal <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3C</xref><bold>)</bold>. Moreover, IDR alone can ensure a physical direct interaction with naked DNA <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3D</xref><bold>)</bold> and the localization of GFP on full-length metaphasic chromosomes (Figs. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3B</xref>). The colocalization of TRIP12 and its IDR with chromatin was confirmed in living cells (Figs. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3C</xref>). A more precise analysis of the IDR reveals that the region between the amino acids 107 and 325 ensures the interaction of TRIP12 with chromatin (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3D</xref>,E). Interestingly, cells that express a high level of the IDR construct display characteristic features of cells in prophase with condensed chromosomes covering the inner face of the nuclear membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3F</xref>) even if they are not pHH3-Ser10 positive (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3G</xref>, bottom panel) as they should be a normal cell (Top panel).

<title>A shortened duration of DNA replication explains the accelerated mitotic entry of TRIP12-depleted cells</title>
<p id="Par14">We next aimed to determine the causes of the accelerated mitotic entry of TRIP12-depleted cells. Mitotic entry is governed by a succession of events that leads to the condensation and the segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells. Among them, the Tyr15-dephosphorylation of CDK1 and the kinase WEE1-cytosolic translocation are essential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

It is reported that the cytosolic translocation of WEE1 is mediated by CYCLIN A nuclear import which begins early during S phase to allow DNA replication <italic>via</italic> the activation of the kinase CDK2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

This corroborates with a significant increased proportion of cells with CYCLIN A nuclear staining in TRIP12-depleted cells <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6C</xref><bold>)</bold>. The important role of CYCLIN A in DNA replication led us to investigate the status of DNA replication in CYCLIN A nuclear-positive cells.

Euchromatin regions are replicated early during S phase when heterochromatin regions are replicated in late S phase. Interestingly, we measured in EDU-positive asynchronous cells a higher proportion of cells in late S phase in TRIP12-depleted cells demonstrating that the depletion of TRIP12 specifically accelerates the DNA replication of euchromatin regions.

<title>A TRIP12 depletion prolongs the SAC activation, leads to chromosome segregation defects and cell growth inhibition</title>
<p id="Par15">In addition to accelerate DNA replication, we observed that a TRIP12 depletion can lead to other cellular alterations such as a prolonged activation of the SAC. We observed that in control cells, the percentage of pHH3-Ser10 positive cells reaches a maximum at = 60 min before the physiological loss of pHH3-Ser10 at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5E</xref><bold>)</bold>. In contrast, this percentage persists at a maximal level for 60 min (t = 30 min to t = 90 min) in TRIP12-depleted cells suggesting an inhibition of the metaphase/anaphase transition. This inhibition could be due to a prolonged activation of the SAC or a default of the APC/C complex. The use of reversine, a SAC inhibitor, proved a prolonged activation of the SAC in absence of TRIP12 (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S5E</xref>). We confirmed the extended duration of prometaphase-metaphase by measuring a significantly increased duration of prometaphase (from invagination of the nuclear membrane) to metaphase in TRIP12-depleted cells (90.1 min) compared to control cells (53.5 min) <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7A,B</xref><bold>)</bold>. Additionally, we observed that TRIP12-depleted cells largely fail to transit from metaphase to anaphase (32.3% <italic>vs</italic> 3.7%).

Cell death and mitotic slippage are two processes by which cells overcome an extended arrest in prometaphase. A long term arrest in prometaphase and cohesion fatigue can lead to different chromosome segregation abnormalities such as the formation of chromosome laggings, anaphase bridges and alterations that are visible in interphasic cells such as micronuclei or giant nuclei (consequence of mitotic slippage). Among cells that achieve the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, our analysis revealed a higher percentage of chromosome lagging, anaphase bridges, micronuclei and giant nuclei in ShTRIP12 cells (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S5F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par17">The E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIP12 was linked to the control of cell cycle regulators (<italic>i.e</italic>.: p14/ARF, p16/CDKN2A)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In this study, we provide evidence that TRIP12 expression varies during the cell cycle and correlates with its nuclear localization. More importantly, we identify a functional N-terminal domain that confers to TRIP12 the capacity to strongly associate with euchromatin. We demonstrate the requirement of TRIP12 in mitotic entry by affecting the duration of S phase. Moreover, we reveal the implication of TRIP12 in the control of SAC activation, proper chromosome segregation and in cell proliferation.</p>
<p id="Par18">In line with the implication in mitotic entry, TRIP12 over-expression and depletion alter initiation of mitosis. Therefore, fine-tuning of TRIP12 expression and/or activity is essential for the control of this phase. Similar observations are reported for other important mitotic proteins such as CYCLIN A. Indeed, CYCLIN A over-expression delays chromosome alignment and sister chromatid segregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The knock down of CYCLIN A by siRNA strategy delays the entry into mitosis by postponing cells in G<sub>2</sub> phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Although the mechanisms that govern its expression during the cell cycle need to be further studied, our findings indicate that <italic>de novo Trip12</italic> mRNA expression is not involved. These observations corroborate the <italic>Whitfield et al</italic>. study, which provides an exhausting list of HelaS3 mRNAs that fluctuate during cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. <italic>Trip12</italic> mRNA is not present in this list. It is plausible that induction of TRIP12 protein expression in S phase could be mediated by an IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry site) dependent-translational regulation as demonstrated for <italic>Aurora A kinase</italic> mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Comparative proteomics approaches during cell cycle identified TRIP12 as a newly synthetized protein in S phase which is in favor of a translational regulation of <italic>TRIP12</italic> mRNA during cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Moreover, the disappearance of TRIP12 from the nucleus in G<sub>1</sub> phase-cells could imply its degradation by the proteasome mediated by APC/C-dependent ubiquitination as TRIP12 possesses putative KEN box (aa 1496–1570/UniProt source) and Destruction boxes (aa 859–867 and aa 1546–1554/ELM resource). This degradation mechanism may explain the decrease of TRIP12 expression. However, other actors that ensure TRIP12 stability remain to be identified. Similar to UHRF1, TRIP12 is stabilized by USP7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. During mitosis, CDK1 initiates UHRF1 degradation by phosphorylating the USP7-interacting domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The same mechanism could exist for TRIP12 degradation since a recent quantitative phospho-proteome approach identified serine 424 residue of TRIP12 as a CDK1 phosphorylation target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Moreover, our preliminary results are in favor of a role of USP7 in the cell cycle regulation of TRIP12. Therefore, the variation of TRIP12 expression during cell cycle likely involves different layers of regulation including translation efficiency and protein stabilization.</p>
<p id="Par19">Another pressing question is whether TRIP12 exerts its function in mitotic entry through its catalytic activity or by protein-protein interaction. Our observations favor a catalytically-independent function <bold>(</bold>Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S4A</xref>). However, these experiments were performed in the context of over-expressing the catalytic mutant. In this context, we show that an over-expression of several different TRIP12 domains (except the N-terminal domain) leads to an inhibition of cell division (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S4A–E</xref><bold>)</bold>. In these conditions, we cannot entirely be certain that TRIP12 function in mitotic entry is independent of its catalytic activity. Moreover, TRIP12-GFP transfection leads to uncontrolled TRIP12 expression throughout all cell cycle phases whereas endogenous TRIP12 is tightly regulated during cell cycle. Formulation of a specific inhibitor of TRIP12 enzymatic activity would be required to definitely address this question.</p>
<p id="Par20">We further demonstrate that TRIP12 interacts with chromatin <italic>via</italic> an IDR. IDRs are found in a multitude of proteins and participate in protein-, DNA-, or RNA-protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. DNA binding proteins are significantly enriched in disordered domains in Eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Many IDRs are functional, adopting a well-defined conformation upon interaction with target molecules. IDRs constitute important regulatory regions such as the N-terminal part of histones that are subject to numerous post-translational modifications to control the chromatin compaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, TRIP12 is the first demonstrated E3 ubiquitin ligase interacting with chromatin through an IDR domain. The staining on full-length chromosomes demonstrates that TRIP12 interacts through its IDR with the entire genome suggesting a widespread role of TRIP12 on genome organization and potentially on global gene expression.</p>
<p id="Par21">We showed that TRIP12 depletion accelerates mitotic entry by shortening the DNA replication phase. DNA replication is a highly ordered process that ensures cells replicate their genome. It requires the sequential assembly of protein complexes such as the pre-replication complex, the pre-initiation complex and the replisome. TRIP12 could participate in the regulation of DNA replication by interacting or controlling the expression of replication complex components. Interestingly, TRIP12 was found in the RPA interactome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Our personal comparative proteomic analysis (SWATH-MS) identified an increased expression of the cyclin dependent kinase CDK6 in TRIP12 depleted cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S6A–C</xref><bold>)</bold>. It is known that CDK6 activity is a critical determinant of pre-RC assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Therefore, TRIP12 could control DNA replication initiation by regulating CDK6 level. The progression through the different phases of DNA replication can also be controlled by chromatin structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Our data showed that TRIP12 IDR has the capacity to modify the chromatin structure when expressed at a high level (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3F,G</xref>). It is also reported that TRIP12 associates with chromatin remodeling complex components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. By modifying the structure of chromatin, TRIP12 could regulate S phase progression. In summary, it is likely that TRIP12 controls the duration of DNA replication by multiple complex mechanisms. Their complete discovery will require further investigations.</p>
<p id="Par22">Our results strongly suggest that in addition to its role for the entry into mitosis, TRIP12 exerts other functions during the progression of mitosis. The interaction of TRIP12 on chromosomes could participate in regulating the kinetics of chromosome condensation or act as a competitor to other chromatin-interacting proteins. The identification of TRIP12 as a potential substrate of CDK1 could also support its role in chromosome condensation. Indeed, it is known that CDK1 substrates, such as CAP-D3 (Chromosome associated protein-D3), are implicated in this process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Moreover, histone ubiquitination varies during cell cycle progression. Both histones H2A and H2B are ubiquitinated in S and G<sub>2</sub> phases, deubiquitinated in prophase and then reubiquinated in anaphase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Also, the promoter of certain active genes remains ubiquitinated during the entire mitosis to facilitate their transcriptional reactivation in post-mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Although the ubiquitin ligase RNF20 is associated to genome ubiquitination, potentially TRIP12 also participates in this epigenetic modification of histones during mitosis.</p>
<p id="Par23">Finally, our findings show that TRIP12 is localized and sequestered in the nucleus for a short duration. This strict temporal control may act to limit the period during which TRIP12 can exert its nuclear functions, precisely from S to early G<sub>1</sub>. This is of particular importance for the TRIP12 inhibitory function on the DDR by promoting RNF168 degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. DDR is repressed during mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> and reactivated in G<sub>1</sub> phase to repair DNA damages that pass the G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint or created during mitosis. Given its inhibitory role on DDR and nuclear localization during the cell cycle, TRIP12 could participate in the mechanisms of DDR inhibition during mitosis by interacting with chromatin and therefore by preventing chromatin accessibility to RNF168. In contrast, TRIP12 disappearance of the nucleus in G<sub>1</sub> phase could be part of DDR reactivation in the cell cycle.</p>
<p id="Par24">In this study, we provide important findings on TRIP12 regulation and its implication in cell cycle progression. More importantly, we reveal for the first time its ability to interact with specific regions of the genome which can prefigure a critical role in the organization and the expression of the genome.</p>
