<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Epidemiological studies consistently implicate traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) and/or proximity to heavily trafficked roads as risk factors for developmental delays and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs); however, there are limited preclinical data demonstrating a causal relationship. To test the effects of TRAP, pregnant rat dams were transported to a vivarium adjacent to a major freeway tunnel system in northern California where they were exposed to TRAP drawn directly from the face of the tunnel or filtered air (FA). Offspring remained housed under the exposure condition into which they were born and were tested in a variety of behavioral assays between postnatal day 4 and 50. To assess the effects of near roadway exposure, offspring of dams housed in a standard research vivarium were tested at the laboratory. An additional group of dams was transported halfway to the facility and then back to the laboratory to control for the effect of potential transport stress. Near roadway exposure delayed growth and development of psychomotor reflexes and elicited abnormal activity in open field locomotion. Near roadway exposure also reduced isolation-induced 40-kHz pup ultrasonic vocalizations, with the TRAP group having the lowest number of call emissions. TRAP affected some components of social communication, evidenced by reduced neonatal pup ultrasonic calling and altered juvenile reciprocal social interactions. These findings confirm that living in close proximity to highly trafficked roadways during early life alters neurodevelopment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) result from abnormal brain development and include a wide range of conditions, such as intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Symptoms present in early childhood and persist throughout life, significantly affecting social, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. ASD and ADHD, which affect ~1 and 5% of children respectively, are among the most common and well-studied NDDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The disorders often co-occur with 30–50% of ASD patients presenting symptoms of ADHD, and their prevalence is on the rise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ASD is currently estimated to affect about 1 in 59 children, which represents a dramatic increase from their previously reported 1 in 68 estimate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. These increased prevalence rates highlight the crucial need to develop a better understanding of the etiology of these neurological disorders since these conditions already incur immense societal and economic costs.</p>
<p id="Par3">While there is compelling evidence that susceptibility to NDDs, as well as symptom severity and treatment outcomes, are influenced by the interaction of genetic and environmental risk factors, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Environmental factors also contribute to these conditions—although researchers disagree on the relative contributions of genes and environment. Furthermore, studies suggest that more than 50% of new ASD cases are due to factors other than diagnostic drift<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Identifying and understanding the environmental risk factors contributing to the rising prevalence rates is crucial and important since they can be modified and/or avoided, unlike genetic risk factors, which are, for the most part, not currently modifiable risk variables. Mounting epidemiological data using independent samples, models, and methods from a variety of geographical locations have implicated exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) as one of these factors. Human exposure to TRAP and/or proximity to roadways, especially during the late gestational period and/or early life, has been significantly associated with an NDD diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">These studies of humans, however, fall short of establishing a causal relationship between TRAP exposure and NDD development, due to an array of confounding factors and a lack of data quantifying individual exposures to complex environmental mixtures. Animal models, therefore, offer a unique benefit and can be used to fill this knowledge gap and directly test the hypothesis that exposure to TRAP impairs behaviors related to NDDs (e.g., developmental delays, social interaction, learning and memory). While there has been some concentrated research in preclinical models, many of the commonly employed exposure methods are limited in their translational relevance to the human condition due to reasons such as repeated anesthesia and failure to recapitulate the complexity and/or relative concentrations of traffic-related emissions in the real world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">In order to fully understand the behavioral consequences of near roadway exposures during early life, we leveraged an innovative real-time rodent exposure facility to expose developing rats. Since composition, dose, duration, intensity, mixtures, and timing of air pollution exposures can influence biological outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, we designed our study to be translationally relevant by representing human TRAP exposure and combined real-world composition of pollutants and dosing in an animal model. The detailed components of the exposure can be found in our Supplementary Information and are reported in comprehensive detail in Bein et al. (under review)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In brief, air from a traffic tunnel in northern California was diverted to a nearby exposure facility housing a large rat colony, with half the colony receiving polluted tunnel air and half the colony receiving filtered air. Using rats, which possess a larger and more sophisticated repertoire of social behaviors compared to mice, allowed for an extensive and nuanced examination of NDD-relevant outcomes. After delivering real-world polluted air to pregnant rats and their offspring, we sought to determine whether the gestational and early life near roadway exposure affected physical growth, neonatal reflexes, communication, social interaction, and/or learning and memory, using a battery of validated behavioral assays.</p>
<p id="Par7">Numerous epidemiological studies have associated near roadway exposure to a range of diseases, but it is difficult in such studies to disentangle confounders, such as socioeconomic status, smoking, and diet. The Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment (CHARGE) study examined the link between autism and living near freeways using a distribution of distances: closest 10% (&lt;309 m), next 15% (309–647 m), the next 25% (647–1419 m), and farthest from freeways (&gt;1419 m)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. In each trimester of pregnancy, living closest (&lt;309 m) to the freeway was associated with autism, with the odds ratio reaching the highest significance during the third trimester, informing the timing of our exposure period. In order to generate toxicological data that complements the epidemiological data, the exposure facility that we employed in this study was designed to model near roadway exposures of air pollution, noise, and vibration, the same stressors experienced by people living in this environment. Epidemiological studies differ on the distance from the roadway that is “safe”, as this distance is partially determined by how much the air pollution from vehicles dilutes and how much the noise and vibration dissipates before the near roadway population is exposed. We drew air from the eastern face of the tunnel, not from inside the tunnel itself, so that the air pollution was somewhat diluted already, we insulated the building to reduce noise, and we installed vibration isolators on the feet of the exposure chambers to reduce vibration. The goal of these measures was to expose the rodents to conditions that well model human exposures.</p>
<p id="Par8">Our investigation led to the discovery that gestational and early life exposure to TRAP affects some components of social communication. Importantly, we also discovered that both roadside-reared groups, TRAP and filtered air (FA), with exposure to the same noise and vibrational stress, had significantly delayed growth and development of psychomotor reflexes, displayed altered social interactions, and exhibited abnormal motor activity. Histological outcomes from these exposures are described in our companion manuscript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Further, we found no evidence for an effect, due to stress or otherwise, of the pregnant dams’ transport to the roadside facility on offspring behavior. This is the first report of functional outcomes of this exposure model, and the first report that illustrates behavioral deficits resulting from near roadway exposure alone.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="Sec3">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p id="Par9">All animals were housed in a temperature-controlled vivarium maintained on a 12:12 light–dark cycle. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of California Davis (UC Davis) and were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. To identify rats, pups were labeled with paw tattoos on postnatal day (PND) 2 using non-toxic animal tattoo ink (Ketchum Manufacturing Inc., Brockville, ON, Canada). Ink was delivered into the center of the paw with a 23-gauge hypodermic needle tip. Rats were also tail marked with non-toxic permanent marker at weaning to allow for additional identification. The tattoo and tail marks for each subject were coded to allow investigators to carry out testing and scoring blind to treatment group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec4">
<title>Order of behavioral testing and description of cohorts</title>
<p id="Par10">Male and female Sprague-Dawley rat breeders (PND 80–90) were paired for two weeks before females were singly housed at approximately gestational day (GD) 14. A group of dams was transported to the roadside exposure facility adjacent to a major freeway tunnel system in the Bay Area of Northern California. Dams were randomly assigned to one of two exposure conditions within the same facility: traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) or filtered air (FA). Two male and two female offspring from each of 20 dams were tested as follows: (1) developmental milestones at PND 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 12, (2) pup USV at PND 5, (3) reciprocal social interaction at PND 32–34, (4) open-field behavior at PND 39–41, (5) novel object recognition at PND 40–42, and (6) fear conditioning at PND 44–48.</p>
<p id="Par11">A second group of dams remained housed at a UC Davis vivarium, constituting the laboratory control group. Two male and two female offspring from each of seven litters were tested as follows: (1) developmental milestones at PND 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 12, (2) pup USV at PND 5, (3) reciprocal social interaction at PND 34–36, and (5) open field behavior at PND 42–43.</p>
<p id="Par12">At a later timepoint, a third group of dams was employed as a control for the approximately 1.5-h vehicular transport required to move the prior groups of dams to the roadside exposure facility. Two weeks after being paired with a male breeder, all dams were singly-housed and half of the group was driven halfway to the roadside tunnel site (~45 min drive) and then back to UC Davis. The other half of the group of dams remained unmoved at the UC Davis vivarium, constituting the control group for the transported group. All of the dams and their offspring remained housed at the UC Davis vivarium for the duration of the study. Two male and two female offspring from each of 11 dams were tested as follows: (1) developmental milestones at PND 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 12, (2) pup USV at PND 5, and (3) open field behavior at PND 38–41.</p>
<p id="Par13">All offspring remained in the location and exposure condition into which they were born. Behavioral testing was conducted in testing rooms adjacent to each vivarium. Two male and two female offspring from each litter were tested. To minimize carry-over effects from repeated testing, assays were performed in order from least to most stressful and at least 48 h elapsed between tests.</p>
<p id="Par14">At separate timepoints, two additional cohorts of male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were used to collect laboratory control data for the learning and memory paradigms. These data were collected at the UC Davis vivarium prior to the testing equipment being relocated to the roadside exposure facility. Both groups remained housed at the UC Davis vivarium for the duration of the study, were well-handled prior to testing, and were offspring of Sprague-Dawley breeders who remained housed at the UC Davis vivarium. One cohort of rats was sampled from five litters and tested in the novel object recognition test at PND 45–53 and a second cohort was sampled from seven litters and tested in the fear conditioning assay at PND 42–44.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec5">
<title>Roadside exposure facility</title>
<p id="Par15">Data from the CHARGE study found residential proximity to freeways to be a risk factor for NDDs when maternal residence was &lt;309 m from a major roadway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. In order to generate toxicological data that complements the epidemiological data, the exposure facility that we employed in this study was designed to model near roadway exposures of air pollution, noise, and vibration, the same stressors experienced by people living in this environment. We drew air from the eastern face of the tunnel, not from within the tunnel itself, so that the air pollution was somewhat diluted already. Additionally, we installed vibration isolators on the feet of the exposure chambers to reduce vibration and insulated the building to reduce noise below the IACUC-mandated maximal tolerated limit of 85 decibels. Such measures were unnecessary for the UC Davis vivarium and adjacent laboratory testing rooms, which have ambient noise levels of only 64 and 43–47 decibels, respectively.</p>
<p id="Par16">The dual housing and exposure facility, located adjacent to a major freeway tunnel system in the Bay Area of northern California, was composed of three rooms: one containing equipment for adjusting air temperature and flow, and measuring air pollutant concentrations; a second room for the two exposure chambers; and a third room for behavior testing. Each exposure chamber was 12.8 ft l × 3 ft w × 7.8 ft h and capable of accommodating 108 cages with filter tops removed. In order to minimize noise stress, all pumps and blowers were housed outside the facility and plumbed through walls. The room containing the exposure chambers and the behavioral testing suite were also additionally insulated to block noise.</p>
<p id="Par17">Air supplied to the TRAP-exposed animals was drawn directly from the face of the tunnel. Flexible ducting carried air from the exit of the tunnel’s two eastbound bores to the exposure facility where rats were exposed to the tunnel air. Air supplied to the filtered air group was drawn from the outside of the exposure facility, where pollutant concentrations were expected to be much lower than at the tunnel face. This air was subjected to several emissions control technologies coupled together in series prior to being plumbed to the exposure chamber. These included (a) a pre-filter for removing large debris and coarse particulate matter (PM), (b) inline activated carbon filters for removing gas-phase volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, (c) barium oxide-based catalytic converters for removing NO<sub>x</sub> and (d) ultrahigh efficiency Teflon-bound glass microfiber filters for removing fine and ultrafine PM. Flow rate control and temperature conditioning were also included in compliance with IACUC specifications. Pressure within each exposure chamber was monitored constantly and blowers were programmed to maintain a small negative pressure in each chamber, with the TRAP chamber drawing in air from the tunnel and the filtered air chamber drawing in air from the outside via the filtration system.</p>

<title>Behavioral testing</title>
<p id="Par18">Two males and two females from each litter were randomly selected as behavioral test subjects and were tested on all behavioral assays with the exception of 16 animals who were only tested as pups and not as juveniles. This was to carefully control for the effect of the litter, previously described as being the most influential factor in developmental toxicological exposure studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Rats at the roadside exposure facility were removed from the home exposure chambers for testing and then immediately returned to the chamber following the completion of each test.

Behaviors were video recorded through the arena’s transparent front wall and later scored by a trained observer blinded to group as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Both subject and stimulus animals were isolated for 30 min prior to the test session. Subject and stimulus animals were always from different litters and stimuli rats used at the roadside facility were housed in filtered air. All behaviors scored were those of the subject animal. Behaviors scored for duration were: (1) exploring, (2) following or chasing, (3) social sniffing, (4) anogenital sniffing, and (6) self-grooming. The testing room was illuminated to ~30 lux.</p>

<title>Open field exploration</title>
<p id="Par22">In order to control for the potentially confounding effects of hypo- or hyperactivity on the other behavioral assays, exploratory activity in a novel open arena was evaluated over a 30 min session.

Using an opaque matte black box (54.1 cm l × 54.1 cm w × 34.3 cm h), each animal was habituated to the empty arena for 30 min on the day prior to the test. On the day of the test, each subject was again habituated to the arena for 30 min before two identical objects were placed gently in the arena with the animal. After a 10 min familiarization session, the animal was isolated in a clean holding cage with bedding for 60 min. During this time, the arena and the objects were cleaned with 70% ethanol and one clean familiar object and one clean novel object were placed in the original positions of the two identical objects during familiarization. Both the identity and location of the novel object within the arena were counterbalanced to address potential inherent object preferences or side biases. Our protocol has been published as standard by the Intellectual and Developmental Disability’s Behavior Cores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Upon being returned to the arena for the recognition test, the subject was allowed 5 min to interact with the familiar and novel objects. Time spent sniffing each object during each phase of testing was automatically measured via video tracking software (EthoVision XT 10 and 12; Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, Netherlands). Objects used were orange plastic cones (8.5 cm l × 8.5 cm w × 9.5 cm h) and glass bell jars (7.5 cm d × 10.3 cm h). The testing room was illuminated to ~30 lux.</p>

During training on day one, rats were exposed to a series of three noise-shock (CS-US) pairings in a testing chamber with specific visual, odor, and tactile cues. The training environment was brightly lit (~100 lux), contained a metal wire floor, and included 0.3 mL of vanilla odor cue (1:100 dilution of McCormick Vanilla Extract). White noise (80 dB) was played for 30 s and a foot shock (0.7 mA) occurred during the final two sec of the noise cue. A two min period for exploration preceded the first noise-shock pairing and elapsed between each noise-shock pairing. A 30 s exploration period followed the final noise-shock pairing and the entire training session was eight min in duration. On day two of testing, the subject was placed back inside the training environment for five min. The chamber contained identical contextual cues as the training session, but no white noise or foot shock occurred. On day three of testing, the subject was placed back inside the training environment for 6 min, but the chamber context was altered. The overhead lighting was turned off and the chamber contained a novel smooth plastic floor, novel black angled walls, and a novel lemon scent (1:100 dilution of McCormick Lemon Extract). An initial three min exploration period was followed by a three min presentation of the white noise conditioned stimulus. Time spent freezing during each test phase was automatically measured by the VideoFreeze software (version 2.7; Med Associates).</p>

Given that TRAP-exposed did not differ from FA-exposed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons post hoc analysis (<italic>p</italic> = 0.475), we cannot conclude that the air quality alone caused the lower numbers of USV.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par41">Our goal was to corroborate human studies that have linked increased risk of NDDs to near roadway TRAP exposures. To do this, we developed an innovative exposure model that quantifies and delivers TRAP collected from a traffic tunnel to rats during both in utero and post-natal development. This design avoided limitations of single exposure paradigms, including requiring anesthesia and difficulties mimicking real-world mixtures of TRAP, while simultaneously leveraging earlier literature to yield consensus. Both roadside exposure groups had significantly delayed growth and development of psychomotor reflexes, displayed altered social interactions, and exhibited abnormal activity in an open field compared to lab controls. This is the first report that used carefully controlled subgroups to illustrate that developmental exposure to realistic near roadway exposures caused subtle but significant changes in developmental endpoints and functional outcomes (i.e., behavior). This confirms the theory suggested by epidemiological studies that in addition to TRAP, noise, vibration, and proximity to highways may be additional risk factors for NDDs in combination with genetic susceptibility or independently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. Our work presented herein is also a novel, important addition because, to our knowledge, this is the first nonclinical study that did not use high levels of particulate matter (PM), concentrated ambient ultrafine particles (CAPS), and/or diesel exhaust and discovered subtle but reportable behavioral outcomes. These findings support the need for further research delineating causal link(s) between exposure to TRAP and behavioral outcomes relevant to NDDs and adding to our understanding of the risks posed by air pollution to the developing nervous system.</p>
<p id="Par42">Recently, a few well recognized laboratories have used reductionist experimental designs to investigate the effects of diesel exhaust<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup> and particulate matter (sizeable and ultrafine)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>, the components most implicated in mediating the neurotoxic effects of TRAP. We extended this published research with our innovative real-world exposure to a dynamic, complex mixture of components, noise, and vibration. Polluted tunnel air was delivered to subjects in the nearby exposure facility while control animals received thoroughly filtered air from a tunnel-adjacent area. Because behavioral outcomes vary by sex, time of year, vendor, and numerous additional variables, we ran, in parallel, a laboratory control group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par43">An important finding was that we observed no significant difference in litter size between TRAP, FA, and laboratory groups, which eliminated litter size as a potential explanatory variable for effects of near roadway exposure on pup growth and development. Yet, both roadside groups had significantly delayed growth and development of psychomotor reflexes, altered social interactions, and abnormal activity in an open field compared to laboratory controls. A potential explanation was that transport stress confounded our observations. However, we showed a complete absence of behavioral phenotypes resulting from the transport alone, strongly suggesting that adverse functional outcomes observed in the TRAP and FA groups were attributable to near roadway exposures. In both sexes of FA- and TRAP-exposed groups, we observed reduced isolation-induced 40-kHz pup ultrasonic vocalizations. Other atypical behaviors included juvenile social play behavior by the critical investigative parameter of anogenital sniffing and social play behavior of following/chasing. These data have direct translational implications as epidemiological studies directed at investigating ASD and NDDs have reported high levels of physical and developmental effects on health associated with the proximity of residence to heavily trafficked roads, using unique data sets from differing regional areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup>. Follow-up studies will need to delineate the effects of noise and vibration during pregnancy from those of TRAP on offspring development and behavior. These findings add to our understanding of the risks posed to the developing nervous system by living in close proximity to roadways and support the need for further research delineating causal link(s) between exposure to TRAP and behavioral outcomes relevant to NDDs.</p>
<p id="Par44">We observed a strong trend toward reduced overall social sniffing in the TRAP- and FA-exposed groups. Social sniffing is a key investigative behavior that initiates numerous types of juvenile social play events such as following/chasing, pinning, pouncing, and rough and tumble play. The TRAP- and FA-exposed juveniles exhibited these deficits without confounding motor deficits. In addition, we observed a trend to elevated self-grooming in males, a well-reported, standardized restricted, repetitive behavior in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup>. Less social sniffing in dyadic interactions and elevated self-grooming are likely indicators of stress in both exposure groups.</p>
<p id="Par45">In addition, others observed elevated self-grooming, repetitive behavior in mice. Similar findings of reduced reciprocal interactions following diesel exhaust exposure from prenatal embryonic day 0 to postnatal day 21 were recently reported in male mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. Chang et al. also reported their diesel exhaust exposure caused increased repeated entries in the T-maze test of spontaneous alternation, a learning and memory assay with the embedded ability to capture restricted behavior. We observed high levels of repetitive motor behavior in the TRAP-exposed group, using a low-order motor stereotypy measure of grooming. Spontaneous alternation in T or Y maze, which may be mimicking higher order restricted, repetitive behaviors, are easily observable in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par46">Surprisingly, we did not observe deficits on our two standard assays of learning and memory, contextual and cued fear conditioning and novel object recognition, due to TRAP exposure. We hypothesized this behavioral domain to have a robust phenotype given earlier literature. Early postnatal life exposure to concentrated ambient ultrafine particles (CAPS) increased preference for immediate reward, a more complex type of cognition that assesses impulsivity using a fixed-ratio waiting-for-reward paradigm, in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref></sup>. The discounting of delayed rewards in preclinical models is considered to be analogous to impulsivity and delay of gratification in humans and is relevant to ADHD. Follow-up investigations revealed that early postnatal exposures to CAPS caused sexually dimorphic impairments in fixed interval performance on an operant training task, with greater sensitivity in males, while adult exposures caused deficits in females, indicating dysfunctional learning and reduced behavioral flexibility in CAPS-exposed mice. CAPS exposure also impaired short-term memory on the novel object recognition memory task in both sexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>. Collectively, these observations indicate dysfunctional learning and reduced behavioral flexibility in CAPS-exposed mice. The different results observed in the CAPS study versus our study may be due to (a) our tasks being limited to fear conditioning and novel object recognition because of limitations on the type of equipment that could be housed at the exposure facility, (b) that there is &gt;20 million years of evolution that separate mouse and rat and there is likely species differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref></sup>, and/or (c) the variable intensities and concentrations of the exposures. Another limitation of our learning and memory data was that the laboratory control data were collected from cohorts other than those under study herein, thereby precluding direct comparisons of performance scores. We were, however, able to make observational assessments with the knowledge that the cohorts were all Sprague-Dawley rats of similar ages tested by the same experimenter using the same equipment following the standard experimental protocol and the laboratory controls were within our standard validation scores. In future studies, we plan on employing operant touchscreen testing, as performed by our laboratories in mice and rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref></sup>, which will allow for more direct comparisons of impulsivity via five choice serial reaction and continuous performance assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref></sup>. Other groups exposed rats in a highly trafficked location in Portugal to non-filtered air (NFA) during gestation and early life and found a significant decrease in object discrimination when compared to the group exposed to filtered air (FA), suggesting that the exposure to TRAP during the combined pre- and post-natal periods impaired short-term discriminative memory. Animals exposed during only pre- or post-natal period did not show impairment on this assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref></sup>, similar to our findings. Another group found that ambient concentrated PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure resulted in robust impairments in adult mice tested in the Barnes Maze, a hippocampal dependent spatial learning task. The PM<sub>2.5</sub>-exposed mice made more errors during training and took longer to reach the target during training trials and the memory retention test, indicating that chronic exposure to airborne fine particulate matter impaired hippocampal related learning and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par47">Multiple groups have reported strong associations between prenatal exposure to TRAP and developmental delays and/or NDDs. Since epidemiology studies are associative, rigorous experiments that test preclinical models in highly controlled environments are warranted. This is particularly pertinent for studies of TRAP, since for decades research has focused on the detrimental effects of tobacco and asthma/allergy-related illnesses. In conclusion, we developed and functionally validated an innovative preclinical model that recapitulated human studies that have linked developmental exposure to TRAP, or proximity to TRAP, and increased risk of NDDs. This confirmation of TRAP as an environmental risk factor for NDDs provides a rationale for controlling and minimizing exposures during critical periods of neurodevelopment thereby reducing the incidence of NDDs and/or decreasing the severity of symptoms. This study sets the stage for future mechanistic investigations to determine the mechanisms by which this risk factor interacts with NDD genes of susceptibility. It will also inform our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of NDDs, which will be useful for identifying developmental windows of vulnerability and possible novel intervention and/or therapeutic strategies.</p>
