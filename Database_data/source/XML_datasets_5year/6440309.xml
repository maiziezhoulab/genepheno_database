<abstract>
<sec>
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>Pragmatic language skills are often impaired above and beyond general language delays in individuals with neurodevelopmental disabilities. This study used a multimethod approach to language sample analysis to characterize syndrome- and sex-specific profiles across different neurodevelopmental disabilities and to examine the congruency of 2 analysis techniques.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Method</title>
<p>Pragmatic skills of young males and females with fragile X syndrome with autism spectrum disorder (FXS-ASD, <italic>n</italic> = 61) and without autism spectrum disorder (FXS-O, <italic>n</italic> = 40), Down syndrome (DS, <italic>n</italic> = 42), and typical development (TD, <italic>n</italic> = 37) and males with idiopathic autism spectrum disorder only (ASD-O, <italic>n</italic> = 29) were compared using variables obtained from a detailed hand-coding system contrasted with similar variables obtained automatically from the language analysis program Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Noncontingent language and perseveration were characteristic of the pragmatic profiles of boys and girls with FXS-ASD and boys with ASD-O. Boys with ASD-O also initiated turns less often and were more nonresponsive than other groups, and girls with FXS-ASD were more nonresponsive than their male counterparts. Hand-coding and SALT methods were largely convergent with some exceptions.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Results suggest both similarities and differences in the pragmatic profiles observed across different neurodevelopmental disabilities, including idiopathic and FXS-associated cases of ASD, as well as an important sex difference in FXS-ASD. These findings and congruency between the 2 language sample analysis techniques together have important implications for assessment and intervention efforts.</p>
