<title>Abstract</title>
<sec id="brb3800-sec-0001">
<title>Objective</title>
<p>In this study, we used a systemic <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout in order to investigate both genotype‐ and sex‐specific differences across multiple measures of sociability, repetitive behaviors, activity levels, anxiety, and fear‐related learning and memory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="brb3800-sec-0002">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Fragile X syndrome is the most common monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism. Few studies to date have examined sex differences in a mouse model of Fragile X syndrome, though clinical data support the idea of differences in both overall prevalence and phenotype between the sexes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="brb3800-sec-0003">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Using wild‐type and systemic homozygous <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout mice, we assessed a variety of behavioral paradigms in adult animals, including the open field test, elevated plus maze, nose‐poke assay, accelerating rotarod, social partition task, three‐chambered social task, and two different fear conditioning paradigms. Tests were ordered such that the most invasive tests were performed last in the sequence, and testing paradigms for similar behaviors were performed in separate cohorts to minimize testing effects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="brb3800-sec-0004">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Our results indicate several sex‐specific changes in <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout mice, including male‐specific increases in activity levels, and female‐specific increases in repetitive behaviors on both the nose‐poke assay and motor coordination on the accelerating rotarod task. The results also indicated that <italic>Fmr1</italic> deletion results in deficits in fear learning and memory across both sexes, and no changes in social behavior across two tasks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="brb3800-sec-0005">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>These findings highlight the importance of including female subjects in preclinical studies, as simply studying the impact of genetic mutations in males does not yield a complete picture of the phenotype. Further research should explore these marked phenotypic differences among the sexes. Moreover, given that treatment strategies are typically equivalent between the sexes, the results highlight a potential need for sex‐specific therapeutics.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a trinucleotide (CGG) repeat expansion in the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene coding for fragile x mental retardation protein (FMRP). The trinucleotide repeats result in hypermethylation of the promoter, which functionally silences <italic>FMR1</italic> and eliminates FMRP synthesis. FXS is phenotypically characterized by intellectual disability, but may extend to include a broad spectrum of behavioral disturbances, including hyperactivity and fidgeting behaviors (Hagerman, Jackson, Levitas, Rimland, &amp; Braden, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0011">1986</xref>). FXS is highly comorbid with other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Wheeler et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0042">2014</xref>), epilepsy (Berry‐Kravis, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0003">2002</xref>), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Clifford et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0005">2007</xref>). Epidemiological data suggest that <italic>FMR1</italic> mutations have a prevalence rate of 2–6% in the ASD population (Kaufmann et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0016">2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Sex plays a significant role in the overall prevalence and clinical presentation of FXS. Prevalence rates vary by sex in FXS, with lifetime incidence of approximately 1:4,000 males, as compared to 1:8,000 females (Pembrey, Barnicoat, Carmichael, Bobrow, &amp; Turner, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0027">2001</xref>). In terms of characteristics of a behavioral phenotype, sex is also a significant contributor to the clinical presentation of FXS, with male individuals showing more severe behavioral impairment as compared to females. Given that X‐linked disorders often follow a sex‐dependent pattern of symptom severity, this difference has been generally attributed to compensation by the second unaffected X chromosome in females (Germain, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0010">2006</xref>; Kazdoba, Leach, Silverman, &amp; Crawley, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0017">2014</xref>). However, it has recently been hypothesized that the symptomatology of affected females may be qualitatively different than affected males. Males display higher rates of ASD‐like behaviors (Reiss &amp; Freund, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0032">1992</xref>), hyperactivity, and inattentiveness (Hagerman &amp; Sobesky, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0012">1989</xref>). In contrast, affected females carry a higher risk for schizophrenia and extreme shyness, but lower risk for intellectual impairment (Reiss, Hagerman, Vinogradov, Abrams, &amp; King, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0033">1988</xref>). Deficits in affective processes are also more prevalent among FXS females (Hagerman &amp; Sobesky, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0012">1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these established differences in both prevalence and phenotypic severity in humans, the majority of <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) studies focus exclusively on males, leaving the influence in females less understood. There is some evidence of a differential phenotype among the sexes, as male <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs exhibit a reduced anxiety phenotype, whereas females KOs show normal levels of anxiety (Qin, Kang, &amp; Smith, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0030">2005</xref>). However, previous studies show mainly similar deficits between male and female <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs on tests of activity levels, learning and memory (Baker et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0001">2010</xref>; Ding, Sethna, &amp; Wang, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0007">2014</xref>), sensorimotor gating (Baker et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0001">2010</xref>; Ding et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0007">2014</xref>), and seizure susceptibility (Nguy &amp; Tejada‐Simon, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0024">2016</xref>; Qin et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0030">2005</xref>) in adulthood. Recent experimental evidence has also shown that female <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs present normal fear learning and anxiety, but show impaired fear memory (Nguy &amp; Tejada‐Simon, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0024">2016</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of behaviors at different ages has shown sex‐specific differences in ultrasonic vocalization production (Reynolds, Nolan, Jefferson, &amp; Lugo, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0034">2016</xref>), though other strains have not shown this effect (Gauducheau et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0009">2017</xref>). In a recently published review, authors summarized the effects of <italic>Fmr1</italic> deletion across both male and female mice, noting that some behaviors have sex‐specific effects, though most behaviors have not yet been examined in females (Romano, Cosentino, Laviola, &amp; De Filippis, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0035">2016</xref>).</p>
<p>The effect of homozygous deletion of <italic>Fmr1</italic> in female mice on repetitive behavior, motor coordination, and social behavior remains unexamined. Lack of females in empirical research is especially prevalent in the fields of neuroscience and biomedical studies (Beery &amp; Zucker, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0002">2011</xref>), and only in recent years has there been a push to include females. The omission of females broadly across studies seems to stem from the belief that female mammals have a higher degree of intrinsic variability, likely due to estrus cycles. A recent meta‐analysis of 293 articles found that variability was not greater in females for behavioral, morphological, physiological, and molecular traits when they did not account for the estrous cycle when compared with males (Prendergast, Onishi, &amp; Zucker, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0029">2014</xref>). Given the omission of female <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice from previous phenotypic characterizations and the broad implications of this exclusion, our study aims to further characterize this model by investigating sex‐specific differences by direct comparison of male and female <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs on tests of activity levels, anxiety behaviors, social behaviors, repetitive behaviors, and motor coordination, as well as hippocampal‐ and amygdala‐based memory.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Male and female <italic>FVB.129P2‐Pde6b+ Tyrc‐ch Fmr1tm1Cgr/</italic>J (Jackson Labs Stock No: 004624) mice were bred to generate wild‐type (WT) and homozygous <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) groups for this study. We bred heterozygous dams with wild‐type males to produce homozygous knockout males, wild‐type males, and wild‐type females. We bred heterozygous dams with knockout males to produce homozygous knockout males and females. Offspring toe clippings were preserved in 70% ethanol and sent for genotyping to Mouse Genotype (Escondido, CA, USA). All animals were bred and housed at Baylor University. Following maturation to PD21, animals were weaned into home cages with up to five littermates. The environment was maintained at an ambient temperature, with 12‐hr light and 12‐hr dark diurnal cycles and <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water. All behavioral testing was conducted during the light phase of the cycle, specifically between 9 am and 5 pm. All procedures were performed in accordance with Baylor University Institutional Care and Use Committee and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>All testing was conducted after the mice reached adulthood, approximately 2 months of age, and they were divided into two cohorts (Cohort 1: n<sub>male wildtype</sub> = 17, n<sub>female wildtype</sub> = 13, n<sub>male knockout</sub> = 16, n<sub>female knockout</sub> = 16; Cohort 2: n<sub>male wildtype</sub> = 12, n<sub>female wildtype</sub> = 13, n<sub>male knockout</sub> = 16, n<sub>female knockout</sub> = 17) for the purpose of diversifying the sample and minimizing the effects of multiple test exposure. Each cohort received a battery of behavioral testing that was ordered from least invasive to most invasive to minimize test order effects (McIlwain, Merriweather, Yuva‐Paylor, &amp; Paylor, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0021">2001</xref>). The first cohort was tested in the following order: open field, elevated plus maze, marble burying, social chamber, and trace fear conditioning. The second cohort was tested in the following order: light–dark box, nose‐poke assay, accelerating rotarod, social partition, and delayed fear conditioning. There was a rest period of 2–3 days between tests. For all testing, the tails of the mice were labeled in order to identify the testing order for the behavioral test. The mice were allowed to acclimate to the testing room for 30 min prior to the beginning of the test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="brb3800-sec-0009">
<label>2.2</label>
<title>Activity levels: open field</title>
<p>The open field test was performed to evaluate changes in activity and anxiety levels. The mice were first weighed, then their tails were marked for identification. The open field apparatus consisted of a clear plastic arena (40 × 40 × 30 cm). The lighting and background noise inside the test chamber were kept constant at 100 lux and 60 dB, respectively. During testing, mice were individually placed into the testing arena for 30 min and the experimenter was not present during the testing period. Activity levels were analyzed by a computer‐operated optical animal activity system (Fusion by AccuScan Instruments, Inc., USA). This system also measured other exploratory behaviors such as grooming, rearing, clockwise, and counterclockwise rotations, as well as stereotypic behavior, which accounts for repeated breaking of the same set of beams, for example, during grooming behavior. To evaluate for anxiety behaviors, distance moved and time spent in the center compared to surround region was compared (center was defined as the inner 50% of the field). Following testing, mice were returned to an alternate cage until all mice in their homecage were tested, then all mice were returned to their homecage, and the arena was cleaned with a 30% isopropyl alcohol solution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="brb3800-sec-0010">
<label>2.3</label>
<title>Anxiety behavior: elevated plus maze</title>
<p>The elevated plus maze test was performed to evaluate changes in baseline anxiety levels (Pellow, Chopin, File, &amp; Briley, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0026">1985</xref>). The apparatus was composed of four 30 × 5 cm arms positioned 40 cm above the floor and a center platform (5 × 5 cm), with two arms enclosed by acrylic walls. The testing room was illuminated by incandescent lamps (30 lux in the open arms) and the background noise level remained constant at 60 dB. During testing, subjects were recorded for 10 min, during which the Ethovision XT video tracking software (Noldus, Netherlands) scored the frequency of entries and time spent in each of the four arms and center platform. Distance traveled and speed of movement were also assessed. The experimenter was not present during testing. Testing videos were recorded using Pinnacle video capture software (Corel, Canada), then scored offline for head‐dips in open arms and rearing activity by an experimenter blind to group identity. Following testing, mice were returned to an alternate cage with other tested mice and the apparatus was cleaned with a 30% isopropyl alcohol solution and dried thoroughly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="brb3800-sec-0011">
<label>2.4</label>
<title>Anxiety levels: light–dark task</title>
<p>The light–dark task was conducted in order to complement the elevated plus maze as a measure of anxiety. The apparatus consisted of a clear acrylic chamber that was modified to allow for a black acrylic insert. The lighting and background noise inside the test chamber were kept constant at 100 lux and 60 dB, respectively. During testing, time spent in the light and dark portions of the chamber were measured for 10 minutes using automated software (Fusion by AccuScan Instruments, Inc., USA).

<title>Repetitive behavior: marble burying</title>
<p>The marble burying test was performed to evaluate changes in repetitive behavior. The apparatus consisted of a clean Allentown mouse cage (27 × 16.5 × 12.5) filled with sanichip bedding to a height of approximately 3 cm. Twenty black 15 mm glass marbles were placed throughout the cage in an equidistant 4 × 5 array (Thomas, Burant et al. <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0301">2009</xref>). During testing, each mouse was individually placed in the testing cage for 30 min and allowed to bury marbles freely. The experimenter was not present in the room for the duration of the testing period. Following testing the mice were returned to their home cage, while the quantity of marbles buried at least 50%, 75%, 100%, and totally buried was tallied by the experimenter.</p>

<title>Repetitive behavior: nose‐poke assay</title>
<p>The nose‐poke assay was conducted as an additional test of repetitive behavior. The apparatus consisted of a board inserted into a clear acrylic area (40 × 40 × 30 cm), with 16 equidistant holes of 1” diameter and approximately 0.75” depth. During testing, mice were placed individually into the apparatus and the number of nose pokes made during a 10‐min period was measured. A nose poke was counted whenever the nose was extended into the hole as far as the eyes. These were counted by a live observer blinded to experimental condition. The arena was cleaned with 30% isopropyl alcohol between subjects. Following testing, mice were returned to an alternate cage with other tested mice and the apparatus was cleaned with a 30% isopropyl alcohol solution and dried thoroughly.</p>

<title>Motor coordination: rotarod</title>
<p>Rotarod performance was measured to assess changes in motor learning. More recently, it has also been proposed that changes in repetitive behavior are also indicative of acquired repetitive behavior (Rothwell Patrick et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0036">2014</xref>). The apparatus consisted of a rotating rod that accelerated from 5 to 40 RPM over a 5‐minute trial (Series 8 Rotorod; IITC Inc., Woodland Hills, CA, USA). Subjects were tested for two trials per day for 4 days of testing with an intertrial interval of 60 min. During testing, an experimenter blinded to group identity live scored the amount of time each animal was able to stay on the rotating rod before falling off. Following testing, mice were returned to an alternate cage with other tested mice and the apparatus was cleaned with a 30% isopropyl alcohol solution and dried thoroughly.</p>

<title>Social behavior: social chamber</title>
<p>The social chamber test was performed to evaluate changes in social approach behavior. The testing apparatus consisted of a clear acrylic box divided into three chambers, measuring 60 cm × 40.5 cm × 22.5 cm, divided by a 0.25‐cm‐thick acrylic wall. The two outer chambers measured 20.5 cm × 40.5 cm and the middle chamber measured approximately 18.5 cm × 40.5 cm. In the center of each of the dividing walls was a door that was 10 cm × 5 cm. This protocol was previously described in Nadler et al. (<xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0300">2004</xref>). Testing was divided into two parts. In part A, the animal was placed in the center chamber and allowed to explore the chamber for 10 minutes. Black wire‐mesh cylinders were placed in the posterior corners of the chamber. A tall plastic bottle was placed on top of the cylinder to prevent the testing mouse from climbing or overturning the cylinder. The animal was then confined to the middle chamber, whereas the researcher placed the intruder mouse (matched for sex, age, and weight) inside one cylinder and a similar sized black block object in the other. The location of the objects was alternated between subjects to prevent a side bias. The barriers to the side chambers were then removed and the subject was allowed to explore for 10 min. The experimenter was not present during the testing window. Videos were analyzed offline for time and frequency in each of the three chambers and investigatory behaviors at the cylinders.</p>

<title>Social behavior: social partition task</title>
<p>The social partition task was used to provide a complementary social behavior test to the results of the social chamber task. This task was used to measure the frequency and duration of interacting with a familiar versus an unfamiliar mouse. The following methods have been previously described (Spencer et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0039">2011</xref>). The animals were housed for 24 hr in a cage divided into two chambers by a clear partition with 0.6‐cm‐diameter holes. In the other half of the chamber, a sex‐, age‐, and weight‐matched conspecific was placed and animals remained housed together overnight. The following day, the approaches and time spent at the partition by the experimental mice was measured for 5 min in three different conditions. An observer live scored the duration and frequency of sniffing events by inputting the events into a computer software program Ethom (Shih &amp; Mok, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0037">2000</xref>). The first condition was with the “familiar” mouse it was housed with overnight, the “unfamiliar” condition was with a novel mouse, and then the “familiar 2” condition was the mouse it had been housed with overnight.</p>

<title>Learning and memory: trace fear conditioning</title>
<p>The trace fear conditioning task was used to evaluate hippocampal‐dependent memory as previously described (Lugo, Smith, &amp; Holley, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0019">2014</xref>; Smith, Gallagher, &amp; Stanton, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0038">2007</xref>). The testing apparatus consisted of an operant conditioning chamber approximately 26 × 22 × 18 cm high with two clear acrylic and two metal sides. The floor consisted of a metal grid enabling it to deliver a mild shock. This chamber was located inside a second, sound attenuating chamber. Throughout testing on all days, freezing behavior was recorded using the FreezeFrame 3 automated detection software (Coulbourn; Ohio).</p>
<p>On the first day of testing, animals were transported to the holding room and allowed to acclimate for 30 min. Animals were then taken to a separate testing room and placed in the fear conditioning chamber. The first trial consisted of a 12‐min recording period to obtain baseline information. Animals were then returned to the holding room and the apparatus was cleaned with a 30% isopropyl alcohol solution and dried thoroughly. On the second day of testing, animals were placed inside the chamber and allowed to explore freely for 4 min prior to the pairing of the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US). In this paradigm, the conditioned stimulus consisted of a 20‐s white noise stimulus (70 dB). This was immediately followed by an 18‐s trace period, then a mild foot shock (2‐s, 0.5 mA) as the unconditioned stimulus. Following a 40‐s intertrial interval (ITI) the CS‐US pairing was repeated. This pairing was repeated a total of six times for a total test time of 840 s. Behaviors such as freezing, running, and jumping were recorded by the observer to ensure the foot shock had been delivered. Animals were then returned to the holding room. On the third day of testing, mice were introduced to a novel context wherein the floor, chamber shape, sound, and smell were altered. A novel floor insert was placed on top of the metal grid, the chamber was altered to be a triangle shape by inserting two clear acrylic walls, a fan was turned on to provide background noise, and the smell was altered by placing a small weigh boat of vanilla extract (Adam's extract) under the floor. Animals were exposed to four 100‐s trials, which consisted of an introductory 20‐s interval with no stimuli, followed by a 20‐s presentation of the CS. Each trial was separated by a 60‐s interval with no stimuli prior to the next trial. Animals were then returned to the holding room with other tested mice and the apparatus was cleaned with a 30% ethanol solution and dried thoroughly. On the fourth day of testing, animals were placed in the original context and allowed to explore freely for 3 min as a test of contextual fear conditioning. Experimenters were not present during the testing window.</p>

<title>Learning and memory: delayed fear conditioning</title>
<p>As a complement to trace fear conditioning, we also evaluated a separate cohort of subjects on the delayed fear conditioning task. The delayed fear conditioning paradigm is known to be selective for amygdala‐based fear memories, whereas trace is selective for hippocampal‐based fear memories (Raybuck &amp; Lattal, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0031">2011</xref>). The apparatus used in this protocol was the one previously described for trace fear conditioning. Throughout testing on all days, freezing behavior was recorded using the FreezeFrame 3 automated detection software (Coulbourn; Ohio).</p>
<p>On the first day of testing, the animals received two pairings of a 30‐s, 80‐dB white noise (CS) followed immediately by a 2‐s 0.7 mA shock stimulus (US). Following the second pairing, there was a 20 s interval. This trial lasted for a total of 334 s. The second day of testing consisted of two trials. On the first trial, the animal was placed in the familiar context and allowed to move freely for 300 s to evaluate freezing behavior in the original context. After a two‐hour period, the animal was presented with a second trial. For the second trial the context was altered as described above by changing the shape and floor of the chamber as well as a novel vanilla‐scented odor placed under the floor grid. The animal was placed in a new context for 360 s. During the first 3 min the subject was allowed to acclimate to a novel context. During the second 3 min of this trial, the animal was presented with the CS continuously for 3 min and freezing behavior was examined. Experimenters were not present during the testing window.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All data were analyzed using GraphPad Software 6.05 (San Diego, CA, USA) or IBM SPSS Statistics 23 (Aramonk, NY, USA). Results were evaluated using a two‐way (Genotype [wild‐type, knockout] × Sex [male, female]) analysis of variance (ANOVA) on each variable for the specific test. Analysis of all results except for the light–dark task involved repeated measures. Information regarding the within‐subjects variable can be found in the specific section. Significant interactions were followed up by formation of a unique grouping variable, “group”, which divided subjects into four groups: male WT, male KO, female WT, and female KO. These interactions were examined with Tukey's LSD post hoc multiple comparisons. For all comparisons, the level of significance remained at <italic>p </italic>&lt;<italic> </italic>.05.

<p>We next wanted to examine if this hyperactivity was a result of failure to habituate over the testing window. A within‐subjects variable of “epoch” was created detailing the total distance moved in ten minute time bins.

<p>Next, we examined anxiety behavior in the open field by measuring the location of movement in the center and surround regions of the testing field. We used a within‐subjects variable of “location” to measure distance moved in the center and surround of the field.

<p>Finally, to examine if the distribution of hole‐poking behavior differed on other measures, a repeated measures ANOVA was run with a within‐subjects variable of “location”, made up of front holes poked, back holes poked, and corner holes poked.

<title>Motor coordination: rotarod</title>
<p>To examine changes in motor learning, coordination, and repetitive behavior, subjects were tested in the accelerating rotarod task.

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to characterize the effect of <italic>Fmr1</italic> deletion in male and female animals. Previous studies evaluating the impact of <italic>Fmr1</italic> deletion often do not include female animals, whether due to avoidance of potentially confounding variables or to the high cost of potentially doubling sample sizes. Our data show that the deletion of <italic>Fmr1</italic> produces sex‐specific behavioral changes. Female <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs showed increased repetitive behaviors on both the nose‐poke task and enhanced motor coordination on the accelerating rotarod when compared to their female WT counterparts, whereas males KOs lacked a similar effect. Social behavior in both the three‐chambered social task and social partition task was unaffected across sexes. Deletion of <italic>Fmr1</italic> also resulted in learning and memory deficits in both trace and delayed fear conditioning paradigms across both sexes. Hyperactivity was detected in the open field task, but only in male KO mice.</p>
<p>Previous examinations of repetitive behavior phenotypes in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice have yielded few statistically significant results. Moreover, most of these effects have been weak and nonreproducible across strains. In a seminal article where the investigators generated six <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse strains, increases in marble burying were observed in only one of the tested strains, though no effect of <italic>Fmr1</italic> deletion on marble burying behavior was noted across all strains. One other paper found a deficit in marble burying behavior that was only trending toward a statistically significant difference (Veeraragavan et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0041">2011</xref>). In both studies only males were used, whereas our study reports the novel finding of female‐specific increases in the repetitive behavior of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs on the nose‐poke task. Therefore, the conclusion that <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice do not have alterations in repetitive behavior may only be representative of male KOs. In support of this assertion, authors of one previous study briefly mentioned similar female‐specific increases in nose‐poke behavior, though these results were not highlighted (Baker et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0001">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Female <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs also showed increased latency to fall in the accelerating rotarod task. The rotarod task is often regarded as a test of cerebellar coordination and motor ability. Previous research has reported no differences in the latency to falling in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO compared to WT (Heulens, D'Hulst, Van Dam, De Deyn, &amp; Kooy, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0014">2012</xref>; Peier et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0025">2000</xref>; Spencer et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0039">2011</xref>). However, one previous investigation has indicated that female wild‐type mice show improved performance on the accelerating rotarod task across multiple strains (McFadyen, Kusek, Bolivar, &amp; Flaherty, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0020">2003</xref>). Phenotypic analyses of another monogenic model of ASD, the neuroligin‐3 (<italic>NLGN‐3</italic>) knockout mouse, have noted enhanced motor learning in the rotarod task, similar to our <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO females (Rothwell Patrick et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0036">2014</xref>). The authors from Rothwell Patrick et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0036">2014</xref> suggested that several components of the motor routine become less variable with training such that latency to falling in this task could be considered an indicator of acquired repetitive behavior. In accordance with these results, we suggest that perhaps female <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs display increases in acquired repetitive behavior in this task.</p>
<p>Hyperactivity in animal models is often considered a confound behavior that could be driving performance in the rotarod task, however, in this study, this is not the case for two reasons. Given the robust findings in the open field task, one would expect that there would be a significant difference on the first trial, which we did not observe. Secondly, female <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice had similar levels of activity compared to WT mice in the open field test, but showed enhanced accelerating rotarod performance. This evidence is congruous with clinical data in humans suggesting that FXS‐related hyperactivity in females is less common than in FXS males (Freund, Reiss, &amp; Abrams, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0008">1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous investigations in <italic>Fmr1</italic> male KOs often show decreased sociability in both social partition and the three‐chambered social task (Liu &amp; Smith, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0018">2009</xref>; Moy et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0023">2009</xref>; Pietropaolo, Guilleminot, Martin, D'Amato, &amp; Crusio, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0028">2011</xref>), which is consistent with ASD and FXS symptomologies. As such, a surprising finding of this study was that <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs show no change in investigation time in social tasks across both sexes. One other study reported similar social preference in the three‐chambered social task between <italic>Fmr1</italic> WT and KO mice (McNaughton et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0022">2008</xref>). These discrepancies may be as a result of a variety of environmental and methodological factors. For example, when behavior in the social partition is examined over time bins, <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice show initial suppression of social investigation during the first 5 minutes of the task, followed by enhanced investigation in the later part of the task (Spencer, Alekseyenko, Serysheva, Yuva‐Paylor, &amp; Paylor, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0040">2005</xref>). Assays of social behavior in this model may be influenced by cage familiarity. On the first day of testing, in an unfamiliar cage, <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs exhibited similar time spent at the partition. During the second day <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO were presented with new unfamiliar partners in the same (“familiar”) cage. During the second “familiar cage” trial, KOs reacted differently than WTs, and the direction of the effect changed across the four time bins. The authors of this study suggested that the social response of the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice are dependent on experience. Therefore, it is possible that the lack of alterations seen in this study may reflect an adaptation to the cage environment. Future studies could examine other paradigms known to detect such subtleties.</p>
<p>One possible limitation of this study is the lack of assessment of estrous cycle of the females mice used in the study. Given that most of these behavioral paradigms only span one day, it is possible that differences could reflect differences in estrous cycles between groups. A recent study comparing heterozygous <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutants did assess the estrous cycle of subjects, however, it was shown that estrous cycle did not significantly impact the results shown (Gauducheau et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0009">2017</xref>). Furthermore, a recent meta‐analysis of 293 articles found that variability was not greater in females for behavioral tasks when they did not account for the estrous cycle (Prendergast et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0029">2014</xref>). However, given that these subjects were separately housed, it is possible that these effects could account for changes seen. Future studies should assess this possibility.</p>
<p>Another possible limitation of our study is the absence of <italic>Fmr1</italic> heterozygous female mice, for two reasons. The first is that in human cases of FXS, heterozygous mutations in <italic>FMR1</italic> are most common, with homozygous mutations rarely occurring. Heterozygous females with the full <italic>FMR1</italic> mutation display mosaic expression of FMRP from the unaffected X chromosome. This typically leads to behavioral variability, which can be typically attributed to a gene dosage effect. Previous studies have examined behavior in the heterozygous <italic>Fmr1</italic> female, but few differences were noted between homozygous and heterozygous females, mostly limited to juvenile aged animals (Gauducheau et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0009">2017</xref>; Qin et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0030">2005</xref>). Although previous studies have suggested that potential differences in female <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs, as well as human clinical data, are linked directly to a gene dosage effect, the behavioral differences noted in this study are independent of <italic>Fmr1</italic> expression. Second, the breeding paradigms used to produce wild‐type and homozygous <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout mice require different pairings, meaning that litter effects could significantly influence behavior (Zupan &amp; Toth, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0043">2008</xref>). These effects could be controlled by inclusion of a female heterozygous group and future studies should directly compare these groups. This study does serve to highlight the role of sex as a biological variable mediating the behavioral phenotype following complete loss of <italic>Fmr1</italic> gene expression, independent of gene dosage effects.</p>
<p>The larger scientific community has begun to place a larger emphasis in investigating and understanding the mediational role of sex in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO, and more broadly, in biomedical research. Understanding sex as a biological variable has wide‐ranging implications, including enhancing the reproducibility of research (Collins &amp; Tabak, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0006">2014</xref>) and the betterment of women's health. Broadly, these findings of this study underscore the importance of including females in preclinical examinations, for the development of potential therapeutic interventions for example. While some have suggested that the female <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs should be included in studies with males based on similarity, here we highlight the marked phenotypic differences, and as such, future research could focus on how these phenotypes could, and should, be treated separately. For instance, repetitive behavior phenotypes are commonly treated using several different types of drugs, including 5‐HT1BR agonists (Ho et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0015">2016</xref>), 5HT1A partial antagonists (Chugani et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0004">2016</xref>) and more recently, antioxidants (Hardan et al., <xref ref-type="ref" rid="brb3800-bib-0013">2012</xref>). Through the routine exclusion of females from biomedical studies, opportunities are missed to explore potential treatments and how sex may impact the efficacy of such treatments.</p>
