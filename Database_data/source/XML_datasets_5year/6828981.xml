<abstract>
<p>Genetic and nongenetic factors are involved in the individual ability to physiologically acclimatize to high-altitude hypoxia through processes that include increased heart rate and ventilation. High-altitude acclimatization is thought to have a genetic component, yet it is unclear if other factors, such as epigenetic gene regulation, are involved in acclimatization to high-altitude hypoxia in nonacclimatized individuals. We collected saliva samples from a group of healthy adults of European ancestry (n = 21) in Kathmandu (1,400 m; baseline) and three altitudes during a trek to the Everest Base Camp: Namche (3,440 m; day 3), Pheriche (4,240 m; day 7), and Gorak Shep (5,160 m; day 10). We used quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing to determine changes in DNA methylation, a well-studied epigenetic marker, in LINE-1, <italic>EPAS1</italic>, <italic>EPO</italic>, <italic>PPARa</italic>, and <italic>RXRa</italic>. We found significantly lower DNA methylation between baseline (1,400 m) and high altitudes in LINE-1, <italic>EPO</italic> (at 4,240 m only), and <italic>RXRa</italic>. We found increased methylation in <italic>EPAS1</italic> (at 4,240 m only) and <italic>PPARa</italic>. We also found positive associations between <italic>EPO</italic> methylation and systolic blood pressure and <italic>RXRa</italic> methylation and hemoglobin. Our results show that incremental exposure to hypoxia can affect the epigenome. Changes to the epigenome, in turn, could underlie the process of altitude acclimatization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>More than 140 million people worldwide permanently live at high altitudes, and 40 million more visit altitudes above 2,500 m annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">Ward et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Moore, 2001</xref>). Atmospheric oxygen partial pressure decreases with increasing altitude, and most individuals experience physiological changes in low-oxygen environments, including increased ventilation, increased red blood cell production, and increased heart rate (HR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Houston and Riley, 1947</xref>). A combination of molecular- to the organismal-level changes occurs during high-altitude acclimatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Sarkar et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The acute response to hypoxia (seconds to hours) involves changes in homeostatic regulation, whereas chronic acclimatization (hours to years) is characterized by gene expression changes in the carotid body, endothelial cells, and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Kourembanas et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">Wiener et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Huey and Powell, 2000</xref>). One of main responders to decreasing levels of oxygen is the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF) pathway. HIF-1 consists of two subunits, oxygen-regulated HIF-1α, and constitutively expressed HIF-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Ivan et al., 2001</xref>). In normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is hydroxylated by HIF prolyl hydroxylase (EGLN) and destined for degradation by ubiquitination <italic>via</italic> the von Hippel–Lindau ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Ohh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Epstein et al., 2001</xref>). HIF-1α hydroxylation is decreased in hypoxic conditions allowing it to accumulate and dimerize with HIF-1β forming an active HIF-1 transcription factor in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Semenza, 2007</xref>). HIF is involved in promoting angiogenesis, regulating erythropoiesis, stimulating glycolysis, and inhibiting fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Formenti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Haase, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Huang et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that mRNA levels of genes involved in the HIF pathway change upon hypoxic exposure, including <italic>HIF1A</italic> and <italic>ARNT</italic> in rats and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">Wiener et al., 1996</xref>), mRNA levels of the platelet-derived growth factor (<italic>PDGF-B</italic>) in human endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Kourembanas et al., 1990</xref>), and dopamine D2 receptor (<italic>D2R</italic>) in rat carotid body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Huey and Powell, 2000</xref>). Given their ability to change upon exposure to environmental factors, epigenetic mechanisms have been hypothesized to play a role the hypoxic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Brown and Rupert, 2014</xref>). Epigenetics refers to mitotically and, in some cases, meiotically heritable changes to gene expression that do not involve changes to DNA sequence and may be reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">Wolffe and Guschin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Feil and Fraga, 2011</xref>). The most widely studied and best understood epigenetic modification is DNA methylation, an addition of a methyl group to the nucleotide cytosine in a cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Mohn and Schubeler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Lam et al., 2012</xref>). DNA methylation is most commonly associated with gene repression when located in promoter regions of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Klose and Bird, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Epigenetic modifications are known for their plasticity and ability to change based on the environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Bollati and Baccarelli, 2010</xref>). Previous studies found associations between DNA methylation and pharmaceuticals, exercise, stress, and other exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Dolinoy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Dolinoy and Jirtle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Senut et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Faulk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Non et al., 2016</xref>). Decreased oxygen levels are associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are genotoxic and can affect DNA methylation and the posttranslational modifications to histone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">James et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Niu et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, epigenetic changes have been observed in cancer cells that are often hypoxic due to the lower oxygen availability of solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">Shahrzad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Baxter et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we focused on DNA methylation and exposure to high-altitude hypoxia.</p>
<p>Epigenetic regulation has been studied in the context of high-altitude adaptation in Andeans and Ethiopians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Alkorta-Aranburu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Childebayeva et al., 2019</xref>). Despite this, epigenetic changes associated with acclimatization to high-altitude hypoxia are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Julian et al., 2014</xref>). To determine if short-term exposure to hypoxia affects the epigenome, we recruited individuals trekking to Everest Base Camp in the Nepal Himalaya. We collected saliva samples and various physiological measurements at four different altitudes: Kathmandu [1,400m; baseline (BL)], Namche (3,440m; day 3), Pheriche (4,240m; day 7), and Gorak Shep (5,160m; day 10).</p>
<p>We determined the DNA methylation status of the repetitive element LINE-1 and the hypoxia-associated genes <italic>EPAS1</italic>, <italic>EPO</italic>, <italic>PPARa</italic>, and <italic>RXRa</italic>. We chose LINE-1 as the marker of global methylation as it has been shown to have different methylation profiles at high compared to low altitude in multigenerational Andeans of Quechua ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Childebayeva et al., 2019</xref>). We examined methylation at <italic>EPAS1</italic> as polymorphisms near this locus are associated with hemoglobin levels in Tibetans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Beall et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>EPO</italic> as it is involves in red blood cell production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Eckardt et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Dame et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Beall et al., 2010</xref>), and <italic>PPARa</italic> and <italic>RXRa</italic> as these hypoxia-associated genes are involved in lipid metabolism regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Keller et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Chinetti et al., 2000</xref>) and <italic>PPARA</italic> is associated with adaptation in high-altitude populations in the Himalaya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Keller et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Chinetti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">Simonson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Horscroft et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>RXRa</italic> and <italic>PPARa</italic> form a heterodimer that is necessary for <italic>PPARa</italic> functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Chan and Wells, 2009</xref>). The aforementioned HIF pathway genes have been chosen due to previous evidence that methylation levels at these genes are associated hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">Rossler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Lachance et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Cortese et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Ethics and Participant Recruitment</title>
<p>This study abided by the Canadian Government Tri-Council policy on research ethics with human participants (TCPS2) and the Declaration of Helsinki, except for registration in a database. Ethical approval was received in advance through Mount Royal University Human Research Ethics Board (protocol 100012 and 101361), the Syracuse University Institutional Review Board (protocol 18-006), and the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (HUM00141118) and harmonized with the Nepal Health Research Council (protocol 109-2017).</p>
<p>This study took place in May 2018 as part of a research expedition in the Khumbu Valley, Everest region of Nepal. We recruited 21 healthy, nonpregnant, nonlactating, nonsmokers between 19 and 52 years of age from a larger research expedition to Everest Base Camp in the Nepal Himalaya. All participants were recruited in Kathmandu <italic>via</italic> verbal communication and provided written and informed consent prior to voluntary participation in the study. Even though these participants were recruited as a part of a larger research expedition, the research questions and data collection reported here were planned <italic>a priori</italic> in advance. Participants either were all altitude naive or had an extended period since the last altitude experience (&gt; 1year). All participants were of self-reported European descent to control for population effects on epigenetics. Participant characteristics can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>.</p>

<title>Ascent Profile and Data Collection</title>
<p>Over the course of 10 days, a team of researchers and study participants trekked from 2,800 to 5,160 m. The ascent profile included three nontrekking rest days at 3,440 m (day 3), 3,820 m (day 5), and 4,240 m (day 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). In the morning between 6:00 and 8:00 local time at 1,400m (Kathmandu; day 0), 3,440 m (Namche; day 3), 4,240 m (Pheriche; day 7), and 5,160 m (Gorak Shep; day 10), saliva samples for DNA and physiological measures were taken following one night of sleep at each altitude.</p>

<p>With respect to physiological measures, body weight was measured using a portable digital scale (model HBF-516B; Omron, San Ramon, CA, United States). All physiological measures were obtained at rest in a seated position following &gt;2-min rest with eyes closed and white noise played through headphones to limit distraction. Blood pressure was assessed using an automated sphygmomanometer. Peripheral oxygen saturation and HR (min<sup>−1</sup>) were measured using a portable finger pulse oximeter (Masimo SET Rad-5, Danderyd, Sweden). Hemoglobin concentration [(Hb); Hemocue Hemoglobin System, Hb201+, Angelholm, Sweden] was assessed <italic>via</italic> finger capillary blood sample using sterile lancets and universal precautions. Self-reported acute mountain sickness scores were obtained using the standard Lake Louise Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">Roach Rc et al., 1993</xref>). All phenotypic measures were performed at the same time of day for each participant.

<title>DNA Methylation</title>
<p>Saliva samples were collected, and DNA was extracted following a well-established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Quinque et al., 2006</xref>). Quantitative pyrosequencing was performed to assess DNA methylation levels of LINE1, <italic>EPAS1</italic>, <italic>EPO</italic>, <italic>PPARa</italic>, and <italic>RXRa</italic>. Five hundred nanograms of DNA from each sample was bisulfite converted using the EZ-96 DNA Methylation<sup>™</sup> Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). Bisulfite-converted DNA was amplified using primers for LINE1 and each targeted gene and HotstarTaq plus Master Mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Primer sequences and the locations of the amplicons can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1"><bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold></xref>. Each sample was pyrosequenced in duplicate using the Pyromark Q96 pyrosequencer (Qiagen). Quality control of the data was assessed using quality control measures built into the pyrosequencing software. All measurements outside of 2 standard deviations from the mean of all samples for each CpG position were excluded. Moreover, measurements with the coefficient of variance between replicates of more than 10 were excluded from further analyses. Duplicate measurements were averaged, as was DNA methylation at CpG sites within each gene. Statistical modeling was performed on these average DNA methylation values for each subject at each gene. Statistical analyses were performed using the samples collected from the 21 individuals at four altitudes for each LINE1, <italic>EPAS1</italic>, <italic>EPO</italic>, and <italic>PPARa</italic> and 19 for <italic>RXRa</italic>. No template controls and 0% methylated DNA and 100% methylated DNA controls (Qiagen) were included in all experiments.</p>

<p>Oxygen homeostasis is an essential component of basic physiological homeostasis. In the mitochondria, oxygen is used to produce ATP in the process of oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Semenza, 2007</xref>). HIF downregulates oxygen consumption by mitochondria and stimulates the glycolytic pathway enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Semenza, 2010</xref>). In addition, the HIF pathway is involved in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Fatty acid oxidation is inhibited in hypoxic conditions as a result of the switch to glycolysis. This leads to accumulation of lipid droplets that have been shown to play a role in protection against ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">Whitmer et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Bensaad et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the HIF pathway is involved in increasing hemoglobin levels in response to decreased oxygen levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Franke et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we determined DNA methylation levels of four HIF pathway genes involved in oxygen homeostasis and metabolism, <italic>EPAS1</italic>, <italic>EPO</italic>, <italic>PPARa</italic>, and <italic>RXRa</italic>, and the marker of global methylation, LINE-1, to better understand how the epigenome responds to changes in ambient oxygen availability.</p>
<p>This is the first study to report changes in DNA methylation associated with an incremental ascent to high altitude in a cohort of European ancestry. Previous studies have shown that DNA methylation is affected by chronic exposure to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">Watson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">Yuen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Brown and Rupert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Childebayeva et al., 2019</xref>). However, the effects of short-term hypoxic exposure on the epigenome have not been studied in the context of acclimatization to high altitude in nonacclimatized individuals.</p>
<p>We found decreased LINE-1 methylation, increased <italic>PPARa</italic>, and decreased <italic>RXRa</italic> methylation at high compared to low altitude. We also identified increased <italic>EPAS1</italic> methylation at 4,240 m (seven days of ascent) and decreased <italic>EPO</italic> methylation at 4,240 m compared to 1,400m. We also found positive associations between <italic>RXRa</italic> methylation and hemoglobin and between <italic>EPO</italic> methylation and systolic blood pressure. These findings show that short-term exposure to high-altitude hypoxia can influence the epigenome, which may in turn influence gene expression and phenotype and thus contribute to high-altitude acclimatization.</p>
<p>LINE-1 is a repetitive element, and its methylation level is associated with the global genomic methylation level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Ogino et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Iwagami et al., 2012</xref>). The methylation status of LINE-1 has been used as a proxy for the status of the methylome upon exposure to toxicants and in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Chalitchagorn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Kile et al., 2012</xref>). Decreased LINE-1 methylation has been shown in cancer and has been associated with genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Ogino et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">Pattamadilok et al., 2008</xref>). We found lower LINE-1 methylation levels associated with high-altitude exposure in our cohort. This could be explained by the effect of ROS on the genome, since ROS production is higher in hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">Wongpaiboonwattana et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Kloypan et al., 2015</xref>). This finding likely reflects the effects of hypoxia as a stressor on the genome.</p>
<p><italic>EPAS1</italic> is involved in activation of oxygen-regulated genes, plays a role in vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">Peng et al., 2000</xref>), and is an important regulator of EPO, which controls erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">Rankin et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, <italic>EPAS1</italic> contributes to high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans and shows altered methylation in Andeans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Beall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Childebayeva et al., 2019</xref>). We found increased methylation of <italic>EPAS1</italic> associated with high altitude at 4,240m (day 7), potentially suggesting decreased <italic>EPAS1</italic> expression. In comparison, high-altitude adapted Andeans show decreased methylation in hypoxic conditions compared to normoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Childebayeva et al., 2019</xref>). It is possible that the increase in <italic>EPAS1</italic> methylation corresponds to the increase in <italic>EPAS1</italic> hydroxymethylation. Hydroxymethylation of a CpG site is an intermediate stage in the demethylation pathway catalyzed by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">Tahiliani et al., 2009</xref>). The bisulfite conversion method we used does not differentiate between methylated and hydroxymethylated cytosines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Nestor et al., 2010</xref>). It is possible that <italic>EPAS1</italic> is in the process of demethylation, which would be expected in hypoxic conditions, although we are seeing a general increase in DNA methylation in our participants.</p>
<p><italic>EPO</italic> plays a major role in increased erythropoiesis under HIF control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Koury and Bondurant, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">Yoon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Risso et al., 2007</xref>). EPO levels rise quickly upon hypoxic exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Eckardt et al., 1989</xref>). In previous studies of high-altitude acclimatization, EPO has been shown to peak after 1 to 3 days at altitude, followed by a decline in an altitude-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Abbrecht and Littell, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Ge et al., 2002</xref>). EPO has a conserved HIF-1 binding site (HBS) CGTG in its 3′ UTR containing a CpG site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">Wang and Semenza, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">Wang and Semenza, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">Wenger et al., 1998</xref>). Decreased methylation status of the HBS has been associated with activation of EPO in hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">Wenger et al., 1998</xref>). We found lower methylation upstream of the HBS site at all higher altitudes compared with 1,400m, and this was statistically significant at 4,240m. These findings are concordant with previously observed increased EPO expression levels at high altitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Robach et al., 2004</xref>) and suggest that DNA methylation may play a role in this process.</p>
<p>We found a significant positive association between EPO methylation and systolic blood pressure suggesting that lower levels of erythropoietin may be correlated with higher blood pressure, since higher DNA methylation around this locus just upstream of an HBS has been linked to decreased expression of EPO based on previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">Wenger et al., 1998</xref>). Other studies have shown a positive relationship between erythropoietin and human recombinant erythropoietin and blood pressure at rest and exercise in humans and in hypertensive and normotensive rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Berglund and Ekblom, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">Raine and Roger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Muntzel et al., 1993</xref>). More research is necessary to establish if decreased EPO methylation of the locus targeted here is truly associated with higher levels of erythropoietin and if there is a link between <italic>EPO</italic> methylation and systolic blood pressure, especially since we did not find an association with hemoglobin. Of note, we observed a negative relationship between <italic>EPO</italic> methylation and systolic blood pressure at 4,240m (day 7), indicating a potential positive link between EPO expression and blood pressure at this altitude. This is the only altitude where we observed a significant change in methylation compared to the baseline. Further investigation is necessary to determine why the positive relationship between <italic>EPO</italic> expression and systolic blood pressure was identified only at 4,240 m of altitude (day 7).</p>
<p><italic>PPARa</italic> is a transcription factor involved in controlling fatty acid metabolism and oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Keller et al., 1993</xref>). PPARs activate the gene for acyl coenzyme A oxidase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Dreyer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Keller et al., 1993</xref>). In addition to its role in fatty acid metabolism, <italic>PPARa</italic> is also associated with conditions such as obesity and diabetes, as well as various cardiovascular conditions including hypertension and atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Belanger et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>PPARa</italic> promotes fatty acid oxidation and may be involved in the switch from fatty acid oxidation to glucose oxidation <italic>via</italic> regulation of uncoupling protein 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">Teruel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Gilde et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>HIF transcription factors are known regulators of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Formenti et al., 2010</xref>). Previous studies in cell cultures have shown that <italic>PPARa</italic> is downregulated by HIF-1 in hypoxic conditions, which may be an adaptive response to hypoxia-induced inflammatory stimuli and metabolic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Narravula and Colgan, 2001</xref>). Another study of hypoxia exposure during an incremental ascent to the Everest Base Camp has found lower capacity for fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle and lower <italic>PPARa</italic> expression at altitude in the Himalayan Sherpa compared to lowlanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Horscroft et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>We found increased <italic>PPARa</italic> methylation associated with increasing altitude. The region we targeted is in the promoter region of <italic>PPARa</italic> suggesting that increased methylation here would be associated with a decrease in expression of <italic>PPARa</italic>, which is consistent with previous findings of decreased <italic>PPARa</italic> expression in hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Narravula and Colgan, 2001</xref>). Decreased expression of <italic>PPARa</italic> is associated with diminished breakdown of fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">Yoon, 2009</xref>). Lower levels of fatty acid oxidation are hypothesized to occur in hypoxic conditions due to the switch to anaerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Ge et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>RXRa</italic> is a transcription factor involved in fat metabolism and intracellular receptor signaling. <italic>RXRa</italic> binds to <italic>PPARa</italic> forming an active transcriptional complex able to bind to target genes known as proliferator-responsive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Dreyer et al., 1993</xref>). Several studies have shown that the activity of the PPARa/RXR<italic>a</italic> complex is reduced in hypoxic conditions to enable suppression of fatty acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Huss et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Belanger et al., 2007</xref>). The <italic>RXRa</italic> pathway was altered by hypobaric hypoxia exposure in the rat brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">Sethy et al., 2011</xref>). RXRs play a protective role in H9c2 cardiomyocytes from hypoxia/reoxygenation–induced oxidative injury in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">Shan et al., 2014</xref>). We found decreased methylation of the CpG island located in the promoter region of <italic>RXRa</italic>, which may be associated with increased expression of <italic>RXRa</italic>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we observed opposite trends in <italic>PPARa</italic> and <italic>RXRa</italic> methylation change. For example, individuals with increased <italic>PPARa</italic> methylation at high altitude have decreased <italic>RXRa</italic> methylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1"><bold>Supplementary Figures 1D, E</bold></xref>). Interestingly, individuals with decreased <italic>PPARa</italic> methylation (IDs 7 and 17) at high altitude have increased <italic>RXRa</italic> methylation (IDs 7 and 17), further highlighting the interactive nature of <italic>PPARa/RXRa</italic>. Since we see opposite change in <italic>PPARa</italic> and <italic>RXRa</italic> methylation levels, it is unclear whether it indicates increased or decreased activity of the PPARa/RXR<italic>a</italic> complex.</p>
<p>We found a significant positive association between <italic>RXRa</italic> methylation and hemoglobin levels. <italic>RXRa</italic> is a member of the retinoic acid receptor family and is necessary for normal hematopoiesis during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Melnick and Licht, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Oren et al., 2003</xref>). Retinoic acid signaling, specifically retinoic acid receptor α, is also involved in adult hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Canete et al., 2017</xref>). RXRa has been shown to play a role in hematopoietic signaling in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">Ricote et al., 2006</xref>). However, the role of RXRa in this process is not well understood in adult humans. Our data suggest that there is a relationship between <italic>RXRa</italic> and hemoglobin levels. Previous studies have shown that <italic>PPARa</italic> is associated with hemoglobin levels, which could explain why we see a significant association with <italic>RXRa</italic> as well, since PPARa and RXRa are known to interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">Simonson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">Scheinfeldt et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the limitations of our study is the use of saliva as a source of DNA. Saliva comprised white blood cells and epithelial buccal cells. Due to differences in DNA methylation signatures between tissues, any changes in methylation associated with altitude exposure may be confounded by cell type composition differences between altitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Lokk et al., 2014</xref>). We did not quantify saliva cell types at each altitude and thus were unable to control for this limitation. Furthermore, we only assessed the methylation levels of saliva. Therefore, it is unclear how other tissues responded to hypoxic exposure. However, there are known correlations between saliva and blood. Studies of genome-wide DNA methylation have reported 88.5% to 96.7% Pearson correlation between blood and saliva CpG sites within an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">Smith et al., 2015a</xref>). Saliva buccal epithelial cell methylation is also similar to the methylation patters of the brain due to the same ectodermal developmental origin and thus may serve as a proxy for DNA methylation changes in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">Smith et al., 2015b</xref>). Methylation levels of certain CpG sites are known to be tissue-specific, while methylation levels of other CpG sites correlate between tissue types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">Varley et al., 2013</xref>). To our knowledge, the genes and loci we chose to study have not been shown to be tissue-specific in terms of methylation levels.</p>
<p>Lastly, we did not collect gene expression data from our participants and thus have not been able to directly link changes in DNA methylation to gene expression.</p>
<p>Overall, we found that short-term exposure to high-altitude hypoxia can affect the epigenome. We observed changes in LINE-1 and hypoxia-pathway associated genes <italic>EPAS1</italic>, <italic>EPO</italic>, <italic>PPARa</italic>, and <italic>RXRa</italic>. We also found significant associations between DNA methylation of EPO and RXRa and systolic blood pressure and hemoglobin, respectively. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on the role of epigenetics in acclimatization to high altitude. Future studies of the genome-wide effects of hypoxia on epigenetics are necessary to better understand the extent of DNA methylation change upon high-altitude exposure.</p>
