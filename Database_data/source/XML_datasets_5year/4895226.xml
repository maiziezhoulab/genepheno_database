<abstract>
<p>Microtubules and their associated proteins (MAPs) underpin the polarity of specialised cells. Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is one such MAP with a multifunctional agenda that requires precise intracellular localisations. Although APC has been found to associate with kinesin-2 subfamily members, the exact mechanism for the peripheral localization of APC remains unclear. Here we show that the heavy chain of kinesin-1 directly interacts with the APC C-terminus, contributing to the peripheral localisation of APC in fibroblasts. In rat hippocampal neurons the kinesin-1 binding domain of APC is required for its axon tip enrichment. Moreover, we demonstrate that APC requires interactions with both kinesin-2 and kinesin-1 for this localisation. Underlining the importance of the kinesin-1 association, neurons expressing APC lacking kinesin-1-binding domain have shorter axons. The identification of this novel kinesin-1-APC interaction highlights the complexity and significance of APC localisation in neurons.</p>

<body>
<p>Neurons are highly polarised cells which require the structural and organisational capacity of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton and its associated proteins (MAPs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. By regulating MT interactions and dynamics, the coordinated activities of a variety MAPs tailor the MT cytoskeleton to specific functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. In neurons, stable MTs bundle in the axon to serve as both a structural framework and a directional highway for the transport of materials by motor proteins. Conversely, the dynamics of MT growth and shrinkage at the axon tip provide the plasticity to steer axon growth and alter synaptic activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.</p>
<p>One MAP intimately involved with cell polarity is Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. APC functions through interactions with MTs, the MT plus end-interacting (+TIP) EB proteins, microtubule-based kinesin motors and both the actin and intermediate filament cytoskeletal elements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. As part of the discrete β-catenin destruction complex, APC also acts in the wnt signalling pathway with GSK3β, Axin and CK1ε<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. A combination of modular tertiary structure and extended unstructured regions provides the platform for these myriad interactions across the 2843-residue APC protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Partial loss of these interactions after nonsense mutations mark APC as a tumour suppressor associated with both syndromic and spontaneous tumourigenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Highlighting important roles in the central nervous system, deletion of APC is also linked with intellectual and autistic disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p>
<p>APC is important for brain development and functions in pathways controlling neuronal differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Initially found at the tips of multiple neurites, APC becomes localised specifically at the distal region of the growing axon, termed the growth cone, upon neuronal polarisation, perhaps in response to local inhibition of GSK3β<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. At this site APC plays important roles in axonal growth, guidance, and morphology by promoting MT growth and stabilisation, actin remodelling and the translation of localised RNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p>
<p>The accumulation of APC at the axon tip is an important but incompletely understood aspect of its function. Around half of the 45 kinesin superfamily (KIF) members are MT plus end-directed processive motors, many of which act to traffic cargo along axons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Kinesin-2 motors have been suggested to play a role in transport of APC into the axon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The KAP3 subunit of heterotrimeric kinesin-2 and the homodimeric kinesin-2 KIF17 bind the N-terminus of APC to transport it to the cell periphery in fibroblasts and epithelial cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Whilst heterotrimeric kinesin-2 is an axonal motor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, KIF17 is an unlikely candidate to localise APC to the axon since it transports cargo selectively to dendrites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. In addition, EB proteins associate with the C-terminus of APC, potentially enabling APC to track the growing plus end of MTs at the axon tip<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, a genetic interaction between APC and kinesin-1 in Drosophila impacts upon polarised membrane trafficking in neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Moreover, in mouse epithelial cells kinesin-1 has been reported to localise APC to the epithelial cell periphery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Kinesin-1 is the prototypic KIF member<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, and was subsequently characterised as a key axonal cargo transporter that also accumulates in axonal growth cones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Kinesin-1 can function as a homodimer of MT motor domain-containing kinesin heavy chain subunits (KIF5), with kinesin light chain (KLC) proteins able to associate with KIF5 to provide further cargo-binding and autoregulatory functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present study, an interaction between KIF5 and the C-terminus of APC was identified which contributes to the peripheral localisation of GFP-APC in human fibroblasts. In rat hippocampal neurons GFP-APC enrichment at the axon tip was drastically reduced in a mutant GFP-APC lacking the KIF5-binding domain. Interestingly, expression of this mutant led to shorter axons without affecting growth cone morphology. In addition, inhibiting kinesin-1 activity by expression of dominant negative (DN) constructs prevented APC accumulation at axon tips. Moreover, heterotrimeric kinesin-2 DN constructs also suppressed axon tip localisation of APC. These data suggest that kinesin-1 and kinesin-2 collaborate to localise APC to the axon tip and that the interaction of APC with kinesin-1 is required for proper axon growth.</p>

<title>KIF5 directly binds a novel region in the APC C-terminus</title>
<p>Since links between kinesin-1 and APC have been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, we tested for a biochemical interaction between APC and kinesin-1. Kinesin-1 functions as a KIF5 dimer or a tetramer of KIF5 plus two KLCs that associate with the KIF5 C-terminus. Kinesin-1 couples to cargo either via the central stalk and C-terminal tail domains of KIF5, and/or through binding between cargo and KLCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. We expressed the C-terminal cargo-binding tails of human KIF5A, B and C as GST-fusion proteins, and found that all were able to pull down endogenous APC from MRC-5 human fibroblast lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In contrast, the C-terminal cargo-binding region of human KLC isoforms KLC1B and KLC2 expressed as GST fusions did not interact with APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>
<p>To begin to map the portion of APC that interacts with kinesin-1, the truncated APC endogenously expressed in the DLD-1 colon cancer cell line was used (truncated at amino acid 1417, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). This form lacks the C-terminal EB1 binding site but contains the N-terminal armadillo domains that bind the non-motor subunit of heterotrimeric kinesin-2, KAP3 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). As expected, a C-terminal fragment of KAP3B containing the known APC-interacting region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, GST-KAP3Bct, pulled down DLD-1 APC whereas GST-EB1 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). GST-KIF5Bct did not interact with DLD-1 APC, suggesting the C-terminal half of APC associates with kinesin-1.</p>
<p>We dissected the kinesin-1 interaction site further by expressing GFP-tagged C-terminal APC fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>) in HeLaM cells and testing their ability to interact with recombinant GST-tagged KIF5Bct, KAP3Bct and EB1. KAP3Bct did not interact with any of these GFP-APC proteins, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, EB1 and KIF5Bct both pulled down the C-terminal third of APC (amino acids 2185–2843), but not the APC central sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Further delineation of the kinesin-1 binding site to residues 2539–2680 of APC (APC-K) was achieved using bacterially expressed GST-APC fragments to pull down GFP-KIF5Bct from HeLaM cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>,d). Interestingly, this region of APC lies between the basic MT-binding site and the EB protein binding-SxIP motif, and has not been specifically mapped as a protein interaction site<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. The kinesin-APC interaction is direct, since purified 6His-KIF5Bct was pulled down by GST-APC-K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Further subdivision of the K domain (APC-K1, -K2 and -KM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>) greatly reduced the interaction with GFP-KIF5Bct from cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>), or with purified KIF5Bct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>), although APC-K1 displayed a low level of binding. Confirming that amino acids 2539–2680 were needed for kinesin-1 binding, an APC construct lacking this region, GST-APC-C1ΔK, did not pull down 6His-KIF5Bct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate how the APC-K region affects APC localisation and interactions in cells, we generated a GFP-tagged APC C-terminal construct that contained the MT and EB binding domains, with or without the kinesin-1 interaction domain (GFP-APC-C and GFP-APC-CΔK, respectively). As expected, GFP-APC-CΔK was not pulled down from HeLaM lysates by GST-KIF5Bct, although it interacted strongly with GST-EB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Furthermore, biochemical examination demonstrated that KIF5 and EB1 interact independently with the APC C-terminus, since increasing 6His-KIF5Bct concentrations did not inhibit 6His-EB1 binding to GST-APC-C1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). To test the significance of this interaction for APC localisation in cells, we expressed GFP-tagged constructs in MRC5 cells, which are flat fibroblasts with a sparse, centrosome-focussed microtubule network<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, unlike HeLaM cells. As previously described, the APC C-terminus associates with MTs but does not accumulate in peripheral clusters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. The KIF5-binding region was not needed for MT localisation, nor for the overlap of APC-C with EB1 at the ends of a subset of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,d</xref>, arrows). Expression of high levels of truncated APC-C caused redistribution of EB1 along the length of APC-positive MTs, and this was not affected by the removal of the KIF5 binding domain (data not shown).</p>

<title>Kinesin-1 promotes GFP-APC peripheral localisation in fibroblasts through the interaction with APC C-terminus</title>
<p>Full length APC localises to growing MT plus ends, decorates a subset of MTs at the cell periphery and forms clusters at these peripheral sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, with this distribution depending on interactions with MTs, EB1 and kinesin-2 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Accordingly, GFP-APC expressed in MRC-5 fibroblasts predominantly localised to a subset of MTs and in clusters at the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In 15–20% of cells, APC localised to microtubules in the cell body only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>). Full length APC lacking the kinesin-1 binding region, GFP-APCΔK, exhibited localisation that was not obviously different from GFP-APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the kinesin-1 interaction is not required <italic>per se</italic> for APC’s MT and +TIP binding, we set out to determine if the interaction with kinesin-1 contributed more subtly to the peripheral localisation of GFP-APC in MRC-5 fibroblast cells. Corroborating roles for heterotrimeric kinesin-2 and EB1 in APC localisation, siRNA-mediated depletion of KAP3 or EB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>) significantly reduced the proportion of MRC-5 cells exhibiting peripheral accumulations of GFP-APC by 48.7% and 31.1%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>, black bars). Partial knockdown of KIF5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), which is the predominant kinesin-1 family member expressed in MRC-5 cells (data not shown), led to a significant 11.5% decrease in cells with peripheral GFP-APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), suggesting that kinesin-1 does indeed facilitate peripheral APC localisation in fibroblasts. Exogenously-expressed KIF5C moves along microtubules and accumulates at the cell periphery through motor activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. We therefore expressed mouse KIF5C-myc/his to test whether this would rescue the effects of KIF5B, KAP3 or EB1 depletion on APC localisation. KIF5C-myc/his co-expression indeed rescued the decrease in cells with peripheral GFP-APC after KIF5B knockdown, as well as significantly enhancing the number of control cells exhibiting peripheral GFP-APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>, grey bars). Moreover, KIF5C-myc/his co-expression partially rescued the effects of KAP3 or EB1 knockdown on APC distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>), suggesting that kinesin-1 can transport APC along microtubules to the cell periphery.</p>
<p>We next used GFP-APCΔK to see if the direct KIF5-APC interaction lies behind these rescue data. A significantly lower number of cells exhibited peripherally localised GFP-APCΔK when compared with GFP-APC in the same experiments (11.5% reduction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>,e). Furthermore, the number of cells with peripherally localised GFP-APCΔK was not affected by KIF5B depletion, nor did it increase after co-expression of KIF5C-myc/his (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). KIF5C-myc/his co-expression also did not rescue the decreased number of cells with peripheral GFP-APCΔK after KAP3 or EB1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Together, these experiments demonstrate that kinesin-1 drives enrichment of APC in the cell periphery through an interaction between KIF5 C-terminal tail and residues 2539–2680 of APC.</p>

<title>Deletion of the kinesin-1 binding site reduces the axon tip enrichment of APC, resulting in shorter axons</title>
<p>APC localises to the distal portion of the axon in neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, but the mechanism behind this localisation has not been fully elucidated. While kinesin-1 plays a subtle role in APC localisation in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>), we wanted to test its role in APC transport in neurons, since kinesin-1 is an important motor for axonal transport. Isolated E18 rat hippocampal neurons develop a clearly distinguishable primary neurite during day 1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) which is at least three times longer than the other processes and accumulates the axonal marker Tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This very long Tau-labelled neurite is poised to become the future axon whereas the other shorter neurites develop into dendrites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. We transfected these neurons with full length GFP-APC or the KIF5 binding mutant GFP-APCΔK to compare their localisations. Strikingly, a highly significant reduction in the proportion of axon tips enriched for GFP-APCΔK was found when compared to GFP-APC (72.7% reduction: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>,c). Measuring the fluorescence intensity along the distal axon demonstrated that GFP-APC was greatly enriched within the distal 1μm of the axon tip, whereas no enrichment in the axon tip over proximal regions was seen for GFP-APCΔK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). These data implicate the interaction between kinesin-1 and APC in the distal axon localisation of APC in neurons.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, neurons expressing GFP-APCΔK had primary axons that were 16.9% shorter than neurons expressing GFP-APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>,e). While shorter axons are not seen after conditional knockout of APC from mouse cortical neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, the expression of APC DN fragments and enhanced APC-β-catenin binding both lead to shorter axons in mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Furthermore, conditional knockout and micro-scale chromophore-assisted laser inactivation of APC both caused defects in growth cone morphology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. We looked in detail at growth cone morphology in neurons expressing GFP-APCΔK, but did not identify any morphological differences which might account for reduced axon growth due to growth cone defects (data not shown).</p>
<p>Since APC interacts with microtubules, we analysed microtubule stability in the growth cones of GFP-APC and GFP-APCΔK transfected hippocampal neurons to check for possible differences which could be responsible for this reduction in axon length. Quantification of immunofluorescence levels of acetylated (stable) or tyrosinated (dynamic) microtubules showed an overall slight increase in stable microtubules in the growth cones of GFP-APCΔK transfected neurons, but these differences were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

<p>To confirm that kinesin-1 function is required for APC enrichment at the axon tip we used KIF5 fragments lacking the motor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>), which have been shown to act dominant negatively and inhibit axonal trafficking of kinesin-1 cargo, such as Kv1 K(+) channels and GABA type B receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Expression of RFP-KIF5C335 or RFP-KIF5C678 significantly reduced the level of endogenous APC in the growth cones of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>,c). In addition the axon tip enrichment of GFP-APC was abolished by both these kinesin-1 DN constructs, as shown quantitatively by fluorescence intensity linescans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
<p>In non-neuronal cells, heterotrimeric kinesin-2 is the predominant motor driving peripheral localisation of APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, and ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Moreover, in mouse DRG neurons an N-terminal fragment of APC containing the kinesin-2 binding domain accumulates at axon tips<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. To assess how heterotrimeric kinesin-2 contributes to axon tip localisation in neurons, a KAP3 dominant negative fragment previously used to inhibit peripheral accumulation of APC in epithelial cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, RFP-KAP3B449, was expressed in neurons. Interestingly, RFP-KAP3B449 also inhibited axon tip enrichment of GFP-APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>), suggesting that APC accumulates at the axon tip through interactions with both kinesin-1 and kinesin-2.</p>

<title>The kinesin-1 binding domain is required for distal axonal enrichment of the APC C-terminus</title>
<p>The C-terminus of APC, containing the MT- and EB-binding domains but lacking the kinesin-2 binding region, has been shown to be enriched at axon tips when expressed in cortical neurons from conditional APC knockout mice and in DRG neurons from wild type mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Similarly, we found that GFP-APC-C accumulated at axonal tips when expressed in rat hippocampal neurons; strikingly, however, GFP-APC-CΔK did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). These data demonstrate that an interaction with EB1 is not sufficient to concentrate APC-C at axon tips, since GFP-APC-CΔK could still bind and colocalise with EB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), and suggest that the interaction with kinesin-1 is required for axon tip accumulation of APC-C. Since the APC N-terminus was observed to accumulate at axon tips<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, it would appear that APC fragments can be efficiently transported along axons by individual kinesins whereas full length APC requires the combined activity of both kinesin-2 and kinesin-1 through interactions at the N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>APC is a central player in cell polarisation and axon growth through its interactions with the cytoskeleton<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In non-neuronal cells APC is known to accumulate peripherally through the action of kinesin-2 MT motor proteins and EB +TIPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Here we have shown that kinesin-1 heavy chains bind directly to the C-terminus of APC, between the MT- and EB-binding regions, and that through this interaction kinesin-1 functions alongside heterotrimeric kinesin-2 to localise GFP-APC distally in fibroblasts and neurons.</p>
<p>Characterisation of kinesin-1 as a novel binding partner of APC has implications for the tumour suppressor activity of APC, since the interaction occurs through the C-terminal region that is lost after tumourigenic truncating mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Reductions in β-catenin destruction complex efficiency, the loss of MT association and ablation of EB1 binding after APC truncation have all been linked with gut epithelium transformation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. We have shown that deletion of the kinesin-1 binding region attenuates the peripheral localisation of APC in fibroblasts. This interaction could also function to regulate APC localisation in epithelia, perhaps contributing to the polarisation and regeneration pathways which become disrupted after APC truncation. Concomitant roles for kinesins-1, -2, and EB1 are suggestive of tight controls on APC distribution, perhaps enabling differential localisation of distinct APC complexes through interactions at either the N- (kinesin-2) or C-terminus (kinesin-1, EB1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p>
<p>In neurons, APC functions in axon specification, growth and dynamics, and is distally localised to the axon tip by a previously poorly understood mechanism. Kinesin-1 is a crucial motor in axonal cargo delivery, functioning in bulk trafficking of axonal material through both fast membrane transport and slow cytoplasmic protein transport<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Our finding that APC lacking the kinesin-1 binding region fails to accumulate at the axon tip in rat hippocampal neurons strongly implicates direct binding to kinesin-1 motor subunits as a requirement for axon tip accumulation. Similar direct coupling to KIF5 chains has been observed for a number of axonal and dendritic cargo molecules, such as the multi-receptor adaptor GRIP1, the mitochondrial adaptors syntaphilin and Milton/TRAK, and the synaptic vesicle adaptor syntabulin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>. Interestingly, APC has recently been implicated in mitochondrial positioning, and is proposed to be recruited to mitochondria via an interaction between its C-terminal domain and the Milton/Miro complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>. This interaction is likely mediated by KIF5, since it binds directly to both APC (this work) and Milton<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, both kinesin-1 and kinesin-2 activity is required for neuronal APC localisation, since APC axon tip accumulation was also disrupted by expression of DN fragments of the KAP3 subunit of heterotrimeric kinesin-2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). Overexpression of the DN APC-binding fragment of KAP3 may also have blocked other known interactors with the APC N-terminal armadillo region, which could have contributed to the localisation phenotype observed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>. The requirement of N-terminal interactions for proper localisation further suggests that APC trafficking is tightly controlled, while the activity of two kinesins in this process sets APC apart from other axonal cargos. The major difference for cargo transport between most non-neuronal cells and a neuronal axon is the distance that needs to be travelled, which could be up to a metre. Axonal transport therefore has to be tightly regulated but also capable of adapting to the changing axonal environment to overcome roadblocks.</p>
<p>The two kinesins could be required for distinct stages in APC axonal trafficking. For example, an increased proportion of GTP-tubulin and detyrosinated MTs in the axon initial segment and axon shaft has been found to favour kinesin-1 motility, resulting in biased axonal trafficking of kinesin-1 cargo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>. Moreover, dynamic, tyrosinated MTs, which are the preferred substrate of kinesin-2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>), are enriched at axon tips<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>. Indeed, the heterotrimeric kinesin-2 subunit KIF3C has recently been characterised as an axon tip-localised kinesin, preferentially associating with tyrosinated microtubules and functioning with EB proteins to regulate axon growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref>. One possibility is that coupling to kinesin-1 provides efficient transport of APC through the axon initial segment and along the axon shaft before handing over to kinesin-2 and EB proteins for enrichment at the axon tip. Arguing against this simple model is the observation that both the N- and C-terminal fragments of APC accumulate in the distal axon (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>; this study), despite interacting with only kinesin-2 or kinesin-1, respectively. This raises the possibility that non-sequential interactions with kinesins-1 and -2 are required for targeting APC to the axon tip. However, it is also conceivable that only full length APC requires the hand-over from kinesin-1 to kinesin-2. There is also potential for kinesin-specific roles in transporting distinct APC complexes in neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p>
<p>Our finding that specific disruption of kinesin-1 binding to APC leads to decreased axon growth highlights the importance of proper localisation of APC to neuronal development. These results are consistent with experiments using DN APC constructs which demonstrate that APC and its binding partners play roles in axon specification and growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. APC may not be absolutely required for these processes, however, since knock out experiments in Drosophila and mouse yielded polarised neurons with wild type-like axon length<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>, although the mouse neurons exhibited highly disorganised MTs and actin in oversized, often split, growth cones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Interestingly, we did not observe any growth cone phenotypes in neurons expressing GFP-APCΔK (data not shown). Sequestration of binding partners by APC DN constructs has been proposed to underlie the difference in outcomes between knock out and DN experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>. The GFP-APCΔK mutant analysed here could therefore be having DN effects, disrupting interactions between APC and its binding partners leading to shorter axons.</p>
<p>To understand the complex function and pathology of APC in neuronal and other tissues we need to understand fully the interplay between APC and its many interactors. The finding that the APC protein uses two distinct processive kinesins for its enrichment in the distal axon provides new insight into how the specific distribution of APC complexes is achieved.</p>

<title>KIF5 kinesin-1 heavy chains directly bind the C-terminus of APC.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Bacterially expressed GST-tagged kinesin-1 constructs were incubated with MRC-5 cell lysate, pulled down with glutathione beads and immunoblotted with anti-APC. (<bold>b</bold>) GST-tagged kinesin-1, kinesin-2 or EB1 proteins were incubated with DLD-1 cell lysate or with transfected HeLaM cell lysate and pulled down using glutathione beads. HeLaM cells were transfected with APC mid region fragments (GFP-APC-M1 or GFP-APC-M2) or APC C-terminus (GFP-APC-C). Pull downs from DLD-1 lysate were immunoblotted using anti-APC and pull downs from transfected HeLaM lysates were immunoblotted with anti-GFP.

<title>Kinesin-1 contributes to the localisation of full length APC in MRC-5 fibroblasts through an interaction with the APC C-terminus.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>,<bold>b</bold>) MRC-5 cells transfected with full length GFP-tagged APC with (<bold>a</bold>: GFP-APC) or without (<bold>b</bold>: GFP-APCΔK) the KIF5 binding region were labelled with anti-tyrosinated-α-tubulin (cyan) and anti-EB1 (red). The low and high magnification views are from different cells. GFP-APC and GFP-APCΔK both localise to distinct peripheral regions (arrows), forming clusters and aligning with MTs and EB1. Scale bars 10 μm. (<bold>c</bold>) MRC-5 cells were transfected with siRNAs targeted to KIF5B, KAP3 and EB1, or a control siRNA, and incubated for 72 hours. Lysates were prepared and immunoblotted with KHC, KAP3, and EB1 antibodies, alongside anti-α-tubulin as a loading control. (<bold>d</bold>,<bold>e</bold>) MRC-5 cells were transfected with siRNAs, incubated for 48 hours before cotransfection with GFP-APC or GFP-APCΔK, and either empty myc vector or KIF5C-myc/his, then incubated for a further 24 hours. Immunostaining using anti-GFP was performed and the number of cells with peripherally localised GFP-APC or GFP-APCΔK was scored. Means +/− SEM from 3 independent experiments, n = 150 cells scored per condition. Not significant (NS), *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01. Significance was determined by two-way ANOVA for comparison of control siRNA with targeted siRNA treatments, both cotransfected with GFP-APC constructs and empty myc vector. Independent sample t-tests were used for pairwise comparison of empty myc vector with KIF5C-myc/his transfectants for each siRNA condition. In addition, an independent sample t-test demonstrated p &lt; 0.05 significance between control siRNA-treated cells expressing empty myc vector together with GFP-APC (<bold>d</bold>) vs. GFP-APCΔK (<bold>e</bold>). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Fig. 3</xref> for example images of cells where GFP-APC and GFP-APCΔK were not peripherally localised.</p>
