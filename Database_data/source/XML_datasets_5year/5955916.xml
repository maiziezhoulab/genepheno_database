<p id="Par1">Oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system (CNS), undergo morphological differentiation characterized by elaborated branched processes to enwrap neuronal axons. However, the basic molecular mechanisms underlying oligodendrocyte morphogenesis remain unknown. Herein, we describe the essential roles of Nuclear Distribution E Homolog 1 (NDE1), a dynein cofactor, in oligodendrocyte morphological differentiation. In the mouse corpus callosum, <italic>Nde1</italic> mRNA expression was detected in oligodendrocyte lineage cells at the postnatal stage. <italic>In vitro</italic> analysis revealed that downregulation of NDE1 by siRNA impaired the outgrowth and extensive branching of oligodendrocyte processes and led to a decrease in the expression of myelin-related markers, namely, CNPase and MBP. In myelinating co-cultures with dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, NDE1-knockdown oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) failed to develop into MBP-positive oligodendrocytes with multiple processes contacting DRG axons. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that NDE1 interacts with the dynein intermediate chain (DIC) in oligodendrocytes, and an overexpressed DIC-binding region of NDE1 exerted effects on oligodendrocyte morphogenesis that were similar to those following NDE1 knockdown. Furthermore, NDE1-knockdown-impaired oligodendrocyte process formation was rescued by siRNA-resistant wild-type NDE1 but not by DIC-binding region-deficient NDE1 overexpression. These results suggest that NDE1 plays a crucial role in oligodendrocyte morphological differentiation via interaction with dynein.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Oligodendrocytes produce and maintain the myelin sheath that insulates and supports neuronal axons. Axon myelination is essential for the efficient and speedy conduction of action potentials in the CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">Developmentally, oligodendrocytes arise from OPCs, which are generated from the ventricular zones of the brain and spinal cord during embryonic stages and after birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Subsequently, OPCs migrate a long distance throughout the CNS and then transform from pre-oligodendrocytes to immature oligodendrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. They extend multiple membrane processes that enwrap neuronal axons to form myelin sheaths and differentiate into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. These processes require dynamic organization of the cytoskeleton and active transport of myelin components. The oligodendrocyte processes are filled with the microtubule cytoskeleton, which serves as a track for the intracellular transport of organelles, mRNAs, and proteins to specific subcellular compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Myelin basic protein (<italic>Mbp</italic>) mRNA is transported as RNA granules along microtubules to the peripheral oligodendrocyte processes and then translated locally in the developing myelin sheaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. As in neurons, the microtubule motor proteins dynein and kinesin could contribute to oligodendrocyte morphogenesis by targeting and localizing cargo in oligodendrocytes. A mutation of zebrafish <italic>kif1b</italic>, which encodes kinesin, impairs <italic>mbp</italic> mRNA transport and causes ectopic localization of myelin proteins, leading to myelination defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. A mutation of zebrafish <italic>dync1h1</italic>, which encodes the heavy chain subunit of cytoplasm dynein, also causes myelination defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">We have previously reported that disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) and DISC1-binding zinc-finger protein (DBZ) are expressed postnatally in oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the corpus callosum, where they regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. <italic>DISC1</italic> is a gene disrupted by a (1;11) (q42.1;q14.3) translocation that has been found to segregate with major psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BP), and major depression (MDD) in a Scottish family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">In this study, to gain more insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, we focused on one of the dynein cofactors, Nuclear Distribution E Homolog 1 (NDE1, also known as NudE). NDE1 is a coiled-coil protein that binds to DISC1 and DBZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. It is required for a wide range of cellular processes in neuronal development by modulating dynein function in cooperation with LIS1, another key dynein regulator. These processes include proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, neuronal migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, dendrite arborization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, and trafficking and localization of cargoes, such as organelles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Previously, Fancy <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that microarray analysis reveals <italic>Nde1</italic> downregulation in the spinal cord of myelination-deficient (Olig2-Cre) × (Floxed dominant-active β-catenin) mice, in which expression of <italic>Mbp</italic>, <italic>Plp</italic>, <italic>Cnp</italic>, and <italic>Mag</italic> are also reduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. These studies raise the possibility that NDE1 plays an important role in oligodendrocyte development. However, NDE1 expression in oligodendrocyte lineage cells and its potential role in oligodendrocyte development remain unknown.</p>
<p id="Par6">We addressed these issues and report for the first time that NDE1 is expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the mouse corpus callosum at the postnatal stage and that NDE1 is involved in oligodendrocyte morphological differentiation via interaction with dynein.</p>

<title><italic>Nde1</italic> is expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the corpus callosum at the postnatal stage</title>
<p id="Par7">Previous studies have reported that <italic>Nde1</italic> is expressed predominantly in proliferating neuronal progenitors and migrating neurons during mouse embryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Despite its functional significance in neuronal development, NDE1 expression and its potential role in oligodendrocyte lineage cells remain poorly understood. To examine if NDE1 is expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells, we performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) analysis of mouse brains using digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probes for <italic>Nde1</italic>. During development, myelination in the corpus callosum of mice begins at the first postnatal week and peaks postnatally 3–4 weeks after birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of <italic>Nde1</italic> mRNA in mouse brains during postnatal development and compared it with adult mice. At postnatal day 1 (P1), ISH analysis revealed that <italic>Nde1</italic>-positive cells were detected in the cortical ventricular zone and corpus callosum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). At P14, when myelin formation is active, <italic>Nde1</italic>-positive cells were enriched in the corpus callosum, and they were also detected in the subventricular zone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). On the other hand, cells expressing <italic>Nde1</italic> mRNA in the corpus callosum was hardly detected in adult mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>Nde1</italic> is expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the mouse carpus callosum.

<p id="Par8">To confirm whether the cells expressing <italic>Nde1</italic> mRNA in the corpus callosum at P14 were oligodendrocyte lineage cells, we performed ISH combined with immunohistochemical analysis using the antibody for Olig2, an oligodendrocyte lineage cell marker. Most Olig2-immunopositive cells in the corpus callosum expressed <italic>Nde1</italic> mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b,e</xref>). To further define the identity of <italic>Nde1</italic> mRNA-expressing cells in the oligodendrocyte developmental stage, <italic>Nde1</italic> mRNA-positive cells were co-labeled with the marker for OPCs or oligodendrocytes, PDGFRα or CC1, respectively. At P14, most <italic>Nde1</italic> mRNA-positive cells expressed CC1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c,f</xref>), whereas a subset of them expressed PDGFRα (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d,g</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par9">To examine NDE1 protein expression in the developmental stage, we performed western blot analyses of the corpus callosum at P1 and P14 and of adult mice using antibodies for NDE1 and MBP. Similar to mRNA expression, NDE1 protein expression was detected at P1 and peaked at P14, but it was downregulated in adults (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h,i</xref>). In contrast, MBP protein expression was hardly detected at P1 and thereafter increased until adulthood (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h,j</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par10">These results indicate that <italic>Nde1</italic> is expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the corpus callosum at the postnatal stage when oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination are active, suggesting a regulatory role for NDE1 in oligodendrocyte differentiation and/or myelin formation.</p>

<p id="Par11">We explored the regulatory role of NDE1 in oligodendrocyte differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> assays using FBD-102b cells derived from fetal brains of P53-deficient mice as OPCs model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. It has been reported that FBD-102b cells are induced to differentiate into oligodendrocytes with highly branched multipolar processes by reducing serum levels in the culture media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Thus, we examined the expression of NDE1 and the oligodendrocyte marker CNPase protein during the <italic>in vitro</italic> FBD-102b cell morphological differentiation process. CNPase protein expression was increased time dependently after induction of differentiation, indicating the progression of differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a,c</xref>). NDE1 protein expression gradually increased in a time-dependent fashion after the induction of differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a,b</xref>). These results indicate that NDE1 expression is abundant in the late stage of oligodendrocyte differentiation.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>NDE1 is necessary for the morphological differentiation of FBD-102b cells.

<p id="Par12">A previous study indicated that the loss of <italic>Drosophila</italic> NudE function results in abnormal dendrite arborization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. To evaluate the role of endogenous NDE1 in the morphological differentiation of FBD-102b cells, cells were transfected with siRNA targeting <italic>Nde1</italic> mRNA (NDE1-si) or control siRNA (cont-si) and differentiated. At 48 h after transfection, <italic>Nde1</italic> mRNA expression was significantly reduced in NDE1-si–transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). Furthermore, NDE1 protein expression was significantly decreased in NDE1-si–transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). These results confirm the effective targeting of <italic>Nde1</italic> mRNA by siRNA. To quantitatively evaluate the effect of NDE1 downregulation on cell morphology, cells were co-transfected with siRNA and GFP expression vectors. At 48 h after induction of differentiation, immunostaining analysis revealed that cont-si–treated cells displayed differentiated morphology with multiple primary and extensive secondary processes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>), whereas NDE1-si–treated cells showed an immature morphology with simple processes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>). Knockdown of NDE1 reduced the number of processes in cells transfected with NDE1-si (5.5 ± 0.24) compared with those transfected with cont-si (9.1 ± 0.16) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed that NDE1 knockdown resulted in a decrease in the protein expression of CNPase, which is required for process formation by binding to tubulin heterodimers and driving microtubule assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2h</xref>). These results suggest that NDE1 is required for process formation during the differentiation process of FBD-102b cells.</p>
<p id="Par13">We next examined the effect of endogenous NDE1 knockdown on the complexity of the processes using primary cultured oligodendrocytes. OPCs were isolated from the postnatal rat cortex and induced to differentiate by withdrawing PDGF from the culture media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. During oligodendrocyte differentiation, bipolar OPCs undergo dynamic morphological changes to pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes with highly branched processes.</p>
<p id="Par14">To examine the effect of NDE1 knockdown on the morphological differentiation of primary cultured oligodendrocytes, OPCs were co-transfected with siRNA and GFP expression vectors. At 48 h after induction of differentiation, <italic>Nde1</italic> mRNA and protein expression was significantly reduced in NDE1-si–treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a,b</xref>). Control cells (co-transfected with cont-si and GFP) exhibited an elaborate morphology with highly branched thick primary and thinner secondary processes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>). On the other hand, NDE1 knockdown cells (co-transfected with NDE1-si and GFP) displayed less complex morphology with simple and shorter processes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>). The morphological complexity of oligodendrocyte processes was quantified by Sholl analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). NDE1 knockdown cells developed fewer and shorter branches, producing a less elaborate network of processes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>). At 96–120 h after induction of differentiation, control cells developed membranous sheets and expressed CNPase and MBP protein in the soma and peripheral processes, while NDE1 knockdown cells rarely extended elaborated structures and expressed low levels of these proteins in the soma (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3f,g</xref>). Western blot analysis also confirmed the decrease in CNPase and MBP protein expression by NDE1 knockdown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3h,i</xref>). These results indicate that knockdown of NDE1 impairs the outgrowth and extensive branching of oligodendrocyte processes and leads to a decrease in the protein expression of CNPase and MBP in primary cultured oligodendrocytes, suggesting that NDE1 is necessary for sequential and morphological differentiation of oligodendrocytes.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Downregulation of NDE1 impairs process formation in primary cultured oligodendrocytes.

<title>Knockdown of NDE1 impairs oligodendrocyte myelination in co-cultures of oligodendrocytes and DRG neurons</title>
<p id="Par15">We next examined the effect of NDE1 knockdown on axon–oligodendrocyte interaction and myelination using cocultures of oligodendrocytes and DRG neurons. To monitor cell morphology, OPCs were co-transfected with siRNA and GFP expression vectors by nucleofection. These transfected OPCs were added to DRG neurons for 10 days. The DRG axonal processes were labeled with the high-molecular-weight neurofilament protein NF-H, and oligodendrocytes were co-labeled with GFP and MBP. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>, over 25% of control cells (co-transfected with cont-si and GFP) exhibited multipolar morphology with elaborated processes and expressed high levels of MBP, which indicated that these cells had differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). It was demonstrated that these cells had wrapped their processes around NF-positive DRG axons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>, inset). In contrast, most NDE1 knockdown cells (co-transfected with NDE1-si and GFP) displayed immature morphology with poor and thin processes and expressed low levels of MBP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). These processes touched and elongated along the DRG axons, but failed to form myelin sheaths (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>).

<title>Overexpression of DIC-binding region of NDE1 impairs process formation in oligodendrocytes</title>
<p id="Par18">To evaluate the physiological role of the NDE1–dynein interaction during oligodendrocyte differentiation, we first confirmed the interaction of the DIC-binding domain of NDE1 with DIC in mammalian cells. A previous study using a pull-down assay has revealed that NDE1 interacts with DIC via the N-terminal region of the coiled-coil domain of NDE1 (amino acids 7–99) in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). Thus, we further constructed GFP-tagged mouse NDE1 expression vectors of the N-terminal region (NDE1 Nt, amino acids 1–182), C-terminal region (NDE1 Ct, amino acids 176–344), and DIC-binding region (NDE1 BR, amino acids 1–100), and performed coimmunoprecipitation analysis using HEK293T cells that were co-transfected with HA-tagged DIC and GFP-tagged full-length wild-type NDE1 (NDE1 WT) or GFP-tagged NDE1 deletion mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). We found that the NDE1 WT, NDE1 Nt, and NDE1 BR retain the ability to co-precipitate with DIC, whereas NDE1 Ct cannot bind DIC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>). In agreement with previous reports, these results suggest that the NDE1 BR region is essential for interaction with DIC. This domain is expected to function as a dominant-negative form of NDE1 through the inhibition of binding between NDE1 and DIC in mammalian cells.</p>
<p id="Par19">To examine the effect of the inhibition of the NDE1–dynein interaction on process formation in primary cultured oligodendrocytes, cells were transiently transfected with GFP-NDE1 BR or GFP.

On the other hand, the cells expressing GFP-NDE1 BR showed less complex and differentiated morphology with thinner and shorter processes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). Sholl analysis revealed significant differences in process complexity between cells expressing GFP-NDE1 BR and cells expressing GFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>).

<p id="Par24">The major findings of this study were as follows: (1) <italic>Nde1</italic> mRNA is expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the corpus callosum at the postnatal stage; (2) NDE1 downregulation impairs process formation in oligodendrocytes, and results in the failure of neuron–oligodendrocyte contact formation and myelination; (3) NDE1 interacts with the DIC of cytoplasmic dynein in oligodendrocytes; (4) overexpression of a DIC-binding region of NDE1 (NDE1 BR) in oligodendrocytes inhibits process formation and myelination; and (5) impaired oligodendrocyte process formation is rescued with siRNA-resistant wild-type NDE1 (NDE1<sup>SR</sup>), but not with DIC-binding region-deficient NDE1 (NDE1ΔBR) overexpression in NDE1-downregulated oligodendrocytes. Taken together, our data indicate that NDE1 plays a crucial role in process formation and myelination by binding to dynein in oligodendrocytes.</p>
<p id="Par25">Previous studies have reported that <italic>Nde1</italic> is primarily expressed in the neural progenitors of the cortical ventricular zone and newly formed cortical plate neurons during embryogenesis and is dramatically downregulated in the perinatal period when the cortical neurogenesis is completed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. More recently, analysis of data from the Human Brain Transcriptome project revealed that <italic>Nde1</italic> expression is dramatically decreased at birth but is slightly upregulated in some brain regions after birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In this study, we first show that <italic>Nde1</italic> mRNA is expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the corpus callosum of mice at the early postnatal stage when oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation are active, and that the expression is downregulated at adulthood. These results suggest that NDE1 has a developmental role in oligodendrocyte lineage cells.</p>
<p id="Par26">Our <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis reveals that NDE1 downregulation by siRNA impaired the outgrowth and extensive branching of oligodendrocyte processes. NDE1 is a known dynein cofactor that regulates dynein activity by recruiting LIS1 to dynein. Together, they form a triple complex, inducing a force-state and promoting the movement of dynein along the microtubules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Dynein is essential for proper morphogenesis, acting on well-characterized minus-end-directed transport of cargoes such as mRNA, proteins, and organelles from distal tips of processes to the cell soma. Dynein is also involved in the modulation of microtubule dynamics at the cell cortex by stabilization of microtubule plus ends and tethering them to the cell periphery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Dynein could function similarly in oligodendrocytes and contribute to the proper oligodendrocyte morphogenesis. In cultured mouse oligodendrocytes, cytoplasmic dynein is localized in the cell body and along microtubules in the peripheral processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. A recent study has reported that mutation of zebrafish cytoplasm dynein causes a defect in myelination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. These studies suggest the possibility that dynein plays a pivotal role in oligodendrocyte morphogenesis. Combined with these studies, our data indicate that impaired process formation by NDE1 downregulation in oligodendrocytes could be attributed to dysregulation of dynein motor functions. A previous report has shown that Drosophila NudE plays an important role in neuronal morphogenesis by regulating dynein activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, suggesting the possibility that NDE1 has common functional roles between neurons and oligodendrocyte lineage cells. This study has shown that Drosophila NudE associates with Golgi outposts, which shape dendrite morphology by functioning as sites of acentrosomal microtubule nucleation in neurons, and that loss of the Drosophila NudE gene affects the transport of Golgi outposts, resulting in abnormal dendrite arborization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In mammals, NDE1 is reported to be involved in dynein-dependent Golgi organization and localization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Interestingly, a previous study has reported that the Golgi complex resides not only in the perikaryon but also in the processes in primary cultures of rat oligodendrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. As in neurons, the dynein–NDE1 complex in oligodendrocytes could function in the targeting and localization of the Golgi complex in peripheral processes. However, it remains unknown whether Golgi outposts could be present in branching points of peripheral processes in the oligodendrocytes, and represent a source for acentrosomal microtubule nucleation. Additional information about the molecular mechanisms underlying oligodendrocyte morphological differentiation must be obtained.</p>
<p id="Par27">Consistent with previous studies, our data show that the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of NDE1, residues 1–100, is sufficient to interact with DIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our data reveal that NDE1 interacts with DIC in the oligodendrocyte lineage cells, and overexpression of NDE1 BR inhibits oligodendrocyte morphological differentiation, potentially acting as a dominant negative form of NDE1 through inhibition of the binding between full-length NDE1 and DIC. However, NDE1 is reported to interact with the coiled-coil N-terminus of DIC and compete with dynactin, which is an essential cofactor of the cytoplasmic dynein, for a common binding region of DIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. A recent study has reported that mutation of zebrafish <italic>actr10</italic>, which encodes the Arp11 subunit of dynactin, causes hypomyelination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Although it remains unclear whether NDE1 could compete with dynactin for binding to DIC in oligodendrocyte lineage cells, we could not exclude the possibility that impaired oligodendrocyte morphogenesis by the NDE1 BR expression could be partially attributed to the inhibition of dynactin-DIC interaction. Additionally, our study demonstrates that impaired oligodendrocyte morphological differentiation by siRNA was rescued by NDE1<sup>SR</sup> but not by NDE1ΔBR overexpression. These results support the conclusion that the interaction between the N-terminal site on NDE1 and DIC is essential for oligodendrocyte morphological differentiation. NDE1 is reported to function as a molecular tether that facilitates the interaction between dynein and LIS1 in dendrite morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. To further determine the role of NDE1-dynein on oligodendrocyte development, it is important to examine the expression and function of other dynein cofactors in oligodendrocytes.</p>

<p id="Par34">Primary rat oligodendrocyte cultures were performed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Mix glial lineage cells were mechanically removed by shaking culture flasks at 200 rpm for 20 h, and OPCs were collected by plating the cells on a non-coated dish to remove astrocytes and microglia. For the transfection, nucleofection was performed using the Basic Nucleofector™ Kits for Primary Mammalian Glial Cells (Lonza) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> OPCs were resuspended in 100 μL Nucleofector™ solution per sample, and transfected with 0.5 µg expression vector and/or 1 µM siRNA using Nucleofector™ program A-33. Following transfection, cells were suspended in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and F-12 medium containing 10% FBS and plated on four-well plates containing coverslips coated with PLL. Four hours after transfection, transfected OPCs were differentiated by replacing all of the media with Neurobasal differentiation medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (Sigma), 5 ng/mL insulin (Sigma), 5 ng/mL NT3 (Pepro Tech Inc.), 15 nM triiodothyronine (Sigma), 10 ng/mL ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) (Pepro Tech Inc.), and 5 µg/mL <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<sc>l</sc>-cysteine (Sigma).</p>

<title>Co-cultures of oligodendrocytes and DRG neurons</title>
<p id="Par35">Primary rat oligodendrocytes and mouse DRG neuron co-cultures were prepared as described previously with some modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In brief, embryonic DRG neurons were obtained from E13.5 mice and dissociated with 0.25% trypsin for 45 min at 37 °C. The dissociated cells were seeded in four-well plates containing coverslips coated with PLL and growth factor-reduced matrigel (BD) at a density of 4 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in Neurobasal medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 2% B27, 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 4 g/L <sc>d</sc>-glucose, and 50 ng/mL nerve growth factor (NGF) (Millipore). The DRG neurons were then cultured for 28 days, and half of the medium was replaced with supplemented Neurobasal medium every other day. To remove dividing cells, such as fibroblasts, the medium was replaced with supplemented Neurobasal medium containing 10 µM fluorodeoxyuridine (Sigma) on days 2 and 6 after seeding. After 28 days, transfected OPCs were added to DRG neurons. Four hours after seeding, co-cultures were differentiated by replacing all the media with co-culture medium (1:1 DMEM/F-12 and Neurobasal media supplemented with 1% N2, 2% B27, 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 10 ng/ml biotin, and 15 nM triiodothyronine).</p>

<sec id="Sec19">
<title>Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction</title>
<p id="Par36">Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed by real-time PCR to evaluate the expression of NDE1 and GAPDH. For the rat genes, the following sets of forward/reverse primers were used: NDE1, 5′- CAGCATTCAGAGGGTTACCG-3′/5′-TCCAGGGACATGATTGTGGC-3′; and GAPDH, 5′-GCCTTCTCTTGTGACAAAGTGG-3′/5′-ATTCTCAGCCTTGACTGTGCC-3′. For the mouse genes, the following sets of forward/reverse primers were used: NDE1, 5′- CAGCACTCAGAGGGTTACCG-3′/5′-TCCAGGGACATGATTGTGGC-3′; and GAPDH, 5′-GTGTTCCTACCCCCAATGTG-3′/5′-AGGAGACAACCTGGTCCTCA-3′. GAPDH was used as an internal normalization control. Real-time PCR was set up using the THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo). Specific ratio comparisons (gene of interest/GAPDH) were used to assess differences in transcript expression between groups.</p>

<title>Western blot analyses</title>
<p id="Par37">Western blot analysis was performed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Immunoreactivity was detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL prime kit (GE Healthcare). Densitometric quantification was performed using ImageJ software (National Institute of Health) with GAPDH as a loading control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec21">
<title>Immunoprecipitation</title>
<p id="Par38">HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-DIC and GFP-NDE1 WT or GFP-tagged truncated forms of NDE1 individually or in combination. Cells were lysed in TNE buffer/1% NP40 in the presence of protease inhibitors (Roche). Prepared lysates were incubated with an anti-HA antibody overnight at 4 °C and then with rProtein G agarose (GE Healthcare) for 6 h at 4 °C. Agarose beads were then washed five times with TNE buffer. Immunoprecipitates by anti-HA antibody were subjected to western blot analysis using anti-GFP antibody.</p>

<title>RNA <bold><italic>in situ</italic></bold> hybridization</title>
<p id="Par40">Murine NDE1 cDNA fragments used as templates for probe synthesis were amplified by PCR using the following forward/reverse primers 5′-ATGGAGGACTCGGGAAAGACCTTTG-3′/5′-GGGCGCAGTTCTCATTGGTCCTAAA-3′. NDE1 cDNA subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) was linearized by restriction enzymes (NdeI or NcoI). DIG-labeled cRNA probes for NDE1 were generated by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription using the cDNA fragment as a template in the presence of DIG-labeled dUTP (Roche). Hybridization procedures were performed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The probe signals of NDE1 were amplified by the TSA-biotin system (PerkinElmer) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and detected using streptavidin–alkaline phosphatase (PerkinElmer) and nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT)/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (BCIP).</p>

<sec id="Sec24">
<title><bold><italic>In situ</italic></bold> hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry</title>
<p id="Par41">For <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis, sections were processed first for ISH and then immunohistochemistry as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. To co-label with Olig2, the probe signals of NDE1 were amplified by TSA Plus DNP system, and detected using Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-DNP antibody. Anti-Olig2 antibody was detected using Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. To co-label with CC1 or PDGFRα, the probe signals of NDE1 were amplified using the TSA-biotin system and detected using streptavidin–alkaline phosphatase (PerkinElmer) and a 2-hydroxy-3-naphthoic acid-2′-phenylanilide phosphate Fluorescent Detection Set (Roche Diagnostics). Antibodies against CC1 and PDGFRα were detected using Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit IgG.</p>
