<title>SUMMARY</title>
<p id="P3">Silencing of <bold>FMR1</bold> and loss of its gene product, <bold>FMRP</bold>, results in fragile X syndrome (FXS). FMRP binds brain m<bold>RNA</bold>s and inhibits polypeptide elongation. Using ribosome profiling of the hippocampus, we find that ribosome footprint levels in <bold><italic>Fmr1</italic></bold>-deficient tissue mostly reflect changes in <bold>RNA</bold> abundance. Profiling over a time course of ribosome runoff in wild-type tissue reveals a wide range of ribosome translocation rates; on many m<bold>RNA</bold>s, the ribosomes are stalled. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of hippocampal slices after ribosome runoff reveals that <bold>FMRP</bold> co-sediments with stalled ribosomes, and its loss results in decline of ribosome stalling on specific m<bold>RNA</bold>s. One such m<bold>RNA</bold> encodes <bold>SETD2</bold>, a lysine methyltransferase that catalyzes H3K36me3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) demonstrates that loss of <bold>FMRP</bold> alters the deployment of this histone mark. H3K36me3 is associated with alternative pre<bold>-RNA</bold> processing, which we find occurs in an <bold>FMRP</bold>-dependent manner on transcripts linked to neural function and autism spectrum disorders.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="P6">Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delays, social impairment, and other maladies. The cause of FXS is an iteration of ~200 or more CGG triplets in <italic>FMR1</italic> that induces DNA methylation and transcriptional inactivation. Loss of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene product FMRP results in synaptic dysfunction and aberrant circuit formation, which produces neuro-pathological conditions during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Santoro et al., 2012</xref>). FXS is modeled in <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) mice, which mimic many facets of the human disease, including learning and memory deficits, repetitive disorders, and susceptibility to seizures. In these animals, neuronal communication is frequently examined at hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, which exhibit exaggerated metabotropic glutamate-receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Huber et al., 2002</xref>). This form of synaptic plasticity normally requires protein synthesis, but in <italic>Fmr1</italic>-deficient animals, protein synthesis is both unnecessary for mGluR-LTD and excessive in neurons, which contributes to aberrant circuit formation and other hallmarks of the syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Waung and Huber, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">FMRP is an RNA-binding protein present in most cells; in neurons, its localization at postsynaptic sites is thought to control activity-dependent synapse remodeling by regulating mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Richter et al., 2015</xref>). Considerable effort has been made to identify FMRP target mRNAs, but the most rigorous involves <italic>in vivo</italic> crosslink and immunoprecipitation (CLIP). CLIP combined with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has identified 842 target mRNAs in the post-natal day 11 (P11)–P25 mouse cortex and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>); predominantly a single mRNA in cultured cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Tabet et al., 2016</xref>); 1,610 RNAs in the P13 cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Maurin et al., 2018</xref>); and ~6,000 RNAs in HEK cells expressing epitope-tagged FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>). This diversity of FMRP CLIP targets could reflect the different procedures employed or the different brain cell types examined. Surprisingly, the majority of CLIP sites in mRNA are in coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Maurin et al., 2018</xref>), with a bias to some <italic>cis</italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Maurin et al., 2018</xref>). FMRP association with mRNA coding regions and co-sedimentation with polyribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Khandjian et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Feng et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Stefani et al., 2004</xref>) suggests it normally inhibits translation by impeding ribosome translocation. Indeed, studies that examined polypeptide elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Udagawa et al., 2013</xref>) or susceptibility to puromycin release of nascent polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>) indicate that FMRP regulates ribosome transit. Supporting evidence comes from studies showing that <italic>Drosophila</italic> FMRP interacts with ribosomal protein L5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Ishizuka et al., 2002</xref>), which may preclude tRNA or elongation factors from engaging the ribosome and causing it to stall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Although these observations need to be extended to mammalian FMRP, they suggest a molecular mechanism by which FMRP stalls ribosomes. Such observations do not indicate how FMRP could stall ribosomes on specific mRNAs.</p>
<p id="P8">Ribosome profiling is a whole-transcriptome method for analyzing the number and positions of ribosomes associated with mRNA; when combined with RNA-seq, it yields heretofore unobtainable information on gene expression at high resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Ingolia, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Brar and Weissman, 2015</xref>). We used ribosome profiling to explore FMRP regulation of gene expression in mouse adult neural stems cells (aNSCs), which in FXS have a proclivity to differentiate into glia at the expense of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Luo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Guo et al., 2011</xref>). We identified mRNAs whose ribosome occupancy was either up or downregulated in FMRP-deficient cells or had altered steady-state levels reflected by their association with ribosomes. We identified yet additional mRNAs whose ribosome occupancy was “buffered” so that changes in their levels were compensated for by opposite changes in ribosome association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Liu et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">Ribosome profiling at steady state cannot distinguish between translocating and stalled ribosomes, suggesting that studies examining FMRP-regulated translation by this method or translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) and RNA-seq (TRAP-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Thomson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Liu et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Greenblatt and Spradling, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Das Sharma et al., 2019</xref>) may overlook key events leading to FXS. Moreover, if intact brain circuitry is important for FMRP regulation, then cultured neurons might not reveal important aspects of FMRP function. To circumvent these issues, we have developed a hippocampal slice assay to detect mRNA-specific ribosome translocation dynamics. Hippocampal slices maintain the <italic>in vivo</italic> synaptic connectivity and cellular architecture and express protein synthesis and FMRP-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Huber et al., 2002</xref>). Profiling over a time course of ribosome runoff in slices demonstrates a wide range of ribosome translocation rates on specific mRNAs, from rapid (rates similar to those in embryonic stem [ES] cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>) to near-complete stalling. Many mRNAs retain 4–6 ribosomes after runoff in wild-type (WT), but not in FMRP-deficient, slices. Some RNAs associated with FMRP-stalled ribosomes encode proteins involved in neurologic function and transcriptional regulation. One such RNA encodes SETD2, a methyltransferase for the chromatin mark H3K36me3. We find increased SETD2 protein in <italic>Fmr1</italic>-deficient hippocampus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) demonstrates that distribution of this mark varies in a genotype (i.e., WT versus <italic>Fmr1</italic>-deficient)-dependent manner in hippocampal tissue. In mammals, apart from blocking cryptic transcription initiation and DNA damage response, H3K36me3 is correlated with pre-mRNA processing events such as alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kolasinska-Zwierz et al., 2009</xref>). RNA-seq reveals that splicing events such as exon skipping are altered in FMRP-deficient slices and that these transcripts are linked to neural function and autism spectrum disorders. Aberrant RNA splicing of synapse related genes is prevalent in autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Quesnel-Vallières et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Smith and Sadee, 2011</xref>). Our study demonstrates that a reduction in ribosome stalling in the <italic>Fmr1</italic>-deficient brain results in a cascade of epigenetic and RNA processing changes that likely contribute to neurologic disease.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<p id="P10">Hippocampal Schafer collateral-CA1 synapses exhibit an exaggerated mGluR-LTD in <italic>Fmr1</italic>-deficient mice that is aberrantly protein-synthesis independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Nosyreva and Huber, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Huber et al., 2000</xref>). To identify mRNAs whose basal expression is misregulated, we prepared CA1-enriched hippocampal slices (400 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), performed ribosome profiling and RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), and calculated translational efficiency (TE), the ratio of ribosome footprints to RNA-seq reads. We identified RNAs with changes in TE (TE up/TE down) or RNAs whose levels were elevated or reduced but without changes in TE (mRNA up/mRNA down) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>) (nominal p value &lt; 0.01, false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.097 by permutation test). A Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the biological processes most enriched in each group shows that the mRNA-down group encodes factors that mediate taxis/chemotaxis, while the mRNA-up group encodes factors involved in ribonucleotide metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref>). The TE-down mRNAs encode factors that control synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1C</xref>). The mRNA-down group is enriched for cellular components linked to the extracellular matrix, while the mRNA-up group encodes the myelin sheath and spliceosome-interacting factors. The TE-down group is involved in the extracellular matrix and synaptic architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1C</xref>). No GO terms from the TE-up group were statistically significant.</p>
<p id="P11">Heatmaps of the top 20 mRNAs with altered up and down TEs in <italic>Fmr1-</italic>deficient slices compared to the WT are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>. Examples of the change in TEs are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>. <italic>Gfpt2</italic> (glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2) mRNA is nearly unchanged in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO but has an increase in ribosome footprints; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Conversely <italic>Lhfpl5</italic> (lipoma high-mobility group protein isoform C [HMGIC] fusion partner-like 5) mRNA has reduced numbers of ribosome footprints while RNA levels are mostly unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Neither <italic>Gfpt2</italic> nor <italic>Lhfpl5</italic> mRNAs have FMRP CLIP sites. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref> shows boxplots for all 843 FMRP CLIP RNAs (p value &lt; 0.0001, Wilcoxon test) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>). As a group, these RNAs decrease significantly in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO, which is tracked by commensurate decreases in ribosome footprints resulting in no change in TE.</p>
<p id="P12">We compared our TE-down and TE-up groups in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO hippocampus with results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Das Sharma et al. (2019)</xref>, who performed ribosome profiling on mouse frontal cortex, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Thomson et al. (2017)</xref>, who performed TRAP-seq from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Only 37 of our TE-down RNAs were detected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Das Sharma et al., 2019</xref> (~7% overlap), and only 5 were detected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Thomson et al. (2017)</xref> (~17% overlap). Even fewer of our TE-up RNAs were detected in either of those studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>) (~2% overlap). We surmise that the differences in methods and source material are likely responsible for little overlap among the studies.</p>
<p id="P13">Our data show almost all changes in ribosome footprint number in <italic>Fmr1</italic>-deficient slices can be attributed to altered RNA levels irrespective of whether the transcripts are FMRP CLIP targets. This suggests that the increase in incorporation of labeled amino acids into protein in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO hippocampal slices (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dölen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Udagawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bowling et al., 2019</xref>) is mostly due to changes in RNA levels and/or ribosome transit rate. However, TE may not necessarily reflect protein production. For example, increased initiation with no change in elongation would produce increased ribosome footprints and yield an elevated level of protein product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). If there is no change in initiation but elevated elongation, the TE will appear to be reduced but the production of protein will be increased. Consequently, ribosome profiling at steady state, which cannot distinguish between transiting and stalled ribosomes, may inadequately represent translation if there are changes in elongation. To assess whether FMRP regulates ribosome dynamics, we modified our procedure to investigate temporal changes in transcriptome-wide ribosome translocation rates.</p>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Ribosome Runoff Dynamics in Hippocampal-Cortical Slices</title>
<p id="P14">We next performed ribosomal profiling and RNA-seq in hippocampal-cortical slices at different time points after blocking initiation with homoharringtonine (HHT). HHT halts ribosomes on initiation codons but allows elongating ribosomes to continue translocating until they run off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). We aimed to determine differences in ribosome translocation rates of all expressed genes in WT tissue slices. Slices were incubated with HHT for 0–60 min and ribosome transit stopped at specific times with cycloheximide; the samples were then used for ribosome profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). A metagene analysis of the ribosome footprints on 1,401 mRNAs with open reading frames (ORFs) of &gt;3,000 nt aligned with the start and stop codons is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, indicating that the ribosomes runoff in a 5′→3′ direction. We chose mRNAs with ORFs &gt;3,000 nt to ensure that ribosome runoff was not complete within 10 min of HHT treatment and read densities could be obtained at each nucleotide position. The read densities were normalized to the average densities of the last 500 nt of the protein coding sequence (CDS) and is based on the P site of the ribosome footprints. A linear regression analysis between the HHT treatment time and ribosome runoff distances was then used to estimate a global elongation rate of 4.2 nt/s at 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). By comparison, the global elongation rate in cultured ES calls is 1.7 nt/s at 37°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">We performed a cluster analysis of all mRNAs with respect to number of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) at each time point relative to time 0. Briefly, Euclidean distance was first computed, followed by hierarchical clustering using Ward’s algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Ward, 1963</xref>), and the analysis of group similarities (ANOSIM) test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Clarke, 1993</xref>) was then used to assess whether distances between clusters were statistically greater than within clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). The mRNAs fell into two broad clusters (ANOSIM R = 0.56, p value &lt; 0.001): those whose ribosome runoff occurred relatively quickly (i.e., within 5–10 min, bottom cluster), and those whose runoff occurred slowly, if at all (top cluster). These two clusters were further grouped into three sub-clusters each for six total subclusters (ANOSIM R = 0.64, p &lt; 0.001). Subclusters 1–3 had slow runoff times, while subclusters 4–6 had relatively fast ribosome runoff times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). The ribosomes on mRNAs in subcluster 2 had the slowest runoff time. We determined the ribosome runoff patterns for the mRNAs in each subcluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). For example, mRNAs for Alcam (activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule), Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton), and Nptn (neuroplastin) are present in subcluster 1, Col11 (collectin subfamily 11) in subcluster 2, Nrxn3 (neurexin 3) in subcluster 3, and actin in subcluster 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). As examples, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref> shows the ribosome footprints of Nrxn3 and actin over time; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref> shows ribosome footprints for additional mRNAs. Although there was some CDS-length dependency of the ribosome runoff rates, the correlation was not linear (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). GO term analysis showed that specific biological activities were associated with each subcluster. Genes in subclusters 1 and 3 (slow runoff times) were associated with neural function such as axon development and synapse organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). Subcluster 2, which contained ribosomes with the slowest runoff rates, had genes encoding the extracellular matrix; subcluster 4 contained genes involved in metabolic functions; subcluster 5 was associated with mRNA processing and regulation; and subcluster 6 was associated with organelle localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). These results suggest that clusters of mRNAs with specific functions have differential ribosomal transit rates.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>FMRP Controls Ribosome Translocation on Specific mRNAs</title>
<p id="P16">To investigate whether FMRP controls ribosome stalling on specific mRNAs, we first determined whether it is present in ribosome-containing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Feng et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Khandjian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Stefani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">El Fatimy et al., 2016</xref>). Extracts from cortices were treated with nonionic detergent (NP40) in the presence or absence of RNase and sedimented through sucrose gradients. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref> shows FMRP sedimented to a “heavy” ribosome-containing region of the gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Stefani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>). These data suggest that FMRP is associated with ribosomes in heavy fractions and thus could play a role in ribosome stalling.</p>
<p id="P17">We next performed sucrose gradient analysis of slices treated with HHT for 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), which allows ribosomes on most genes to run off (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> shows that most FMRP co-sediments with polysomes as shown previously (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Feng et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Stefani et al., 2004</xref>), but after HHT treatment, it is more prevalent in “medium” gradient fractions that correspond to four to six ribosomes most likely due to association with stalled ribosomes. Other proteins (e.g., UPF1, MAP2, and eEF2) do not show a similar change in sedimentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). A small amount of FMRP remains in a heavy (&gt;7 ribosomes) region of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The same experiments were performed with <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). RNA-seq of the heavy fractions showed that 1,574 RNAs and 686 RNAs were reduced or elevated, respectively, in both genotypes, indicating a sensitivity or resistance to HHT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). <italic>Actin</italic> is one RNA that was sensitive to HHT and was depleted by ribosome runoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>), which is consistent with results from the HHT time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>). <italic>Map1b</italic> RNA, on the other hand, was enriched in the heavy polysomes by HHT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref> shows GO terms for the RNAs depleted in the heavy fractions after runoff, which include factors involved in RNA metabolism. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref> shows GO terms for RNAs enriched in the heavy polysomes after HHT treatment, which include factors involved in membrane and ion transport.</p>
<p id="P18">In contrast to the heavy polysome fractions, we found genotype-specific differences in the RNA-seq of the medium polysome fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). Forty-six RNAs were downregulated in HHT-treated <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO slices relative to WT, indicating that they are normally bound by FMRP-stalled ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Eight of these mRNAs encode chromatin and transcriptional regulators, and 23 encode proteins involved in neural function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). One is <italic>Ankrd12</italic> (ankyrin repeat domain containing 12), which is depleted in the KO slices following HHT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref> shows that after HHT treatment, <italic>Ankrd12</italic> RNA contains fewer stalled ribosomes in the medium fractions of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO slices, confirming this mRNA is under FMRP regulation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref> demonstrates that compared to all RNAs, the HHT-sensitive RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) showed significant decreases in RPFs and TEs, but not RNA levels, in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO relative to WT (ribosome profiling data of these RNAs from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>; **p &lt; 0.01; ***p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon test) showing the consistency between steady-state ribosome profiling and the dynamic ribosome runoff assay.</p>
<p id="P19">Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref> demonstrates that one of the mRNAs decreased in the medium fraction in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO slices, <italic>SETD2</italic>, shows an increase in its protein level in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO hippocampus relative to WT (p = 0.0245, two-tailed t test), which is expected if FMRP stalls ribosome translocation on this RNA. We find no statistically significant increase in SETD2 mRNA in RNA-seq data from the FMRP KO hippocampal slices (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We tested SETD2 protein in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice and found no change relative to genotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5E</xref>). This result might reflect a possible brain-specific function of FMRP or that rapidly dividing MEF cell lines do not recapitulate FMRP-dependent ribosome stalling, at least not on SETD2 mRNA. SETD2 is the main histone lysine methyltransferase that trimethylates the histone H3 tail on the lysine36(K36).</p>

<title>FMRP-Mediated Regulation of H3K36me3</title>
<p id="P20">To investigate whether altered SETD2 levels influence gene-specific changes in H3K36me3, we performed ChIP-seq from WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO hippocampus in duplicate, combining hippocampal tissue from two animals per biologic replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). All genotypic replicates were highly correlated with each other(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). H3K36me3 is a broad histone mark that is enriched primarily in the body of the gene. To measure regions with enrichment of the mark, we used the SICER v1.1 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Xu et al., 2014</xref>) that annotates ChIP signal over a stretch of DNA as “islands” (an island is defined as a cluster of non-overlapping consecutive DNA regions (200-bp windows) separated by at least a 600-bpgap region of DNA with no ChIP-enriched signal detected above threshold). Annotation of the H3K36me3 islands shows that they were primarily present within the gene body compared to promoter proximal regions, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Krogan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Tiedemann et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Metagene analysis showed there to be no genotype-specific difference in the distribution of marks overall along the gene body and no effect of gene length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4B</xref>–S4D). We further compared the differential enrichment of the H3K36me3 islands within the replicates by a negative binomial test performed using edgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) (fold change &gt;2 and p &lt; 0.05). We found 363 islands with decreased and 2,223 islands with increased H3K36me3 in the <italic>Fmr1</italic>KO compared to WT hippocampus ChIP-seq in both replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>). Examples of the changes of these marks that are genotype-dependent are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref> where H3K36me3 on <italic>Reep4</italic> (receptor expression-enhancing protein 4) is reduced but elevated on <italic>Tprkb</italic> (TP53-related protein kinase-binding protein). The decreased islands were fewer and mostly found in intragenic regions, whereas the increased islands were enriched and present in both the intragenic and intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>), demonstrating a redistribution of H3K36me3 in FXS model mice. Many of the islands, especially those that increase in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO animals, are found on genes linked to autism spectrum disorders as defined by Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). A subset of genes (37) showed both increased and decreased islands, but at different locations on the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). GO term enrichment analysis of the genes that increased H3K36me3 islands is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>. The genes with increased H3K36me3 islands are remarkably enriched for those involved in neural function such as synapse assembly and animal behavior. No significant GO terms were enriched in the group of genes with decreased H3K36me3 islands. We find no correlation between steady-state RNA abundance and H3K36me3 levels on islands in the genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4F</xref>), which could be attributed to compensatory post-transcriptional mechanisms affecting steady-state RNA. Furthermore, the methylated islands also undergo genotype-specific length changes; they are significantly longer in the WT compared to <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO (p &lt; 0.001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov [K-S] test) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4E</xref>). Our data thus show that an increase in the levels of SETD2 in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO resulting primarily in increased H3K36me3 chromatin marks at a subset of genes.</p>

<title>FMRP Regulates Alternative RNA Processing</title>
<p id="P21">H3K36me3 in mammals has been correlated with alternative pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). We analyzed our RNA-seq data from WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO hippocampal slices using the rMATS alternative splicing package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Shen et al., 2014</xref>) and detected many alternative pre-mRNA processing events including skipped exon (SE), mutually excluded exon (MXE), and alternative 5′ and 3′ splice site (A5SS and A3SS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S3</xref>; FDR &lt; 5% and p &lt; 0.05). The number of exon inclusion events are shown (differences in exon inclusion levels is calculated as percent spliced in [PSI], and a cutoff of |deltaPSI| ≥5% is used). Several of the exon-skipping events were validated by qRT-PCR, with ~20%–40% reduction in exon skipping in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). These skipped exons have previously been found to be associated with defects in brain development and disease pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">An and Grabowski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Fugier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Rockenstein et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, an increase in microexon 4 skipping in <italic>Cpeb4</italic> mRNA was found in postmortem cortical tissue from autism patients. Consequently, a mouse model of <italic>Cpeb4</italic> microexon 4 deletion recapitulated the molecular and behavioral phenotypes found in autism patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Irimia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Parras et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Quesnel-Vallières et al., 2016</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref> shows all the RNA processing events that undergo changes in <italic>Fmr1</italic>-deficient hippocampus relative to WT (p &lt; 0.05, |deltaPSI| ≥5%). Skipped exons are by far the most prevalent category, followed by alternative 3′ splice sites. The genes whose RNA processing events are altered in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO are strongly linked to neural function such as vesicle transport to synapses and vesicle recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). Moreover, many of the genes with alternative splicing events (Alt. Spl.) in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO hippocampus (Alt. Spl. <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO) are linked to autism (i.e., SFARI autism spectrum disorder database [ASD]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). In addition, the Alt. Spl. genes in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO significantly overlap with genes previously found to display alternative splicing in patients with autism (Alt. Spl. ASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Parikshak et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). We also find an overlap of genes with changes in H3K36me3 islands with those found to harbor aberrant splicing in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). We found no correlation between amount of exon skipping and RNA abundance, RPF levels or presence of FMRP CLIP tags at the gene level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S5A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5C</xref>). We next assessed the H3K36me3 levels at the skipped exons in the SE category and found a significant decrease in the H3K36me3 marks at the 5′ splice site (±50 nt) of these exons that are skipped in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO hippocampus compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>; p = 0.02 using the Wilcoxon test). Interestingly, when we increased the analysis over a region of ± 150 nt (~2 nucleosomes) we no longer found a decrease in H3K36me3 at the skipped exons in the FMRP KO animal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5D</xref>). Although at the island level, which encompasses mainly regions &gt;1 kb, we see mainly an increase in H3K36me3 levels, but at the 5′ splice site of genes (±50 nt) susceptible to alternative splicing in the FMRP KO, we see a decrease in H3K36me3 levels. Further studies are needed to understand how H3K36me3 modifications and/or other factors might play a role in regulating differential alternative splicing in the FMRP KO background. Thus, as with other autism spectrum disorders, dysregulated alternative splicing is prevalent in a mouse model of FXS and might be linked to changes in H3K36me3 levels at the splice site.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P22">We used several approaches to investigate FMRP regulation of mRNA expression in the mouse brain, focusing first on steady state ribosome profiling in hippocampal slices. <italic>Fmr1</italic> deficiency resulted in ribosome footprint levels that mostly tracked altered levels of RNA, which is consistent with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Liu et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Das Sharma et al., 2019</xref>). Because ribosome profiling at steady state cannot distinguish between static and translocating ribosomes, we modified our profiling procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>) to identify the dynamic range of ribosome translocation rates genome-wide in hippocampal slices. These studies in turn resulted in four main findings. First, they showed that mRNAs cluster into defined functional biology groups based on the transit rates of their associated ribosomes. The ribosomes on most mRNAs (&gt;5,000) transit rapidly, whereas on some mRNAs (~3,000), ribosome transit is slow or nearly not at all (~350). There is some CDS length dependency as well. Second, using a combination of ribosome runoff and sucrose gradient centrifugation, we identified ~50 mRNAs associated with FMRP-stalled ribosomes, which strongly imply translational regulation. One of these mRNAs encodes a histone lysine methyltransferase, SETD2, which is elevated in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO hippocampus. Third, the SETD2-dependent histone mark, H3K36me3, is rearranged in both intragenic and intergenic regions upon <italic>Fmr1</italic> deficiency; primarily increases in H3K36me3 are observed in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO. Fourth, because H3K36me3 has been correlated with alternative RNA processing in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), we analyzed our RNA-seq data and found widespread aberrant splicing in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO hippocampus, most prominently exon skipping/inclusion. These altered processing events often correlated with changes in the histone mark, occurred on genes that regulate pre-synaptic functions, such as synaptic vesicle recycling, and were strongly linked to autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p>
<p id="P23">Earlier studies have inferred that ribosome stalling in the brain is linked to RNA transport granules in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Krichevsky and Kosik 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Mallardo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kanai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Khandjian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Graber et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that at least some of the ribosome stalling we observe may be the result from such compartmentalization in neurons or perhaps is a more general feature of the brain. In contrast, rapidly dividing ES cells do not appear to have stalled ribosomes, at least not of the magnitude we observe here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>). Irrespective of whether ribosome stalling is a dendritic or neuronal phenomenon, how it occurs mechanistically on specific mRNAs is unclear, but it could be related to secondary structure or association with RNA binding or other proteins. One clue, however, could be the accumulating evidence that strongly implicates phosphorylation of eEF2 as a coordinator of translation and neural activity and thus is likely to be one mediator of ribosome translocation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Scheetz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Sutton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">McCamphill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Heise et al., 2017</xref>). Even so, the involvement of phospho-eEF2, a general translation factor, would unlikely be responsible for mRNA-specific stalling. We also noted that some mRNAs, such as those in subcluster 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>), encode proteins involved in the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). A number of these proteins contain proline-rich stretches, whose geometry in the polypeptide exit tunnel can lead to ribosome stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Schuller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Huter et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p id="P24">We have identified 48 mRNAs whose ribosomes are stalled specifically by FMRP. These RNAs include those with (40 mRNAs) and without FMRP CLIP (8 mRNAs) sites in coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Van Driesche et al., 2019</xref>), so it would appear that a simple FMRP “roadblock” model would not explain ribosome stalling. Alternatively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Ishizuka et al. (2002)</xref> showed that <italic>Drosophila</italic> FMRP binds ribosomal proteins, and in a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chen et al. (2014)</xref> found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> FMRP reconstituted with mammalian ribosomes binds a region that would preclude tRNA and elongation factors from engaging in translation. However attractive this model is for FMRP-mediated ribosome stalling, the fact that mRNA or translation factors were not included in the reconstitution assays brings into question whether it reflects the physiological basis for ribosome stalling.</p>
<p id="P25">Our studies revealed that FMRP stalls ribosomes on a number of mRNAs that encode epigenetic regulators and that the misregulation of one of them in <italic>Fmr1</italic>-deficient hippocampus, SETD2, leads to a widespread increase in H3K36me3 chromatin marks (islands). These H3K36me3 islands are both enriched for and depleted from autism-risk genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>) as well as those with synaptic functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). This suggests that SETD2, the main enzyme that catalyzes this chromatin mark, might also be an autism-risk gene, which has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Lumish et al., 2015</xref>). Mutations in several chromatin-remodeling genes have been linked to changes in neural function, autism, and other intellectual disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">van Bokhoven 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Goodman and Azad, 2019</xref>). In most cases, however, mutations in epigenetic modifiers result in up or downregulation of transcription. Indeed, previously identified epigenetic changes in FXS model mice by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Korb et al. (2017)</xref>, particularly H3K4me3, H4K8ac, and H4K16ac, were responsible for widespread changes in transcription in cortical neurons and the cerebellum. Importantly, these investigators could rescue several FXS pathophysiologies, many of which resemble those in autism, by targeting the epigenetic reader protein Brd4. H3K36me3 does not mark promoter regions but instead is found in gene bodies and increases as RNA polymerase II proceeds 3′ during catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Neri et al., 2017</xref>). In mammals, one of the functions H3K36me3 is correlated with, if not causative for, is alternative pre-mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). In the <italic>Fmr1</italic>-deficient hippocampus, we detected extensive changes in RNA processing, mostly exon skipping. Surprisingly, most of the skipped exons occurred in genes that have pre-synaptic functions such as synaptic vesicle recycling, transport, and exocytosis, which could at least partially explain alterations in synaptic vesicle dynamics and neurotransmitter release in FXS model mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Deng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Ferron et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Broek et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, a number of skipped exons in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO have been linked to neurological disorders such as autism (skipped microexon 4 in <italic>Cpeb4</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Irimia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Parras et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Quesnel-Vallières et al., 2016</xref>), Alzheimer’s disease (skipped exon 7 in <italic>APP</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Fragkouli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Rockenstein et al., 1995</xref>), Parkinson’s disease (skipped exon 3 in <italic>Mapt</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Lai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Wobst et al., 2017</xref>), and intellectual disabilities (skipped exon 12 in <italic>Cnksr2</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Houge et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p id="P26">Alternative pre-mRNA processing is a common feature in autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Raj and Blencowe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Quesnel-Vallières et al., 2019</xref>), so it is perhaps not surprising that this would occur in fragile X. However, because FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that regulates translation, a reasonable assumption would be that mRNAs encoding splicing factors are improperly expressed in the disorder and that this leads directly to mis-splicing events. However, our data indicate that this relationship might not be linear. Instead, we find that FMRP controls ribosome dynamics on specific mRNAs, which leads to elevated translation (e.g., SETD2), which leads to chromatin modifications (e.g., H3K36me3), which in turn might lead to alternative splicing of neuronal mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7G</xref>). These observations do not preclude the possible, if not likely, direct involvement of FMRP in some of these events. Even so, inferences that fragile X is a disorder of improper translation, while not incorrect, are vastly over-simplified. However, the complexity of gene expression changes in fragile X might offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention at multiple steps.</p>

Slices were then treated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) in ACSF, 4°C, snap-frozen on dry ice/EtOH bath, and stored at 80°C. For homoharringtonine (HHT) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), cortical-hippocampal slices were recovered 3–4 hours in ACSF and then treated with HHT (20 μM) (Tocris) or 0.05% DMSO (vehicle) for different times (0, 5, 10, 30, 60 min). At the end of the incubation time, slices were snap/frozen on dry ice/EtOH bath and stored at −80 C. Ten slices from 2–3 mice/genotype were pooled for each biological replicate.</p>

<p id="P34">Ribosome profiling libraries were prepared following the published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Heyer et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, rRNA was depleted from the purified monosomal RNA with RiboZero (Illumina, #MRZG12324). Remaining RNA samples were separated on a 15% TBU gel (National Diagnostics, #EC-833) and the ribosome footprints were size-selected between the 26 and 34nt markers. RNA was eluted from the crushed gel pieces in RNA elution buffer (300mM NaOAc pH5.5, 1mM EDTA, 0.25% SDS) at room temperature overnight, filtered with Spin-X Centrifuge Tube Filters (Corning, #8162) and precipitated with equal volume of isopropanol. Recovered RNA was dephosphorylated with T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (NEB, #M0201S) and ligated with preadenylated adaptor in miRCat®−33 Conversion Oligos Pack (IDT) using T4RNL2Tr.K227Q ligase (NEB, #M0351L). Reverse transcription (RT) was performed with primers containing 5nt-barcodes and 8nt-unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and SuperScript III (Invitrogen, #18080–044) in 1X first-strand buffer without MgCl<sub>2</sub> (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl). RT products were separated on a 10% TBU gel and the 130–140nt region was selected. cDNA was eluted in DNA elution buffer (10mM Tris pH 8.0, 300mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA) at room temperature overnight, filtered, and precipitated with isopropanol. Purified cDNA was circularized with CircLigase (Epicenter, #CL4115K). Except for the RNase titration samples, cDNA derived from remaining rRNA was hybridized to biotin-labeled antisense probes (IDT) and further depleted with Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 (Invitrogen, #65001). Optimal PCR cycle number was determined empirically by test PCR reactions with titrated cycle numbers. Final PCR amplification was performed with KAPA Library Amplification Kit (Kapa Biosystems, #KK2611) and 180–190bp products were size-selected on an 8% TBE gel.

For the metagene analysis, transcripts with CDS longer than 3000nt (n = 1401) were selected to ensure incomplete ribosome run-off after 10min HTT treatment. The read densities at each nucleotide position were normalized to the average density of the last 500nt of CDS and averaged using the P sites of RPFs. For visualization purposes, the curves were smoothed within a 90nt window. An arbitrary 0.8 threshold was used to estimate the relative run-off distances at 5 and 10min. A linear regression analysis between the HHT treatment time and ribosome run-off distances was performed to estimate the global elongation rate. To visualize the run-off patterns for individual transcripts, RPFs were normalized to the abundance of mitochondrial RPFs and plotted along the mRNA nucleotide positions. The same y-scale was used across the time-course, so the initiation peaks were truncated to reveal the patterns over CDS. Stalled ribosomes were quantified by RSEM by mapping RPFs to Refseq (V69) mouse CDS without the first and last 300nt to avoid the translation initiation and termination peaks after prolonged HTT treatment. Counts of RPFs were normalized to the length of CDS minus 600nt and the abundance of mitochondrial RPFs in that sample to calculate the RPK (Reads Per Kilobase of transcript) value for each transcript.</p>

<title>Ribosome Profiling Reveals Diverse Changes of Gene Expression in Fmr1 KO Hippocampus</title>
<p id="P58">(A) Schematic diagram of the hippocampal slice preparation. To reduce spontaneous electrical activity, region CA3 was excised. 8–10 slices from six to eight mice/genotype were pooled per biological replicate (wild-type [WT], n = 4 and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO, n = 3).</p>
<p id="P59">(B) Schematic diagram of the experimental procedures for ribosome profiling.</p>
<p id="P60">(C) Scatterplot of expression changes of mRNA levels and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Dysregulated mRNAs in the absence of FMRP are classified into four regulatory groups. 14,459 genes past filtering are used for the scatterplot. Nominal p &lt; 0.01, FDR = 0.097 by permutation test. FC, fold change; TE, translational efficiency.</p>
<p id="P61">(D) Top three GO terms of Biological Process enriched in each regulatory group. The enrichment (gene ratio) is represented by the size of dots. The enrichment significance (adjusted p value) is colorcoded.</p>

<title>Runoff Ribosome Profiling of WT Mouse Brain Slices</title>
<p id="P72">(A) Schematic diagram of homoharringtonine (HHT) runoff ribosome profiling. WT mouse brain slices were treated with 20 mM HHT, an inhibitor of translation initiation, to allow ribosome runoff for 5, 10, 30, and 60 min (t) at 30°C. 10 slices from two or three mice were pooled per time point of HHT treatment.</p>
<p id="P73">(B) Metagene plot of RPFs after HHT treatment. Reads are mapped transcripts (n = 1,401) with CDS longer than 3,000 nt and aligned at the annotated start and stop codons (gray vertical dash lines). The read densities at each nucleotide position are normalized to the average density of the last 500 nt of CDS and averaged using the P sites of RPFs. For visualization purposes, the curves were smoothed within a 90-nt window. Black horizontal dash line indicates the arbitrary 0.8 threshold to estimate the relative runoff distances (black vertical dash lines).</p>
<p id="P74">(C) Linear regression between the HHT treatment time and ribosome run-off distances (from B) to estimate the global elongation rate (4.2 nt/s).</p>
<p id="P75">(D) Cluster analysis of gene groups with distinct ribosome runoff patterns. The RPFs of each gene at each time point was normalized to time 0. The Euclidean distance matrix was then calculated, followed by hierarchical clustering using Ward’s agglomeration method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Ward, 1963</xref>).</p>
<p id="P76">(E) Ribosome runoff patterns for each subcluster. The global pattern of each subcluster was summarized using the corresponding median and standard deviation in each time point. The number of RNAs in each subcluster is shown in parentheses.</p>
