<p id="Par1">Certain human traits such as neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs) and congenital anomalies (CAs) are believed to be primarily genetic in origin. However, even after whole-genome sequencing (WGS), a substantial fraction of such disorders remain unexplained. We hypothesize that some cases of ND–CA are caused by aberrant DNA methylation leading to dysregulated genome function. Comparing DNA methylation profiles from 489 individuals with ND–CAs against 1534 controls, we identify epivariations as a frequent occurrence in the human genome. De novo epivariations are significantly enriched in cases, while RNAseq analysis shows that epivariations often have an impact on gene expression comparable to loss-of-function mutations. Additionally, we detect and replicate an enrichment of rare sequence mutations overlapping CTCF binding sites close to epivariations, providing a rationale for interpreting non-coding variation. We propose that epivariations contribute to the pathogenesis of some patients with unexplained ND–CAs, and as such likely have diagnostic relevance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Epimutations represent a class of mutational event where the epigenetic status of a genomic locus deviates significantly from the normal state, and can be classified into two main types: primary epimutations are thought to represent stochastic errors in the establishment or maintenance of an epigenetic state, while secondary epimutations are downstream events related to an underlying change in the DNA sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Both secondary and primary epimutations that originate in the germline will be constitutive events found in all cells. In contrast, primary epimutations that occur post-fertilization may result in somatic mosaicism. Constitutive (i.e., non-mosaic) epimutations are known to underlie several genetic disorders that can be identified in blood-derived DNA: 5–15% of patients with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer present with constitutional <italic>MLH1</italic> promoter methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and fragile X syndrome, the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability, results from a secondary epimutation in which hypermethylation of an expanded CGG repeat at the <italic>FMR1</italic> promoter causes transcriptional silencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">With the recent dramatic advances in genomic technologies, genome-wide surveys of cohorts of patients with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs) and congenital anomalies (CAs) (ND–CAs) for point mutations and structural variations have greatly advanced our understanding of their genetic etiologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, even after whole genome sequencing (WGS), no causative mutation can be identified in many such cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that some cases of ND–CA that remain refractory to conventional sequence-based analysis harbor rare epigenetic aberrations (termed epivariations), which are associated with dysregulation of normal genome function, and that these would be missed by the conventional sequencing approaches. We identify rare epigenetic changes that are absent in thousands of controls in ~20% of patients with ND–CA. From large-scale sequencing, population and expression studies, we conclude that epivariations are: (i) frequently associated with extreme outlier and mono-allelic gene expression; (ii) generally conserved across multiple tissues within an individual, validating the use of blood DNA to study ND–CA; (iii) sometimes occur secondary to <italic>cis</italic>-linked regulatory mutations, providing a rationale for interpreting non-coding genetic variants; (iv) can occur sporadically with a remarkably high de novo rate, and (v) a subset exhibit non-Mendelian inheritance, suggesting they are often being reset between generations by epigenetic reprogramming. We propose that epivariations likely contribute to the pathogenesis of some patients with unexplained ND–CAs, and suggest that epigenome profiling represents a promising method for the study of human disease that complements sequence-based approaches.</p>

<title>Identification of epivariations in cases and controls</title>
<p id="Par5">We studied a cohort comprising 489 individuals with ND–CA: most had been previously tested by copy number variation (CNV) microarray, all had undergone exome sequencing, and some had undergone WGS, yet no putatively pathogenic mutations had been identified. Almost 90% of the patients had an ND, 50% were classified as having an autism spectrum disorder, 16% had an epilepsy/seizure phenotype; 65% also had multiple CA, including congenital heart defects (CHD) (36%), facial dysmorphisms (29%), growth anomalies (22%), and micro/macrocephaly (13%) (full details in Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>). We hypothesized that this cohort represented an optimal population in which to search for novel pathogenic epivariations since an underlying genomic abnormality was suspected, but many common environmental and genetic causes of ND–CA had been excluded. Methylation profiling in ND–CA samples was performed with the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip (450k array). Profiles in each ND–CA sample were compared individually against a control cohort comprising 1534 unrelated individuals from four publicly available datasets (GSE36064, GSE40279, GSE42861, and GSE53045). We also searched for epivariations in two cohorts of population controls by comparison against this same set of 1534 individuals: 117 families (GSE56105)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> were used to assess the inheritance of epivariations in controls (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">2</xref>); 2711 unrelated individuals (GSE55763)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> were used to assess the frequency of epivariations in the general population (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">3</xref>). We utilized a sliding window approach to identify epivariations in each sample, defined as 1 kb regions containing ≥3 probes showing rare outlier methylation absent in the set of 1534 common control individuals (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and Methods section). After stringent quality control, including removal of loci with clusters of poorly hybridizing probes and extensive manual curation to remove technical and batch effects, we identified a total of 143 epivariations in 114 ND–CA samples (i.e., 23% of the probands tested). Twenty percent of the ND–CA cohort carried one epivariation (<italic>n</italic> = 98), while 3% of the individuals tested presented two or more epivariations (<italic>n</italic> = 16) (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">4</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par6">Using PCR/bisulfite sequencing, we attempted orthogonal confirmation for 70 epivariations. We observed concordant changes in methylation for 55 of the 58 assays that provided useful data, yielding a 95% true positive rate for differentially methylated regions (DMRs) detected by array (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM8">5</xref>). Allelic analysis demonstrated that these epivariations represent large methylation changes specifically on one allele, consistent with the hypothesis that epivariations represent allelic events. In most cases, we observed two clusters of largely methylated and unmethylated reads occurring in approximately equal proportions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>), although in some instances the interpretation of validation experiments was made complex due to highly biased allelic representation, presumably reflecting preferential PCR amplification of one allele (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Large gains and losses of DNA methylation identified in patients with ND–CA. Plots <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>, and <bold>c</bold> show <italic>β</italic> values obtained from Illumina 450k array for probands (highlighted in green) and 1534 controls (shades of gray corresponding to ±1, ±1.5, and ±2 standard deviations from the population mean, represented by the dashed black line; dashed gray lines represent controls with outlier methylation levels). <bold>a</bold> Recurrent hypomethylation of the imprinted locus of <italic>MEG3</italic> (hg19: chr14:101290194–101294429) in Proband 398 (solid green line) and Proband 146 (dashed green line).

Each plot shows the methylation pattern for an amplicon, with each row representing a single bisulfite read and each column one CpG in the amplicon. Black circles are methylated CpGs and white circles unmethylated CpGs. Based on the presence of a heterozygous SNP within the DMR (hg19: chr19:2900643), the observed gain of methylation occurs specifically on one allele: each pie chart shows the methylated fraction of reads per CpG</p></caption><graphic id="d29e704" xlink:href="41467_2018_4540_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par7">In addition to searching for epivariations in samples with ND–CA, we also screened two large cohorts of population controls, identifying a total of 719 DMRs in the 3326 control samples analyzed (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">3</xref>). Thus, epivariations are a relatively common occurrence in the human genome, and are not always associated with any discernable clinical phenotype. Twenty-four of the epivariations identified in our cases with ND–CA were also found in one or more of these controls, therefore indicating that either these DMRs are unrelated to the patient phenotype, or perhaps are associated with incomplete penetrance. However, we observed a 1.2-fold enrichment in the frequency of epivariations in the 489 ND–CA samples when compared to 2711 population controls (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>), although this does not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.058, two-sided Fisher’s exact test).</p>
<p id="Par8">Using a combination of 450k arrays and bisulfite PCR/sequencing assays, we were able to assess the inheritance of 57 DMRs identified in our patients with ND–CA: 33 of the 57 epivariations tested were also present in apparently unaffected parents, and thus represent inherited events. However, 42% (<italic>n</italic> = 24) of the epivariations identified in patients with ND–CA were absent in both parental samples, and thus occurred as de novo events. When compared to epivariations found in 117 control pedigrees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">2</xref>), this represents a 2.8-fold enrichment in the rate of de novo epivariations in cases compared to controls (<italic>p</italic> = 0.007, two-sided Fisher’s exact test) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). Thus, while it is currently unclear whether many of the epivariations identified contribute to the phenotypes of the patients in our study, the paradigm of de novo mutational events echoes that observed for other classes of genetic mutation (copy number and single nucleotide variation (SNV)) deemed pathogenic in ND and CHD cohorts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>A significant excess of de novo epivariations found in patients with ND–CA.

<p id="Par9">In addition to their de novo nature, recurrence of mutations found in unrelated patients with a similar phenotype is commonly used as a way of assigning significant evidence for the involvement of a specific gene or locus in disease. We identified 12 recurrent epivariations (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>), i.e., the same methylation change was identified in multiple unrelated probands. Of these, two epivariations encompassed the promoters of genes known to show altered methylation in congenital disease (<italic>MEG3</italic> and <italic>FMR1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, showing that our approach successfully detects pathogenic epivariations. The two males identified with hypermethylation at <italic>FMR1</italic> had phenotypes consistent with a diagnosis of fragile X, primarily intellectual disability (ID) and behavioral anomalies. While both had previously been tested by PCR and reported as normal, subsequent Southern blot testing confirmed the presence of the classical <italic>FMR1</italic> triplet repeat expansion, although in one case this was an apparent mosaic event. A third recurrent epivariation coincides with a fragile site containing a hypermethylated triplet repeat expansion (<italic>FRA10AC1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> although this, and four other recurrent epivariations detected in our disease cohort, was also identified in population controls, suggesting that they are unlikely to be pathogenic. One of the novel recurrent epivariations detected only in our patient cohort was found in two patients with CHD (Probands 22 and 117), and represents a recurrent hypo-methylation defect at the promoter—5′ UTR—first exon of <italic>MOV10L1</italic>, a gene with an embryonic heart-specific isoform that interacts with the master cardiac transcription factor NKX2.5<sup>13</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). One patient with this epivariation at <italic>MOV10L1</italic> presented with double outlet right ventricle, hypoplastic left ventricle, asplenia, and short stature, while the second presented with pulmonary stenosis, laryngo-bronchio-tracheomalacia, and foot polydactyly. Finally, using less stringent criteria for identifying DMRs (see Methods), we detected methylation defects in 11 probands at 10 imprinted loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), 90% of which occurred de novo.

<title>Regulatory mutations underlie some epivariations</title>
<p id="Par10">Based on previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that some epivariations might occur secondarily to an underlying regulatory sequence mutation. In order to identify mutations disrupting regulatory elements (e.g., transcription factor binding sites) that might underlie the methylation changes observed in our cohort, we performed high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and targeted DNA sequencing of 50 DMRs and their flanking sequences. We detected rare sequence mutations that co-segregated with epivariations and potentially impact regulatory elements at 24% of the loci tested: six CNVs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>) and seven SNVs (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM10">7</xref>). Where inheritance data from parental samples were available, we found that all of these rare CNVs and SNVs segregated with the presence of the DMR, suggesting that the epivariations occurred secondarily to the underlying sequence mutation.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Detection of rare CNVs by targeted sequencing of epivariations and their flanks. Proband 121 carries a maternally inherited DMR at the <italic>PDCD2</italic> locus. We identified a maternally inherited heterozygous 4061 bp deletion flanking the DMR. Two other similar examples are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6</xref></p></caption><graphic id="d29e869" xlink:href="41467_2018_4540_Fig3_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par11">Of the rare segregating SNVs detected at DMRs, three were SNVs within the canonical binding sites for CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor), a transcription factor with roles in chromatin organization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>), including a de novo SNV that disrupts a CTCF binding motif in association with a de novo epivariation (Proband 70) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). In each case, the disrupted CTCF motif was either overlapping or very close to (separation &lt;1 kb) the DMR. This represents a significant enrichment for rare SNVs disrupting CTCF binding sites in the vicinity of epivariations when compared to the same regions in other samples in whom we performed targeted sequencing, but who did not carry epivariations at these loci (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0015, two-sided Fisher’s exact test), strongly implicating rare <italic>cis</italic>-linked variants in regulatory sequence as a causative factor underlying some epivariations. Furthermore, given the low frequency of de novo SNVs and epivariations in the genome, it is highly unlikely that a de novo SNV and a de novo epivariation would co-occur at the same locus in an individual by chance, providing additional support that some epivariations represent secondary events caused by disruption of CTCF binding. Using paired methylation and sequence data from 90 individuals studied by the 1000 Genomes Project (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM11">8</xref>), we replicated this enrichment for rare SNVs disrupting CTCF binding motifs around epivariations (<italic>p</italic> = 0.049, two-sided Fisher’s exact test), identifying two rare CTCF-disrupting SNVs, one of which co-segregates with the presence of an epivariation in multiple unrelated individuals. Though readily detectable by WGS, there is considerable difficulty in interpreting the functional significance of variants outside of coding regions. Thus, we propose that the use of epigenome profiling represents a complementary approach that can provide a rationale for interpreting non-coding genetic variation.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Targeted sequencing of epivariation loci identifies a significant enrichment of rare SNVs within the CTCF canonical binding motif. <bold>a</bold> Hypermethylation in <italic>NOS3</italic> (chr7:150704999-150706354) in Proband 103 (outlier in green); in the lower UCSC Genome Browser view, the DMR location is shown as a green bar, and a rare SNV that lies within the CTCF binding motif (blue region within black bar) in this same individual is shown in red. <bold>b</bold> CTCF motif according to ENCODE Factorbook repository.

<title>Functional consequences of epivariations</title>
<p id="Par12">In order to provide insight into the biology and functional consequences of epivariations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, we performed studies of gene expression, inheritance, and tissue conservation using datasets of DNA methylation (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM12">9</xref>), gene expression (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM13">10</xref>), and genotype data derived from population controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Using paired RNAseq and DNA methylation data in 90 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project, we verified that epivariations encompassing gene promoters were often associated with large changes in gene expression, with hypomethylation leading to increased expression and hypermethylation to transcriptional repression, consistent with the known repressive effects of promoter DNA methylation (<italic>p</italic> = 9.2 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM13">10</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We also observed that many hypermethylated epivariations at promoters are associated with complete silencing of one allele (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). While these observations were made in a control cohort, this suggests that some epivariations have an impact comparable to that of loss-of-function coding mutations.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Epivariations are frequently associated with large changes in gene expression.

<title>Epivariations are generally present in multiple tissues</title>
<p id="Par13">While epigenetic profiles can vary substantially between cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, it is unclear whether similar cell-specific variability exists for epivariations. To address that, we analyzed cohorts in which methylation profiles were available from multiple different tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In samples from the GenCord population, in which methylation data from fibroblasts, B cells, and T cells sampled from dozens of newborns are available, by first identifying DMRs in T cells, we observed a very strong concordance for outlier methylation at the same locus in fibroblasts derived from the same individual (Spearman rank correlation of 0.75, <italic>p</italic> = 1.2 × 10<sup>−27</sup>, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM12">9</xref>).

<p id="Par14">A similar trend for conservation of epivariations across multiple different post-mortem tissues was also observed in a second cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Here, epivariations found in blood were nearly all visible in multiple other somatic tissues sampled from the same individual (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the majority of epivariations are constitutive events found in multiple tissues.

<title>Evidence for non-Mendelian inheritance of epivariations</title>
<p id="Par15">Despite strong evidence that some of the epivariations we observed are secondary events related to the presence of an underlying sequence change (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>), we were unable to detect <italic>cis</italic>-linked sequence mutations associated with the majority of epivariations in our cohort, suggesting that these might instead represent primary epivariations that arose sporadically. As the mammalian genome undergoes several rounds of demethylation and remethylation during gametogenesis, embryonic and somatic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, theoretically there is considerable potential for primary epivariations to be reset to the default state. We therefore assessed how often epivariations are stably transmitted between parents and their offspring. Using a large control cohort comprising 117 nuclear families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, we studied the heritability of epivariations between generations, identifying 47 epivariations segregating within these pedigrees. We observed a marked deviation from the expectations of Mendelian inheritance, with only 32 instances of parent–child transmission in 95 informative meioses; significantly fewer than the Mendelian expectation of 47.5 transmissions (<italic>p</italic> = 0.027, two-sided Fisher’s exact test) (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">2</xref>). Therefore, this apparent reduction in heritability indicates that primary epivariations often exhibit non-Mendelian inheritance, and suggests they are frequently reset between generations by epigenetic reprogramming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par16">In this study, we set out to investigate the prevalence, causes, and consequences of epigenetic defects in the human genome, and to study their potential role in the etiology of ND–CA disorders. By performing epigenome profiling in a large cohort of 489 patients with diverse ND–CA, all of whom had previously undergone microarray testing and/or exome or genome sequencing, in addition to analyzing &gt;5000 population controls, we demonstrate that epivariations are a relatively frequent occurrence in the human population. Subsequent analysis of cell lines showed that the presence of epivariations is often associated with large changes in the expression of <italic>cis</italic>-linked genes, indicating functional consequences on the genome. Furthermore, we demonstrated that epivariations are generally conserved across multiple tissues, validating the use of peripheral blood for the studies of ND–CA.</p>
<p id="Par17">We observed both recurrent epivariations in cases that were absent in thousands of population controls, and a significant excess of de novo epivariations in cases compared to controls, both of which are hallmarks often associated with pathogenic variants. Despite this, the pathogenic significance of many of the epivariations we identified remains uncertain. For example, in many cases, epivariations were inherited from apparently unaffected parents, suggesting that they are unlinked to the observed phenotype. While it is likely that the presence of some epivariations we observed in ND–CA cases is unrelated to patient phenotype, we note that not all inherited events are benign, and there are many examples of rare inherited sequence variants that show variable penetrance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par18">Studies of the inheritance of epivariations in families showed that they can occur de novo at very high frequency (up to 42%), yet also show significantly reduced heritability compared to Mendelian expectations, suggesting that they are often reset during meiosis. However, in contrast to this dynamic process of frequent gain and loss, targeted sequencing and array CGH identified segregating rare sequence variants that disrupt annotated regulatory elements associated with 24% of the epivariations we investigated, indicating that a subset are likely secondary events caused by underlying sequence variations. Thus our data are consistent with a model in which some epivariations are primary events that occur sporadically, but are often reset during the waves of epigenome remodeling that occur during meiosis and early embryonic development, while others are secondary events that occur as a result of <italic>cis</italic>-linked regulatory sequence mutations. Consistent with this, previous studies in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> have shown that primary epimutations are often reset during meiosis, while secondary epivariations have been observed to remain stable through multiple generations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par19">In addition to mutations that disrupt regulatory elements such as TF binding sites, expansions of GC-rich tandem repeats can also result in local DNA hypermethylation. Indeed, we identified multiple individuals with gains of methylation at known CGG repeats, including <italic>FMR1</italic>/<italic>FRAXA</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> (two cases), <italic>XYLT1</italic>/<italic>FRA16A</italic> (one case)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, <italic>FRA10AC1</italic>/<italic>FRA10</italic> (two cases and nine controls)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, and <italic>DIP2B</italic>/<italic>FRA12</italic> (one control)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Both individuals with <italic>FMR1</italic> hypermethylation were shown to carry the classic CGG expansion that causes Fragile X, and although not tested, it is likely that the gains of methylation observed at the other three known fragile sites are also caused by similar repeat expansions. While our targeted sequencing experiments of other epivariations did not identify any novel tandem repeat expansions, this class of mutation is difficult to detect with short-read sequencing. Thus, it remains possible that some of the hypermethylated epivariations we observed might be caused by this mechanism.</p>
<p id="Par20">Previous studies have made attempts to investigate the prevalence of epigenetic changes in patients with ND–CA. Kolarova et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> compared the DNA methylation profiles of 82 patients against 19 controls, identifying a total of 157 DMRs. Consistent with our own findings, Kolarova et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> also identified patients with hypomethylation defects of <italic>MEG3</italic> and <italic>MOV10L1</italic>. While loss of imprinting at <italic>MEG3</italic> is a known cause of Temple syndrome, the recurrent observation of hypomethylation of <italic>MOV10L1</italic> is significant (total <italic>n</italic> = 3 of 571 cases versus 0 of 4878 controls, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, Fisher’s Exact test), and provides additional evidence implicating this locus with developmental defects. Similarly Aref-Eshghi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> assessed methylation patterns in a total of 528 samples, identifying altered methylation levels at several imprinted loci that were absent in controls. Consistent with our own study, their cohort included two patients with hypermethylation of <italic>HM13</italic>, thus demonstrating this as another recurrent alteration found in patients with ND–CA, and suggesting that this may be an imprinting disorder.</p>
<p id="Par21">Our study shows that epivariations are a relatively common feature in the human genome, that some are associated with changes in the local gene expression, and raises the possibility that they may be implicated in the etiology of developmental disorders. In an era when WGS is being applied to many thousands of human genomes, epivariations represent a class of genetic variation that remains undetectable by purely sequence-based approaches. We anticipate that future studies exploring the relationship between sequence variation and epigenetic state will further illuminate the regulatory architecture of the human genome, providing novel insight into the consequences of non-coding mutations.</p>

<p id="Par26">Raw data files with <italic>β</italic> values, color, intensity, and detection <italic>p</italic>-values per probe were obtained from the genomics facilities. Quality control steps entailed performing a gender check, a screen for potential regions of homozygous deletion, PCA plots, and density plots of <italic>M</italic> values.

<p id="Par27">We inferred patient gender by calculating both the mean <italic>p</italic>-value of chromosome Y probes, and the mean <italic>β</italic> value of chromosome X probes per sample, and compared these to the patient records. A mismatch between the array-inferred gender and the reported patient gender was detected in four samples: these samples were removed from downstream analysis and the published GEO entry.</p>
<p id="Par28">As the 450k array utilizes hybridization of DNA to infer a methylation value per probe, regions of homozygous deletion where probes have no target DNA to hybridize often yield very low signal. In such regions of homozygous deletion, reported <italic>β</italic> values are often highly erratic, and thus can easily appear as outlier values when compared to the rest of the population, yielding potential false-positive DMRs in our analysis. We assessed the presence of putative homozygous deletion regions by identifying clusters of probes with failed detection <italic>p</italic>-values. For a high-quality 450k array hybridization, typically &lt;0.1% of autosomal probes yield detection <italic>p</italic>-values &gt;0.01. Thus, clusters of multiple probes in any one sample with failed detection <italic>p</italic>-values (<italic>p</italic> &gt;0.01) should be extremely rare. The perl script arguments were set to flag 3 kb windows where three or more probes yielded detection <italic>p</italic> &gt;0.01 in each sample. In total, across the 489 probands, we detected 182 putative regions of homozygous deletion (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM14">11</xref>). By comparing these putative CNVs with publicly available datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> (minor allele frequency, MAF ≥5%), we observed that 81% of clusters of probes with failed detection <italic>p</italic>-values corresponded to common CNV loci or intergenic space, validating this as an appropriate method. Regions identified as putative homozygous deletion in each sample were then excluded from the list of DMR calls.</p>
<p id="Par29">PCA and density plots of <italic>M</italic> values were obtained with the lumi and methylumi R packages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. We excluded one sample from downstream analysis because it was a clear outlier by PCA. Two additional samples (Proband 488 and Proband 489) were removed from the analysis of chromosome X because they were clear outliers by PCA based on chromosome X data.</p>
<p id="Par30">After removal of probes with failed detection <italic>p</italic>-values (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.01) in each sample, we performed color correction, background correction, and quantile normalization of <italic>β</italic> values across all probands control samples using <italic>lumi</italic> and <italic>methyllumi</italic>. Finally we performed normalization to account for the different data distributions of Infinium type I and type II probes using the BMIQ package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Identification of candidate DMRs</title>
<p id="Par31">Identification of putative DMRs was performed using a custom perl script (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/AndyMSSMLab/Scripts/tree/master">https://github.com/AndyMSSMLab/Scripts/tree/master</ext-link>). We utilized a sliding window approach to individually compare the methylation profile in each proband against the entire control cohort, detecting regions of robust outlier methylation represented by multiple independent probes with extreme methylation values, including at least one probe with methylation values well outside that observed in any control sample. This was done as single probes can present outlier values due to technical array artifacts, hybridization artifacts such as the presence of underlying sequence variants, or the presence of C&gt;T mutations at the CpG being assayed. Stringent thresholds for calling DMRs were set as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par32">Hypermethylation: the proband presents, in a 1-kb window, probes that fulfill both of the following criteria:</p><p id="Par33">(i) At least 3 probes that each have <italic>β</italic> values above the 99.9th percentile of the control distribution for that probe, and are ≥0.15 above the control mean.</p><p id="Par34">(ii) At least 1 probe with a <italic>β</italic> value ≥0.1 above the maximum observed in controls for that probe.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par35">Hypomethylation: the proband presents, in a 1-kb window, probes that fulfill both of the following criteria:</p><p id="Par36">(i) At least 3 probes that each have <italic>β</italic> values below the 0.1th percentile of the control distribution for that probe, and are ≥0.15 below the control mean.</p><p id="Par37">(ii) At least 1 probe with a <italic>β</italic> value ≥0.1 below the minimum observed in controls for that probe.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p id="Par38">All DMRs were manually curated to remove the loci that were deemed false-positive calls. Despite performing probe-level filtering and multiple rounds of normalization of the array data, such measures are imperfect and do not remove all probes that show aberrant signals due to underlying technical or biological effects. We observed both systematic batch effects, and also sporadic false positives in single samples that were filtered, as follows:</p>
<p id="Par39">(i) Batch effects, i.e., technical differences due to arrays being processed in separate groups, were sometimes observed between cases and controls. Here, it was usually observed that there was either a systematic shift in <italic>β</italic> values reported by one or more probes within a region between arrays processed in different batches. In some cases, the mean of each batch was significantly different, with every sample showing a shift, whereas in other cases the means of the two populations remained similar, but a subset of the samples in one batch showed a gradient of deviations, with the <italic>β</italic> values of multiple cases lying in the extreme tail of the control distribution.</p>
<p id="Par40">(ii) In some cases, while 3 probes within a 1-kb region were identified as outliers, the outlier probes were not in a contiguous block as would be expected for a true methylation change, and were interspersed with other probes that showed no difference compared to the control population. We interpreted these signals as likely random groupings of individual probes that each yielded outlier beta values for some other reason, e.g., rare underlying variations that influenced probe performance, or poor hybridization performance of individual probes. Indeed, we identified that many such cases were due to regions of homozygous deletion as indicated by clusters of probes with failed array detection <italic>p</italic>-values (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM14">11</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par41">We observed that 98.6% of the probands presented less than 10 DMRs. Due to a clear increase in the rate of false-positive DMRs as assessed by manual curation, samples with &gt;10 DMRs were excluded (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). Only the 143 epivariations that were deemed true positive by both researchers were kept for downstream analysis (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">4</xref>). All genomic coordinates are in build GRCh37/hg19. We identified 12 recurrent epivariations (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Methylation profiles of 614 healthy individuals from 117 families (GSE56105) were subject to the same analysis, comparing individual methylation profiles against 1534 controls to search for outlier DMRs (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">2</xref>). Taking into account the pedigree information, assessment of epivariation inheritance was performed by inspection of data plots of all family members at the DMR locus; 2711 unrelated individuals (GSE55763) were subject to the same pipeline for identification of DMRs (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">3</xref>).</p>

<title>Epivariation calling at imprinted loci</title>
<p id="Par42">To identify epivariations affecting imprinted loci, a total of 763 450k array probes mapping to 50 imprinted loci were selected from Monk et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> and Joshi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The mean methylation level was calculated in each proband and control by averaging <italic>β</italic> values for all probes within each imprinted locus. For each proband, methylation changes were considered as epivariations when either the mean methylation level showed a difference greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean of controls, or when the mean <italic>β</italic> value was &gt;0.8 or &lt;0.2. Epivariations identified in imprinted loci are listed in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec15">
<title>Bisulfite sequencing</title>
<p id="Par43">In order to assess the accuracy of our identification of putative epivariations from array data, we performed secondary validation experiments using bisulfite PCR amplicon sequencing. Validation studies were performed in both the proband and parental DNAs (where available) to determine if they were (i) genuine regions of outlier methylation, (ii) inherited from a phenotypically normal parent (and therefore likely unrelated to patient phenotype), or (iii) de novo (and therefore likely pathogenic). Finally, bisulfite sequencing has the additional advantage of being able to determine if the methylation change occurred on one or both alleles, which is important given that the epivariation paradigm predicts that most pathogenic changes will present as mono-allelic gains or losses of methylation.</p>
<p id="Par44">Samples were processed at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center Epigenetics Medical Center, Columbia University Medical Center. Genomic DNA was bisulfite treated and then subjected to targeted sequencing. Primers were designed using MethPrimer, bisulfite-converted DNA was amplified by PCR, followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) (Illumina MiSeq). Sample preparation for MiSeq was performed on a Fluidigm AccessArray high-throughput PCR machine with sample bar-codes incorporated in a second round of PCR. Allele-specific methylation was assessed where coverage was &gt;100 reads. Libraries prepared by this method were then subjected to NGS on the Illumina MiSEQ (2 × 150 bp) platform, which scores net methylation in each amplicon based on the ratio of C to T bases at CpG positions. For each amplicon and sample, methylation percentages (Methylated reads/Total reads) averaged across the covered CpGs (&gt;100×) were provided.</p>
<p id="Par45">Seventy epivariations were selected for validation with this methodology (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM8">5</xref>). Eleven assays failed to work. Of the remainder, we verified that 33 epivariations were inherited (67% maternal and 33% paternal), 24 were de novo, and 2 were true positives but their inheritance was not assessed (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">4</xref>). In some instances, the interpretation of validation experiments was made complex due to highly biased allelic representation, presumably reflecting preferential PCR amplification of one allele (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par46">To confirm the epivariations at imprinted loci, 2 μg of DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite and purified using the EpiTect Bisulfite kit (Qiagen, Germantown MD). Bisulfite PCR for each candidate region was performed on 2 μl of bisulfite-treated DNA using HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase (Qiagen, Germantown MD) and specific primers. After amplification, PCR products were cloned into TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transformed into chemically competent TOP10 cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for subsequent sequencing using M13R primers (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>).</p>

<title>Agilent custom designed array</title>
<p id="Par47">In order to identify CNVs overlapping or adjacent to epivariations that could underlie the methylation change, we designed a custom ultra-high-resolution CGH array specifically targeting 28 DMRs and ±600 kb of their flanking sequences. At each epivariation locus to be assayed for CNVs, we selected a mean density of 1 probe per ~150 bp ± 100 kb of each DMR, and more sparse coverage (mean density of 1 probe every ~600 bp) extending a further 500 kb upstream and downstream. Normalization probes spaced throughout the autosomes and additional control probes on chromosomes X and Y were also included in the array. The custom array was designed and ordered through Agilent’s online portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://earray.chem.agilent.com/earray/">https://earray.chem.agilent.com/earray/</ext-link>). DNA samples were processed in the Cytogenetics and Cytogenomics Laboratory of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

<title>Targeted sequencing of epivariations</title>
<p id="Par48">In order to identify SNVs within DMRs or their flanking sequences that could underlie methylation changes, we performed targeted sequencing of 36 DMRs (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">4</xref>), including an additional ±75 kb of sequence from each flank, using a custom sequence capture assay and a HiSeq2500 instrument. Briefly, library preparation entailed shearing DNA using a Bioruptor (Diagenode, Denville NJ) to a mean fragment size of 300 bp, use of the KAPA LTP prep kit and barcoding the DNA with NextFLEX (Bioo Scientific, Austin TX). Capture was performed with a custom oligonucleotide DNA capture kit (Nimblegen, Madison WI). NGS was performed using paired-end 150 bp reads generated with an Illumina HiSeq 2500. Thirty-six samples were multiplexed per sequencing lane, and were processed in the Genomics Core of New York University.</p>
<p id="Par49">Paired-end reads were mapped against the human reference genome (hg19) using BWA-MEM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/lh3/bwa">https://github.com/lh3/bwa</ext-link>, v0.7.12) with default parameters.

The protocol involves multiple steps. Initially, the gVCF file was created individually for each sample using the haplotype caller utility. Next, joint genotyping was performed on all samples together and a single vcf file generated. In all steps, we restricted genotyping to the targeted loci.
