<abstract>
<p>Autophagosomes primarily mediate turnover of cytoplasmic proteins or organelles to provide nutrients and eliminate damaged proteins. In neurons, autophagosomes form in distal axons and are trafficked retrogradely to fuse with lysosomes in the soma. Although defective neuronal autophagy is associated with neurodegeneration, the function of neuronal autophagosomes remains incompletely understood. We show that in neurons, autophagosomes promote neuronal complexity and prevent neurodegeneration <italic>in vivo</italic> via retrograde transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-activated TrkB receptors. p150<sup>Glued</sup>/dynactin-dependent transport of TrkB-containing autophagosomes requires their association with the endocytic adaptor AP-2, an essential protein complex previously thought to function exclusively in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These data highlight a novel non-canonical function of AP-2 in retrograde transport of BDNF/TrkB-containing autophagosomes in neurons and reveal a causative link between autophagy and BDNF/TrkB signalling.</p>

<p>The endocytic adaptor protein complex AP-2 is mostly known for its role in endocytosis and in synaptic vesicle reformation. Here the authors show that AP-2 also mediates retrograde transport of TrkB-containing autophagosomes in neurons; this process promotes neuronal complexity and prevents the degeneration of cortical and thalamic neurons.</p>

<body>
<p>Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved process that serves to provide nutrients during starvation and to eliminate defective proteins and organelles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum via lysosomal degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. During autophagy portions of the cytoplasm are sequestered within double- or multimembraned vesicles termed autophagosomes. These undergo subsequent maturation steps, in particular fusion with late endosomes, to become late-stage autophagosomes also called amphisomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> before being delivered to lysosomes by dynein-mediated retrograde transport<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Autophagosome formation requires an E3-like complex comprising ATG5 that catalyses lipid conjugation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the cytoprotective function of autophagy under conditions of starvation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, recent data support additional roles of autophagy, for example, in maintenance of stemness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> or FGF signalling to mediate bone growth during development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In the brain, autophagosomes form locally in distal axons and are trafficked retrogradely<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> to eventually fuse with lysosomes enriched in the neuronal soma. Accumulation of autophagosomes is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, while knockout (KO) of key autophagy proteins in mice causes neurodegeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In spite of these findings the physiological function of neuronal autophagosomes and their role in promoting neuronal survival and counteracting neurodegeneration remains incompletely understood.</p>
<p>A crucial pathway that promotes neuronal survival, protects from neurodegeneration and promotes neuronal complexity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> is the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signalling pathway. In cortical and hippocampal neurons BDNF initiates signalling by binding to its receptor TrkB in distal neurites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Activated BDNF/TrkB complexes are internalized predominantly via macropinocytosis mediated by EHD4/pincher into so-called ‘signalling endosomes' that are refractory to lysosomal degradation to ensure persistent signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Consistent with this model, BDNF/TrkB have been shown to require retrograde axonal transport to promote neuronal branching and survival and to counteract neurodegeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Recent data suggest that TrkB-signalling endosomes may contain late endosomal markers such as Rab7 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) and are trafficked in part by Snapin, a subunit of the BLOC-1 complex. KO mice lacking Snapin suffer from impaired neurosecretion, but do not show major defects in brain architecture or neuronal complexity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> associated with defective BDNF/TrkB signalling, suggesting that other factors must exist that promote retrograde traffic of TrkB-signalling endosomes. However, neither the identity of these factors nor the cell biological nature of TrkB-signalling endosomes is known.</p>
<p>Here we demonstrate that TrkB-signalling endosomes are late-stage autophagosomes that undergo retrograde transport to the neuronal soma via their association with the adaptor AP-2, an essential<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> protein complex hitherto thought to function exclusively in clathrin-mediated endocytosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and in the reformation of synaptic vesicles in the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. AP-2 is a heterotetramer comprised of α, β, μ, and σ subunits. We show that neuronal AP-2 mediates retrograde transport of TrkB-containing autophagosomes via association of AP-2α with LC3 and of AP-2β with the p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunit of the dynein cofactor dynactin to promote neuronal complexity and counteract neurodegeneration <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data, thus, identify a novel function of autophagy in BDNF/TrkB signalling during brain development mediated by a non-canonical role of the endocytic adaptor AP-2.</p>

<title>Retrograde co-trafficking of AP-2 and LC3 in neurons</title>
<p>The localization and function of neuronal AP-2 so far has been investigated largely by analysis of its steady-state distribution in fixed neurons and brain tissue or by genetic and biochemical experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. To obtain insights into AP-2 function in living neurons we monitored the dynamics of fluorescent protein-tagged AP-2μ (tagged at an internal site that retains full functionality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) by live imaging of primary cortico-hippocampal neurons in culture. In addition to the plasma membrane, AP-2μ-mRFP localized to puncta in axons and dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). In axons, AP-2μ-mRFP-positive puncta underwent rapid bidirectional movement (at 0.4–0.5 μm s<sup>−1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>) suggestive of microtubule-based transport with a preference for retrograde transport to the neuronal soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). In contrast, no retrograde transport of AP-2μ-mRFP was seen in dendrites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 2</xref>). Given the reported association of AP-2 with autophagic proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> and the prominent microtubule-based movement of autophagosomes in neurites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, we hypothesized that mobile AP-2-containing structures may correspond to LC3-positive autophagosomes. Live cell image analysis revealed a close colocalization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c,d</xref>) and co-trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 3</xref>) of eGFP-LC3b with AP-2μ-mRFP in primary neurons. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the degree of colocalization between AP-2μ-mRFP and eGFP-LC3 (Rp=0.65±0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>) was comparable to that of eGFP-LC3 with mCherry-ATG12 (Rp=0.67±0.02), a <italic>bona fide</italic> component of the machinery for autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e,f</xref>). In agreement with previous reports, we found that &gt;80% of stationary AP-2 puncta in the axon were confined to synapses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1g–i</xref>). Partial co-localization of endogenous AP-2 with LC3 in neuronal processes was further confirmed by dual-colour time-gated stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) analysis of neurons treated with the vATPase inhibitor folimycin, a lysosomotropic agent, which prevents autophagosome, and, thus, LC3b degradation via lysosomal proteolysis, and immunostained for AP-2α and LC3b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h,i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1j,k</xref>). In clathrin-mediated endocytosis, AP-2 functions to recruit clathrin and cargo proteins to endocytic sites at the plasma membrane. Surprisingly, we failed to detect a specific enrichment of clathrin on AP-2-positive autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1l,m</xref>). These data suggest that retrograde co-trafficking of AP-2 on autophagosomes may reflect a novel non-canonical function of AP-2 in autophagosome transport in primary neurons that likely is independent of its established role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis as further discussed below.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>AP-2 forms a complex with LC3 and dynactin/p150<sup>Glued</sup></title>
<p>The co-trafficking of AP-2 with LC3 on autophagosomes raises the question how neuronal AP-2 is recruited to these carriers. While the β, μ and σ subunits of AP-2 complex are made from a single gene in mammals, the α subunit is encoded by two isogenes termed α<sub>A</sub> and α<sub>C</sub> that undergo alternative splicing in the brain. Recent data suggest that AP-2 can associate with LC3 via a putative LIR motif within the appendage domain of the AP-2α<sub>A</sub> subunit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. To probe whether AP-2 via its α-appendage domain directly binds to LC3 we carried out binding assays using purified proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a,c</xref>). Purified recombinant LC3 was found to bind to the GST-tagged appendage domains of both AP-2α and AP-2α<sub>C</sub> with a preference for AP-2α<sub>A</sub> over AP-2α<sub>C</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In line with this, endogenous AP-2α<sub>A/C</sub> co-purified with GST-LC3b (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>) in affinity chromatography experiments from brain lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), while, conversely, GST-AP-2α<sub>A</sub> and, less well, GST-AP-2α<sub>C</sub> associated with native LC3b (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Consistent with the preferential retrograde transport of AP-2-containing LC3-positive autophagosomes, we found endogenous AP-2 to co-immunoprecipitate with the p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunit of dynactin, a cofactor for the retrograde microtubule-based motor dynein, but not with the anterograde trafficking motor Kif5A from detergent-extracted rat brain lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Moreover, p150<sup>Glued</sup> expressed in HEK293T cells was able to capture the purified appendage domain of AP-2β in binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Finally, affinity purification of endogenous AP-2 using GST-fused Stonin 2 as a bait resulted in the co-purification of both LC3b and p150<sup>Glued</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>), suggesting that all three proteins act as part of a complex. Consistent with these biochemical data we observed the close colocalization of endogenous LC3b with p150<sup>Glued</sup> and AP-2 in neurons treated with folimycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e–h</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that AP-2 associates with LC3 and p150<sup>Glued</sup> in a protein complex that may mediate retrograde transport of autophagosomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>AP-2 regulates retrograde autophagosome transport in neurons</title>
<p>To test this hypothesis we probed whether AP-2 is functionally important for retrograde autophagosome transport by conditionally ablating expression of the essential AP-2μ subunit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> in neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Tamoxifen addition to DIV0 cultured hippocampal neurons isolated from newborn mice carrying floxed alleles of AP-2μ and expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (AP-2μ<sup>lox/lox</sup>:CAG-iCre) resulted in strongly reduced expression of neuronal AP-2 (monitored by its α subunit) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). The levels of other endocytic or presynaptic proteins analysed in brain lysates from conditional neuronal-confined AP-2 KO neurons (AP-2μ<sup>lox/lox</sup>:Tubα1-Cre mice; described in more detail below) were largely unaffected except for a small, yet statistically insignificant reduction of synaptotagmin 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c,d</xref>), an established AP-2 binding partner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p>
<p>We then monitored the transport of autophagosomes in wild-type (WT) and AP-2μ KO neurons expressing mRFP-eGFP-LC3 by live imaging. In WT neurons mRFP-labelled autophagosomes displayed bidirectional movements with an average retrograde velocity of about 0.4–0.5 μm s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a–c</xref>), similar to the values obtained for AP-2μ-mRFP with which it colocalizes (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) and consistent with earlier data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. AP-2μ deletion greatly reduced retrograde autophagosome velocity and the mobile fraction of retrograde LC3b-positive carriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>), while the fraction of stationary LC3b puncta was increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref>). In agreement with the function of dynein motors in slow anterograde movement, lack of neuronal AP-2 caused a mild, yet statistically insignificant reduction in anterograde autophagosome transport (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3e,g</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Transport of mitochondria proceeded unperturbed in absence of neuronal AP-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3h–k</xref>). These data suggest that AP-2 regulates retrograde transport of autophagosomes from neurites to the cell soma, where most lysosomes are located<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Consistent with this hypothesis and with our live imaging results analysis of AP-2μ KO neurons by thin-section electron microcopy revealed an accumulation of dense vesicular and concentric multilamellar organelles resembling late-stage autophagosomes (also termed amphisomes) post-fusion with late endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d–f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3o</xref> and below). As reported earlier<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, AP-2μ KO neurons displayed a reduced number of synaptic vesicles (to about 60% of those seen in WT), in agreement with its canonical function in synaptic vesicle reformation. The ‘spheroid-like' accumulation of late-stage autophagosomes in neurites and in the soma of AP-2μ KO compared to WT control neurons was confirmed by immunostaining with antibodies against endogenous LC3b and late endosomal Rab7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g–l</xref> for quantifications), indicating that the autophagosomal structures observed by light and electron microscopy have undergone fusion with late endosomes. In contrast, no significant alterations in the number or localization of early endosomes marked by Rab5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a,b</xref>) or LAMP1-positive late endosomes/lysosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3l–n</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c,d</xref>) were observed. To probe whether loss of AP-2 may alter LC3b synthesis and/or degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, we treated WT and KO neurons with the lysosomotropic agent folimycin. Folimycin application caused the accumulation of LC3b-positive puncta in WT neurons to reach levels similar to those seen in neurons lacking AP-2μ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3m</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4e</xref>). Thus, LC3b accumulation in absence of AP-2 does not appear to result from increased LC3b synthesis. A similar increase in folimycin-treated AP-2 KO neurons was observed for Rab7-positive puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3n</xref>). These results argue that the accumulation of late-stage autophagosomes in AP-2 KO neurons is caused by decreased degradation of LC3b/Rab7-positive autophagosomes due to their defective retrograde transport.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>AP-2 regulates autophagy independent of endocytosis</title>
<p>As decreased degradation of LC3b/Rab7-positive autophagosomes in the absence of AP-2μ might result from their defective delivery to lysosomes, we next probed the turnover of autophagosomes in the absence of AP-2μ using mRFP-eGFP-LC3 as a reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Serum deprivation caused an elevation of the mRFP/eGFP fluorescent ratio in WT neurons indicative of increased starvation-induced autophagic flux. In contrast, no significant changes in the mRFP/eGFP ratio were observed in AP-2μ KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4f</xref>). Moreover, AP-2 loss resulted in the accumulation of the autophagic adaptor and degradative substrate p62/SQSTM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>) that persisted upon inhibition of protein synthesis in the presence of cylcoheximide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4g</xref>), suggesting that it is the result of defective autophagosome turnover. Consistent with this, mTORC1 signalling measured by phospho-S6 kinase 1 and phospho-Raptor levels was not significantly changed in AP-2 KO brains, although we detected a slight increase in the total amount of S6 kinase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4h,i</xref>). These data suggest that autophagosome accumulation in absence of AP-2 is not a consequence of reduced mTORC1 activity, a key repressor of autophagosome formation.</p>
<p>Our results described thus far indicate that loss of AP-2 causes defective retrograde transport and accumulation of autophagosomes in neurons, likely via its association with p150<sup>Glued</sup> and with LC3. A prediction from this hypothesis is that AP-2 binding to LC3 is required for autophagosome transport and turnover. To test this directly we capitalized on a mutant variant of AP-2α<sub>A</sub> that due to mutational inactivation of its LIR motif fails to associate with LC3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Overexpression of LC3 binding-deficient mutant, but not WT AP-2α<sub>A</sub> in control neurons phenocopied AP-2μ loss with respect to defective mRFP-eGFP-LC3 conversion and retrograde autophagosome transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>). By contrast, mutant AP-2α<sub>A</sub> was perfectly capable of restoring defective clathrin-mediated endocytosis of transferrin in HeLa cells depleted of endogenous AP-2α<sub>A</sub> and AP-2α<sub>C</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g,h</xref>). Collectively, these data reveal a novel function for AP-2 in retrograde axonal transport of LC3/Rab7-containing autophagosomes in neurons that appears to be independent of its established role in endocytosis.</p>

<title>Autophagosome transport by AP-2 promotes neuronal complexity</title>
<p>What is the function of LC3/Rab7-containing autophagosomes trafficked retrogradely via complex formation of AP-2 with LC3? Previous data show that Rab7-positive organelles act as retrograde shuttling devices for active neurotrophins including BDNF and its main receptor TrkB (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) to mediate nuclear signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> and neuronal arborization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. To test this, we monitored the retrograde dynamics of TrkB-mRFP by live imaging. TrkB-mRFP was present on both large, as well as smaller diffraction-limited mobile puncta within the soma and in neurites of BDNF-stimulated neurons, where it colocalized with eGFP-LC3-positive autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 4</xref>). In the absence of BDNF the mobility of TrkB-mRFP puncta was greatly reduced in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>), but not in AP-2 KO neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>), suggesting that BDNF may induce the targeting of signalling-active TrkB to autophagosomes for AP-2/LC3/p150<sup>Glued</sup>-mediated transport. Consistent with this hypothesis we observed that TrkB-mRFP, as well as the active phosphorylated form of TrkB (pTrkB) and the TrkB signalling component growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) accumulated in LC3b-containing autophagosomes in the absence of AP-2μ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e–g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c–f</xref>). The levels of full-length TrkB and its truncated isoform T1 were elevated in brains of conditional AP-2μ KO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5g,h</xref>), which persisted upon inhibition of protein synthesis by cylcoheximide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5i,j</xref>), suggesting that it is the consequence of impaired turnover of stalled TrkB-containing autophagosomes. The levels of the p75NGF receptor, which can also be activated by BDNF, but is not coupled to the BDNF/TrkB signalling pathway were unaltered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5k–m</xref>). Importantly, AP-2μ loss significantly reduced the mobility of TrkB-mRFP puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5h–j</xref>), in line with their retrograde traffic via autophagosomes. Endocytosis of active TrkB proceeded in the absence of AP-2μ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5n–p</xref>), consistent with TrkB being internalized predominantly via EHD4/pincher-mediated macropinocytosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and with an endocytosis-independent role of AP-2 in retrograde transport of TrkB-containing autophagosomes. Collectively, these data indicate that AP-2 mediates retrograde transport of LC3-positive autophagosomes containing active TrkB.</p>
<p>Retrograde trafficking of TrkB from axons to the neuronal soma is required for neurotrophin signalling to promote neuronal arborization and complexity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Hence, defective retrograde transport of TrkB-containing autophagosomes in the absence of AP-2 would be expected to result in reduced neuronal complexity and impaired dendritic arborization. We directly tested this in hippocampal neurons from AP-2μ<sup>lox/lox</sup>:CAG-iCre mice, in which AP-2μ expression can be acutely abrogated by tamoxifen treatment. As predicted neuronal complexity was severely reduced in tamoxifen-treated AP-2 KO neurons (treated from DIV0) compared to mock-treated WT control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5k,l</xref>), a phenotype rescued by re-expression of AP-2μ at DIV8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5m</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a–c</xref>). Moreover, expression of LC3 binding-deficient AP-2α<sub>A</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5n</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6d,e</xref>) or partial depletion of the p150<sup>Glued</sup> subunit of dynactin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6f–i</xref>) in WT control neurons both phenocopied decreased neuronal complexity observed in neurons lacking AP-2μ, suggesting that retrograde axonal transport of TrkB-containing autophagosomes mediated by an AP-2/LC3/p150<sup>Glued</sup> complex is required for proper neuronal arborization. To test whether the loss of neuronal branching in DIV14 neurons results from a failure in neurite development or whether it is a consequence of dendrite pruning, we induced AP-2μ loss in fully developed neurons, by applying tamoxifen in cultured eGFP-expressing neurons at DIV8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6j</xref>). Conditional loss of AP-2μ induced at DIV8 significantly impaired the neuronal branching complexity of mature neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6k,l</xref>). These data suggest that loss of AP-2-mediated retrograde autophagosome transport induces post-developmental neurite pruning in cultured neurons.</p>
<p>A prediction from these data is that defective autophagosome maturation and, thus, impaired shuttling of TrkB signals should result in reduced neuronal complexity, akin to loss of AP-2 or p150<sup>Glued</sup> function. To test the prediction that reduced neuronal complexity is causally linked to defective TrkB-containing autophagosome transport, we conditionally deleted ATG5, an E3 ligase mediating early autophagosome expansion and maturation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, via tamoxifen-induced recombination in neurons from ATG5<sup>lox/lox</sup>:CAG-iCre mice (ATG5 KO). Conditional loss of ATG5 in hippocampal neurons in culture resulted in defective neuronal arborization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5o,p</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6m</xref>).

Loss of neurons in absence of AP-2 was mediated by apoptosis, as evidenced by the marked elevation of active caspase-3 in lysates from cultured AP-2 KO neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7e,f</xref>). Histological analysis of the temporal progression of neurodegeneration in conditional AP-2μ KO revealed that although the brain morphology of AP-2μ-deficient mice appeared normal at p4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7g,h,m</xref>), already at p7 first signs of neuronal loss were detectable in thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7i,j,n</xref>).

<title>Impaired BDNF-TrkB signalling in AP-2-deficient neurons</title>
<p>The data described thus far suggest a model according to which AP-2 promotes retrograde transport of LC3/Rab7-positive autophagosomes containing active TrkB complexes to convey distal BDNF signals to the soma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> and thereby promote neuronal complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). A major target of TrkB signalling is BDNF itself, the expression of which has recently been found to be under the control of a TrkB-mediated positive feedback loop<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Thus, if AP-2 loss indeed impairs TrkB signalling one would expect the expression of BDNF to be reduced in KO mice lacking neuronal AP-2. In agreement with this hypothesis, we found pro-BDNF and BDNF levels to be reduced by about 50% in AP-2 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7v,w</xref>). Given the positive feedback loop between TrkB signalling and BDNF expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, we analysed BDNF mRNA expression levels in WT and AP-2 KO neurons by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>). Strikingly, BDNF mRNA levels were significantly decreased in the absence of AP-2 compared to WT controls, in agreement with defective TrkB signalling due to stalled autophagosome transport in AP-2 KO neurons. We reasoned that defective arborization of AP-2μ KO neurons should be rescued by boosting BDNF signalling through exogenous application of BDNF. In this setting bath application of BDNF in mass cultures of AP-2 KO neurons is expected to activate their soma-confined TrkB receptors, thereby eliminating the necessity for retrograde transport along the axon. Sustained application of BDNF indeed was sufficient to rescue defective dendritic arborization in the absence of AP-2μ, while it had no effect on the number of branches in WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e,f</xref>), in agreement with published data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Under similar conditions nerve growth factor (NGF) application failed to rescue the reduced neuronal complexity in AP-2μ-deficient neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7g</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together our results reveal a novel function for AP-2 in BDNF/TrkB signalling via promoting retrograde transport of TrkB-containing autophagosomes. As retrograde transport of TrkB-containing endosomes is required for neurotrophins to exert their transcriptional regulation of activity-dependent genes, most notably of BDNF (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>), in the nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, the loss of neuronal complexity and subsequent neurodegeneration in AP-2 KO mice is likely the consequence of defective BDNF gene transcriptional regulation due to impaired retrograde autophagosome transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results reveal a novel function of autophagosomes as retrograde shuttles for TrkB-signalling complexes in neurites to promote neuronal branching and to prevent neurodegeneration. We show that TrkB-signalling endosomes, proposed to convey distal BDNF signals to the soma more than 15 years ago<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, may in fact correspond to late-stage LC3/Rab7-positive autophagosomes containing active TrkB complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). In neurons, unlike non-neuronal cells, the formation of autophagosomes and their turnover by fusion with lysosomes is spatially segregated as autophagosomes form in distal axons and mature during their retrograde transport along microtubules to the cell soma, which contains the majority of lysosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. This arrangement allows neurons to integrate TrkB/BDNF signals from their distal axons to spatiotemporally instruct neuronal branching and to allow for survival via a positive feedback loop that in turn controls BDNF expression, while active TrkB complexes may eventually undergo lysosome-mediated degradation upon their arrival in the neuronal soma. Together with the observation that distal autophagosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> have not yet been acidified and are proteolytically inactive, this predicts that premature acidification of TrkB-containing autophagosomes impairs TrkB/BDNF signalling and, thus, neuronal circuit development (consistent with ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Indeed, recent data have shown that overacidification of TrkB-containing organelles in the absence of the Christianson syndrome protein NHE6, an Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger known to underlie postnatal microcephaly, intellectual disability, epilepsy and autism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, results in defective neuronal arborization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> akin to loss of AP-2 or ATG5 reported here.</p>
<p>Retrograde axonal transport of TrkB-containing autophagosomes to the soma is promoted by a protein complex comprising the autophagy protein LC3, the dynein activator p150<sup>Glued</sup> and the endocytic adaptor AP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>), a protein hitherto thought to be exclusively involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and reformation of synaptic vesicles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Several lines of evidence suggest that the function of AP-2 in retrograde axonal transport of TrkB-containing autophagosomes is independent of its established role in endocytosis. First, AP-2 is associated and co-trafficked with autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) containing active TrkB receptors post-internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Second, and consistent with this, we find AP-2 to be largely dispensable for BDNF-induced TrkB endocytosis in cultured neurons (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5n–p</xref>). Third, we show that defective retrograde transport and accumulation of autophagosomes in neurons in absence of AP-2μ is phenocopied by overexpression of an LC3 binding-deficient mutant version of AP-2α<sub>A</sub> that is fully functional with respect to endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Finally, we demonstrate that AP-2 via distinct subunits directly associates with LC3 and with p150<sup>Glued</sup> independent of its association with endocytic proteins. The LC3-AP-2-p150<sup>Glued</sup> complex likely is of special importance in neurons, where autophagosomes are transported over large distances and with high precision and speed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. A role of AP-2 in neuronal branching is supported by data from mammalian neurons and from <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggesting a key role for AP-2-associated kinase 1, a crucial activator of AP-2, in dendrite arborization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Interestingly, recent data have identified an endocytosis-independent role for the endocytic protein endophilin in neuronal autophagosome formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>, for example, upstream of the function of AP-2 in autophagosome transport described in this study. How AP-2 switches between its functions in endocytosis and retrograde transport of TrkB-containing autophagosomes remains to be determined.</p>
<p>It is possible, if not likely, that additional factors besides AP-2 act as adaptors for retrograde dynein-based motor complexes to shuttle TrkB-containing autophagosomes to the neuronal soma. These include the Snapin subunit of BLOC-1, which has been postulated to bind to dynein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> or JIP1, a multifunctional adaptor implicated in both antero- as well as retrograde movement of autophagosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. These factors could either cooperate with AP-2, for example, to coordinate recruitment of both dynein and p150<sup>Glued</sup>/dynactin, or else distinct retrograde adaptors may operate in distal versus proximal axons. Future studies will be needed to distinguish between these possibilities. Irrespective of the precise molecular mechanisms the identification of autophagosomes as shuttling devices to convey TrkB/BDNF signals to the neuronal soma adds a new facette to the functions of autophagy. Based on our results we predict that autophagy-inducing agents such as polyamines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref> may act as potent therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative and age-associated nervous system disorders, that are often known to be associated with defective axonal transport<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>, by mediating TrkB/BDNF signalling.</p>

The pulsed 775-nm STED laser was triggered by the WLL. Within each independent experiment, samples were acquired with equal settings. Alexa 488 and Alexa 532 were excited using a pulsed WLL at 488 and 545 nm, respectively. Depletion occurred at 592 nm. Fluorescence signals were detected sequentially by hybrid detectors at appropriate spectral regions separated from the STED laser by corresponding dichroic filters. Images were acquired with an HC PL APO CS2 × 100/1.40-N.A. oil objective (Leica Microsystems), a scanning format of 1,024 × 1,024, eight-bit sampling, and 4.5 zoom, yielding a pixel dimension of 25.25 nm and 25.25 nm in the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> dimensions, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficients were determined in ROIs (5.1 × 4.3 μm) using the Intensity Correlation Analysis function from the Colocalization Macro in ImageJ (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>).</p>

<title>Sholl analysis of cultured neurons</title>
<p>Neurons were transfected with eGFP on DIV 8. In case the cells were treated with growth factors (BDNF and NGF, both Peprotech), these factors were added on DIV 7 at 50 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>. Cells were either fixed on DIV 14/15 for AP-2μ KO and control neurons, or on DIV20-22 for ATG5 KO and control neurons and processed as above. In case homologous recombination was induced at DIV8, AP-2 KO neurons were fixed on DIV19-20. Neurons were imaged with a Leica SP5 confocal microscope using a Plan-Apochromat × 63/1.32 oil DIC objective, corrected for both chromatic and spherical aberrations. Neurons were scanned at a resolution of 1,024 × 1,024, eight-bit sampling, zoom 1 and z-increment of 0.5 μm. Sholl analysis of single cells was performed using the ImageJ Sholl Analysis Macro. The complexity of neuronal branching was calculated by summing the number of intersections within 200 μm from the cell body.</p>

<title>Live imaging of cultured neurons</title>
<p>Neurons were imaged on 12–16 DIV using an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope with a × 40 oil-immersion objective, temperature-controlled stage (37 °C) and a CCD camera. Time-lapse images of neurons expressing TrkB-mRFP and/or mRFP-eGFP-LC3 were acquired every second using Slidebook (Improvision Germany, Göttingen) for 30 s. For starvation experiments, neurons were kept in serum-free media for 3 h before imaging. Individual particles were manually identified in Slidebook. Particle tracking analysis of individual particles was done using the Particle tracking protocol in Slidebook, and individual tracks obtained were verified manually. The mean speed of individual particles was calculated by determining the mean square displacement between each pair of sequential frames averaged over all frames. Kymographs were generated using the corresponding module in Slidebook. Frequency distribution analysis was done in Excel (Microsoft).</p>

<title>Immunohistochemical analysis of brain sections</title>
<p>Mice were killed on postnatal days 3, 7, 14 or 18–21 by an overdose of ketamin/rompun (i.p., 10 μl per 10 g body weight) and transcardially perfused with 50 ml saline solution (0.85% NaCl, 0.025% KCl, 0.02% NaHCO3, pH 6.9, 0.01% heparin, body temperature), followed by 50 ml cold (7–15 °C) freshly depolymerized 4% (wt/vol) PFA (Merck) in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4. Brains were carefully taken out of the skull, postfixed overnight in the same fixative, and placed in a mixture of 20% (vol/vol) glycerol and 2% (vol/vol) dimethylsulfoxide (VWR International) in 0.4 M PBS for 24 h for cryoprotection. Frozen horizontal, coronal or sagittal sections (40 μm) were collected in six series in 0.1 M PBS. For immunostaining, corresponding hippocampal sections from WT and KO littermates were processed simultaneously. Sections from the second series were washed three times in PBS (3 × 15 min each), followed by washing several times in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (9 × 20 min each). Sections were preincubated with PBS containing 5% (vol/vol) NGS and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h and subsequently incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C for 48 h (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for a list of antibodies). Then, sections were washed nine times for 20 min each in 0.3% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PBS and incubated with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:400) for 12 h using standard techniques. Finally, sections were mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides. Sections were imaged at a resolution of 1,024 × 1,024, with eight-bit sampling (no z increment was used) with a Leica SP5 confocal microscope using a Plan-Apochromat × 63/1.32 oil DIC objective, corrected for both chromatic and spherical aberrations. Fluorescent puncta were determined in the background-substracted ROI (90 × 83 μm) by using the autothreshold ‘Max Enthropy' algorithm implemented in ImageJ and analysed using the ‘Analyze particles' ImageJ module to determine the number of fluorescent puncta per μm<sup>2</sup>.

<title>TrkB endocytosis assay in cultured neurons</title>
<p>Hippocampal WT and AP-2 KO neurons were prepared as described above and transfected on DIV 8 with eGFP-TrkB. On DIV 13 coverslips were rinsed once in 1 ml osmolarity-adjusted serum-free NBA-containing medium. To induce antibody uptake neurons were incubated for 15 min or, alternatively, for 30 min at 37 °C in pre-warmed 70 μl serum-free medium supplemented with 50 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> human BDNF (Peprotech) and 1:500 diluted GFP-antibody (polyclonal rabbit, Abcam, ab6556). Control condition corresponded to the incubation for 30 min at 4 °C in pre-cooled antibody/BDNF solution. After the indicated time points coverslips were transferred to a new well plate containing ice-cold PBS and washed once for 1 min with ice-cold 0.2 M acetic acid and 0.5 M NaCl in MQ. After two additional on/off washing steps with ice-cold PBS neurons were fixed for 10 min at RT with 4% PFA/4% sucrose and washed three times with PBS. Subsequently cells were blocked in PBS supplemented with 10% NGS (blocking buffer) under non-permeabilizing conditions for 30 min. The surface-bound antibody pool was immunostained by incubation with goat-anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 coupled antibody (Invitrogen, 1:100 in blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the cells were washed three times in PBS and postfixed for 10 min at RT with 2% PFA/2% sucrose followed by three PBS washes. To identify the internalized antibody pool the neurons were permeabilized, blocked in the blocking buffer supplemented with 0.3% TX-100 for 20 min and immunostained with goat anti rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 labelled secondary antibodies (1:200, blocking buffer supplemented with 0.3% Tx) for 30 min at RT. Coverslips were washed three times with PBS and mounted using Immumount. Cells were imaged using a Leica SP8 and analysed using ImageJ. The amount of internalized eGFP-TrkB receptors was calculated by taking the ratio between the mean grey value of internalized GFP antibody over the mean grey value of total expression levels of eGFP-TrkB.</p>

<title>Loss of neuronal complexity in AP-2μ-deficient neurons results from reduced TrkB signalling to control expression of BDNF.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Hypothetical model for the role of AP-2 in retrograde transport of TrkB-containing autophagosomes in neurons. In WT neurons, AP-2 via its association with LC3 and p150<sup>Glued</sup> mediates retrograde transport of BDNF/TrkB-containing amphisomes (late-stage autophagosomes post-fusion with Rab7-positive late endosomes) to the cell body, where TrkB signalling regulates transcription of activity-dependent genes in the nucleus. In the absence of AP-2 (KO) TrkB endocytosis proceeds, however BDNF/TrkB-mediated signalling is defective due to impaired retrograde transport of BDNF/TrkB-containing autophagosomes. Stalled late-satge autophagosomes in neurites of AP-2 KO neurons cause axonal swellings and underlie neurodegeneration. (<bold>b</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of BDNF expression levels in brain lysates from WT or conditional AP-2μ KO mice. Note that AP-2α remaining in the KO brains is largely derived from AP-2 expressed in glial cells not targeted by Cre. See also the levels of pro-BDNF in WT and AP-2 KO neurons in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7v</xref>. (<bold>c</bold>) BDNF levels are significantly reduced in AP-2 KO brains. BNDF levels in WT were set to 100% (<italic>n</italic>=3 mice per genotype, *<italic>P</italic>=0.0158). (<bold>d</bold>) BDNF mRNA levels are significantly decreased in AP-2 KO neurons (WT: 99.9±0.02%, KO: 72.1±1.12%, **<italic>P</italic>=0.02). (<bold>e</bold>–<bold>g</bold>) Reduced neuronal complexity of AP-2μ-deficient neurons is rescued by long-term BDNF application. (<bold>e</bold>) AP-2μ KO neurons expressing eGFP were treated for 7 days with 50 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> BDNF or left untreated. Scale bars, 100 μm. (<bold>f</bold>) Application of BDNF rescues the number of branching points in neurons lacking AP-2μ compared to untreated controls (KO+BDNF: 66.65±24.19, KO untreated: 34.87±11.19, *<italic>P</italic>=0.046). No difference in the number of branching points between untreated and BDNF-treated WT neurons was observed (WT+BDNF: 84.74±21.49, WT untreated 80.86±11.96, <italic>P</italic>=0.882, <italic>n</italic>=3 experiments, 21–23 neurons per condition).
