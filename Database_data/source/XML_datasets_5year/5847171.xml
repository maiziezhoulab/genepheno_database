<title>Summary</title>
<p>Interneurons navigate along multiple tangential paths to settle into appropriate cortical layers. They undergo a saltatory migration paced by intermittent nuclear jumps whose regulation relies on interplay between extracellular cues and genetic-encoded information. It remains unclear how cycles of pause and movement are coordinated at the molecular level. Post-translational modification of proteins contributes to cell migration regulation. The present study uncovers that carboxypeptidase 1, which promotes post-translational protein deglutamylation, controls the pausing of migrating cortical interneurons. Moreover, we demonstrate that pausing during migration attenuates movement simultaneity at the population level, thereby controlling the flow of interneurons invading the cortex. Interfering with the regulation of pausing not only affects the size of the cortical interneuron cohort but also impairs the generation of age-matched projection neurons of the upper layers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="p0030">Cell migration has a fundamental role in the formation of complex tissue structures, such as the brain, which involves a precise temporal and spatial migration of different cell types. Cellular models have demonstrated that the nature of the cell movement can influence population dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barber et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Villar-Cerviño et al., 2013</xref>). Migration brings together projection neurons (PNs) and interneurons (INs) in the cerebral cortex: PNs migrate radially within the cortical wall, whereas INs originate from the ventral forebrain and reach the cortex by moving along tangential paths. In contrast to a steadier motion of PNs undergoing somal translocation or locomotion on radial glial fibers to settle in the cortical plate, INs undergo a stereotypic two-stroke cycle of migration, switching from sharp periods of movement to pauses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellion et al., 2005</xref>). At the molecular level, the migration of cINs and PNs relies on the microtubule (MT) and actomyosin cytoskeletons that integrate extracellular signals governing directed migration and that generate the forces required for cell movement. MT polymerization is required for the extension of the leading process whereas actomyosin dynamic directs the centrosomal displacement and nuclear movement referred to as nucleokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellion et al., 2005</xref>). It is intriguing how these two neuronal populations, despite using similar cellular machineries, migrate using distinct types of choreography. Moreover, it remains unclear how these different migratory behaviors contribute to the exquisite organization of the cerebral cortex. Several studies have explored the contribution of cytoskeleton-regulatory proteins to tangential migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Godin et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kappeler et al., 2006</xref>), but none of them provided a physiological significance to the saltatory motion of cIN migration.</p>
<p id="p0035">Post-translational modifications (PTM) of proteins are important for central cellular processes such as cell migration. Indeed, genetic manipulations preventing the activity of PTM enzymes have been associated with neuronal migration defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Creppe et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hahn et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that some key proteins involved in cell motility undergo post-translational regulation. Here, we explored the contribution of protein polyglutamylation, which occurs on a variety of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tanco et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van Dijk et al., 2008</xref>). We found that several enzymes regulating (de)glutamylation from the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like family (TTLLs) or cytosolic carboxypeptidases (CCPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Janke et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">van Dijk et al., 2007</xref>) are expressed in the subpallium where newborn cINs accumulate before entering into the cortex. One striking feature of CCPs is that they remove not only glutamate side chains generated by polyglutamylation but also gene-encoded polyglutamate stretches at carboxy termini of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rogowski et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tort et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we show that the genetic disruption of <italic>Ccp1</italic> (<italic>Agtpbp1</italic>), the major deglutamylating enzyme expressed in cINs, modifies their migration mode without affecting average velocity. At the molecular level, we found that loss of CCP1 induces cytoskeletal changes leading to a significant decrease of pause duration, thereby converting the saltatory migration of cINs into a treadmill-like motion. This switch of migration mode reduces randomness in movement timings at the population level, thereby leading to higher recruitment of cINs into the cortical wall. We also show that the cortex detects the overflow of cINs and fine-tunes the size of the age-matched PN population by scaling cortical progenitor proliferation. Altogether, our study demonstrates that a tight intrinsic regulation of pausing in migrating cINs has a pivotal role in controlling neocortex histogenesis.</p>

<title>Conditional Loss of Ccp1 in Cortical Interneurons Converts Saltatory Migration into a Steadier Motion</title>
<p id="p0040">Glutamylation is a major PTM of microtubules (MTs) in neurons that serves as a signaling code for modulating protein function according to the size of the polyglutamate chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Janke, 2014</xref>). The length and complexity of glutamate side chains are controlled by the coordinated activity of enzymes performing glutamylation (TTLL proteins) or deglutamylation (CCP proteins). TTLL4, TTLL5, and TTLL7 add the branching point glutamate, while TTLL1, TTLL6, TTLL11, and TTLL13 promote glutamate chain elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Janke et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">van Dijk et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, CCP5 has higher specificity in removing the branching point glutamate on lateral chains while CCP1, CCP2–CCP4, and CCP6 deglutamylate lateral or gene-encoded polyglutamate chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rogowski et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tort et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we found that the leading process of migrating cINs showed detectable levels of glutamylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>A). <italic>Dlx5/6</italic>-positive subpallial structures express several <italic>Ttll</italic> and <italic>Ccp</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>B). <italic>Ccp1</italic>, which codes for the main glutamate chain deglutamylase, is specifically enriched in the SVZ and mantle zone of GEs where cINs migrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>C). CCP1 is mainly detected in the growth cones and around the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>D). According to its expression pattern, and because targeting CCP5 or TTLL1 have a major impact on MTs function by dramatically modifying glutamylation patterns, we conditionally invalidated <italic>Ccp1</italic> from newborn cINs. <italic>Ccp1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice were crossed with <italic>Dlx5-6</italic> Cre-GFP mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stenman et al., 2003</xref>) to remove the catalytic domain of CCP1 in most forebrain GABAergic neurons (further named CCP1 conditional knockout [cKO]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1</xref>A). <italic>Ccp1</italic> invalidation was not genetically compensated by changes in expression level of other <italic>Ttlls</italic> and <italic>Ccps</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>B). Western blotting showed accumulation of hyperglutamylated MTs in CCP1 cKO medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) extracts, as detected by GT335 and PolyE antibodies, recognizing either the branching point glutamate or linear, carboxy-terminal glutamate stretches containing at least 3 glutamate amino acids (3E+) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rogowski et al., 2010</xref>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>F and 1G; percentage of change, GT335: +87%, p = 0.035; PolyE: +127.1%, p = 0.0025). These results were further confirmed by immunolabeling of CCP1 cKO or wild-type (WT) cINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>H).<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CCP1 Promotes the Saltatory Migration of cINs</p><p>(A) Immunodetection of polyglutamate side chains (GT335 antibody) on cINs explants. cINs express Cre-GFP and nuclei are counterstained with DAPI.

<p id="p0045">Time-lapse recordings were performed on MGE explants from E13.5 CCP1 WT or cKO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Movie S1</xref>), cultured for 1 day <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) on mixed cortical feeder. While we did not observe defects of growth cone splitting or differences in the numbers and length of neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figures S1</xref>C–S1E), migrating CCP1 cKO cINs extended secondary neurites with longer life duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>I and 1J; percentage of change, +40%, p &lt; 0.0001). This phenotype was correlated with accumulation of acetylated tubulin, which marks long-lived MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>K and 1L; percentage of change, +41%, p = 0.029). The migration of cINs analyzed by tracking nucleokinesis in organotypic slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>M), revealed that cINs from both genotypes move at comparable average speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>N) and with similar nucleokinesis frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>F), but of shorter amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>O, percentage of change, −13%, p = 0.0015). In addition, nuclei of CCP1 cKO cINs spend less time pausing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>P; percentage of change, −13%, p = 0.0011), thereby undergoing sliding movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>M, red arrows indicate continuous nuclear movements that are not considered as nucleokinesis events). Position of the centroid of a migrating cIN varies with time because it constantly grows and retracts processes during migration. We plotted the centroid displacement over time and found that, similar to the nucleus behavior, it pauses less frequently upon <italic>Ccp1</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figures S1</xref>G–S1I). Altogether, these data suggest that CCP1 is a pivotal enzyme expressed by cINs to control saltatory migration. Furthermore, overexpression of <italic>Ccp1</italic>, or its catalytic dead form, does not change the average speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>J), the pausing time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>K) or the directionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>L) of migrating cINs.</p>

<title>CCP1 Regulates Actomyosin Dynamics</title>
<p id="p0050">While migrating, CCP1 cKO cINs show minor impairment of MT-dependent neurite stability but exhibit dramatic nucleokinesis defects. Although (de)glutamylation has been mostly associated with MTs, it is now recognized that deglutamylase-sensitive C-terminal gene-encoded glutamate chains are present on proteins with function ranging from intracellular signaling to cytoskeleton regulation. The nucleokinesis of cINs mostly relies on actomyosin contractility that propels their nucleus forward to pace migration. Despite minor alteration of second order branch lifetime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>I and 1J), the nucleokinesis defects of CCP1 cKO cINs likely arise from poor regulation of actomyosin contraction. To test this hypothesis, we monitored actin dynamics during migration by expressing LifeAct-Ruby in cINs. In cINs these regions are the nuclear rear, the swelling preceding nucleokinesis, and the growth cone. We observed an enlargement of the contraction area behind the nucleus that adopted a cup-like shape in CCP1 cKO cINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>A and 2B; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc2">Movie S2</xref>; percentage of change, +110%, p &lt; 0.0001). Larger areas of actomyosin contraction result in less efficient nuclear movement due to dispersion of vector forces around the nucleus. Actomyosin contraction also controls centrosomal motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Solecki et al., 2009</xref>), and the nucleus-to-centrosome distance of CCP1 cKO cINs was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>C; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc3">Movie S3</xref>; percentage of change, −26%, p = 0.0373). Altogether, these differences support actomyosin dynamic defects upon loss of CCP1 in cINs. The subcellular localization of CCP1 in cINs coincides with regions of intense actomyosin remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>D). Actomyosin contraction requires phosphorylation of the regulatory myosin light chain (MLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Somlyo and Somlyo, 2003</xref>). Indeed, the level of MLC phosphorylation is dramatically increased in CCP1 cKO cINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>D and 2E; percentage of change, +568%, p = 0.0006). MLC phosphorylation is sustained through the RhoA pathway where ROCK kinase phosphorylates MLC directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amano et al., 1996</xref>) or indirectly by decreasing the activity of the myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kimura et al., 1996</xref>). This pathway also controls indirectly actomyosin contractions by promoting the activity of LIM kinase, which further inhibits cofilin and thus prevents actin severing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 1998</xref>). Our analysis did not reveal difference in RhoA activation in E13.5 WT and CCP1 cKO cINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2</xref>A). Moreover, protein levels of major actomyosin regulators remained unchanged between E13.5 CCP1 cKO or CCP1 WT MGE extracts (PRIDE: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="intref0010" xlink:href="pride:PXD006397">PXD006397</ext-link>). Analysis of globular (G) to filamentous (F) actin ratio suggested that the actin network was not altered in CCP1 cKO cINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>F, 2G, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2</xref>B). Another regulator of MLC phosphorylation is MLC kinase (MLCK), whose expression was similar in cINs of both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2</xref>C). We thus postulated that the modification of actomyosin contractility in CCP1 cKO cINs might originate from differences in MLCK activity rather than changes in expression.<fig id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>CCP1 Regulates Actomyosin Contraction by Processing MLCK</p><p>(A) Co-culture of migrating cINs from CCP1 WT and cKO electroporated with pCAGGS-LifeAct-Ruby.

<title>CCP1 Controls Pausing of cINs by Enzymatic Regulation of MLCK Activity</title>
<p id="p0055">MLCK contains a C-terminal stretch of 8 glutamates that can be processed by CCPs <italic>in vitro</italic> (CCP1, CCP4, and CCP6) and give rise to a range of shorter forms of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rogowski et al., 2010</xref>). Because <italic>Ccp1</italic> is enriched in cINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>B), we tested whether such processing would occur <italic>in vivo</italic>. For this purpose, MLCK western blot and pull-down from MGE extracts of E13.5 CCP1 cKO or CCP1 WT mice were analyzed with polyE antibodies to detect MLCK containing at least 3 glutamates (MLCK-3E<sup>+</sup>) or anti-Δ2-tubulin antibodies to detect MLCK-1E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rogowski et al., 2010</xref>). We detected an increased polyE signal on MLCK immunoprecipitates from CCP1 cKO MGEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>I and 2J, percentage of change, +133%, p = 0.0088), and a complementary reduced signal with Δ2-tubulin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>K, percentage of change, −28%, p = 0.0424), suggesting accumulation of MLCK-3E<sup>+</sup> at the expense of MLCK-1E. We next assessed whether MLCK was also processed by TTLL1, the predominant MTs glutamylase expressed by cINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>B). MGE extracts of E13.5 TTLL1 cKO and WT were processed by ELISA. We detected equal distribution of signals for Δ2-tubulin and polyE immunoreactivity on MCLK immunoprecipitates, which strongly suggests that TTLL1 cannot glutamylate MLCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figures S2</xref>D and S2E).</p>
<p id="p0060">To test whether MLCK processing by CCP1 alters its enzymatic activity, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> activity assays of MLCK isolated from HEK293T expressing either MLCK-3E<sup>+</sup> or MLCK-1E. After pull down, MLCK activity was measured by ATP consumption upon MRCL3 peptide phosphorylation. The kinase activity of MLCK-1E was 60% lower compared to the corresponding long form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>L, p = 0.0068). Therefore, by reducing MLCK activity via enzymatic processing and without affecting its expression in migrating cINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>I; PRIDE: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="intref0015" xlink:href="pride:PXD006397">PXD006397</ext-link>), CCP1 might control nuclear movement during the stereotypic two-stroke cycle of migration. To test this hypothesis, we treated cultured MGE explants from CCP1 WT or CCP1 cKO cINs with ML7, a selective inhibitor of MLCK. ML7 treatment rescued pause duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>M and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2</xref>F; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc4">Movie S4</xref>), amplitude of nucleokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>N and 2O; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc4">Movie S4</xref>), as well as the maximum nucleus-centrosome distance in CCP1 cKO cINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>C).</p>
<p id="p0065">In the absence of CCP1 activity, several proteins accumulate long glutamate chains, most of them generated by glutamylases, which might modulate their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Janke, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van Dijk et al., 2008</xref>). To test if MLCK glutamylation status is a predominant regulator of cINs migration, we rescued general levels of protein glutamylation in CCP1 cKO cINs by expressing inducible small hairpin RNA (shRNA) that target <italic>Ttll1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2</xref>G). Acute reduction of TTLL1 in WT cINs decreased glutamylation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figures S2</xref>H and S2I). Lowering <italic>Ttll1</italic> expression in cINs from E13.5 CCP1 cKO did not change their average speed of migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2</xref>J) but worsen their migration phenotype by further reducing the pausing time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2</xref>K). Targeting <italic>Ttll1</italic> in a CCP1 cKO background did not rescue the size of actomyosin contraction area behind the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2</xref>L). Altogether, these results show that MLCK activity can be tuned by deglutamylation, however, the protein cannot be re-glutamylated by TTLL1, the major glutamylase expressed in interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>B). Moreover, they suggest that conversion of the CCP1 cKO cINs migration mode is mainly resulting from dysregulation of MLCK activity, which depends on the length of its carboxy-terminal glutamate stretch.</p>

<p id="p0070">We investigated how loss of <italic>Ccp1</italic> expression affects cIN migration <italic>in vivo</italic>. During development, cINs migrate from the subpallium to the pallium and by E13.5, some have already crossed the corticostriatal barrier (CSB) to enter into the developing cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>A).

<p id="p0080">In order to study the respective contribution of MGE and CGE to the supernumerary cINs invading the cortex of CCP1 cKO, we performed birth-dating analyses 48 hr after 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) injection at different developmental stages (E11.5, E13.5, and E15.5). Higher numbers of EdU<sup>+</sup>;GFP<sup>+</sup> cINs were observed at all rostro-caudal levels in the cortex of CCP1 cKO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>E and 3F; percentage of change at E11.5–E13.5, +45%, p = 0.018; E13.5–E15.5, +20.6%, p = 0.028; E15.5–E17.5, +30%, p = 0.029). This suggests that supernumerary cINs in CCP1 cKO are generated from both MGE and CGE. We further confirmed that the expression pattern of core genes required for the specification and migration of cINs remained unchanged in CCP1 cKO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figures S4</xref>D–S4H). The MGE also produces striatal INs (sINs) whose sorting depends on cortical repulsion and striatal attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marín et al., 2001</xref>). To assess whether supernumerary cINs seen upon <italic>Ccp1</italic> deletion might correspond to mis-positioned sINs, we quantified the density of GFP<sup>+</sup>; Calbindin<sup>+</sup> cINs in CTIP2<sup>+</sup> striatal regions and found no differences between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figures S5</xref>A and S5B). Because additional brain regions are seeded by GABAergic neurons derived from <italic>Dlx5-6</italic>-expressing progenitors, we measured the expression level of genes selectively expressed by these neurons in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified cINs from microdissected cortices of E15.5 CCP1 WT and CCP1 cKO.

FACS analyses revealed that the total number of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the brain of E14.5 CCP1 cKO and WT embryos was comparable (±1.6 × 10<sup>6</sup>). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased number of cINs invading the cortex of CCP1 cKO embryos does not arise from differences of generation, survival, specification, or rerouting.

<title>Cell-Intrinsic Migration Properties Control the Rate of cINs Cortical Invasion</title>
<p id="p0090">Loss of CCP1 activity in cINs converts their saltatory biphasic mode of migration into a steady monophasic migration. While cINs of both genotypes migrate at the same average speed, pause duration, and instantaneous speed were significantly reduced in migrating CCP1 cKO cINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>A and 5B). To test whether differences of kinetic properties of migration lead to an increased sorting of CCP1 cKO cINs in the developing cortex, we generated trial surrogates of cellular motion using distributions of kinetic parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>A and 5B). We simulated 20 realizations of two groups, A and B, of hundred surrogates with kinetic parameters similar to those observed <italic>in vitro</italic> for CCP1 WT cINs and CCP1 cKO cINs, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc5">Movie S5</xref>). One such realization displays reduced pause durations in group B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>D) as compared to group A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>C). We found that at the end of a simulation time of 10 hr, a significantly higher percentage of group B surrogate cells had crossed the lower displacement thresholds compared to that found in group A, while there was no significant difference between the two groups for higher displacement thresholds (&gt;350 μm). Preserving identical distributions of instantaneous speeds for groups A and B showed significant difference in the percentage of cells crossing all displacement thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>E–5H). Therefore, these data-driven simulations demonstrate that the reduced pausing of CCP1 cKO cINs increases their recruitment at short distances from the starting location despite a compensatory effect of lower instantaneous speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>E and 5F).<fig id="fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><italic>In Silico</italic> Modeling of cINs Migration Supports Enhanced Invasion of CCP1 cKO cINs</p><p>(A and B) Frequencies of occurrence of pause duration (A) and instantaneous speeds (B) measured in organotypic slice cultures from CCP1 WT and cKO.</p><p>(C and D) Movement phase densities (moving: colored, non-moving: white) for 100 cell surrogates of group A (C) and group B (D) as a function of simulated time, in one realization.

<title>Fine-Tuning of Cortical Invasion by cINs Controls Dorsal Cortical Neurogenesis</title>
<p id="p0100">We have shown that the invasion of the cortical wall by cINs is modulated by changes in cell-intrinsic migration properties during development. However, the physiological role of a regulated sorting of cINs in the developing cortex remains unknown. To uncover such potential role, we analyzed the cellular properties of the cortical wall during its invasion by cINs. The neuronal cell output of dorsal progenitors was analyzed 48 hr after EdU injection, revealing a higher number of EdU<sup>+</sup>;GFP<sup>−</sup> cells in E13.5 CCP1 cKO cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>A and 6C). We observed a strong correlation between numbers of EdU<sup>+</sup>; GFP<sup>−</sup> PNs and cINs present in selected cortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>B and 6C). The Pearson correlation coefficient was significant between these two parameters (r = 0.9397; p = 0.0002), showing that cortical regions containing a higher density of cINs have higher proliferation rates. We next assessed the fraction of cycling Sox2<sup>+</sup> apical progenitors (APs) and Tbr2<sup>+</sup> intermediate progenitors (IPs) located close to the CSB where cINs migrate. The proportions of APs and IPs were similar between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>D and 6E) but only the rate of IPs undergoing S-phase (1-hr EdU pulse) was increased in the cortical wall of E13.5 CCP1 cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>D, 6F, and 6G). We next performed a sequential double injection of thymidine analogs, CldU and EdU at E13.5, which demonstrated that while the cell-cycle length (Tc) of IPs was decreased, no change in S-phase duration (Ts) occurred upon loss of CCP1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figures S6</xref>A–S6C). To test whether the cycling behavior of IPs was sensitive to a reduction of cortical invasion by cINs, we monitored these parameters in <italic>Nkx2-1</italic> knockout (KO) mice that suffer from strong reduction of migrating cINs in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butt et al., 2008</xref>). The analysis of cycling parameters of E13.5 <italic>Nkx2-1</italic> KO and WT mice revealed a selective reduction of IPs undergoing S-phase (Tbr2<sup>+</sup>; EdU<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>H–6K). Cortical IPs populate the upper VZ and lower IZ where we observed many supernumerary cINs migrating in CCP1 cKO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>C, 3D, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6</xref>D). To assess the possible contact between both cell population, we performed super-resolution analyses of brain sections from E15.5 CCP1 WT and CCP1 cKO embryos dorsally electroporated with mbCherry. We observed a close apposition of cIN processes and the membrane of some Tbr2<sup>+</sup> IPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6</xref>E). In order to decipher whether a cellular contact between cINs and IPs is required to control their proliferation, we designed <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. Cortical progenitor cultures enriched in IPs were maintained 1DIV with or without homochronic explants of MGE-derived cINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6</xref>F). The explants were either seeded on the cortical progenitor cultures (co-culture) or in Millicell inserts to avoid direct contact. Proliferation of IPs was measured after a short pulse of EdU (30 min). While proliferation of Sox2<sup>+</sup> APs was similar across culture conditions (data not shown), we observed a larger fraction of cycling Tbr2<sup>+</sup> IPs in cultures containing cINs explants. Importantly, direct contact was not required to stimulate IPs proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figures S6</xref>F–S6H; percentage of change of proliferation in co-cultures: cINs CCP1 WT +62%, cINs CCP1 cKO +66%; in Millicel inserts: cINs CCP1 WT +55%, cINs CCP1 cKO +64%). Interestingly, cINs from CCP1 WT embryos or CCP1 cKO embryos show the same ability to promote IP proliferation.

<p id="p0105">In E13.5 CCP1 cKO mice, the proportion of cycling IPs is increased over control and this is correlated with increased cell output. At E13.5, cortical progenitors are mainly generating neurons for superficial layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hevner et al., 2003</xref>). Accordingly, we observed an increased number of Cux1<sup>+</sup> neurons in the cortex of E18.5 CCP1 cKO embryos while the number of Ctip2<sup>+</sup> neurons, generated before E13.5, remained unchanged across experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>L and 6M).

<p id="p0110">Altogether, these results suggest the existence of a crosstalk between IPs and cINs to regulate IPs proliferation, thereby the number of upper layer PNs.

<title>Pausing during Migration Strongly Influences the Rate of Cortical Invasion by Interneurons</title>
<p id="p0115">Pause duration and instantaneous migration speed of cINs can have contrary influences on the size of their cohort invading the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>E and 5F). Moreover, the cINs recorded <italic>in vitro</italic> do not display strict movement linearity. Therefore, we used synthetic biology to characterize the cINs cohort displacement. For this purpose, we performed simulations by imposing movement linearity to surrogates, using the experimental distributions of cINs migration parameters and found a higher percentage of cells arriving to destination upon conditional loss of CCP1 activity. These simulations assumed a single direction of migration and no interaction between cells. Time-lapse analyses of isolated CCP1 WT and CCP1 cKO cINs migrating individually in MFDs tested both assumptions and validated the cell-intrinsic contribution to the migration of a cohort of cINs. These experiments also gave a closer picture to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation. These results therefore provide significant evidence to conclude that increase in the size of the CCP1 cKO cINs cohort reaching the cortical wall is a result of the decreased pause duration, in spite of the compensatory effect of reduced instantaneous speeds and is not dependent on intercellular interaction.</p>

<title>Deglutamylation Is a Novel Mode of Regulation of Enzymatic Activity</title>
<p id="p0120">Despite the requirement of MT modifications to control INs migration and the existing subtle neurite branching defects upon accumulation of polyglutamylation, we show here loss of CCP1 activity in cINs reduces their pausing and instant migration speed by affecting mostly actomyosin contractions. By removing gene-encoded carboxy-terminal glutamates from MLCK, CCP1 regulates the enzymatic activity of MLCK. As such, our work demonstrates that the enzymatic activity of a protein can be directly regulated by enzymatic deglutamylation. Alterations in the carboxy-terminal glutamate stretch of MLCK might affect its folding or/and control its ATP loading efficiency or its ability to bind to MLC. It will be exciting to decipher the mechanism that control CCP1 activity, thus allowing it to timely control the pausing of migrating cINs. Our data show that CCP1 is detected both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of cINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>D). Therefore, one possible explanation could be the existence of a regulated nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of CCP1 to pace intermittent periods of movements via cytoplasmic regulation of actomyosin contractions. Our future work will focus on the analysis of the regulation of the spatiotemporal activity of CCP1 activity in migrating cINs.</p>
<p id="p0125">It is noteworthy that although cINs accumulate high levels of MT glutamylation that can be processed by de/glutamylases, the migration phenotype of CCP1 cKO cINs predominantly arises from the dysregulation of actomyosin contractions.</p>

<title>Molecular Crosstalk between cINs and IPs Controls Cerebral Cortex Neurogenesis</title>
<p id="p0130">Crosstalk between cINs and PNs is important to control early steps of cortical morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bortone and Polleux, 2009</xref>). Along this line, our work provides a physiological rationale for the transient pausing of migrating cINs in the cerebral cortex. Pausing not only regulates the flow of cINs invading the cortex by imposing movement heterogeneity at the population level, but also controls the proliferation of IPs for the generation of <italic>ad hoc</italic> number of upper layer PNs. While supernumerary cINs promote IPs proliferation, massive depletion of cINs invading the cortex of <italic>Nkx2.1</italic> KO mouse embryos leads to an opposite phenotype. However, <italic>Nkx2-1</italic> expression is also required for forebrain angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vasudevan et al., 2008</xref>), a factor regulating proliferation of cortical progenitors, including IPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Javaherian and Kriegstein, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lange et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, <italic>Nkx2.1</italic> KO embryos lack some ventral forebrain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sussel et al., 1999</xref>) such as MGE and CGE that are major sources of SHH, which modulate cortical progenitor proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Komada et al., 2008</xref>). Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggest, however, that IPs proliferation can be modulated by the number of cINs, independently of vessels or integrity of ventral forebrain structures.</p>
<p id="p0135">A balance between numbers of PNs and cINs settling into the cortex is primordial to ensure proper activity of the cortex, but its regulation and the exact nature of the molecular dialog existing between migrating cINs and IPs remains to be uncovered. Such dialog likely includes diffusible factors released form cINs that influence the cell-cycle progression of IPs, as suggested by our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.</p>
<p id="p0140">IPs have previously been shown to regulate cINs migration via chemokine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sessa et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tiveron et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, the supernumerary cINs observed in the cortex of CCP1 cKO embryos were accumulating in the IZ migration stream, in close the vicinity of cycling IPs. Therefore, our finding highlights another level of plasticity of the cortex where the population of cINs in turn feedback on the IPs to control neurogenesis output.</p>
<p id="p0145">Here, we propose that the cell-intrinsic regulation of pausing by CCP1 activity is an important driver of cINs migration, which acts in concert with attractive cues layered along migratory streams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Flames et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tiveron et al., 2006</xref>) to control the flow of cINs in the cortex. It would then be interesting to investigate whether diffusible cues attracting more migrating cINs modulate their pausing behavior. Together with previous work, our data suggest that a bidirectional molecular communication between IPs and cINs shapes neocortex histogenesis.</p>

<title>Mouse genetics</title>
<p id="p0170">All mice were handled according to the ethical guidelines of the Belgian Ministry of Agriculture in agreement with European community Laboratory Animal Care and Use Regulations (86/609/CEE, Journal Officiel des Communautées Européennes, L358, 18 December 1986) and with experimental protocol n°1393. Animal handling in the UK was carried out in accordance with the United Kingdom legislation (ASPA 1986).</p>
<p id="p0175">For CCP1 conditional KO, exons 20-21 of <italic>Agtbpb1</italic> gene were flanked with loxP sites. Two month-old CCP1 conditional KO females were crossed with either Dlx5-6 Cre or Dlx5-6 Cre; Rosa-FloxStop YFP males of the same age. Pregnant females were sacrificed at the gestational day 13.5 and 14.5 and both male and female embryos were used for the analysis of the migration profile of WT or cKO cINs. E13.5 male and female embryos were also used in proteomic and genomic analysis. P0, P3, P5, P7, P8 and P21 mouse pups/adolescent were used to characterize the postnatal positioning of WT or cKO CCP1 as well as their intrinsic cell death profile and cortical positioning. Males and females were used between P0 until P8 and only males were used at P21. For TTL1 conditional KO, <italic>Ttll1</italic> gene was flanked with loxP sites and 2 month-old female mice were mated to NestinCRE male mice of the same age. Finally, 2 month-old <italic>Nkx2.1</italic> full KO male and female mice were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kusakabe et al., 2006</xref>). Pregnant females were sacrificed at the gestational day E13.5 and both males and female embryos were used in experiments involving this mouse model. Nkx2.1 Cre mice were purchased from Jackson’s Laboratories (stock number 008661) and backcrossed into MF1 genetic background. These mice were mated to Rosa-FloxStop TdTomato in order to visualize recombined cells. Two month-old Nkx2.1 Cre; Rosa-FloxStop TdTomato mice were mated to <italic>Ccp1</italic><sup>lox/lox</sup> mice of the same age in order to impair CCP1 function in MGE progenitors expressing <italic>Nkx2-1</italic> gene. Pregnant females were sacrificed at the gestational day E13.5 and both male and female embryos were used in the experiments involving this mouse line.</p>

<title>Generation of CCP1 cKO mice</title>
<p id="p0180">The conditional mutant mouse line for <italic>Ccp1</italic> (on exons 20 and 21) was generated at the Mouse Clinical Institute (MCI, Illkirch, France). The targeting vector was constructed as follows. The 5′ (4.5 kb), 3′ (1.4 kb) and inter-loxP (1.9) fragments were PCR amplified and sequentially subcloned into an MCI proprietary vector containing the LoxP sites and a Neo cassette flanked by Flippase Recognition Target (FRT) sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1</xref>A). The linearized construct was electroporated in 129S2/SvPas mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. After selection, targeted clones were identified by PCR using external primers and further confirmed by Southern blot with 5′ and 3′ external probes. Two positive ES clones were injected into blastocysts, and derived male chimeras gave germline transmission. The excision of the neomycin-resistance cassette was performed <italic>in vivo</italic> by breeding the chimeras with a Flp deleter line (C57BL/6N genetic backgroundFLP under ACTB promoter). The Flp transgene was segregated by breeding the first germline mice with a WT C57BL/6N animal. For generation of CCP1 KO, <italic>Ccp1-</italic>floxed mice were crossed with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of a CMV promoter. Genomic DNA isolated from mouse tail snip was analyzed by PCR. Mice were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) according to MCI protocols using GoTag polymerase (Promega) and 33 amplification cycles. The three primer pairs used are listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc7">Table S1</xref>.</p>

<title>MGE explant culture on matrigel matrix</title>
<p id="p0185">MGE explants were placed in MatTek Petri dishes (MatTek Corporation #P35G-0-20-C), previously coated with non-diluted Matrigel matrix (BD Biosciences #35427). Explants were covered with a thin layer of 1:2 Matrigel matrix diluted in neurobasal medium (NBM) (GIBCO #21103-049) supplemented with B27 containing vitamin A (1:50), penicillin/streptomycin (1:100) and L-glutamine (1:100). Explants were kept for 2h at 37 0C in a humidified incubator saturated with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, before NBM was added.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4.4.3">
<title>MGE explant culture on feeder layer of cortical neurons</title>
<p id="p0190">For some experiments, MGE explants were cultured on top of a feeder layer of cortical cells prepared one day before from homochronic WT cortices (2 embryos/dish). Cortical cells were mechanically dissociated using polished glass pipettes and plated in MatTek dishes previously coated with poly-ornithine (100μg/mL) and laminin (5μg/mL) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Cortical cells were left adhere for 2h and cultured in 2mL of supplemented NBM.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4.4.4">
<title>Culture of cortical progenitors</title>
<p id="p0195">MatTek Petri dishes were coated with poly-ornithine (100μg/mL) and laminin (5μg/mL) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Cortices from E12.5 NMRI mouse embryos were dissected (around 14 cortices for 10mL of culture medium) and mechanically dissociated. The cell suspension was filtered using a strainer of 40μL and 800μL of cell suspension were added to the coverslip of MatTek dishes. After 2h, 1mL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with B27 containing vitamin A (1:50) penicillin/streptomycin (1:100), L-glutamine (1:100), EGF and bFGF (20ng/mL final). Cells were kept in a humidified incubator saturated with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 24h. MGEs were microdissected and cut into 4 homogeneous pieces. Twenty pieces of MGE were plated in contact with cortical progenitors or on top of a Millicell insert and maintained in culture for a an additional period of 24h. After this period, 1.5 μL of 10mM EdU were added to each dish for a period of 30 min.</p>

<title>MGE explant electroporation</title>
<p id="p0200">Embryos brains (E13.5) were exposed, by removing head tissue and skin, in a Petri dish containing ice-cold HBSS. After removal of the cortex, plasmids were pressure-injected in the MGEs using a FemtoJet injector (Eppendorf) and electroporation performed placing platinum P3 electrodes surrounding head tissue. Electroporation was performed using a BTX ECM830 electroporator. Electroporation conditions: 5 pulses, 50V, 50ms, 1 s interval. Electroporated MGEs were micro-dissected and cut into 4-6 small explant pieces.</p>

<sec id="sec4.4.6">
<title>Organotypic slice culture from embryos brains</title>
<p id="p0205">Heads from E12.5 embryos were harvested in ice-cold HBSS containing Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg2+ and embedded in 4% low-melting agarose (BIO-RAD #161-3112) in HBSS. 300 μm coronal brain slices were prepared using a LeicaVT1000S vibratome. Slices were cut inside a chamber containing ice-cold HBSS at a speed of 2mm/s and a using a blade cutting frequency of 4. Immediately after cutting, slices were placed on 0.4 μm millicel membranes inserted on MatTek dishes containing supplemented NBM. Slices were kept in culture for at least 24h before time-lapse recording and medium replaced before recording.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4.4.7">
<title>Time-lapse recordings</title>
<p id="p0210">GFP-expressing interneurons were monitored for at least 5h under a Nikon A1 inverted confocal microscope. MatTek dishes containing organotypic brain slices or MGE explants were placed in a humidified chamber saturated with 5% CO2. Recordings were performed at a constant temperature of 37 oC and an average of 16-18 Z steps were obtained each 5 min. Explants electroporated with LifeAct-Ruby plasmid were imaged using resonant confocal mode every 15 s. For MLCK inhibition, ML7 hydrochloride was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 10μM, 5h before the start of time-lapse recording.</p>

<title>Shotgun proteome and LC-MS/MS analysis</title>
<p id="p0265">For differential proteome analysis of ganglionic eminences obtained from WT and CCP1cKO mice, we used a proteomics shotgun approach in combination with post-metabolic peptide labeling using NHS esters of <sup>12</sup>C<sub>3</sub>- or <sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-propionate. In brief, four ganglionic eminences per condition were pooled and pulverized in liquid nitrogen, and the resulting tissue powders were suspended in lysis buffer containing CHAPS (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.8% wt/vol CHAPS) with protease inhibitors added (Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Roche). Tissue suspensions from each condition were separately subjected to three rounds of freeze-thaw lysis and cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 5 min at 4°C. Sample protein concentrations were determined for each condition using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay Kit (Biorad), and the amount of clear lysate containing 300 μg of proteins (approximately 0.5 mL of cleared lysate) were processed as follows. To denature proteins, guanidinium hydrochloride was added to each lysate to a final concentration of 4 M. Each sample was desalted in 20 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0 over a NAP-5 desalting column (GE Healthcare). Then, each protein mixture was digested overnight at 37°C with sequencing-grade endoproteinase LysC (endoLys-C, Promega) at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1/400 (w/w). Afterward, the resulting peptides were labeled post-metabolically using isotopic variants of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-propionate (i.e., NHS ester of 12C3-propionate for the CCP1 cKO mice sample and 13C3-propionate for the WT mice). The propionylation reagents were quenched by the addition of 40 mM glycine and the peptide mixture heated for 60 min at 100°C to reverse possible O-propionylation of Ser, Thr and Tyr. Equal amounts of CCP1 WT and cKO peptide sample were mixed, and following oxidation of methionines, peptides were fractionated via RP-HPLC in 30 s intervals, as described previously. Following peptide fractionation, peptide fractions eluting 12 min apart were pooled to reduce the number of LC-MS/MS runs (24 per analysis).</p>
<p id="p0270">The obtained peptide mixtures were introduced into an LC-MS/MS system, an Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano-LC (Thermo Fischer Scientific) in-line connected to a Q-exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific), for MS analysis. Peptides were loaded on a trapping column (made in-house; 100 μm inner diameter x 20 mm, 5 μm beads, C18 Reprosil-HD, Dr. Maisch). After flushing from the trapping column, the sample was loaded on a reverse-phase column (made in-house; 75 μm inner diameter x 150 mm, 3 μm beads, C18 Reprosil-HD, Dr. Maisch) packed in the needle (PicoFrit SELF/P PicoTip emitter, PF360-75-15-N-5, New Objective). Peptides were loaded with solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 2% acetonitrile in water) and were separated with a linear gradient from 2% solvent A’ (0.1% formic acid in water) to 55% solvent B (0.1% formic acid, 80% acetonitrile in water) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min, followed by a wash reaching 100% solvent B for 15 min.</p>
<p id="p0275">The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent, positive ionization mode, automatically switching between MS and MS/MS acquisition for the 10 most abundant peaks in a given MS spectrum. In the Q-exactive, full-scan MS spectra (m/z 375–1500) were acquired in the Orbitrap at a target value of 1E6 with maximum ion injection time of 80 ms, and a resolution of 60,000 at 200 m/z. The 10 most intense ions fulfilling a predefined criterion (AGC target 1E5 ions, maximum ion injection time of 60 ms, isolation window of 1.5 m/z, fixed first mass of 145 m/z, spectrum data type: centroid, underfill ratio 2%, intensity threshold 1.3E4, exclusion of unassigned, singly charged precursors, peptide match preferred, exclude isotopes on, dynamic exclusion time of 12 s) were subjected to tandem MS scans at a resolution 15,000 (at 200 m/z).</p>
<p id="p0280">From the MS/MS data in each LC-MS/MS run, Mascot Generic Files were created using Mascot Distiller software (version 2.5.1, Matrix Science). In the generation of these peak lists, grouping of spectra was allowed in Mascot Distiller with a maximum intermediate retention time of 30 s, and a maximum intermediate scan count of 5 was used where possible. Grouping was done with a 0.005-Da precursor tolerance. A peak list was only generated when the MS/MS spectrum contained more than 10 peaks. There was no deisotoping, and the relative signal-to-noise limit was set at 2. These peak lists were then searched with the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science) using the Mascot Daemon interface (version 2.5.1, Matrix Science, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="intref0055" xlink:href="http://www.matrixscience.com">http://www.matrixscience.com</ext-link>). Spectra were searched against the Swiss-Prot database with taxonomy set to <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (release 2015_05). Two different type of searches were performed: in one of them, the enzyme was set to semi-endoLys-C. In both cases, enzyme settings allowed for one missed cleavage, nonetheless allowing for cleavage when lysine was followed by proline. Variable modifications were set to pyroglutamate formation of N-terminal glutamine and acetylation of the N terminus. Methionine oxidation was set as a fixed modification. Determination of the light (<sup>12</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-propionyl) and heavy (<sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>-propionyl) labeled peptides for further quantification was enabled using the quantitation option in Mascot. The mass tolerance on precursor ions was 10 ppm (with Mascot’s C13 option set to 1), and that on fragment ions was 20 mmu. The peptide charge was set at 2+ and 3+, and the instrument specification was set as ESI-QUAD. Only peptides that were ranked one, have a minimum amino acid length of eight and scored above the threshold score, set at 99% confidence, were withheld. The false discovery rate was calculated for every search and was always found to be lower than 1.5%.</p>

<title>Quantification and Statistical Analysis</title>
<p id="p0315">Statistical analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism 6 or MATLAB software. Parametric or non-parametric t tests were used to compare statistical difference between two experimental groups. The choice between parametric and non-parametric t test was made after verifying normality of distributions on Graph Pad Prism 6. One way-ANOVA was used to compare the statistical difference between at least three experimental groups. Two-way ANOVA was used to compare the statistical difference between at least three experimental groups based on multiple characteristics (e.g., number of cells per cortical area within different genotypes). Several assumptions were made to use ANOVA: similar variance across experimental distributions, samples were obtained independently and within each sample the observations were sampled independently and randomly. The choice of the post hoc test following ANOVA was made according to the necessity of computing confidence interval for every comparison. Permutation test was used to simulate the displacement of surrogate cells to avoid repeating the experiments many times in order to test statistical significance. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM and the experimental n, the statistical test used and statistical significance are indicated in the figure legends. A significance level of 0.05 was used in the statistical tests. For every experiment the results were re-calculated independently by the main authors of this manuscript.

Robust statistics was applied to the base-2 logarithm values of the peptide ratios accepted as valid by Mascot Distiller. The median of the peptide ratio distributions of both experiments was corrected to zero. Further, peptide ratios being set as FALSE were verified by individual inspection. Protein ratios were then calculated by taking the median of the peptide ratios that identified that protein.

<title>Kinematic simulations of migrating cINs / analysis of cINs migration in MFDs</title>
<p id="p0330">Each surrogate cell moved in one direction following a movement profile of pauses and instantaneous speeds sampled randomly from their distributions in WT and cKO CCP1 cells. The proportion of pause to movement, averaged across surrogates, was kept identical to that observed in each group. Surrogates were simulated for 10 hours and at the end of the simulation time, the percentage of them having crossed 10 different displacement thresholds were calculated. The procedure was repeated for 20 realizations in each of which the pause onsets, durations and the instantaneous speeds for each surrogate was randomized. All simulations were done in MATLAB.</p>
<p id="p0335">Since INs do not move in a straight line in corridors of MFDs, a least-squares line was fitted to each cell’s positions over time and its displacements along and perpendicular to this line were found. Next, maximum displacement threshold crossed by 75% of cells in each population was calculated at each time instant. At the end of recording time, statistical significance of the observed difference between values of this threshold for the CCP1 cKO group and for the CCP1 WT group was assessed by a permutation test. The null hypothesis was that the difference in the maximum displacement thresholds between the two groups is observed independently of the assignment of final displacement values to the cells of these two groups. Thus, the values of displacements, found at the end of recording, pooled from both groups were shuffled and assigned randomly to cells from each group to construct two surrogate sets of displacement values. The difference between maximum displacement thresholds crossed by 75% of the cells from each of the two surrogate sets was found and the procedure was repeated 10000 times to construct a distribution of surrogate values. By comparing where the observed difference falls relative to all the surrogate differences under the null hypothesis of an outcome independent of group assignment of displacement values, a p value was found. The calculation of p value for the difference in maximum displacement thresholds was done for 19 different values of percentage of cells. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p>
