<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">The intellectual disability gene, Sox11, encodes for a critical neurodevelopmental transcription factor with functions in precursor survival, neuronal fate determination, migration and morphogenesis. The mechanisms regulating SOX11’s activity remain largely unknown. Mass spectrometric analysis uncovered that SOX11 can be post-translationally modified by phosphorylation. Here, we report that phosphorylatable serines surrounding the high-mobility group box modulate SOX11’s transcriptional activity. Through Mass Spectrometry (MS), co-immunoprecipitation assays and <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation assays followed by MS we verified that protein kinase A (PKA) interacts with SOX11 and phosphorylates it on S133. <italic>In vivo</italic> replacement of SoxC factors in developing adult-generated hippocampal neurons with SOX11 S133 phospho-mutants indicated that phosphorylation on S133 modulates dendrite development of adult-born dentate granule neurons, while reporter assays suggested that S133 phosphorylation fine-tunes the activation of select target genes. These data provide novel insight into the control of the critical neurodevelopmental regulator SOX11 and imply SOX11 as a mediator of PKA-regulated neuronal development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">The SOXC protein SOX11 is a potent transcriptional regulator, which has been functionally linked to early and late steps of mammalian neurogenesis including neural precursor survival, proliferation, neuronal fate commitment, migration and dendrite development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The critical role of SOX11 for human CNS development was predicted by single-cell transcriptomic analysis of human neocortical development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and was confirmed by the discovery that heterozygote mutations in Sox11 are associated with Coffin-Siris Syndrome, a rare human congenital disorder characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly and growth deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">The regulation of SOX11 remains poorly understood. Recent data suggests that SOX11 activity may be controlled not only by epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms, but also by post-translational modifications. In retinal ganglion cells, SOX11’s subcellular localization is modulated by SUMOylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In previous work we identified ten candidate serine residues for phosphorylation via mass spectrometry. Notably, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of SOX11 on serine 30 (S30) resulted in the redistribution of SOX11 from an exclusive nuclear localization to a mixed nuclear and cytoplasmic localization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Here, we focused on the impact of phosphorylation on SOX11’s transcriptional activity and on the identification of kinases controlling SOX11’s function. We show that the three phosphorylatable serine residues surrounding the DNA binding High-mobility group (HMG)-box, i.e., S30, S133, and S137, modulate SOX11’s transcriptional activity. Moreover, we provide evidence that Protein Kinase A (PKA) interacts with SOX11 and phosphorylates SOX11 on S133. Finally, we provide evidence that phosphorylation of SOX11 on S133 modulates dendritic morphogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>The first 3 Phospho-serines of SOX11 are important for its transcriptional activity</title>
<p id="Par5">Our previous mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis identified ten putatively phosphorylated serine residues in the murine SOX11 protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Three of these residues, i.e., S30, S133, and S137, surround the DNA-binding HMG-box (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). These serine residues are highly conserved between species and found exclusively in SOX11 but not in other members of the SOXC transcription factor family. The other seven putatively phosphorylated serine residues are located more towards the C-terminus and do not show conservation between species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. To investigate the impact of SOX11’s phosphorylations on its transcriptional activity, we tested the ability of SOX11 phosphorylation mutants for transcriptional activation in luciferase assays. Mutations of all phosphorylatable serines to an amino acid (i.e., alanine) that mimics non-phosphorylated serine (C3-Sox11p<sup>NON</sup>) or to an amino acid (i.e., aspartate) that mimics phosphorylation (C3- Sox11p<sup>MIMIC</sup>) abolished transcriptional activation of the SOX11-responsive minimal promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, which contains multiple binding sites for SOX11 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The three phospho-serines surrounding the HMG-box are important for SOX11’s transcriptional activity. (<bold>a</bold>) Representation of the phosphorylated serine residues on SOX11 WT and Table presenting the amino acids that are exchanged on each mutant.

The data are presented as mean ± SEM.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e487" xlink:href="41598_2018_34480_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par6">To clarify, which of the phosphorylatable serines impact on SOX11’s transcriptional activity mutations were separated into two groups. The first group contains the three N-terminal serines flanking the HMG-box while the second group comprised the seven C-terminal serines S244, S248, S249, S253, S258, S289 and S292. In both groups, the serines were mutated to either a non-phosphorylatable or a phospho-mimetic form to generate the following mutants: (i) C3-Sox11p<sup>N3W7</sup> = NON 3 Wildtype (WT) 7, where the three N-terminal serines are mutated into a non-phosphorylatable form, (ii) C3-Sox11p<sup>M3W7</sup> = MIMIC 3 WT 7, where the three N-terminal serines are mutated into a phosphomimetic form, (iii) C3-Sox11p<sup>W3N7</sup> = WT 3 NON 7, where the seven C-terminal serines are mutated into a non-phosphorylatable form, and iv) C3-Sox11p<sup>W3M7</sup> = WT 3 MIMIC 7, where the seven C-terminal serines are mutated into a phosphomimetic form (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). While transcriptional activation of the SOX11-responsive minimal promoter by the C3-Sox11p<sup>W3N7</sup> and C3-Sox11p<sup>W3M7</sup> mutants was comparable to the activation by non-mutated Sox11, neither C3-Sox11p<sup>N3W7</sup> nor C3-Sox11p<sup>M3W7</sup> significantly activated the SOX11-responsive minimal promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). These data strongly suggest that the conserved, three N-terminal phosphorylatable serines around the HMG-box, are important for SOX11’s transcriptional activity.</p>

<title>PKA interacts with SOX11 and phosphorylates its serine 133</title>
<p id="Par7">To identify kinases mediating SOX11’s phosphorylation, its interactome was determined by AP-MS (affinity purification combined with MS). For this purpose, Strep/FLAG SOX11 was recombinantly expressed in Neuro2A and immunoprecipitated via anti-FLAG antibodies. Co-purified proteins were analyzed by SILAC-based quantitative mass spectrometry to identify specific SOX11 interactors. The full list of interactors is shown in Supplemental Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>. Interestingly, this analysis identified Protein Kinase A Type 1a Regulatory Subunit (PRKAR1a, RIα) as well as the A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins 8 (AKAP8) and 12 (AKAP12) as interacting partners of SOX11 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). PKA is a holoenzyme that consists of four subunits, two catalytic (PKA<sub>C</sub>) and two regulatory (PKA<sub>R</sub>). It was identified that different combinations of catalytic and regulatory subunits have distinct biochemical properties being differentially responsive to cAMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Additionally, PKA’s specificity and versality is regulated by its scaffold proteins, AKAPs. AKAPs form multiprotein complexes that in addition to PKA contain for example phosphatases, which allow immediate signal termination. PKA is also confined to different cellular compartments by AKAPs, thus, localizing PKA in close proximity to its targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. AKAP8 is responsible for cAMP-responsive nuclear events and it has been associated with microcephaly and autism-like phenotypes in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Thus, the finding that SOX11 biochemically interacts with PRKAR1a and AKAPs suggests that SOX11 may be targeted by the Protein Kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>PKA interacts with SOX11.

The blots presented are cropped.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e571" xlink:href="41598_2018_34480_Fig2_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par8">We next investigated whether PKA is active in SOX11 expressing cells of the developing and adult brain. The transcription factor cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) is a bona fide target of PKA and its phosphorylation on serine 133 is commonly used as a proxy for PKA pathway activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Immunofluorescent staining of the developing mouse cortex on embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) and of the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus using antibodies against S133 phosphorylated CREB (pCREB), SOX11, and the immature neuronal marker doublecortin (DCX) showed that SOX11-positive immature neurons were immunoreactive for pCREB. These findings indicate that the PKA pathway is active in SOX11-expressing cells of the embryonic and adult brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b and c</xref>). We also found that SOX11 co-immunoprecipitated with PKAc and vice-versa in E15.5 mouse brain extracts demonstrating that SOX11 and PKA interact <italic>in vivo</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref> and Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par9">To identify the serine residue that is phosphorylated by PKA we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays of SOX11 followed by MS analysis. Overexpressed SOX11 was immunoprecipitated from HEK293T cells. Precipitated SOX11 was incubated with purified PKAc in the presence or absence of a Protein Kinase A inhibitor peptide (PKI). MS analysis and quantitative assessment by spectral counting revealed increased phosphorylation on a peptide covering the S133 and S137 residue in the presence of PKAc compared to samples additionally treated with PKI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). Because of the close proximity of the S133 and S137 residues, mass spectrometry could not distinguish which of the serines was phosphorylated. Comparison of the amino-acid sequences surrounding S133 and S137 using a bioinformatical algorithm specifically designed to predict PKA phosphorylation sites (pkaPS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, however, identified S133 as the more probable site for PKA-mediated phosphorylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>). To test whether S133 influences SOX11’s subcellular localization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, we overexpressed Sox11WT, Sox11S133NON (S133ASox11, non-phosphorylatable), and Sox11S133MIMIC (S133DSox11, phosphomimetic), in HEK293T cells and performed immunofluorescent stainings. In both mutants and SOX11WT, immunofluorescent stainings and fluorescent line intensity plots identified cells with nuclear or nuclear and cytoplasmic SOX11 localization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c-e</xref>’) suggesting that the phospho-status of SOX11S133 does not influence SOX11’s subcellular localization.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>PKA phosphorylates SOX11 in serine 133.

<p id="Par11">We next compared the ability of wildtype SOX11 and S133 phospho-mutant SOX11, i.e., Sox11S133NON and Sox11S133MIMIC, to rescue the differentiation-deficit of Sox4/Sox11-ablated NPCs. To this end, we stereotactically injected Sox4<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>Sox11<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> double conditional knockout mice (Sox4/11 cKO mice) with an MML-retrovirus bi-cistronically encoding for Cre-recombinase and mitoDsRed together with a MML-retrovirus bi-cistronically encoding for wildtype or mutant SOX11 and GFP. Animals were sacrificed 17 days post injection to test the rescue capacity of the mutants and to validate the dendritic morphogenesis of the transduced cells. Expression of mitoDsRed and GFP was used to identify Cre-recombinase and SOX11 transduced cells, respectively. Virtually all Cre-recombinase expressing neurons co-transduced with Sox11WT, Sox11S133NON, or Sox11S133MIMIC, expressed the neuronal marker and SOX11 target gene doublecortin (&gt;98% in all groups). Moreover, double-transduced cells featured the typical polarized dentate granule (DG) neuron morphology with an apical dendrite spanning the granule cell layer and initiation of dendrite branching in the molecular cell layer irrespective of whether they were transduced with wildtype or phospho-mutant SOX11. These data indicate that wildtype and phospho-mutant SOX11 are functional and can rescue the SoxC-loss-of-function induced neuronal differentiation deficits (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>). A more detailed analysis, however, revealed differences in dendrite morphologies between cells rescued by wildtype or phospho-mutant SOX11 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c–g</xref>). Sholl-analysis showed that dendrite complexity was consistently lowest in Sox11S133MIMIC-expressing, intermediate in Sox11S133NON-expressing, and highest in Sox11WT-expressing DG neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>). The total dendritic length and number of branch points were comparable between Sox11WT- and Sox11S133NON-expressing neurons but were significantly lower in Sox11S133MIMIC-expressing neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e and f</xref>). Moreover, Sox11S133MIMIC-expressing neurons showed a strong trend towards lower numbers of dendritic termini (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g</xref>). The observation that SOX11 wildtype and S133 phospho-mutants elicited striking differences in dendrite morphology suggests that S133 phosphorylation modulates SOX11 activity/function.</p>
<p id="Par12">To begin to understand the mechanistic basis of the differential effects of the S133 phospho-mutants on dendrite morphology, we compared their ability to transactivate different target genes. Specifically, we compared the ability of the mutants to activate the SOX11-responsive minimal promoter and the promoters of Stathmin1 (Stmn1) and Doublecortin (DCX). Both SOX11S133 phospho-mutants showed increased transactivation of the SOX11-responsive minimal promoter compared to the SOX11WT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4h</xref>). In addition, while Sox11WT, Sox11S133NON, and Sox11S133MIMIC, showed comparable abilities for activation of the Stmn1 promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4i</xref>), both phospho-mutants consistently activated the DCX-promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> more strongly than SOX11WT with the phospho-mimetic mutant being the most potent transactivating form (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4j</xref>). These results raise the interesting possibility that the phosphorylation of SOX11 on S133 may modulate the transactivation activity of SOX11 on a subset of target genes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par13">SOX11 has been firmly established as a critical developmental transcriptional regulator with pleiotropic functions in early and late processes of neurogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The regulation of SOX11, however, remains poorly understood. Extending our previous work that identified ten phosphorylatable serine residues in the SOX11 protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, we show that the three N-terminal serines are important for SOX11’s transcriptional activity. We also demonstrate that one of them, S133, is phosphorylated by the cyclic AMP responsive PKA kinase. Most importantly, <italic>in vivo</italic> replacement experiments in developing adult-generated hippocampal neurons revealed that the phospho-mimetic and non-phosphorylatable S133 mutants differentially affect neuronal morphogenesis, indicating that phosphorylation on S133 modulates SOX11’s activity or function.</p>
<p id="Par14">Mutation analysis of the predicted phospho-serines suggested that the three N-terminal phospho-serines are important for SOX11’s transcriptional activity. Interestingly, while the combined mutation of all three N-terminal serines into phospho-mimetic or non-phosphorylatable amino acids abolished transcriptional activity, single mutants of S30 (phospho-mimetic) and S133 (phospho-mimetic and non-phosphorylatable) can activate transcription. This could be potentially explained by S137, which may further contribute to the ability of SOX11 to transactivate. It is also possible that a distinct combination of phosphorylations on the three N-terminal serines may be required for transcriptional activity. Given that the N-terminal serines surround the DNA-binding HMG box, it is also tempting to speculate that the combinatorial phosphorylation of these serines determines the affinity of SOX11 to DNA. The function of the seven C-terminal phosphorylatable serine residues remains to be established. Mutation of all seven C-terminal serines to a phospho-mimetic or a non-phosphorylatable form did not affect the transcriptional activity of SOX11 in luciferase reporter assays. These basic transcriptional assays, however, do not exclude a functional relevance for the phosphorylation status of the C-terminal serine residues in the regulation of SOX11’s transcriptional activity. Further studies are required to determine whether, e.g., a combinatorial phosphorylation code involving the C-terminal serine residues, may fine-tune transcriptional activity, modulate target gene selection, or influence interaction with other transcription factors.</p>
<p id="Par15">We explored the impact of the phosphorylation status of SOX11 on S133 in the context of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus a tightly regulated transcription factor sequence that includes SOX11, generates new functional dentate granule neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Adult-generated hippocampal DG neurons feature a highly stereotypic dendritic morphology, which is essential for DG neuron function and whose perturbation is associated with deficits in hippocampus-dependent information processing and behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Having confirmed that SOXC transcription factor function is essential for neuronal differentiation in the adult neurogenic lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, we found that SOX11 and its S133 phospho-mutants were equally potent in rescuing the neuronal differentiation deficit of SoxC-deficient cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Intriguingly, in-depth analysis of rescued cells revealed that the SOX11 WT and S133 phospho-mutants differentially impacted on dendrite morphogenesis. These observations raise the intriguing possibility that S133 phosphorylation may function to fine-tune dendrite development. The molecular mechanism through which S133 phosphorylation modulates dendrite development remains to be established. Interestingly, SOX11WT and the SOX11S133 mutants differentially activated select promoters of genes encoding for cytoskeleton-modifying proteins, suggesting that S133 phosphorylation may allow to modulate the expression of a defined subset of genes involved in the regulation of dendrite development. The finding that expression of either SOX11 S133 phospho-mutant produced a dendritic phenotype that was different from the SOX11WT phenotype raises the intriguing possibility, that development of the stereotypic dentate granule cell morphology requires a precise balance between the phosphorylated and un-phosphorylated S133 form of SOX11.</p>
<p id="Par16">We provide evidence that the S133 residue is targeted by PKA. cAMP/PKA-signaling is a central signaling pathway in neuronal development, which in adult neurogenesis is involved in the control of neuronal fate determination, neuronal survival, and neuronal morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is considered the primary transcriptional mediator downstream of cAMP/PKA-signaling regulated neuronal development. Our findings raise the intriguing hypothesis that at least some aspects of PKA-regulated neuronal development such as dendritic development, are mediated through a transcription factor network that includes CREB and SOX11.</p>
<p id="Par17">There is evidence that impaired generation and functional integration of adult-born DG neurons as well as dys-regulation of cAMP/PKA-signaling play a significant role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders such as anxiety, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. It will be interesting to explore if and how dys-regulation of SOX11 phosphorylation contributes to those pathologies.</p>

<p id="Par30">For the identification of SOX11 interaction partners, Strep-FLAG-tagged mouse SOX11 was transiently expressed in SILAC-labelled (light: Lys-0/Arg-0; heavy: Lys-8/Arg-10) Neuro2a cells. The isolation of SOX11 protein complexes was performed by co-IP from nuclear extracts. Confluent cells were washed with PBS (Life Technologies), harvested, washed again and pelleted. Subsequently, the cytoplasmic fraction was collected using 3 times the volume of buffer A [10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1 µg/ml phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2 and 3 (Sigma Aldrich), 1 mM DTT, 1 µg/ml complete protease inhibitor (Roche)] according to pellet size. After 15 min of incubation 0.1% NP40 (Roche) was added to break the cell membrane. Following centrifugation, the nuclei were harshly resuspended in 2 times volume according to pellet size buffer C [20 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 25% glycerol, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM PMSF, 1 µg/ml phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2 and 3 (Sigma Aldrich), 1 mM DTT, 1 µg/ml complete protease inhibitor (Roche)] and rotated for 20 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing nuclear proteins was collected. Flag affinity purification was performed applying anti-Flag M2 agarose beads (Sigma). Beads were washed 3 times in buffer C, thereof twice without phosphatase and protease inhibitors, thereafter 50 µl packed beads were incubated 1.5 h at 4 °C on an end-over-end shaker with 3.5 to 6 mg nuclear extract, supplemented with 300U/mg Benzonase Nuclease (Novagen) to exclude DNA-mediated interactions.
