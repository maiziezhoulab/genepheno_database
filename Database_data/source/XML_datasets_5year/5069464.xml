<abstract>
<p><italic>CACNA1I</italic> is a candidate schizophrenia risk gene. It encodes the pore-forming human Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 α1 subunit, a subtype of voltage-gated calcium channel that contributes to T-type currents. Recently, two <italic>de novo</italic> missense variations, T797M and R1346H, of hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 were identified in individuals with schizophrenia. Here we show that R1346H, but not T797M, is associated with lower hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 protein levels, reduced glycosylation, and lower membrane surface levels of hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 when expressed in human cell lines compared to wild-type. Consistent with our biochemical analyses, whole-cell hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 currents in cells expressing the R1346H variant were ~50% of those in cells expressing WT hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3, and neither R1346H nor T797M altered channel biophysical properties. Employing the NEURON simulation environment, we found that reducing hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 current densities by 22% or more eliminates rebound bursting in model thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) neurons. Our analyses suggest that a single copy of Chr22: 39665939G &gt; A <italic>CACNA1I</italic> has the capacity to disrupt Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel-dependent functions, including rebound bursting in TRN neurons, with potential implications for schizophrenia pathophysiology.</p>

<p><italic>CACNA1I</italic> encodes the pore-forming hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 α1 subunit, one of three major Ca<sub>V</sub>3 voltage-gated calcium (Ca<sub>V</sub>) channels that contribute to low threshold T-type currents. Compared to Ca<sub>V</sub> channels, Ca<sub>V</sub>3 have low voltage-activation thresholds, rapid inactivation, and slow closing rates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Of the three-member Ca<sub>V</sub>3 family, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels have the most depolarized activation thresholds; and they open as well as inactivate and close slowly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p>
<p>Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels are expressed in a limited subset of neurons including GABAergic neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) where they support oscillatory activity essential for sleep spindle generation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In TRN neurons, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels are mostly inactivated at resting membrane potentials and mediate the rebound bursting upon transient membrane hyperpolarizations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Rebound bursting in TRN neurons is largely absent in mice lacking Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels, and sleep spindle generation is disrupted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Sleep spindle abnormality, as well as altered patterns of neuronal activity in the thalamus, are found in people with schizophrenia, suggesting thalamocortical network dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p>
<p>Genetic analyses of large patient cohorts have identified loci associated with the risk of mental illnesses including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Several of these candidate risk genes encode proteins involved in calcium signaling, including voltage-gated calcium channel subunits (<italic>CACNA1C</italic>, <italic>CACNB2</italic> and <italic>CACNA1I)</italic>, that may ultimately converge on a common disease mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Biological insight derived from psychiatric-associated common genetic variations is currently limited to a few studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>; causative risk alleles can be difficult to localize precisely within GWAS loci, and many map to non-coding regions of as yet undefined functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Recently, two rare, <italic>de novo</italic> missense variations, Chr22: 39659492C &gt; T and Chr22: 39665939G &gt; A, were identified in <italic>CACNA1I</italic> by exome sequencing of trio samples that include 105 schizophrenia probands. <italic>CACNA1I</italic> was the only gene in this cohort to harbor missense variations in more than one proband<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The resulting amino acid alterations, T797M and R1346H (numbered according to NM_021096 but equivalent to R1311H NM_001003406<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), are predicted to reside in extracellular regions of domains II and III of hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3. <italic>CACNA1I</italic> was validated as a candidate schizophrenia risk gene, in a genome wide association study by the Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium as one of 108 independent genomic loci that exceed genome-wide significance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. These studies emphasize the need for functional studies of rare missense, exome variations in <italic>CACNA1I</italic> that associate with schizophrenia risk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we use biochemical and electrophysiological assays in the HEK293 cell expression system, to show that R1346H hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 variant has reduced glycosylation and cell surface expression compared to hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 wild-type, without altered biophysical properties. In contrast, T797M did not affect hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel properties in our assays. Employing NEURON to simulate TRN neuron excitability, we show that R1346H disrupts rebound bursting mediated by Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels.</p>

<title>Mutagenesis</title>
<p>T797M and R1346H were introduced on an SbfI-HindIII fragment of FLAG-tagged WT hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 cDNA (Origene, RC219179) and sub-cloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to generate full-length FLAG-tagged hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 cDNAs. Mutagenesis primers were for T797M: 5′-CACGGACACTGGAGACATGGTGCCCG/5′-TCGGGCACCATGTCTCCAGTGTCGGTG, and for R1346H: 5′-GCAACATCACCAACCACTCGGACTGC/5′-GCCATGCAGTCCGAGTGGTTGGTGAT. All constructs used in this study were sequence verified.</p>

<title>Single copy cDNA, stable integration in HEK293 cells</title>
<p>The Flp-In T-REx system selects for clones containing single copy integration of cDNAs thereby reducing variability in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 protein expression levels among cells and across cell lines. Parental Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells (Thermo Fisher, R78007) were transfected with pcDNA5/pFRT/TO vectors containing WT, T797M or R1346H hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 cDNAs, and pOG44 vector encoding FLP recombinase (Thermo Fisher, K650001) in 1:9 ratio using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS. Single cDNA insertion events were selected after two weeks in 200 μg/mL hygromycin B (Invitrogen) and resistant polyclonal cell lines (10–20 colonies) expanded and maintained with 200 μg/mL hygromycin B and 15 μg/mL blasticidin S (Invitrogen). hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel expression was induced by 1 μg/mL doxycycline and all analyses (including electrophysiology) were performed 72 hours after induction (unless otherwise indicated). At 72 hours Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel protein levels plateaued. cDNA integration in each cell line was validated with Sanger sequencing of the insertion locus.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA from each cell line was harvested using RNAeasy Plus (Qiagen). 10 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed and cDNA synthesized using random hexamer priming (Transcriptor cDNA synthesis, Roche). FastStart Universal SYBR Green 2X Master Mix (Roche) was used to perform quantitative PCR for hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 (<italic>CACNA1I</italic>: <italic>5</italic>′<italic>CAATGGACTGGATGCTGTTG/5</italic>′<italic>ATCCAGGGGTTGTGGTTG</italic>) and β-actin (<italic>ACTB: 5</italic>′<italic>CCAACCGCGAGAAGATGA/5</italic>′<italic>CCAGAGGCGTACAGGGATAG</italic>). <italic>CACNA1I</italic> mRNA in each cell line was analyzed by the relative quantitation of gene expression method and using ACTB that encodes β-actin as the reference control gene (ΔΔCt method)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Threshold amplification cycle (CT) values were obtained for target (<italic>CACNA1I</italic>) and internal control (<italic>ACTB</italic>) to calculate ∆CT (CT target–CT reference), and ΔΔCt calculated before and after induction of <italic>CACNA1I</italic> by doxycycline treatment. We carried out 3–4 technical replicates, from three independent cell culture and dox-induction step (biological triplicates). The biological variability in our RT-qPCR experiments stems primarily from different overall levels of mRNA induction across biological replicates.</p>

<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Whole cell lysates of Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells expressing WT, T797M or R1346H hCa<sub>v</sub>3.3 channels were prepared as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Electrophoresis samples were prepared in 4x Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) and incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes before SDS-PAGE (3–8% tris-acetate gel, Life Technologies). Antibodies: mouse anti-FLAG (1:1000, Sigma F1804); rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology 14C10); mouse anti-β-actin (1:50000, Sigma A5441); rabbit anti-pan-cadherin (1:1000, Life PA5-17526). Anti-GAPDH or anti-β-actin signals were used as reference signals to normalize across preparations and also as gel loading controls.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Cell-Surface Biotinylation</title>
<p>hCav3.3 protein expression was induced in transformed Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells with 4 day treatment of 1 μg/mL doxycycline. Cells were then washed three times with <italic>solution A</italic> (see below) and incubated with 1.5 mg/mL EZ Link Sulfo-NHS-SS Biotin (Life Technologies) for 20 min at 4 °C. The labeling reaction was quenched with 3 × 5 min BSA/L-lysine solution, and the cell preparation washed twice at 4 °C for 5 min with <italic>solution A</italic>. Cells were lysed on ice with 200 μL of PB/SDS and 1 mL of PB/Triton, sonicated for 5 min at 30 on/30 off intervals in a Bioruptor bath sonicator (Diagenode), and centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 15 minutes. Biotinylated lysates were incubated with NeutrAvidin beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) under constant rotation for 2 hours, centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and then beads were washed sequentially with 2 × 1 mL PB/Triton, 2 × 1 mL PB/Triton/600, and 2 × 1 mL of PB. Protein bound to NeutraAvidin beads was eluted for 20 minutes at RT°C with 2x Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) and β-mercaptoethanol. Input and eluate samples were analyzed by immunoblotting. <italic>Solution A</italic>: 7.74 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2.26 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.7 mM KCl, 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. <italic>BSA/lysine quenching solution</italic>: 0.5% BSA, 50 mM L-lysine-H<sub>2</sub>O in PBS/Ca/Mg, pH 7.4; PB: 7.74 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2.26 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>; PB/SDS: PB, 1% SDS; PB/Triton: PB, 1% Triton; PB/Triton/600: PB,1% Triton, 600 mM NaCl.</p>
<p>The protein measurements for T797M and R1346H channels have similar dispersion, and scales proportionally to the absolute values. The coefficient of variation (CV) for whole cell protein level for R1346H is 40% compared to 31% for T797M. Using 1000 bootstrapping samples we estimated that the 95% confidence interval for T797M CV is (0.21,0.42), while the 95% CI for R1346H CV is (0.26, 0.54). The 95% confidence interval for the difference in CV between T797M and R1346H is (−0.26, 0.09)–not different from 0–indicating that the data dispersion between T797M and R1346H is statistically equivalent.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Deglycosylation</title>
<p>Deglycosylation was performed on input or eluate samples with Protein Deglycosylation Mix (New England Biolabs). Briefly, 60 μg of total protein (input) or biotin labeled membrane protein (eluate) was denatured in Glycoprotein Denaturing Buffer for 20 minutes at RT. The denatured protein was then treated with either buffer alone (control) or with the Deglycosylation Enzyme Cocktail (PNGase F, <italic>O</italic>-Glycosidase, Neuraminidase, Galactosidase, and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase) for 1 hour at 37 °C in a solution of 50 mM sodium phosphate and 1% NP-40. Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting.</p>

<title>Conventional electrophysiology</title>
<p>Voltage-gated calcium currents (Ca<sub>V</sub>) were only resolved in Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells after, and not before, doxycycline induction of wild-type or mutant hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 cDNA. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were used to compare hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel currents in doxycycline treated Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells carrying a single copy of exogenous wild-type or mutant hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 cDNA. Recordings were performed as previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The macroscopic Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 currents recorded in this expression system originate from the gating of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels: we have never recorded Ca<sub>V</sub> currents in untransfected tsA201, HEK293 or Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells under the recording conditions used in this study (see also refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Wild-type macroscopic Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 currents shown here have all the properties of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 currents and the peak current is about 60 pA/pF, equivalent to ~ 700–750 pA, with only 2 mM calcium as the charge carrier. The properties of the macroscopic as well as single Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel currents are completely consistent with previously published data e.g.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.</p>
<p>Whole-cell external recording solution contained: 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, pH adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH and the intracellular pipette solution contained: 126 mM CsCl, 10 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM MgATP, pH 7.2 with CsOH. Whole-cell hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 currents were evoked by square step depolarizations from a holding potential of −100 mV. Currents were leak subtracted online using a P/−4 protocol. Currents recorded with Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, LLC) were sampled at 20 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. For single-channel recordings, we used the HEK293-derived cell line tsA201 transiently expressing wild-type or mutant hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 cDNA for 48 hrs. We used a pipette solution for single channel recording which is optimized to isolate Ca<sub>V</sub> currents: 110 mM BaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM CsCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2 with Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub> and the extracellular bath solution contained: 135 mM potassium aspartate, 10 mM EGTA, 5 mM HEPES, 5 mM KCl, pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH (see refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). The high potassium extracellular solution effectively clamps the membrane potential to 0 mV eliminating contributions of the membrane potential to the transmembrane patch voltage. To reduce electrode capacitance in single channel recording, pipettes were coated with Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning, Co) and polished to resistances of 5–8 MΩ. Single channel currents recorded using Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, LLC) were sampled at 10–20 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Clampfit10 software (Molecular Devices, LLC) was used for single channel analyses. Leak subtraction was performed offline using a noiseless stimulated null trace. All recordings were obtained at room temperature.</p>

<title>Properties of single Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel currents</title>
<p>The estimated reversal potential for current flow through single Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels was positive to 0 mV, the single channel conductance estimated from the single channel current voltage relationship was consistent with single channel conductance measurements for Ca<sub>V</sub>3, and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 specifically e.g<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>; single Ca<sub>V</sub> channel currents exhibited classic slow closing kinetics during the repolarization step<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>; and we have never resolved single Ca<sub>V</sub> channel currents in tsA201 cells in un-transfected cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>All data were acquired without knowledge of clone identity, all analyses were done before revealing clone identity, and the experimenter interleaved recordings from cells expressing different clones on each experimental day. To compare current amplitudes across cells, we converted to current density (pA/pF) to normalize for cell size. In high throughput electrophysiology, cell capacitance is not measured but the much larger sample sizes (&gt;100) add statistical power and compensate for the relatively small variation in size among HEK293 cells. Peak currents evoked by depolarizing pulses were used to generate current voltage relationships. These were fit with the sum of a Goldmann-Hodgkin-Katz flux equation (ϕ) and an exponential function to model the shape of inward and outward unitary conductance, multiplied by a single Boltzmann function to summarize gating.</p>

Peak current amplitudes measured from cells expressing hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 WT, T797M and R1346H were fit to a bimodal distribution comprising two log-normal functions (sub-distributions) of different scale and shape factors. Descriptors of interest, the Bernoulli parameter and the median of the larger sub-distribution were determined by finding the parameters that maximize the likelihood of the data (maximum-likelihood estimates). To determine confidence intervals, a bootstrap procedure was used: the fitting algorithm was repeated for each resampling of the data.</p>

<title>hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 expression is disrupted by R1346H</title>
<p>We set out to test if two rare schizophrenia risk variations, identified in <italic>CACNA1I</italic> from exome sequencing of trio samples<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, disrupt Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel function as assessed in HEK cell line expression systems. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a,b</xref> illustrate the approximate location of amino acids T797 and R1346 in putative extracellular loops that link transmembrane helices 5 and 6 in domains II and III, respectively. We used Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells that harbor inducible, single-copy stable integration of cDNAs encoding C-terminus FLAG-tagged WT, T797M, or R1346H, to investigate hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 function. These cells do not express endogenous Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels. The anti-FLAG Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 signal was only induced following exposure to doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, lanes 1–3) and absent in non-induced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, lanes 4–6). Anti-FLAG Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 signal increased in whole cell lysates prepared from stably transformed cells during 3 days of exposure to doxycycline, and plateaued 72 hours post induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, lanes 1–3).</p>
<p>WT hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3-FLAG protein isolated from whole cell lysates migrates as a doublet at ~250 kDa and &gt;250 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The &gt;250 kDa band is glycosylated based on the shift to ~250 kDa after exposing cell lysates to glycosidases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). We compared total hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3-FLAG protein levels in lysates from cells expressing WT, T797M and R1346H and found that the hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3-FLAG signal in cells expressing R1346H was reduced significantly compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>

The relative level of the &gt;250 kDa glycosylated hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 signal, as a fraction of the total hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 signal, was significantly reduced in cells expressing R1346H compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>, F<sub>(2,23)</sub> = 10.04, <italic>p</italic> = 0.014, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post test, <italic>p</italic><sub>WT, R1346H</sub> = 0.0439). By contrast, the total hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 signal, and the relative abundance of the glycosylated &gt;250 KDa signal from cells expressing T797M were not significantly different from WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, lanes 1 and 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <italic>whole cell</italic>, one-way ANOVA followed with Dunnett’s test, <italic>p</italic><sub>WT,T797M</sub> = 0.2491; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>, one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s test, <italic>p</italic><sub>WT, T797M</sub> = 0.8318).</p>
<p>Biotinylated, surface hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 isolated from cells expressing WT, T797M and R1346H migrates as a single, glycosylated band at &gt;250 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, lane 4–6). The biotinylated R1346H Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 signal was significantly lower compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <italic>surface</italic>, lane 4 and 6, F(2, 20) = 40.78, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0005, one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s test, <italic>p</italic><sub>WT,R1346H</sub> &lt; 0.0001), but biotinylated T797M hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 was not distinguishable from WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <italic>surface</italic>, lane 4 and 5, one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s test, <italic>p</italic><sub>WT, T797M</sub> = 0.5469). Following glycosidase treatment, the surface, biotinylated WT hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 signal shifted to a lower molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>), suggesting that the major fraction of surface hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 is glycosylated. We analyzed Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 mRNA levels in Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells from three different induced cell cultures, and within each experiment quantified mRNA levels 3–4 times. We found no differences among cells expressing WT, R1346H, and T797M hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data demonstrated that hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 protein levels are substantially lower in cells expressing R1346H compared to WT and T797M. The glycosylated R1346H hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 protein fraction (&gt;250 kDa) is preferentially reduced relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>), suggesting that R1346H might interfere with glycosylation and surface trafficking of hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3.</p>
<p>To compare rates of hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 protein decay in cells expressing WT, T797M and R1346H, we treated cells with 0.8 μg/mL puromycin to inhibit protein translation and measured levels of hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 protein at different time points. At this concentration and duration of exposure, puromycin had no obvious cellular toxicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. The 250 kDa lower molecular weight hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 signal decayed relatively rapidly after protein translation was inhibited and was not detectable after 6 hours of puromycin exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). By contrast, the glycosylation-associated &gt;250 kDa hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 signal decayed more slowly and incompletely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). After 48 hrs of exposure to puromycin, the &gt;250 kDa hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 signal was reduced ~50% of control levels similarly among three genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, 48 hr data point, F<sub>(2,20)</sub> = 2.675, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0935, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post test, <italic>p</italic><sub>WT, R1346H</sub> = 0.259, <italic>p</italic><sub>WT, T797M</sub> = 0.540). In the first 2 hrs of puromycin treatment, the &gt;250 kDa hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 signal increased ~40% and ~30% in cells expressing WT and T797M respectively and the levels were not different between the two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, 2 hr data point, F<sub>(2,20)</sub> = 17.6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post test, <italic>p</italic><sub>WT, T797M</sub> = 0.859). We observed ~15% reduction in the &gt;250 kDa band in cells expressing R1346H following exposure to puromycin, and the overall protein levels were lower compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>, 2 hr data point, F<sub>(2,20)</sub> = 17.6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post test, <italic>p</italic><sub>WT, R1346H</sub> = 0.0154). We also showed that GAPDH levels did not decrease following puromycin treatment in cells expressing different Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 clones over the time course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Our data suggest that R1346H reduces the net accumulation of glycosylated hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 compared to wild-type and does not impact the rates of channel protein decay.</p>
<p>Collectively, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that R1346H interferes with surface trafficking of hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 by a mechanism that may involve glycosylation. Two putative N-linked glycosylation sites are within 1 and 4 amino acids of R1346 (N1345 and N1342). Mutations of putative glycosylation sites, N192Q and N271Q in S3-S4 and S5-S6 linkers of domain I of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 protein are associated with reduced levels of biotinylated, functional channels on the cell membrane surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. The glycosylation states of auxiliary subunits of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels have also been reported to influence protein function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>.</p>

<title>hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel current densities are lower in cells expressing R1346H</title>
<p>We next tested if T797M and R1346H affect the functional properties of hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels using whole-cell recording from the same Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 as described above. We used 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the charge carrier for conventional whole-cell recording and resolved large Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 currents that peaked at ~60 pA/pF in cells expressing WT channels. Consistent with our biochemical analyses, hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel current densities in doxycycline-induced HEK293 cells expressing R1346H, but not T797M, were smaller relative to those in cells expressing WT hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3, independent of membrane voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). To compare hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 currents across a range of voltages, we estimated permeability rates from Boltzmann-GHK fits of individual current voltage data sets from cells expressing WT, R1346H and T797M hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>; <italic>left</italic>). Permeability rate was used as a measure of the overall current flow in a cell for a range of voltages (see methods). Permeability rates were ~43.6% lower for hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 currents in cells expressing R1346H compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>; <italic>left</italic>, p<sub>WT,R1346H</sub> = 0.00054, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test followed by Bonferroni correction), whereas permeability rates calculated from cells expressing T797M were similar to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>; <italic>left</italic>, <italic>p</italic><sub>WT,T797M</sub> = 0.923, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test followed by Bonferroni correction). Estimates of the membrane potential at which Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 currents reverse direction were not different in cells expressing WT, R1346H and T797M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>; <italic>right</italic>, <italic>p</italic><sub>WT,R1346H</sub> = 0.36, <italic>p</italic><sub>WT,T797M</sub> = 0.74, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test followed by Bonferroni correction) suggesting that ion selectivity in hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels is unchanged by R1346H and T797M.</p>
<p>We next contracted ChanTest to perform unbiased, high throughput electrophysiology using the Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells expressing hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels, and data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref> (IonWorks Barracuda; Molecular Devices). The large sample sizes, possible from high throughput automated whole-cell analyses, allowed for population analyses of hCav3.3 current densities in cells expressing WT, R1346H or T797M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Population data, displayed in bee swarm and cumulative frequency plots, illustrate that hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 currents in cells expressing R1346H hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 are on average 2-fold smaller compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). The cumulative frequency relationships for each condition were bimodal, consistent with two populations of Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells: one expressing and a smaller fraction not expressing hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Parameterization of each distribution, allowed by the larger sample size, showed that the percentage of cells not expressing hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 current was similar among all variants (WT: 16%, T797M: 16%, R1346H: 20%) and that the median hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 current of cells expressing R1346H was ~2-fold relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>, <italic>p</italic><sub>WT,R1346H</sub> &lt; 0.0001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test followed by Bonferroni correction). These data are consistent with our findings from conventional whole-cell recording.</p>
<p>Lower hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 current densities in cells expressing R1346H could originate from fewer hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels on the cell surface, from reduced current flow through individual hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels, when open, or a combination of both. We used high-resolution, low-noise cell-attached patches to measure the rate of ion flow through single hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a–c</xref>). The amplitude of single hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel currents was consistent with that reported previously for single Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 currents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> and indistinguishable among WT, R1346H, and T797M hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 recordings over a range of test potentials (~13 pS, 110 mM barium as charge carrier; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, <italic>p</italic><sub>WT,R1346H</sub> = 0.85, and <italic>p</italic><sub>WT,T797M</sub> = 0.53, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test followed by Bonferroni correction). We measured single channel current amplitudes from tail currents to generate the single channel I-V relationship because of the larger current amplitudes (greater driving force) at negative voltages. The slow gating kinetics typical of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 currents is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref> from individual traces as well as captured in the ensemble averages. We conclude that the smaller Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 current densities in cells expressing R1346H reflect reduced numbers of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels on the cell surface relative to WT, but the amount of current that flows through individual hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels is unaffected by R1346H.</p>
<p>We completed our assessment of R1346H and T797M hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel properties not captured by analyses of peak current-voltage relationships, using a series of voltage protocols to evaluate whole-cell currents. We assessed: voltage-dependence from tail current analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a–c</xref>.

V<sub>1/2</sub>, <italic>p</italic><sub>WT,R1346H</sub> = 0.12, <italic>p</italic><sub>WT,T797M</sub> = 0.76.

Tail current kinetics provide a measure of the overall rate of channel closing, because the tail potential is below the threshold for channel opening and the slow closing kinetics is a hallmark feature of Ca<sub>V</sub>3 channels, compared to other Ca<sub>V</sub> channels. We conclude from these extensive analyses, that R1346H and T797M do not affect the biophysical properties of hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels as assessed in human cell lines, including the time course of recovery from inactivation (T797M; data not shown). It is important to note that our analyses, which find T797M has no measurable effect on the basic features of hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels including expression levels and biophysical properties, do not rule out a potential effect of T797M that depends on the presence of cofactors in the native environment.</p>

<title>R1346H impacts rebound bursting in a model of TRN neuron</title>
<p>In TRN neurons, transient membrane hyperpolarizations can trigger bursts of action potentials, called rebound bursting, immediately upon membrane repolarization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). This phenomenon is mediated by activation of dendritic Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels that are recruited from a previously inactivated state when the membrane is hyperpolarized. Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 underlies 90% of the low threshold, voltage-gated calcium channel expressed in TRN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and rebound bursting is absent in TRN neurons of mice lacking Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. By simulating TRN neuron excitability in the NEURON environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> we show that: (i) rebound bursting is highly sensitive to Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel density; (ii) rebound bursting is eliminated when Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel density is reduced to 78% or less of initial WT values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>; black line shows WT relationship); and (iii) firing of TRN neurons evoked by depolarizing current injections is insensitive to changes in dendritic Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 current densities to 40% of initial WT values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a,c</xref>).</p>
<p>To simulate heterozygosity—equal contribution of WT and R1346H alleles—we reduced Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 current density to 72.5% of WT levels and showed that this reduction in Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 current density fails to support rebound bursting regardless of hyperpolarization magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>, top three rows). In contrast, firing of TRN neurons, evoked by depolarizing current injections is unaffected by R1346H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>, bottom two rows). The results from NEURON simulation are consistent with the notion that Depolarization-induced firing is primarily mediated by activation of voltage-gated ion channels other than Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 in TRN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p>

Our study is the first to assess the functional impact of two missense <italic>CACNA1I</italic> variants found in schizophrenia patients, but not in unaffected family members<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Based on our analyses, we find that the <italic>de novo</italic> coding variant Chr22: 39665939G &gt; A of <italic>CACNA1I</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, is sufficiently disruptive to Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 in the heterozygous condition to impact rebound bursting in a TRN model neuron. Our data lend support to the proposal that Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 R1346H, which is proposed as one of several <italic>de novo</italic> risk variations that contribute to schizophrenia pathophysiology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, is damaging.

However, we cannot rule out the possibility that T797M impacts Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel function by mechanisms that are not reconstituted in HEK cells.</p>
<p>Our findings are interesting in light of documented functional associations between reduced Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 expression in TRN neurons, rebound bursting of TRN neurons, sleep spindle oscillations, and sleep spindle coherence across cortex in schizophrenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>.

<p>Our data are consistent with a mechanism by which R1346H interferes with Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 glycosylation and plasma membrane trafficking leading to reduced Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 current density. An extracellular N-linked glycosylation motif N1345 (N-x-S/T) encompasses R1346 residue and glycosylation of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is known to influence the rate of protein transport from the ER through the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Our studies add to reports that glycosylation of many ion channel proteins, including Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2, regulates their levels of surface expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Several human diseases are known to arise from defects in glycosylation. For example, in cystic fibrosis causal mutations in human <italic>CFTR</italic> lead to altered glycosylation patterns of CFTR channel protein and channel trafficking defects in lung epithelial cells, and in long QT syndrome, coding mutations in human <italic>KCNE</italic> and <italic>KCNQ</italic> lead to reduced potassium ion channel glycosylation and reduced expression in the heart<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>.</p>
<p>Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 is essential for rebound bursting in TRN neurons, and we show that reduced Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 current density in model TRN neurons expressing R1346H is sufficient to disrupt this phenomenon. Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 is expressed in other brain regions including the cortex and in mitral cell dendrites of the olfactory bulb<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>. In mitral cells, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 contributes to modulation of evoked and asynchronous release, and it mediates rebound bursting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>.

Our experiments were designed to assess the functional consequences of T797M and R1346H on Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel activity in a robust expression system, and they demonstrate that R1346H disrupts Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 channel trafficking to the plasma membrane. We did not identify a phenotype associated with T797M in our assays of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 function and, as discussed above, we cannot rule out the possibility that T797M will be disruptive to Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 signaling in the native environment, but our analyses should help guide future studies designed to assess the potential contribution of R1346H-Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 to schizophrenia risk.</p>

<p>(<bold>a</bold>) <italic>Left</italic>: hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 tail currents from cells expressing WT, T/M, and R/H clones. Currents were recorded after membrane potential is hyperpolarized to −80 mV from a series of steps (−80 mV to +60 mV). Current amplitudes were normalized. (<bold>b</bold>) <italic>Left</italic>: I/I<sub>max</sub> activation at −80 mV from different test potentials. Averages are shown with 99% confidence intervals generated by bootstrap analysis for the three cell lines and; <italic>right</italic>: individual activation curves for each recording. The activation curve is distorted at stronger depolarizations that induce inactivation during the test pulse, but there is no difference among the three clones. (<bold>c</bold>) <italic>Left</italic>: Average V<sub>1/2</sub> values estimated from fitting two Boltzmann functions to individual activation curves in <italic><bold>b</bold></italic>. Average (circle), median (horizontal bar), interquartile range (25<sup>th</sup>–75<sup>th</sup> percentile, box), whiskers (range), and outliers (cross) for each condition. Mean values ± SE for V<sub>1/2-negative</sub>, WT: −40.0 ± 0.98 mV; T/M: −38.8 ± 0.35 mV; and R/H: −37.6 ± 0.99 mV; for V<sub>1/2-positive</sub>, WT: 19.9 ± 2.2 mV; T/M: 22.6 ± 1.46 mV; and R/H: 15.4 ± 2.54 mV; for <italic>k</italic>, WT: 13.4 ± 0.6 mV; T/M: 14.7 ± 0.8 mV; and R/H: 14.3 ± 0.8 mV. (<bold>d</bold>) Calcium currents from cells expressing different hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 as described above for panels <italic><bold>a</bold></italic>and <italic><bold>b</bold></italic>. Left: Currents activated by depolarizations to 0 mV, −20 mV, and −40 mV. Current amplitudes were normalized for visual comparison. (<bold>e</bold>) Time constants estimated from fitting the rising phase of calcium currents evoked by different test potentials (TP) are averaged and plotted as described above for panel<italic><bold>b</bold></italic>. (<bold>f</bold>) Closing rate (τ<sub>closing</sub>) at −60 mV for WT, T/M and R/H hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels. −60 mV was chosen to minimize influence from the differences in current size between R/H and WT. Data are shown similar to panel <bold>b</bold>. Mean values ± SE, τ<sub>closing</sub> for WT: 5.33 ± 0.75 ms; T/M: 5.38 ± 0.88 ms; and R/H: 4.62 ± 0.46 ms. n values (<bold>b</bold>–<bold>f)</bold>, WT: n = 8; T/M: n = 8; and R/H: n = 8.</p>

<title>Inactivation properties were similar among WT, T797M (T/M) and R1346H (R/H) hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels.</title>
<p>P values calculated using the 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (<bold>a</bold>) <italic>Left</italic>: Representative traces to determine the availability of channels to open upon depolarization (voltage-dependence of inactivation). Voltage-dependent inactivation was obtained using a pre-pulse protocol. 2 s inactivating pre-pulses were applied from −110 mV to −10 mV in 10 mV steps; each pre-pulse was followed with a test pulse to −20 mV. <italic>Middle</italic>: voltage dependence of inactivation for WT, T/M and R/H hCav3.3 currents. Symbols represent mean and shaded areas correspond to 95% bootstrapped confidence interval. <italic>Right</italic>: Individual voltage dependent inactivation curves from each genotype are also shown. (<bold>b</bold>) Inactivation curves were fitted to a Boltzmann function. V<sub>1/2</sub> and slope factor (<italic>k)</italic> were similar among the three genotypes. Average (circle), median (horizontal bar), interquartile range (25<sup>th</sup>–75<sup>th</sup> percentile, box), whiskers (range), and outliers (cross) are shown for V<sub>1/2</sub> and <italic>k. Left:</italic> V<sub>1/2</sub> mean ± SE, WT: −67.1 ± 0.89 mV (n = 11); T/M: −65.3 ± 1.30 mV (n = 6); and R/H: −69.4 ± 1.4 mV (n = 5). <italic>Right</italic>: <italic>k</italic> mean ± SE, WT: 6.90 ± 0.21 mV (n = 11); T/M: 6.45 ± 0.37 mV (n = 6); and R/H: 6.93 ± 0.48 mV (n = 5). (<bold>c</bold>) <italic>Left</italic>: representative traces depicting the rate of decay of the calcium current (open-state inactivation) during the test pulse for WT, T/M, R/H hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 channels. Traces were normalized to enable comparisons. <italic>Middle</italic>: the decaying phase of calcium currents at several voltages was fitted to a single exponential. The rate of decay increased with test potential depolarization, and the time constants were similar among the three genotypes at all voltages analyzed. <italic>Right</italic>: time constants of inactivation for individual cells.</p>

<title>hCa<sub>V</sub>3.3 R1346H (R/H) variant impairs rebound burst firing in TRN neuron simulations.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Simulations of membrane voltage in model TRN neurons responding to hyperpolarizing or depolarizing current injections. <italic>Left</italic>: WT neuron fires a burst of rebound action potentials following 200 ms negative, hyperpolarizing current injections of different magnitudes (upper) and bursts of action potentials during the depolarizing current injection (lower). <italic>Right</italic>: Neuron with 72.5% of WT Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 current density to approximate heterozygosity (50% R/H and 50% WT) does not exhibit rebound bursting following hyperpolarization. (<bold>b</bold>) Relationship between number of rebound spikes and size of hyperpolarizing current injection for a range of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 current densities. Percent of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 current relative to WT (black) color coded from green (78%) to red (120%). (<bold>c</bold>) The number of spikes during positive current injections depends on the magnitude of the current injection (x-axis), but it is only marginally influenced by Ca<sub>V</sub>3.3 density. Black lines represent current density for WT and R/H heterozygous cells, with same color spectrum as in (<bold>b</bold>), extended to 40% of WT (blue).</p>
