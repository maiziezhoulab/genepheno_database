<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">The study of early-onset, inherited forms of neurodegenerative disease provides an opportunity to identify how single gene defects lead to neurodegeneration. The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of such monogenetic neurodegenerative disorders with disease onset early in infancy or childhood (5–8 years in the most common form but congenital and rare adult-onset forms also exist). Patients present with a loss of visual acuity followed by onset of seizures and psychiatric disturbances. A progressive mental decline follows, accompanied by loss of motor skills and death usually occurs by the age of 20–30<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The progression of NCL pathology appears similar to many other neurodegenerative disorders in that changes to synapses occur very early and a local activation of glia precedes a regionally specific loss of neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">The NCLs are recessively inherited monogenic disorders (with the exception of one rare adult-onset autosomal dominant form) and mutations have been identified in 13 genes responsible for NCL with varying ages of onset. Mutations in <italic>CLN7/MFS domain-containing 8</italic> (<italic>CLN7</italic>/<italic>MFSD8</italic>) are responsible for late-infantile onset NCL (LINCL or CLN7 disease), with disease onset at 1.5–5 years of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The CLN7 protein is predicted to be a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters, the majority of which have twelve membrane spanning domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In cell culture experiments with tagged forms, CLN7 protein is localized primarily in lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and has been identified by lysosomal proteomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from <italic>CLN7</italic> deficient mice show a loss of lysosomal proteins and deficits in mTOR reactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In the mouse retina, CLN7 protein co-localizes with the post-synaptic density marker, PSD-95<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, indicating the potential for alternative localization in specialist cells.</p>
<p id="Par4">The <italic>in vivo</italic> function of Cln7 remains unknown. Mutant mice show lysosomal dysfunction and a potential impairment of autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> but it is unclear how this leads to neurodegeneration. Evidence is building that loss of the <italic>CLN</italic> genes impacts on synapse function, suggesting that they play a common role either within neurons or non-neuronal cells in the development or homeostasis of synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. To further investigate potential roles for Cln7 we have made use of <italic>Drosophila</italic> where many genes associated with human neurological conditions, including developmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, have been identified to have conserved roles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has one clear orthologue of <italic>Cln7</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, which is widely expressed both in the CNS and other tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Similarly to the mammalian form, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cln7 protein localizes to lysosomes and but also has prominent localization at the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. We have investigated the role of Cln7 at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a model glutaminergic synapse which provides a simple, genetically tractable system to study the core processes of synapse assembly and homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The NMJ exhibits both short-term and longer-term homeostasis mediated by multiple cellular pathways, acting at both sides of the synapse, and many of these mechanisms also act similarly to regulate homeostasis in mammalian neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In addition, normal autophagic flux and endo-lysosomal function are known to maintain the synapse. Mutants affecting lysosomal function or autophagy, including <italic>spinster</italic> and the cation channel <italic>Trpml</italic>, impact on NMJ development and cause expansion of the synapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Neural expression of <italic>Drosophila Cln7</italic> is largely restricted to the optic system but it is expressed more widely in the CNS in glia, including in the glia that form the blood-brain-barrier and in the ensheathing glia that wrap axons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. <italic>Cln7</italic> is also expressed in the neuromuscular system where high levels are found in the muscles which form the postsynaptic cell of the NMJ.</p>
<p id="Par6">To study Cln7 requirement <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model for CLN7 disease by deleting the N-terminal half of the <italic>Cln7</italic> gene. While the animals remain viable, they display impaired locomotion and an associated reduction in synapse size and altered synapse function. We show that a population of Cln7-containing vesicles localizes at the post-synaptic side of the synapse but autophagy is largely intact in the <italic>cln7</italic> mutants and retrograde BMP signaling pathway driving pre-synapse growth functions normally. We show that there is a molecular interaction between Cln7 and the TOR complex activator, Rheb, which suggests Cln7 regulates neural development via TOR from a post-synaptic vesicular compartment.</p>

<p id="Par7">Disruption of the <italic>MFSD8/CLN7</italic> gene has been identified as the cause of the LINCL form of the NCLs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Subsequently, more than 30 different <italic>Cln7</italic> mutations have been characterized. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene CG8596 shows 57% amino acid homology to human <italic>CLN7</italic> and is the unique <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of <italic>Cln7</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

In a parallel study we generated Venus-YFP knock-in forms of Cln7 by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to act as a reporter of expression and sub-cellular localization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. <italic>Cln7</italic> is predominantly a glial protein in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS but it is also expressed in the neurons of the visual system, starting during the early stages of eye development in the late larva and persisting in adult flies (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>) and consistent with the visual pathology that manifests early in CLN7 disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. To study the functional role of Cln7, we generated two loss-of-function alleles of <italic>Cln7</italic> by imprecise excision of the P-element, NP0345, that is inserted in the upstream region proximal to the start codon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1B</xref>).

<title>Cln7 is localized to the post-synaptic side of the neuromuscular junction</title>
<p id="Par8">As there is growing speculation that the synapse is a target of disease in the NCLs, we investigated whether Cln7 functions at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a model glutamatergic synapse that is routinely used to gain insight into molecular function of proteins associated with human neurological disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Using a YFP-Cln7 knock-in reporter line we find <italic>Cln7</italic> is expressed in the glia that ensheath the motor neurons and also in the body wall muscles that form the post-synaptic cells of the NMJ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The expression levels of the YFP reporter are low, as might be expected for the endogenous levels of Cln7. We further examined the localization of Cln7 using higher-resolution Airyscan confocal imaging. We find that Cln7 is present in puncta throughout the muscle cell but also concentrates at the post-synaptic site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2A</xref>). Surrounding each pre-synaptic swelling (or bouton) is a convoluted membranous structure known as the sub-synaptic reticulum (SSR), which contains the post-synaptic glutamate receptors. A commonly-used marker of the SSR, anti-Discs large (Dlg, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PSD-95 ortholog), appears in a continuous pattern around the boutons but higher-resolution imaging reveals that Cln7 is clearly localized to discrete vesicles immediately surrounding the post-synaptic site, rather than in the plasma membrane of the cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2B</xref>). The nature of the Cln7-containing vesicles is not clear but they do not appear to contain Cathepsin L, a lysosomal marker, and lysosomes do not concentrate at the synapse (not shown).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Cln7 localizes to a vesicular compartment at the post-synaptic membrane.

<p id="Par9">Localization of some proteins to the SSR, such as Coracle, requires staufen-dependent trafficking of the mRNA and local translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Cln7 and Coracle proteins are both concentrated at the post-synaptic site and are also both expressed in the ensheathing glia that wrap the motor axons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2D</xref>). However, Cln7 localization is not likely to require local translation at the post-synaptic site because localization is maintained even when a N-terminally-tagged Cln7 fusion protein (Myc-BioID-Cln7) is overexpressed under the control of Mef2-Gal4 and with the endogenous <italic>Cln7</italic> 3′UTR absent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Cln7 is required for normal synaptic growth</title>
<p id="Par10">The distribution of Cln7 within post-synaptic vesicles suggests the protein may function to regulate the synapse and, since LINCL may be a result of synapse failure, we investigated the consequence of a loss of <italic>Cln7</italic> function. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ is a readily accessible glutamatergic synapse and an excellent model system to study synapse function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, so this discovery afforded us an opportunity to ask how Cln7 might function at the post-synaptic site. The peripheral NMJs in late-stage larvae are easily identifiable using immunofluorescence and the innervations are simple, with 2–4 individual motoneurons contacting each muscle cell. The type I motoneurons that innervate the muscle can be further subdivided into two classes called type Ib and type Is classified according to the size of the presynaptic terminal swellings, known as boutons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3A</xref>). The type Ib terminals provide tonic stimulation and the type Is phasic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The overall size of the NMJ is governed by intra-neuronal and trans-synaptic homeostatic mechanisms that modulate NMJ size during development to match pre-synapse size and strength to muscle size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Many mutations affecting the structural and electrical properties of the NMJ consequently affect its size at the late larval stage, including many mutations related to human neurological diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Loss of <italic>Cln7</italic> leads to neurodevelopmental defects.

<p id="Par11">We find that in <italic>Cln7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> animals the NMJ is reduced in size. Manual counting of the swellings of the terminal (boutons) is commonly used as a simple measure of terminal size as the boutons contain most of the active zone synaptic vesicle release sites. At muscle 4 we see a significant reduction of the type Ib motoneuron terminals in the <italic>Cln7</italic> mutant larvae when compared to isogenic control larvae (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3A</xref>). This reduction is consistent with a reduction in synapse growth rather than degeneration as staining with anti-Dlg fails to reveal remnants of postsynaptic specializations left after neuron retraction (data not shown). Some of the boutons in the <italic>Cln7</italic> larvae appeared larger so we also used a non-subjective method of measuring terminal volume from 3D-rendered confocal images. Again, the type Ib terminals were significantly smaller than controls but, interestingly, the type Is terminals were unaffected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3B</xref>). As a further measure of synapse size, we counted the number of active zones at the NMJ. Active zones are visualized with an antibody to Bruchpilot (ELKS), an active zone component<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Bruchpilot positive puncta were counted at muscle 4 and this confirmed that the number of active zones within Ib boutons is reduced in <italic>Cln7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> animals concomitant with the reduction in volume but is unchanged in type Is junctions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3C</xref>). Both alleles of <italic>Cln7</italic> had an identical phenotype as does the transheterozygous combination. Interestingly, both alleles were also haploinsufficient, suggesting some processes important for NMJ development are critically dependent on the levels of the <italic>Cln7</italic> protein. These results suggest a requirement for Cln7 for normal synapse development.</p>

Only knockdown of <italic>Cln7</italic> in the muscle replicated the under-development phenotype at the NMJ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3D</xref>), consistent with the expression of <italic>Cln7</italic>. We also performed the converse experiment of re-expressing YFP-Cln7 in the <italic>Cln7</italic><sup>−/−</sup> background, again with ubiquitous expression (actin-Gal4) or expression restricted to neurons (Elav-Gal4), to muscle (Mef2-Gal4), in both neurons and muscle together (Spin-Gal4) or to glia (Repo-Gal4). Muscle expression with Mef2- or Spin-Gal4 was only capable of partial rescue of function which narrowly failed to reach significance. Only ubiquitous expression fully rescued the phenotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3E</xref>) indicating that some Cln7 function is required elsewhere in addition to the muscle.</p>

<p id="Par13">To examine the consequence of the abnormal synaptic growth we characterized synaptic physiology and larval motility. An electrophysiological analysis of the NMJ was carried out using intracellular recordings. We recorded the spontaneous transmitter release at the larval NMJs for two minutes to calculate miniature excitatory junction potential (mEJP) frequency and amplitude in 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 and 2.0 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration but there was no significant difference due to genotype in either case (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4A</xref>; 2-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison test, p = 0.483).

<p id="Par14">Nerve-evoked excitatory junction potentials (EJPs), were recorded at 1 Hz frequency at 1 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to evaluate synapse function. We found that EJPs at <italic>Cln7</italic> neuromuscular junctions were similar to those produced by control animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4B</xref>). We next applied continuous 5 Hz stimulation to the motor neurons to assess changes in the ability to recruit from the reserve pool of neurotransmitter vesicles. In the control animals, the evoked amplitudes followed a trend towards mild depression as vesicles in the reserve pool become depleted. However, a much more accentuated decline of EJP amplitude was observed in <italic>Cln7</italic> mutant animals under the same conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4C</xref>).

<p id="Par15">The NMJs regulate body-wall muscle contraction. To identify if the electrophysiological changes we detected led to a quantifiable change in locomotion, we measured instantaneous speed of larval crawling.

<title>Autophagy is unaffected in Cln7 mutants</title>
<p id="Par16">Defects in the effectiveness of the autophagy pathway are associated with many forms of neurodegenerative disease, including forms of NCL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and impairment of autophagy is known to cause a reduction in synapse size similar to that seen in the <italic>Cln7</italic> mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In cultured cells, Cln7 is associated predominantly with lysosomes, which are essential mediators of autophagy and mutations affecting lysosomal function lead to a block in autophagic flux. However, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> normal lysosomal function seems to be critical in the neuron<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, whereas Cln7 is restricted to the post-synaptic partner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, we asked whether impaired autophagy in the <italic>Cln7</italic> flies might underpin the synaptic phenotypes.</p>
<p id="Par17">We examined accumulation of p62, a multiple domain protein that acts as a receptor to activate autophagy. Under nutrient-rich conditions, p62 is usually degraded in lysosomes but in starvation conditions autophagic flux is increased and some non-degraded p62 accumulates in lysosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5A</xref>, see <italic>w</italic><sup>1118</sup> control). Thus, p62 levels are often monitored as one readout of autophagic flux. In <italic>Cln7</italic><sup><italic>84D</italic></sup> larvae no p62 accumulates under growth conditions. However, a small but not statistically significant amount of p62 did accumulate under starvation conditions in the <italic>Cln7</italic><sup><italic>84D</italic></sup> larvae, suggesting only a minor impairment in autophagy or lysosomal function (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5A</xref>). This contrasted markedly with <italic>atg18</italic> mutants. Here, p62 clearly accumulated during growth and did so very dramatically under starvation conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5A</xref>). Interestingly, these results are consistent with experiments using <italic>Cln7</italic> deficient cerebellar granule neurons which also failed to show a major defect in autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Autophagy and retrograde BMP signaling are unaffected by loss of Cln7.

<p id="Par18">We also examined whether increasing autophagic flux could rescue the <italic>Cln7</italic> phenotype by inhibiting the TOR complex activity using rapamycin or torin. TORC1 is a central regulator of growth and autophagy and homeostasis in cells and TORC2 is required for normal NMJ development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Inhibition of TORC1 increases autophagic flux which, in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ, leads to an overgrowth phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Previously, it was reported that inhibiting TORC1 with rapamycin was unable to rescue the smaller NMJ phenotype seen in <italic>atg18</italic> mutants, presumably because autophagy is severely compromised in these animals and this cannot be circumvented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. We reasoned that rapamycin treatment would similarly have no effect on the <italic>Cln7</italic> phenotype if it was due to defective autophagy. However, both rapamycin treatment or treatment with the TORC1 and TORC2 inhibitor, torin, caused a robust increase in NMJ size in both control and <italic>Cln7</italic> larvae indicating that autophagic flux can be increased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5B</xref>). Taken together with the lack of p62 accumulation, and given that autophagy is also not overtly affected in <italic>Cln7</italic> deficient cerebellar granule neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, this suggests that the developmental changes in the <italic>Cln7</italic> animals are not due to defective autophagy.</p>

<title>Normal bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) retrograde signaling in Cln7 mutants</title>
<p id="Par19">Since Cln7 is required post-synaptically, we examined whether retrograde signaling necessary for normal growth of the pre-synaptic compartment of the NMJ might require Cln7 function. Retrograde signaling allows matching of pre-synapse size and excitability with muscle size; a key retrograde system is based on a BMP-type signal. Glass-bottomed boat (Gbb), a BMP molecule, is secreted from the muscle and binds to the Type I and II receptors Thick veins (Tkv), Saxophone (Sax) and Wishful thinking (Wit) expressed on the neuronal membrane. Ligand binding results in phosphorylation of the SMAD family member Mothers against dpp (Mad) and its retrograde transport to the nucleus. Mutations in <italic>gbb</italic> or the receptors lead to loss of pMad and a smaller NMJ. Conversely, mutations in <italic>Dad</italic>, which encodes an inhibitory SMAD, lead to NMJ synapse overgrowth and a profusion of small, satellite boutons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par20">Given the enrichment of Cln7 at the PSD and the similarity of the <italic>Cln7</italic> mutant phenotype to those seen for mutations in components of the BMP signaling pathway, we asked whether BMP retrograde signaling is affected by loss of <italic>Cln7</italic>. Potentially Cln7 might act in the post-synaptic muscle cell in the production, processing or presentation of the Gbb ligand. In this case, loss of <italic>Cln7</italic> would give an identical phenotype to loss of Gbb, Tkv, Sax or Wit but a double mutant combination would not make the synapse undergrowth phenotype worse. Similarly, loss of <italic>Cln7</italic> would abolish overgrowth in <italic>Dad</italic> mutants by preventing Mad phosphorylation downstream of Tkv and therefore <italic>Dad;Cln7</italic> double mutants should have a <italic>Cln7</italic>-like undergrowth. We quantified NMJ size in <italic>sax</italic><sup><italic>4/5</italic></sup> and <italic>Dad</italic><sup><italic>J1e4</italic></sup> single mutants and saw the expected undergrowth and overgrowth phenotypes respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5C</xref>). The NMJ synapses size in <italic>sax</italic> mutants was almost identical to the <italic>Cln7</italic><sup><italic>84D</italic></sup> mutants, however, a s<italic>ax</italic><sup><italic>4/5</italic></sup><italic>;Cln7</italic><sup><italic>84D</italic></sup> double mutant combination was lethal before late larval stage suggesting an additive effect and indicating that CLN7 and sax operate in different pathways. A <italic>Dad</italic><sup><italic>J1e4</italic></sup><italic>;Cln7</italic><sup><italic>84D</italic></sup> double mutant combination showed a small reduction in overgrowth resulting in an intermediate phenotype. This suggests that phosphorylation of Mad in response to a Gbb signal is intact in the <italic>Cln7</italic> mutant larvae. To further confirm this, we stained the CNS of wild-type and <italic>Cln7</italic> larvae with anti-pMad.

<title>Loss of Cln7 leads to reduced TORC1 activity in the post-synaptic muscles</title>

<p id="Par23">We next turned to TORC2. TORC2 acts in the neuron to restrict synaptic growth.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par25">Here we have utilized <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model system to identify an <italic>in vivo</italic> role for Cln7/MFSD8, the protein whose activity is reduced in late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, an early onset childhood neurodegenerative disease. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome contains orthologues of some but not all the genes associated with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis suggesting that, while it may not model all aspects of the disease, it can be used to elucidate the core molecular functions of different NCL genes. We demonstrate that Cln7 is required for normal synaptic development, consistent with a growing appreciation that the synapse is a significant target in neurodegenerative disease. When <italic>Cln7</italic> is disrupted, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction fails to reach its normal size having a reduced volume while maintaining normal active zone density. While this is characteristic of mutations affecting autophagic flux within neurons, autophagy is only mildly affected by loss of Cln7. Instead, Cln7 is resident in a vesicular compartment at the post-synaptic side of the junction where it functions to regulate TOR signaling. Previous studies have revealed that TOR signaling has a conserved postsynaptic role to influence retrograde regulation of synaptic activity at central and peripheral synapses in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and that dysregulation of TORC signaling is associated with autism and cognitive decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Recently it has also been observed that Cln7 is required for TOR reactivation in MEFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. We propose that late-infantile NCL may be a consequence of an early failure of synapse development brought about by dysfunctional TORC signaling.</p>

<title>Lysosome protein function in neural development</title>
<p id="Par26">Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis is a disease with multiple, overlapping forms and with varied ages of onset but which share lysosomal dysfunction as a shared feature. Lysosomal function is essential for autophagic flux and, consistent with a predominantly lysosomal localization for the Cln7 protein in cultured cells, autophagy dysfunction was reported in a Cln7 mutant mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Autophagy is also essential for neural development and long-term neural health, including in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Given the similarity of the NMJ phenotype in <italic>Cln7</italic> and various <italic>atg</italic> mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, we assumed defective autophagy was likely to be responsible for the <italic>Cln7</italic> phenotypes. However, autophagy appears to be required pre-synaptically in the neuron rather than post-synaptically and, while we cannot rule out a small contribution, we demonstrate here that autophagy is largely intact in the absence of Cln7. Consistent with this, autophagy was also reported to be ostensibly normal in a <italic>Cln7</italic> deficient cerebellar granule neuron cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par27">Mutations in other lysosomal genes also affect NMJ development. Two notable examples are <italic>spinster</italic>, which encodes an MFS-domain protein localizing to late endosomes and lysosomes in both neurons and muscle; and <italic>Trpml</italic>, encoding a lysosomal cation channel and homolog of the gene mutated in the human lysosomal storage disorder, mucolipodosis type IV. Loss of <italic>spinster</italic> activity leads to excess reactive oxygen species being generated in the neurons. ROS are a cell-autonomous driver of neural growth in this system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and consequently, <italic>spinster</italic> mutants display a large overgrowth of the pre-synaptic compartment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In addition, the retrograde BMP signaling that drives pre-synaptic expansion is also potentiated in the <italic>spinster</italic> mutants, presumably due to inefficient degradation of the active ligand/receptor complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In <italic>Trpml</italic> mutants, a similar undergrowth of the NMJ occurs to that in <italic>Cln7</italic> mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Trpml functions as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel in lysosomes and by regulating an important aspect of lysosomal function – intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis – also regulates autophagy and TORC1 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, like Spinster – and in contrast to Cln7 – Trmpl is required pre-synaptically.

<title>TORC1 and TORC2 activity in neural development</title>

CNS pathology manifests very early in life in CLN7 disease so it is possible that developmental changes to the CNS and synaptic abnormalities (if also present in human CLN7 disease) predicate for later neuropathology, although potential mechanisms driving this are not yet clear. Might the failure to regulate TOR activity correctly underpin degeneration? The mTORC1 complex has a well-established role regulating neural growth and development in the mammalian nervous system. Several activating mutations upstream of mTORC1, including loss of PTEN or Tsc1/2, result in overgrowth of neurons and increase in density of dendritic spines, as do mutations in the translational repressor, FRMP, downstream of active mTORC1. Consistent with these effects, autism is a highly prevalent co-morbid feature in human disorders caused by mutations in these genes, including tuberous sclerosis, PTEN harmatoma syndrome and Fragile-X syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. TORC1 activity also has conserved functions regulating synaptic homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The effects of loss of TORC activity on metabolism – particular lipid metabolism – are well recognized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> but how a reduction in TORC activity effects the nervous system, and how loss might contribute to neurological disease in the NCLs is less well understood. Our identification of molecular interactions between Cln7 and Rheb places Cln7 in the regulatory framework governing TOR activity in neurons but exactly how it functions will require identification of the other Cln7-interacting proteins, the composition of protein complexes involving Cln7 and an understanding of the cargo transported by the Cln7 protein.</p>

<title>Implications for the NCLs</title>
<p id="Par29">Lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is affected in several lysosomal disorders, including CLN3 disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and, while Cln7 is not likely to be a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, it will be interesting to ask if changes to Ca<sup>2+</sup> accompany, and potentially underpin, the loss of post-synaptic TORC activity in Cln7 mutants, as they appear to pre-synaptically in <italic>Trmpl</italic> mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Many of the CLN proteins are considered to be lysosomal but lysosomes are predominantly localized in a peri-nuclear location in neurons. However, a proportion of Cln7 also localizes to the plasma membrane in non-polarized, cultured cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This makes the presence of Cln7 in a vesicular compartment at the post-synaptic membrane intriguing, especially given the co-localization of Cln7 and PSD-95 in the mouse retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Palmitoyl protein thioesterase (Ppt1) is a lysosomal protease mutated in CLN1 disease. While Ppt1 is clearly lysosomal in most cultured non-neuronal cells, a synaptic pool appears to exist additionally in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Potentially, alternative localizations for the CLN proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> in the CNS may be an important part of the emerging story of synaptic dysfunction in the NCLs.</p>

<title>Drosophila lines</title>
<p id="Par30"><italic>Drosophila</italic> lines were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center at Indiana University except for an isogenic <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> control strain from the Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> Resource Center; PG-Gal4 (<italic>NP6293) from the Kyoto DGRC Stock Center</italic>; Spin-Gal4 and <italic>Dad</italic><sup><italic>j1e4</italic></sup> from Dr. Sean Sweeney (University of York, UK); and <italic>rictor</italic><sup><italic>Δ42</italic></sup> from Dr. Joseph Bateman (King’s College London). Gal4 lines used with stock numbers as of January 2019 were as follows: actin (BL3954); Elav<sup>c155</sup> (BL458); Mef2 (BL27930); vGlut (BL26160); Repo (BL7415); PG (Kyoto: 105188). The Cln7 RNAi line used was yv;TRiP.HMC03819 (BL55664). To generate UAS-Venus-Cln7, the full-length Cln7 ORF was amplified by proofreading PCR using clone GH22722 as a template and cloned into pENTR/D-Topo. After sequence verification it was recombined into the pTVW destination vector obtained from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genetics Resource Center, University of Indiana and transformants generated by BestGene.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>Cln7</italic> mutants</title>
<p id="Par31">The P-element NP0345 inserted in the 5′UTR of the <italic>Cln7</italic> locus (CG8596) was excised by mating to the Δ2–3 transposase line. Two independent deletion alleles, 36H and 84D, were identified by PCR and subsequently backcrossed over 6 generations to the isogenic <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> control.</p>

<sec id="Sec18">
<title>Visualization of the larval NMJ</title>
<p id="Par32">The pre-synaptic membrane was visualized with Alexa-594 goat anti-HRP (1;1000; Jackson Immuno) except for volume measurements from confocal z-sections when a membrane-localized GFP was used (OK371-Gal4, UAS-CD8::GFP) with rabbit anti-GFP (AbCam ab290, 1:1000). To ensure constant culture density and conditions between samples, cohorts of 100 1<sup>st</sup> instar larvae were picked from the agar plates and transferred to vials of freshly made food and incubated for 3–4 days until wandering 3<sup>rd</sup> instar stage. Larval flat mounts were immunostained using standard procedures. Briefly, tissue was fixed for 20 min in 4% EM-grade formaldehyde in HL-3. After washing, tissue was permeabilised and blocked in 1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C for primary antibodies and for 2 h at room temperature for secondary antibodies. Stained tissue was mounted in Prolong Gold and visualized on a Zeiss LSM510 Meta, LSM780 or LSM880 Airsycan confocal microscopes using 40X N.A. 1.4 oil immersion, 40X N.A. 1.2 water immersion or 100x N.A. 1.46 oil immersion PlanApo lenses, respectively. Active zones were stained with mouse anti-Bruchpilot (clone NC82, 1:25; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) and the post-synaptic density with anti-Dlg (clone 4F3, 1:20; DSHB). Rabbit anti-pMAD (1:500) was a gift of Prof. Carl-Henrik Heldin (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala). YFP-Cln7 was visualized with rabbit anti-GFP (1:5000; AbCam ab290). Rabbit anti-pS6 (1:400) was a gift of Dr. Jongkyeong Chung, Seoul National University<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Alexa-488 and Alexa-594-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immuno Research and used at 1:500 dilution.</p>

<sec id="Sec19">
<title>Quantification of NMJ size</title>
<p id="Par33">Volumes were acquired with an optical slice width of 1.0 μM and steps of 0.5 μM using a 40x N.A. 1.4 PlanApo objective and zoom = 2.0. Volocity was used to render the volumes then to measure the volume of the pre-synaptic membrane and to count active zones. Boutons were counted manually for the type Ib junction on muscle 4 of segments A3-A5. In each case a transmitted light image of the corresponding muscle was obtained at 10x and the muscle surface area calculated by outlining in ImageJ. Bouton number was then normalized to the muscle surface area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec20">
<title>Quantification of pS6 fluorescence</title>
<p id="Par34">pS6 fluorescence was quantified from single optical planes collected using a 25x N.A. 0.8 water immersion objective. The mean fluorescence from square ROIs of area 185 μm<sup>2</sup> of muscles 6 and 7 was calculated in imageJ, avoiding trachea and bright pre-synaptic puncta. The mean of the 14 areas was used as the mean fluorescent intensity for that animal. The plot profile tool was used to report the maximal fluorescence of individual active zones.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec21">
<title>Quantification of larval movement</title>
<p id="Par35">Wandering 3<sup>rd</sup> instar stage larvae were transferred to a custom 3D-printed chamber comprising 12 oval troughs each 3 mm deep and with a track length of 75 mm. Each trough was lined with a thin coating of 3% w/v agar. The chamber was lit from below by a LED light table and filmed from above with a Basler GigE camera. Cohorts of 12 larvae crawling were filmed for 5 min each and their position tracked at 2.5 fps using Ethovision software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec22">
<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p id="Par36">Wandering 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae were dissected in HL3.1 supplemented with Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration at 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 or 2.0 mM depending on the paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Recordings were made from muscle 4 of segments A3-A5 using standard protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Baseline synaptic transmission was characterized by recording mEJPs for 2 min and 16 EJPs stimulated at 1 Hz. For high frequency stimulation, 16 EPSPs at 1 Hz were recorded followed by 5 Hz stimulation for 5 min. In all experiments a minimum of 8 larvae were used with maximum of 2 recordings per larva. In each case the starting resting potential of the muscle was −60 to −75 mV and resistance of 5–10 mΩ. Analysis of electrophysiological recordings was performed in Clampfit 10.0 and data exported for further analysis in Prism 7.0.</p>

Larvae were then removed from the food and protein samples prepared for each genotype. The remaining 10 larvae for each genotype were starved of amino acids for 4 h at 25 °C. Lysates of total protein were prepared by manually crushing the larvae with a mini-pestle directly into 200 μl Laemmli buffer containing 8 mM DTT and protease inhibitors.</p>

<title>Cell transfection, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence</title>
<p id="Par38">To generate expression plasmids, the <italic>Cln7</italic> pENTR clone was recombined into pAMW. The full-length Rheb ORF was amplified from clone GH10361 and cloned in to pENTR. After sequence verification it was recombined in pAFW. Tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with Myc-Trap_MA beads or anti-FLAG M2 Affinity gel overnight at 4 °C. For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed 48 h after transfection in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min then stained as for larval tissue except that Hoechst was added to the diluted secondary antibodies at 1:10,000 to label DNA. Coverslips were mounted in ProLong Gold (Thermo) and viewed on a LSM780 confocal microscope. Primary mouse anti-Flag and goat anti-myc were the same as for western blots but used at 1:500. Secondary antibodies were Alexa-488 donkey anti-goat and Alexa-594 donkey anti-mouse (1:500; Jackson Immuno Research).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec25">
<title>Western blotting</title>
<p id="Par39">Protein were separated by standard SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes by wet transfer. Primary antibodies were: mouse anti-Flag M2 (1:5000; Sigma); goat anti-myc (1:1000; AbCam ab9132); rabbit anti-Ref(2)P (<italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of p62, 1:500; a gift of Dr. Gabor Juhasz, Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest); and mouse anti-actin (clone JLA-20, 1:500; DSHB). Secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (both 1:4000, Cell Signaling Technologies). Detection of HRP was with SuperSignal West Femto ECL reagent in conjunction with a Vilber Fusion FX system. p62 levels were normalized to actin from 16-bit images using ImageJ.</p>

<sec id="Sec26">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p id="Par40">All statistical tests were performed within Prism 7. Normality of datasets was determined using a D’Agostino-Pearson test and datasets not conforming to Gaussian distributions were transformed with logarithmic or reciprocal transformations. Non-parametric tests were used where distributions remained non-Gaussian after transformation. Survival was compared by log-rank analysis. Samples sizes and tests used are described in the figure legends. Significance in all cases was set at p &lt; 0.05.</p>
