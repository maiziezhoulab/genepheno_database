<abstract>
<p>Nature is always the best inspiration for basic research. A family with severe thrombosis and antithrombin deficiency, the strongest anticoagulant, carried a new mutation affecting the translation-start codon of <italic>SERPINC1</italic>, the gene encoding antithrombin. Expression of this variant in a eukaryotic cell system produced three different antithrombins. Two downstream methionines were used as alternative initiation codons, generating highly expressed small aglycosylated antithrombins with cytoplasmic localization. Wild-type antithrombin was generated by the use of the mutated AUU as initiation codon. Actually, any codon except for the three stop codons might be used to initiate translation in this strong Kozak context.</p>
<p>We show unexpected consequences of natural mutations affecting translation-start codons. Downstream alternative initiation AUG codons may be used when the start codon is mutated, generating smaller molecules with potential different cell localization, biochemical features and unexplored consequences. Additionally, our data further support the use of other codons apart from AUG for initiation of translation in eukaryotes.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>It is well accepted that in most eukaryotic mRNAs the selection of the translational initiation site occur via a scanning mechanism which identify a start AUG codon. Thus, mutations disturbing this initiation codon will probably have important biological consequences. Indeed, there are examples of diseases caused by mutations affecting initiation AUG codons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. However, most of studies identifying mutations affecting this codon in patients are restricted to the genetic characterization of the mutation and to family studies to demonstrate the cosegregation with the disease phenotype. Actually, current mutation databases, described incorrectly the missense consequence extrapolated from the effect of the mutation on the affected codon, when that amino acid change probably will never happen. For example, in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), the five mutations affecting the initiation codon of <italic>F8</italic>, the gene encoding FVIII, identified in patients with haemophilia A, all are considered as missense mutations (Met-Thr; Met-Arg; Met-Ile; Met-Val and Met-Leu). The identification and the characterization of new natural mutations affecting initiation codons may reveal both new information on this key biological process and the pathogenic consequences of disturbing a correct initiation of translation.</p>
<p>Antithrombin is a serpin that inhibits multiple procoagulant serine proteases, mainly thrombin and factor Xa, by an efficient mechanism. Consequently, antithrombin plays a key anticoagulant role by correctly controlling and preventing inappropriate, excessive or mislocalized clotting of blood, which may cause venous thromboembolism (VTE). [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] Thus, antithrombin deficiency was the first and so far strongest thrombophilic factor, identified 50 years ago, with autosomic and dominant features. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] Accordingly, antithrombin deficiency is evaluated in patients with early or recurrent thrombosis, as well as in cases with familial history of thrombosis or with thrombosis at unusual localizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Analysis of antithrombin and <italic>SERPINC1</italic>, the gene encoding this anticoagulant, in patients with deficiency has been very helpful to identify mechanisms involved in its deficiency, as well as to describe key functional residues of this anticoagulant. The best example is the identification of residues involved in the interaction with heparin, a cofactor that fully activates the anticoagulant capacity of antithrombin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Moreover, these studies may also assist to identify prognostic markers, as there is a considerable clinical heterogeneity among patients with reduced antithrombin activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. When the mutation impairs the transcription, the RNA stability, the folding or the secretion of the molecule, no variant antithrombin is detected in plasma. This quantitative defect is named type I deficiency, is rare in the general population, and significantly increases the risk of VTE. Alternatively, when the mutation does not significantly impair the secretion of the variant molecule but reduces or abolish its anticoagulant activity causes a qualitative deficiency that is called type II deficiency. Type II deficiencies are more frequent in the general population and usually associate with milder risk of VTE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], although for certain mutations, the variant associates with stronger clinical severity than mutations causing type I deficiency, because the mutation may also have a dominant negative effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. The characterization of families with antithrombin deficiency and very severe clinical phenotype might assist to identify new mechanisms associated with the risk of VTE.</p>
<p>Antithrombin is a glycoprotein synthesized by hepatocytes as a 464 amino acid precursor. As for most of secretory proteins, antithrombin contains a signal peptide (32 amino acids for antithrombin), which is crucial for introducing the nascent protein into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Translocation of the protein into the ER is followed by post-translational processing, which includes disulphide bond formation, N-glycosylation, signal peptide cleavage, and strict protein folding into a metastable conformation, which is required for its efficient mechanism of inhibition of this serpin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p>
<p>The present work has characterized a new <italic>SERPINC1</italic> mutation identified in a family with antithrombin deficiency that displayed very severe clinical phenotype. The study revealed surprising results affecting classical concepts of cellular and molecular biology that open new perspectives on the pathological relevance of mutations disturbing the initiation codon.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="s2_1">
<title>Clinical data</title>
<p>The proband, a Norwegian woman, was diagnosed of renal vein thrombosis at the age of 14. Multiple recurrences appeared during her short life, as a massive cerebral thrombotic occlusion occurring at the age of 26 caused her death. Thrombophilic analysis was done in the proband. Levels of protein C and protein S were found repeatedly normal at occasions when she was only treated with low molecular weight heparin. The proband did not carry prothrombotic polymorphisms, prothrombin G2010A and factor V Leiden. Lupus anticoagulant was not present. The JAK-2 V617F mutation was not detected. The single thrombophilic defect identified was antithrombin deficiency, with anti-FXa values of 55% and antigen levels of 56% compared with that observed in a pool of 100 healthy blood donors (100%). These results suggest a type I deficiency. Eighteen relatives had antithrombin deficiency with a mean anti-FXa activity of 55±2.6% and antigen levels of 56±1.8%, and all except two young carriers, developed early and/or recurrent venous or arterial thrombotic events, in four cases with fatal consequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p>

<title>Genetic study</title>
<p>Sequence of <italic>SERPINC1</italic> in the proband revealed a c.3G&gt;T heterozygous mutation in exon 1 that affects the translation-initiation codon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). This mutation predicts a missense change p.(Met1Ile), but it theoretically abolished protein translation, which might explain the type I deficiency of carriers. This mutation has not been previously described (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/all.php">http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/all.php</ext-link>). However, other mutation affecting the same AUG codon with different consequence p.(Met1Thr) has been identified in a Japanese patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Interestingly, the patient and her father carrying this different mutation affecting the initiation AUG codon also had early venous and arterial thrombotic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Sequencing of <italic>SERPINC1</italic> in 4 relatives with antithrombin deficiency and relevant thrombotic history, including pulmonary embolism, stroke and recurrent thrombosis, confirmed the presence of the c.3G&gt;T mutation in heterozygous state in all patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2_3">
<title>Biochemical characterization of antithrombin deficiency</title>
<p>Electrophoretic and Western blot analysis of plasma antithrombin confirmed the reduction of levels among carriers of the <italic>SERPINC1</italic> c.3G&gt;T mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). No abnormal forms of antithrombin were identified in plasma of carriers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). All these data confirmed a type I antithrombin deficiency. Similarly Japanese carriers of p.(Met1Thr) mutation also had type I antithrombin deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2_4">
<title>Recombinant model</title>
<p>The extraordinary severe clinical phenotype associated with this mutation, which is even more severe than that found in patients with nonsense mutations leading to type I deficiency from our cohort of 250 unrelated patients with congenital antithrombin deficiency, encouraged us to perform further studies. <italic>in vitro</italic> studies were designed to test if this mutation might induce the expression of an aberrant antithrombin with a potential gain of function that might help to explain the clinical phenotype of carriers. Accordingly, recombinant expression of this mutation was done in HEK-EBNA eukaryotic cells.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Western blot analysis with the polyclonal antibody against human antithrombin of conditioned media of HEK-EBNA cells transfected with the mutated plasmid revealed three proteins, although expression was 5-20-fold lower than that observed in cells transfected with the wild-type plasmid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). One band had the same electrophoretic mobility as the wild-type antithrombin (58 KDa) while two smaller bands were also detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). These small forms (∼46 KDa) although had lower expression than the wild-type molecule, still showed a high intracellular expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Purification of proteins from the conditioned media was done following the same strategy to purify plasma antithrombin: heparin affinity and ion exchange, supporting that all recombinant proteins bind heparin.</p>
<p>Proteomic analysis of recombinant antithrombins confirmed that all proteins corresponded to human antithrombin. For the small molecules, 19 peptides, covering 57% of the antithrombin sequence, were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). The ATEDEGSEQK (residues 26-35) was the first aminoterminal peptide identified in the smaller proteins, but the first aminoterminal peptides of the wild-type antithrombin: HGSPVDICTAKPR and DIPMNPMNPMCIYR were not detected in the small antithrombins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Neither mutations nor aberrant post-translational modifications were detected by proteomic analysis.</p>
<p>Treatment of conditioned media with PNGase-F confirmed that the 58 KDa band corresponded to the fully glycosylated wild-type antithrombin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Interestingly, the 46 KDa bands did not change their electrophoretic mobility after treatment with PNGase-F and they were still smaller than aglycosylated wild-type antithrombin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), supporting that these aberrant and smaller antithrombins had no N-glycosylation but also have lost few residues. Unfortunately, Edman’s sequencing of these smaller antithrombins rendered no results because of insufficient purified protein.</p>
<p>Functional studies confirmed that the 58 KDa protein also had anticoagulant activity, as covalent 90 KDa thrombin-antithrombin complexes were formed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In contrast, the small 46 KDa proteins did not form complexes with thrombin but seemed to behave as a substrate for this protease, as a smaller band (45 KDa) was detected when incubated with thrombin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Functional studies done with conditioned media of cells transfected with plasmids containing a stop codon at position 1, which produce small 46 KDa antithrombins but did not produce wild-type antithrombin (see later), confirmed that the 46 KDa proteins did not form thrombin-antithrombin complexes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and had no anti-FXa activity in a chromogenic assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p>

Interestingly, immunoelectron-microscopy revealed significant differences in the intracellular distribution of antithrombin. HEK-EBNA cells transfected with the wild-type plasmid had a strong and specific expression of antithrombin in the ER and Golgi apparatus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

<title>Site directed mutagenesis to verify the use of alternative initiation codons</title>
<p>Site directed mutagenesis of the pCEP4-S169A-M1I plasmid were designed to evaluate whether alternative translation-initiation codons might be used in the recombinant model to produce the three antithrombins detected by Western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>We firstly tried to clarify the small antithrombins, which according to the electrophoretic, glycomic, proteomic and electron microscopy data, might be explained by the use of down-stream in frame methionines. In human antithrombin the first two in frame methionines excluding the initiation codon are located at positions Met49 and Met52; 17 and 20 residues behind the signal peptide, in the mature protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Mutation of the codons encoding Met49 and Met52 to stop codons, confirmed that these methionines were used as alternative translation-initiation codons when the initiation codon encoding methionine 1 (Met1) was mutated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). The context of these methionines has a high score for potential initiation of translation (0.670 and 0.466, respectively vs. 0.938 for the wild-type Kozak sequence surrounding Met1 in <italic>SERPINC1</italic> mRNA and 0.843 for the Kozak sequence surrounding Met1 in the plasmid used for recombinant expression) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p>

</fig>
<p>We initially proposed two hypotheses to explain the presence of a wild-type molecule in cells transfected with the c.3G&gt;T mutation: contamination with wild-type plasmid or an alternative initiation methionine up-stream, in the plasmid sequence. We identified an AUG codon keeping the reading frame of antithrombin, located 40 residues up-stream (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). However, mutation of this residue to an isoleucine codon, did not modify the expression pattern, and the three antithrombins were still detected in the conditioned media (data not shown). Indeed, there are 4 stop codons downstream this -40 AUG codon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). This experiment, together with the nonsense mutagenesis disturbing Met49 and Met52 (M49X and M52X, respectively), which did not produced the wild-type antithrombin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) and the mutation of arginine 161 to a stop codon (R161X) that produced no antithrombin at all (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), discarded any potential contamination with wild-type plasmid. Thus, we explored the potential use of other codon, different than the AUG, as initiation of translation to explain the wild-type antithrombin detected in our eukaryotic cell model when transfected with the mutant plasmid. The first candidate was a CUG codon (coding for leucine), located 5 positions upstream, as this codon may initiate translation in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. However, neither mutation to valine (L-5V) nor to stop (L-5X), abolished the expression of the wild-type antithrombin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). To localize the new translation-initiation site, codons surrounding Ile1 were mutated to stop codons. While a stop codon in Thr-1 (T-1X) did still produce the three antithrombins, a stop codon in Asn4 (N4X) only rendered the two small antithrombins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). These data, together with the high score for initiation of translation of codon 1 in the plasmid (0.843) strongly suggest that the AUU codon encoding isoleucine might be used as initiation of translation. Ten site directed mutagenesis were done in the AUU codon encoding Ile1 to test different nucleotides in each position of this initiation codon. All tested combinations produced the three antithrombins at different levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>), except those encoding stop codons, which only produced the two small antithrombins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, we also disturbed the Kozak sequence in the wild-type plasmid (M1), maintaining the initiation AUG codon. A stop codon at Thr-1 (T-1X) also caused a severe reduction of wild-type antithrombin in the conditioned media, but interestingly, also rendered the intracellular expression of small antithrombin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>).</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>There are few studies evaluating the consequences of mutations disturbing translation initiation codons in recombinant models, as it is generally considered these mutations cause the loss of the affected molecule by abolishing translation. In some cases the mutation lead to loss of function, finding no expression of the variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], but few studies showed the use of in-frame downstream methionines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, translation may not necessarily occur from the first downstream alternative start site, or from a single alternative start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. An interesting example is a second-site mutation in the initiation codon of <italic>WAS</italic> (c.1A&gt;T) that allows the use of a close downstream AUG codon (p.M1-P5del). This alternative initiation bypass the pathogenic consequences of the c.11delG; p.G4fsX40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p>
<p>There are some gene variations affecting this codon or the surrounding Kozak sequence with mild consequences according to the high frequency of the mutated allele. One excellent example is the rs291466 SNP affecting the initiation AUG codon of the 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase (HIBCH). The c.2T&gt;C mutation causes a missense change of the initiation methionine codon to threonine. Interestingly, the minor-allele frequency of this SNP is very high (0.43), and homozygous carriers of this SNP have higher methylmalonic acid expression than carriers of the wild-type allele encoding for methionine at position 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Thus, the study of new natural mutations affecting initiation codons may help to understand the potential consequences of these genetic defects, particularly if mutations are identified in patients with a disorder and recombinant models support the clinical data.</p>
<p>The mutation of the initiation methionine codon of <italic>SERPINC1</italic> identified in a thrombophilic family could explain the apparent type I antithrombin deficiency diagnosed in carriers. However, we express this mutation in a eukaryotic cell model aiming to supply further evidences on the consequences of new mutations affecting initiation methionine codons. We also aimed to get additional information that might explain the severe clinical phenotype of carriers (with early and recurrent thrombosis that had fatal consequences in some carriers). Our recombinant studies demonstrate that alternative AUG codons may be used in <italic>SERPINC1</italic> when the initiation methionine is mutated. Two in-frame downstream AUG codons, in a relatively appropriate Kozak context may be used. Interestingly, these alternative downstream AUG codons will generate variant molecules that are expressed at high rates when the wild-type initiation AUG codon is mutated. As these two alternative initiation codons are behind the signal peptide, the proteins generated had no hydrophobic signal peptide and do not enter into the ER. Consequently, these small antithrombins locate in the cytoplasm and they are not glycosylated. Other mutation affecting the signal peptide p.(Leu22Pro) identified in a patient with type I antithrombin deficiency also supports the relevance of the hydrophobic nature of the signal peptide to direct the protein to ER for cotranslational processing events and secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. We think this mechanism should also affect the other mutation also affecting the initiation AUG codon described in a patient with antithrombin deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. There are evidences supporting the use of AUG codons to initiate translation in suboptimal Kozak context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] and still they are used for initiation without mutations affecting the triplet encoding Met1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Actually, alternative translation initiation is a mechanism involved in the variability of the human proteome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. There are also clues of this bypass mechanism when Met1 is mutated in other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] but as far as we know this is the first example affecting a serpin. Interestingly, despite of lacking the N-terminal region and N-glycosylation, these small antithrombins are synthesized in a eukaryotic cell line, and have different cellular localization than the native protein. It is required to know the functions that these aberrant antithrombins might play in carriers of this mutation. They do not have anticoagulant function, but it is possible that the reactive center loop of these small antithrombins might be exposed since the protein seems to be cleaved by thrombin. As the N-terminal region of serpins is the portion with minor conservation in the superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], it is possible that these small antithrombins might be folded, playing a new function. We speculate that the expression of variant antithrombins with different cell location might be involved the severe clinical phenotype of carriers. Patients carrying nonsense mutations in <italic>SERPINC1</italic>, having a high risk of thrombosis, do not usually display the clinical severity shown by this family. Two different mechanisms of gain of function have been suggested to explain the increased clinical severity of mutations associated with antithrombin deficiency, both requiring from generation of an aberrant antithrombin with dominant negative effect that impair the function of the wild-type molecule in heterozygous patients. 1) The deletion of the reactive P1 residue (Arg425) does not only cause a loss of function. This variant (Antithrombin London) has no anticoagulant activity, but also acquires a gain of function: its increased heparin affinity reduces the activation of the wild-type antithrombin by competing to bind heparin. Thus, heterozygous carriers of this mutation have reduced anticoagulant capacity under restricted heparin concentrations. Accordingly, carriers of this mutation have severe thrombotic phenotype that includes early, arterial or recurrent thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. 2) Mutations inducing the folding of antithrombin into hyperstable conformations (latent or polymers) might also reduce the anticoagulant capacity by impairing the function of wild-type molecules. The latent antithrombin forms dimers with native antithrombin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] and mutations inducing the formation of antithrombin polymers incorporate wild-type monomers into the growing polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. We speculated that the cytoplasmic aberrant antithrombins generated by the p.Met1? mutation might get a new gain of function that could contribute to the severe clinical phenotype of carriers. Further experiments are required to define the biological relevance of the small antithrombins and to verify such attractive hypothesis. It would also important to clarify in new experiment why these cytosolic aberrant proteins may reach the conditioned media, although there are alternative pathways to secrete cytosolic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>].</p>
<p>Secondly, our study shows new and fascinating data on the initiation of translation in eukaryotes. It is generally assumed that translation occurs in eukaryotic cells at the canonical AUG-methionine codon. However, in certain cases, initiation can occur at codons differing from AUG by a single nucleotide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Our recombinant model in eukaryotic cells revealed that potentially all codons may be used to initiate translation if they are in a proper Kozak context. Additional studies are required to quantify the efficiency of translation of each triplet. Only triplets encoding stop codons are not able to initiate translation. This last result argues against the use of the Met-tRNA to initiate translation independently of the codon present in the RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Actually, a recent study suggests that initiation of translation may occur with amino acids encoded by the mutated initiation codon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Unfortunately, the low amount of protein generated in our model, and the processing of the protein, which releases the signal peptide, did not allow identifying the initiation amino acid of the wild-type antithrombin observed in cells transfected with the mutated plasmid. A very recent study demonstrated that other codons than AUG might be used to start the protein synthesis rather than internal methionines in translation-initiation mutants of the ABO blood group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Additionally, the characterization of open reading frames in mouse embryonic stem cells have shown that a great number of alternate initiation sites are non-AUG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, nature is always an excellent source of biological information. The study of a severe thrombophilic family with antithrombin deficiency has identified not only a new mutation in <italic>SERPINC1</italic>, but also new clues on potential new pathological functions of unexpected aberrant proteins and fascinating news on the initiation of translation. The proposed consequences available in mutation databases of mutations affecting the initiation methionine may be incorrect. Two bypassing mechanisms may generate aberrant proteins when mutations affect the initiation methionine: i) downstream methionine codons may be used, resulting in smaller variants (with different post-translational modifications) that might reach abnormal cell localization, like our case; or generate completely different proteins, all with unknown functions and potential unpredictable pathogenic consequences; ii) non-AUG may be used as initiation codons, which may generate proteins with milder (if any) variations. Thus, our study encourages to deep evaluating individually the mutations affecting initiation methionines in different genes, which might have consequences ranging from a mild to a severe effect.</p>
