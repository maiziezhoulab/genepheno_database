<abstract>
<p>Emerging evidence suggests that active DNA demethylation machinery plays important epigenetic roles in mammalian adult neurogenesis; however, the precise molecular mechanisms and critical functional players of DNA demethylation in this process remain largely unexplored. Ten–eleven translocation (Tet) proteins convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and its downstream derivatives. Here we show that 5hmC is elevated during the differentiation of adult neural stem cells (aNSCs), and Tet2 is primarily responsible for modulating 5hmC dynamics. Depletion of Tet2 leads to increased aNSC proliferation and reduced differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Genome-wide transcriptional analyses reveal important epigenetic roles of Tet2 in maintaining the transcriptome landscape related to neurogenesis. Mechanistically, transcription factor forkhead box O3 (Foxo3a) physically interacts with Tet2 and regulates the expression of genes related to aNSC proliferation. These data together establish an important role for the Tet2-Foxo3a axis in epigenetically regulating critical genes in aNSCs during adult neurogenesis.</p>

<body>
<p>Epigenetic regulation represents a fundamental mechanism that maintains cell-type-specific gene expression during development and serves as an essential mediator to interface between the extrinsic environment and intrinsic genetic programs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. DNA methylation and histone modifications are the predominant forms of epigenetic regulations. Combined, these modifications in the context of chromatin have been described as ‘epigenetic codes’ that underpin gene expression programs and determine cell identity. At the DNA level, methylation of cytosine at the 5-carbon position (5-methylcytosine; 5mC) has been well studied as a critical epigenetic mark in the mammalian genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Cell-type-specific landscapes of methylation patterns, the methylome, confer one of the bases for cell-type-specific gene expression, resulting in vastly diverse cellular phenotypes and functions out of identical genetic materials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Moreover, dynamic regulation of DNA methylation in response to various neuronal activities in the brain is critical for normal brain function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.</p>
<p>5mC used to be viewed as a stable and long-lasting covalent modification to DNA; however, the fact that ten–eleven translocation (TET) proteins, including TET1, TET2 and TET3, could convert 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), giving us a new perspective on the previously observed plasticity in 5mC-dependent regulatory processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Furthermore, TET enzymes are also known to further oxidize 5hmC into 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC), which can be readily repaired by DNA repair enzymes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Present evidence indicates that 5hmC-mediated epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and affect the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p>
<p>Adult neurogenesis occurs in discrete regions of the adult mammalian brain, namely the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) in the hippocampus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The newly generated neurons then integrate into the neuronal circuitry and modulate neural plasticity. Aberrant adult neurogenesis is linked to intellectual disabilities and neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Emerging evidence suggests that various epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs, as well as cross-talk among these mechanisms, play important roles in fine-tuning and coordinating gene expression during adult neurogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. TET-mediated oxidation of 5mC presents a particularly intriguing epigenetic regulatory paradigm in the mammalian brain, where its dynamic regulation is critical. In brain, 5hmC is significantly enriched relative to many other tissues and cell types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. 5hmC, but not 5mC, is found to increase during embryonic neurodevelopment and is associated with activated neuronal functional genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Genome-wide profiling during neurodevelopment and aging suggests that 5hmC is not only acquired during postnatal neurodevelopment and aging, but also displays spatial and temporal dynamics, pointing to its important role(s) in normal brain function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Indeed, recent research has shown that Tet1 regulates activity-induced gene expression in neurons and modulates the formation and extinction of specific types of memory<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Tet1 also regulates neurogenesis by influencing DNA methylation states at the promoters of selective genes related to neurogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. However, the precise epigenetic role(s) of 5hmC in adult neurogenesis, particularly in balancing adult NSC proliferation and differentiation plasticity, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the specific neuronal functions of individual Tet proteins and their functional partners during adult neurogenesis remain unclear.</p>
<p>Here we show that 5hmC abundance increases upon adult neural stem cell (aNSC) differentiation, accompanied by the specific elevation of Tet2 protein. We found that loss of Tet2 shifted the balance of aNSC states by promoting proliferation and impairing their differentiation ability <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Genome-wide transcriptional analyses echoed the phenotypic observations at the molecular level that the loss of Tet2 results in significant alteration of the transcriptome landscape related to aNSC proliferation and differentiation. Genome-wide 5hmC profiling suggested a positive correlation between 5hmC intragenic dynamics and a large portion of transcriptional upregulation. Mechanistically, we found that transcription factor forkhead box O3 (Foxo3a) interacted and coordinated with Tet2 to directly regulate proliferation-related genes. The binding of Foxo3a was significantly increased on the promoters of these genes in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs, concurring with the elevated 5hmC at these loci, to stimulate their transcription. <italic>In vitro</italic> analyses revealed that Foxo3a could preferentially bind to the motifs with 5hmC marks. Knockdown of Foxo3a in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs could rescue the deficits associated with the loss of the Tet2. These data together establish an important epigenetic role for the Tet2-Foxo3a axis in adult neurogenesis.</p>

<title>Tet2 is important for 5hmC dynamics during adult neurogenesis</title>
<p>Tet-mediated DNA demethylation is implicated in the regulation of gene expression during neurodevelopment and neurogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. To dissect the specific and precise roles of Tet homologs, as well as cytosine oxidation dynamics during adult neurogenesis, we first isolated <italic>in vivo</italic> Nestin<sup>+</sup>/Sox2<sup>+</sup> aNSCs from the dentate gyrus of 2-month-old wild-type (WT) adult mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a–d</xref>). These aNSCs could proliferate (referred as proliferating aNSCs or aNSCs hereafter) and produce both β-III tubulin (Tuj1)-positive neuronal cells and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive glial cells after two days of differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> (referred as differentiated cells hereafter; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e–h</xref>), confirming their pluripotency and capacity for adult neurogenesis. There were few GFAP+/Nestin+ double-positive cells in the differentiated conditions, indicating that the majority of cells have committed to either neuronal or glial lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1i–l</xref>). Co-immunofluorescence (IF) staining using 5hmC-specific antibody and the aNSC marker Nestin showed that 5hmC resided in the nuclei of Nestin-positive aNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a–d</xref>). Interestingly, a significant and specific increase of Tet2 expression among all three Tet proteins was found in differentiated aNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). In the meantime, a significant increase of global 5hmC level was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>, WT_P versus WT_D, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). These data were in line with the previous observation that 5hmC accumulated during embryonic and postnatal neurodevelopment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In contrast, differentiation from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to embryonic bodies (EBs) led to a significant reduction in 5hmC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h,i</xref>, ES versus 5 days EB differentiation, D5, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test), suggesting a unique pattern of 5hmC in aNSC differentiation. The increase of 5hmC during aNSC differentiation was further confirmed using a highly sensitive mass spectrometry (liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)) approach (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>, WT_P versus WT_D, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). The expression dynamics of three Tet homologs in mice DG during postnatal neurodevelopment were also examined. Only Tet2 displayed a specific and significant increase during postnatal neurodevelopment compared to other Tet proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test), consistent with the observations in aNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Tet1 showed significant downregulation, whereas Tet3 was marginally elevated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01 and <italic>P</italic>=0.35, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). These data led us to further focus on Tet2 in adult neurogenesis.</p>
<p>To determine the essential roles of Tet2 in aNSC proliferation and differentiation, and its impact on adult neuronal functions, we isolated <italic>in vivo</italic> Nestin<sup>+</sup>/Sox2<sup>+</sup> aNSCs from the brains of adult <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice by replacing part of exon 3 sequences of the <italic>Tet2</italic> gene with nlacZ/nGFP as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, together with age-matched wild-type littermates. Tet2 depletion decreased global 5hmC levels in both proliferating and differentiated <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>). Furthermore, loss of Tet2 consistently led to a significant decrease in 5hmC levels during postnatal brain development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c,d</xref>). Thus, Tet2 is not only required to maintain 5hmC levels in proliferating aNSCs, it is also involved in the increased 5hmC levels upon aNSC differentiation. These data together indicated a predominant role of Tet2 in modulating 5hmC level during adult neurogenesis and neurodevelopment.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Tet2 regulates adult neurogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Given the roles of Tet2 in modulating 5hmC levels during neurogenesis, we examined whether loss of Tet2 could influence the proliferation and/or differentiation states of aNSCs. We first performed a BrdU (an analog of thymidine) incorporation assay to assess the effects of Tet2 ablation on aNSC proliferation. IF staining of BrdU showed more BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,d</xref> comparing to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>, respectively), and stereology quantification indicated a 51.7% increase of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs relative to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test), suggesting that Tet2 depletion stimulated aNSC proliferation. The increased proliferation in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs <italic>per se</italic> was further supported by the BrdU/Nestin and BrdU/Sox2 co-staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>). We then surveyed the effect of Tet2 depletion on the differentiation of aNSCs. IF staining experiments showed that loss of Tet2 led to fewer neuronal marker Tuj1-positive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2j</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>) and glial cell marker GFAP-positive glial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2k</xref> compared to 2g). The quantification indicated 71.8% fewer Tuj1<sup>+</sup> neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2n</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test) and 45.1% fewer GFAP<sup>+</sup> glial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2o</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test), indicating the loss of Tet2 could impair aNSC differentiation.</p>
<p>To validate the effects of Tet2 depletion on aNSC differentiation, we analyzed the promoter activity of pan-neuronal transcription factor NeuroD1 and glial cell marker GFAP in WT aNSCs using a previously described dual luciferase reporter assay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. We found that the loss of Tet2 could significantly decrease the promoter activities of NeuroD1 and GFAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). In addition, the expression of the neural stem cell marker Nestin in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs is significantly higher than in WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). We then quantified the expression of several established neuronal and glial marker mRNA levels and found that the expression of neuronal cell markers β III-Tubulin (Tuj1) and NeuroD1 significantly decreased (55% and 94.4%, respectively) in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs relative to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c,d</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). The expression of glial cell markers GFAP and s100β also displayed significant reductions (95.7% and 58%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4e,f</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). Moreover, siRNA knockdown of Tet2 in WT aNSCs resulted in significant downregulation of NeuroD1 and GFAP luciferase activities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4g,h</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01 and <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). To confirm the direct roles of Tet2 in modulating adult neurogenesis, we performed electroporation to re-express Tet2 in the <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs. The re-expression of Tet2 significantly restored the NeuroD1 and GFAP reporter expression comparing to <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs, supporting the key role of Tet2 in adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4i,j</xref>).</p>
<p>To validate the important role of Tet2 in adult neurogenesis, we transiently knocked down Tet2 in wildtype aNSCs by shRNA electroporation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). The Tet2 knockdown led to the upregulation of Nestin and downregulation of NeuroD1 and GFAP, consistent with the increased proliferation and impaired differentiation in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). Importantly, simultaneous knockdown of both Tet1 and Tet2 in wildtype aNSCs resulted in a significant decrease of both NeuroD1 and GFAP reporter expression, indicating the double-knockdown impaired aNSC differentiation, the same effects observed in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and Tet2 shRNA knockdown aNSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5c,d</xref>). On the other hand, the depletion of both Tet1 and Tet2 significantly enhanced the aNSC proliferation rate, evidenced by significant increase of BrdU-positive cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e,f</xref>). These observations indicated the Tet1 and Tet2 double knockdown in adult NSCs displayed similar characteristics comparing to <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSC. Collectively, our data strongly support the predominant roles of Tet2 in regulating adult neurogenesis, and loss of Tet2 shifted the balance of aNSC states by promoting proliferation and impairing their differentiation.</p>
<p>To further investigate the roles of Tet2 in regulating adult neurogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, both <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and WT mice were administered BrdU and killed at 1 or 4 weeks afterwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2p</xref>). We first performed BrdU and Ki67 IF staining to assess the proliferation of aNSCs <italic>in vivo</italic> and found that most BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells and Ki67+ cells localized at the subgranular zone (SGZ) at the 1-week time point. Furthermore, there were significant higher BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells and Ki67+ cells in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2q</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>).

At the 4-week time point, some newborn neurons migrated to the granular zone and became mature neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>, NeuN staining), and total BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were still significantly higher than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2r</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). However, there were significantly fewer (43% fewer) newborn neurons (BrdU<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup>) in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2s</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). In addition, the percentage of newborn neurons (BrdU<sup>+</sup> NeuN<sup>+</sup>) from <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice was significantly lower than WT mice after 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2t</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). No significant difference was found in hippocampus volume (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.4, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test) and the survival rate of aNSCs between WT and <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6d</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.4, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test).

<title>Tet2 regulates the expression of neurogenic genes</title>
<p>To understand the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the adult neurogenesis associated with the loss of Tet2, we applied RNA-seq to profile the global transcriptome from <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs and their WT controls to first assess how loss of Tet2 could influence genome-wide transcriptome in functional adult aNSCs. RNA-seq analyses indicated that Tet2 depletion resulted in 703 significantly upregulated and 979 downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>, average <italic>P</italic> value 0.0031 and 2.27E–03, respectively, cuffdiff <italic>t</italic>-test). Interestingly, gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed specific enrichment of upregulated genes in the cell cycle and DNA replication pathways. In contrast, the downregulated genes were largely enriched in GO terms related to neuronal functions, such as glutamate receptor signalling, synapse assembly, and dendrite morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). We also performed RNA-seq in WT and <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSC differentiated cells and compared the expression changes of these genes in differentiated cells. This panel of upregulated genes in the absence of Tet2 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>) appeared to be explicitly associated with aNSCs, as these genes did not show obvious differences in the differentiated WT or <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>, aNSC versus Differentiation). However, the patterns of downregulated genes showed a more similar trend between aNSC and differentiated cells than upregulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>), suggesting the upregulated genes are <italic>bona fide</italic> to the skewed aNSC characteristics in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs. Closer examination of these differentially expressed genes in protein interaction networks suggested that many of them are related to cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation, such as the mitotic sister chromatid segregation and glutamate receptor signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8c,d</xref>). The expression of several downregulated genes or upregulated genes in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs involved in neuronal differentiation or cell growth/proliferation were further confirmed by qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9a,b</xref>). Taken together, the global alteration of the transcriptome landscape in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs is in line with the phenotypic observations that Tet2 depletion led to enhanced proliferation and impaired neuronal differentiation.</p>

<title>5hmC dynamics correlates with transcriptomic alterations</title>
<p>Genome-wide 5hmC profiling from WT and <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs were obtained using the previously described chemical-based 5hmC-containing DNA enrichment coupled with high-throughput sequencing (hMe-Seal)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs showed 84% fewer unique 5hmC peaks compared to WT, consistent with the dot blot results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref>). No significant difference of Tet1 or Tet3 expression was found when Tet2 was depleted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10b</xref>, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test), consistent with the Tet2 is primarily responsible for adult neurogenesis. Nonetheless, Tet2 western blotting demonstrated the complete depletion of Tet2 at the protein level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig.10c</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent studies suggested a positive correlation between intragenic 5hmC with transcription control during neuronal development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. We sought to investigate whether Tet2 was primarily involved in controlling intragenic 5hmC dynamics and thus epigenetically modulating aNSC signature transcripts during adult neurogenesis. Since 5hmC has also been implicated in distal regulatory regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> that can be specifically controlled by Tet2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), we investigated the 5hmC dynamics between 5-kb upstream of transcription start sites (TSS) and downstream of transcription end sites (TES). Metagene plots of normalized 5hmC reads on 703 significantly upregulated genes and 979 downregulated genes revealed an overall positive correlation between 5hmC and transcription in WT and <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs. On upregulated genes, average 5hmC showed a general increase in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs, including promoters (1 kb±TSS) and gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). On the other hand, 5hmC was primarily reduced between promoters to the first two thirds of gene bodies (66% average position normalized to gene length), but showed a modest increase on promoters and the last third of the gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the 703 significantly upregulated genes emerged to be specific between WT and <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), they were likely to reflect the primary phenotypic effects in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs. In addition, Tet2 knockdown is known to directly increase intragenic 5hmC in ES cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, in line with our observations in aNSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We thus focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms of Tet2 and 5hmC in modulating these upregulated genes. We first calculated the average intragenic 5hmC levels on each individual upregulated gene and found 62% (439, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, binomial test) of the 703 upregulated genes bore higher 5hmC tag density in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). GO analyses on the 439 genes with higher intragenic 5hmC in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs preserved the key pathways related to DNA replication and mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>). In comparison, GO analyses on the 38% of upregulated genes with reduced 5hmC in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> were largely involved in protein depolymerization and disassembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 10d</xref>). The sequencing results of the hME-Seal were further validated by loci-specific qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11a,b</xref>). These observations indicated Tet2 and 5hmC directly regulated genuine genes correlated with aNSC proliferation, whose ectopic upregulation in the <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs were corresponding to the balance shift between proliferation and differentiation.</p>

<title>Foxo3a interacts with Tet2 to regulate adult neurogenesis</title>
<p>Previously, along with others, we found that 5hmC is highly enriched within distal regulatory regions, particularly enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. To identify the potential transcription factor(s) that could be involved in Tet2-mediated epigenetic modulation in neurogenesis, we examined the published ChIP-seq datasets of multiple transcription factors that have been linked to neurogenesis previously, and overlapped them with the 5hmC dynamic regions regulated by Tet2. We observed that Foxo3a binding sites have the most overlap. Foxo3a, a mammalian forkhead family member, is well known to regulate gene expression and help preserve an intact pool of neural stem cells, at least in part by negatively regulating neuronal differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Analyses of genome-wide Foxo3a binding patterns in aNSCs revealed that Foxo3a is enriched at the enhancers of genes involved in neurogenic pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Intriguingly, it has also been suggested Foxo3a could serve as a transcriptional activator<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>; however, detailed mechanistic insight into Foxo3a as a transcription factor moderating adult neurogenesis remains as an open question. To systematically investigate the regulatory role of Foxo3a in adult neurogenesis, especially its coordination with Tet2 and cytosine modifications, we performed our own Foxo3a chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) in control and <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs. 56.4% of our Foxo3a ChIP-seq peaks overlapped with published Foxo3a binding sites using different NSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 11c</xref>). It is now widely accepted that Tet proteins can influence proximal DNA modifications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, thus we first separately merged the Foxo3a or 5hmC peaks from WT and <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>) and tested their correlation by overlapping peaks within 500 bp of 5hmC peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>). Interestingly, 8,179 out of 21,395 Foxo3a peaks resided within a 500-bp range of 5hmC peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, binomial test), implying the potential orchestration between Foxo3a and Tet2 in aNSCs. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether Foxo3a is biochemically associated with Tet2 protein. We performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments followed by western blot analyses using WT aNSCs with anti-Foxo3a and anti-Tet2 antibodies, and found that endogenous Tet2 could be readily precipitated by Foxo3a and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). To further confirm this observation, we performed additional co-IP experiments using HEK293 cells transfected with Myc-tagged full-length mouse Tet2 and FLAG-tagged mouse Foxo3a. The Tet2-Foxo3a binding was validated by reciprocal IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). We reasoned that, as a transcriptional activator, Foxo3a ought to be dynamically enriched in promoter regions and positively correlated with upregulated genes in the absence of Tet2. To test this, we focused on the Foxo3a dynamic changes on promoter regions of 439 upregulated genes modulated by Tet2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). Remarkably, 310 out of 439 (70.6%) of these genes displayed increased Foxo3a promoter binding in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, binomial test), indicating these genes were likely under the control of both Tet2 and Foxo3a. GO analyses on these genes revealed similar enrichment of proliferation-related pathways, including DNA replication chromosome organization and the cell cycle. Interestingly, Foxo3a-regulated genes were also enriched in nervous system development, reflecting the neuronal signature of Foxo3a, besides its general roles in modulating aNSC proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>).</p>
<p>We generated heatmaps using Foxo3a and 5hmC log<sub>2</sub> normalized reads per million on promoters (500 bp upstream and downstream of transcription start sites (TSS)) and gene bodies (from 500 bp downstream of TSS to transcription end sites (TES)) of 310 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>) co-regulated by Tet2 and Foxo3a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). Violin plots to quantify the mean of each heatmap lane with statistical analyses were also engaged. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>, Foxo3a showed higher enrichment on promoters than gene bodies, and Tet2 depletion led to significantly increased Foxo3a binding to these promoters (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). 5hmC levels were also significantly increased in the absence of Tet2 (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). Both Foxo3a and 5hmC on gene bodies showed a modestly significant increase in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> versus WT comparing to their bindings on promoters (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). These data present a mechanistic correlation of Foxo3a and 5hmC on promoters of these upregulated genes in the absence of Tet2. We chose two cohorts of upregulated genes co-regulated by Tet2 and Foxo3a from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref> that are involved in the cell cycle (<italic>n</italic>=38) and nervous system development (<italic>n</italic>=54) to investigate the Foxo3a and 5hmC dynamics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>). Foxo3a showed the significant elevation on promoters of genes in both groups, again correlated with promoter 5hmC dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>, <italic>P</italic>=0.003 and <italic>P</italic>=0.01, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test).</p>
<p>To validate the predominant roles of Foxo3a in the regulation of the upregulated genes in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs, we examined the Foxo3a and 5hmC dynamic changes on the promoters and gene bodies among significantly upregulated and downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13a</xref>). Both Foxo3a and 5hmC showed substantially more and significant enrichment on the promoters of upregulated genes than downregulated genes in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs comparing to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13a</xref>). These observations support the predominant roles of Foxo3a on upregulated genes by binding to their promoters. Overall Foxo3a and 5hmC changes on the gene bodies positively correlated with their expression, but the Foxo3a changes on the gene bodies of downregulated genes were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 13b</xref>, <italic>P</italic>=0.2, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). These data suggested the positive correlation of Foxo3a and 5hmC primarily for promoter binding, and thus affect transcription involved in proliferation. In addition, these analyses further indicated that Foxo3a might not be the direct regulator for these downregulated genes.</p>
<p>Since specific and significant increase of Foxo3a binding was observed at the promoters of upregulated genes in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs and correlated with 5hmC accumulations <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 12 and 13a</xref>), we sought to test whether 5hmC accumulation could directly recruit Foxo3a as a mechanism to stimulate these gene expression. To test this possibility, we synthesized two sets of biotin-labelled DNA oligos with identical sequences based on Foxo3a ChIP-seq top motifs. The cytosines in the consensuses sequence were either hydroxymethylated (5hmC probe) or unmodified (control probe), with the latter used as a negative control. Control and 5hmC-containing probes were used for <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay using equal amount of Foxo3a recombinant protein. We found that Foxo3a displayed significantly stronger binding to the 5hmC-modified probes over control <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 14a,b</xref>). These data, together with Foxo3a/5hmC correlation <italic>in vivo</italic>, revealed the molecular mechanism of upregulated genes that 5hmC accumulation upon Tet2 deletion served as a binding platform to further recruit Foxo3a and stimulate gene expression.</p>
<p>To confirm the direct role of Foxo3a in regulating gene expression related to aNSC proliferation, several genes from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref> were examined by qPCR in WT, <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSC and <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSC with the knockdown of Foxo3a mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 14c</xref>). The Foxo3a knockdown significantly reduced the upregulation of these genes caused by the Tet2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c–e</xref>, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). Furthermore, Foxo3a knockdown significantly ameliorate the over-proliferation deficits in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f</xref>), supporting an important role of Tet2-Foxo3a axis in the regulation of adult neurogenesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our data presented here highlight the unique function of Tet2 in dynamic 5hmC regulation during adult neurogenesis. The loss of Tet2 significantly decreased 5hmC levels and partially blocked the acquisition of 5hmC upon aNSC differentiation. We found that the loss of Tet2 promoted aNSC proliferation but inhibited their differentiation both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Global transcriptome analyses established the molecular bases of these phenotypic observations, with significantly upregulated or downregulated genes involved in aNSC proliferation or neuronal differentiation, respectively. Mechanistically, we found that Tet2 interacted with the neuronal transcription activator Foxo3a and co-regulated key genes involved in aNSC proliferation. Tet2 depletion led to an ectopic increase of Foxo3a and 5hmC on promoters and intragenic regions of genes involved in the cell cycle and nervous system development. The preferential binding of Foxo3a to hydroxymethylated DNA were further confirmed <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, our data suggest a model wherein, in wild-type aNSCs, Tet2 and Foxo3a bind and co-regulate genes involved in normal aNSC proliferation and aNSC signature/plasticity maintenance. The presence of Tet2 on these genes maintains promoter and intragenic 5hmC homeostasis, which could determine the Foxo3a binding dynamics to keep its amount optimized on these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). In the absence of Tet2, 5hmC accumulates on promoters and gene bodies due to the impaired DNA demethylation process and recruits additional Foxo3a to ectopically increase the expression of these genes and cause a skewed aNSC proliferation and differentiation balance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>).</p>
<p>Although all three Tet homologues in mammals possess the indistinguishable ability to oxidize 5mC to 5hmC <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, due to their conserved catalytic domain in C-terminals, their protein structures, expression in various tissues and at different developmental stages, as well as their ability to control 5mC/5hmC oxidation loci genome-wide and influence gene expression, appear to be quite different<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Earlier work showed that loss of Tet1 leads to a decrease in the self-renewal capability of aNSCs, whereas its loss did not impact the differentiation potential<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. This is the opposite of what we found here in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, indicating that Tet1 and Tet2 have distinct roles in the regulation of neurogenesis. Indeed, Tet1 was found to regulate neurogenesis by influencing DNA methylation states at the promoters of selective genes related to neurogenesis, while our study here demonstrated the important roles of a Tet2 interactor, Foxo3a, in targeting the promoters of genes related to aNSC proliferation. Nonetheless, simultaneous knockdown of Tet1 and Tet2 in aNSCs recapitulated the enhanced proliferation and impaired differentiation in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> or Tet2 shRNA knockdown, suggesting a primary role of Tet2 in regulating adult neurogenesis.</p>
<p>Our molecular analyses suggested Tet2 epigenetically controlled a subset of genes related to proliferation and differentiation, and determined their levels during the transition. Depletion of Tet2 resulted in the global alteration of gene expression and 5hmC level. These molecular data fitted well to explain the phenotype observed in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs. A recent study in mouse ES cells revealed that Tet1 depletion decreases 5hmC in both TSS and gene bodies, while Tet2 depletion impairs 5hmC levels primarily in gene bodies with a gain of 5hmC in TSS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Our 5hmC profiling data in aNSCs showed the 5hmC on gene bodies seemed to correlate well with significant altered transcription. This positive correlation of 5hmC with gene expression appeared to be more specific in aNSCs than mouse ESCs since no correlation of 5hmC and gene expression was found in mESCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Interestingly a recent study showed depletion of Tet2 in mast cells can also promote mast cell proliferation and inhibit their differentiation into myeloid cells. Importantly, their data, in agreement with ours, suggested the control of mast cell proliferation appeared to be predominantly Tet2-dependent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. These facts together indicated a universal and specific role of Tet2 to prevent overgrowth of different cell types. It has been well established that various mutations of Tet2 lead to the development of myeloid malignancy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, thus the Tet2 loss-of-function mutations or deletions in aNSCs could link aberrant neurogenesis to the development of brain tumours such as gliomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Furthermore, these results validated our approaches to focus on the aNSC upregulated genes in the absence of Tet2, such as oncogene Kit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>) that also appeared to be Tet2 target in mast cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p>
<p>Intense efforts have gone into pinpointing the detailed molecular mechanisms of how Tet proteins regulate gene expression through cytosine oxidation. Our present data revealed a novel Tet2 binding protein, Foxo3a, and a coordinative role of Tet2-Foxo3a in modulating aNSC proliferation and signature genes. It has been reported that Foxo3a is required to regulate the Notch signalling pathway during the self-renewal of adult muscle stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, and a recent publication suggests its role in defining enhancers in neurogenic genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Our data helped explain the molecular basis of differential gene expression regulated by Foxo3a in the absence of Tet2. Although overall 5hmC levels are significantly reduced in the absence of Tet2, its levels and intragenic distributions on critical upregulated genes related to aNSC pluripotency and signature are actually elevated. These observations provided an alternative insight that Tet2 can not only increase 5hmC levels by converting 5mC to <italic>de novo</italic> 5hmC, but can also further modulate the cytosine oxidation dynamic by converting 5hmC to 5fC/5caC. This characteristic of Tet2 was particularly important to maintain the 5hmC homeostasis on critical genes and keep the amount of transcription factor binding, such as Foxo3a, in check. Thus, our findings here define a novel mechanism of the Tet2-Foxo3a axis in epigenetically modulating transcriptome dynamics involved in aNSC proliferation and characteristics.</p>

The aNSCs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and immunofluorescence was performed as described below.</p>
<p>For the <italic>in vivo</italic> neurogenesis assay, adult WT and <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice received two BrdU injections per day (50 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, i.p.) at an interval of 8 h for a total of six injections. To study proliferation, 1 week after the final BrdU administration, one group of mice was anesthetized with chloral hydrate (50 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) and perfused with PBS, followed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. To study differentiation, 4 wk after the final BrdU administration, another group of mice was killed and brains were removed for dehydration in 30% sucrose overnight. The 40-μm brain sections were collected with a cryostat (Leica), and immunofluorescence staining was performed. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-rat Nestin (1:500 in IF, BD, Cat. 556309), rabbit anti-Sox2 (1:500 in IF, Millipore, Cat.

<title>Electroporation and luciferase assays</title>
<p>Cultured WT and <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> aNSCs were used for electroporation assay with an electroporator (Amaxa Lonza). In brief, cell pellets were resuspended with 100 μl nucleofection solution. After electroporation, cells were plated into poly-ornithine/Laminin-coated 24-well plates with fresh proliferation medium. The second day, the proliferation medium was replaced with differentiation medium, and cells were continuously cultured for another 36–40 h. The luciferase assay was performed with a luminometer according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). A measure of 0.1 μg Renilla-luc plasmids and 2 μg NeuroD1-/GFAP-luc plasmids were used, respectively. For re-expression of Tet2, shRNA against Tet1 and Tet2 were obtained from Qiagen. For the acute knockdown electroporation assay, the final concentration of siRNA was 100 nM (siGenome SMART Pool, M-058965-01, Dharmacon).</p>

Average normalized 5hmC mapped reads per million from WT, <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, and non-enriched input DNA were calculated in each bin of each gene, and average bin values from all genes were plotted. 5hmC in <italic>Tet2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> showed higher enrichment on the gene bodies of upregulated genes and lower enrichment on downregulated genes compared to 5hmC from WT aNSCs. The entire transcripts from transcription start sites (TSS) to transcription ending sites (TES) were referred as intragenic regions. (<bold>c</bold>) Circular map view of upregulated genes in the absence of Tet2 and their correlation with 5hmC are indicated. Each mouse chromosome is shown in the black-and-white outer track. Orange lines attached to the chromosomes indicate the chromosomal locations of 703 upregulated genes.

<title>The Tet2-Foxo3a axis was critical in modulating aNSC transcriptome landscape involved in proliferation and aNSC characteristics.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) In WT aNSCs, Tet2 and Foxo3a bind and co-regulate the genes involved in aNSC proliferation and aNSC signature/plasticity maintenance. The binding of Tet2 to these genes maintains promoter and intragenic 5hmC homeostasis, which could determine the Foxo3a binding dynamics to keep its amount optimized on these regions. (<bold>b</bold>) In the absence of Tet2, 5hmC accumulates on promoters and gene bodies due to the impaired DNA demethylation process and recruits additional Foxo3a to ectopically increase the expression of these genes and cause skewed aNSC proliferation and differentiation balance.</p>
