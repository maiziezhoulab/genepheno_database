<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The NOTCH2 gene plays a role in the development of many tumors. Deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 3 (DTX3) was identified as a novel E3 ligase for NOTCH2 and as a potential therapeutic target for esophageal cancer. However, whether DTX3 could regulate NOTCH2 to suppress the progression of esophageal carcinoma remains unknown. In our study, NOTCH2 had higher expression in human esophageal carcinoma cell lines compared to normal human esophageal epithelial cell line, and ablation of NOTCH2 suppressed the proliferation and migration of esophageal carcinoma cells. A novel E3 ligase for NOTCH2 was identified by yeast two‐hybrid (Y2H) screening, and DTX3 promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of NOTCH2. Further study showed that DTX3 overexpression suppressed the proliferation and tumorigenicity of human oesophageal carcinoma cells. The analysis of tissue samples from patients revealed that the expression of NOTCH2 was high while the expression of DTX3 was low in esophageal cancer. Furthermore, the expression of DTX3 and NOTCH2 showed a significant negative correlation in human oesophageal cancer samples. Our study suggested that the DTX3‐NOTCH2 axis plays an important role in the progression of esophageal cancer, and DTX3 acts as an anti–oncogene in esophageal carcinoma, potentially offering a therapeutic target for esophageal cancer.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Esophageal cancer (EC) is a highly prevalent malignancy worldwide. According to data released by the American Cancer Society in 2018 the number of estimated new cases of EC was 17 290 in the USA, accounting for 10% of digestive system tumors; the estimated number of deaths from EC was 15 850, ranking seventh among all malignancies.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0002">2</xref> According to the data released by the National Cancer Registry Center of China in 2015, the prevalence of EC was 21.17/100 000 in China in 2012, ranking fifth among all malignancies; the mortality rate was 15.58/100 000, ranking fourth among all malignancies.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0003">3</xref> Today, although the treatment for EC is multidisciplinary, surgery remains the most effective therapeutic approach in patients without metastatic disease.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0006">6</xref> There is still no good treatment method for metastatic EC.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0007">7</xref> Targeted therapy is widely used in cancer treatment because of its minimal side effects compared to other strategies, so new targets for EC treatment are urgently needed.</p>
<p>The Notch signaling pathway is implicated in self‐renewal of stem cells, cell‐fate determination of progenitor cells and terminal differentiation of proliferating cells.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0008">8</xref> Notch family receptors, including NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTCH4, are type I transmembrane proteins with extracellular EGF‐like repeats.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0009">9</xref> DLL1, DLL3, DLL4, JAG1 and JAG2 with Delta/Serrate/LAG‐2 (DSL) domain are typical Notch ligands.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0008">8</xref> Notch‐ligand binding induces the cleavage of Notch receptor by metalloprotease and γ‐secretase to release Notch intracellular domain (NICD), then translocates into the nucleus to associate with DSL transcription factor which mediates gene transcription.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0005">5</xref> Notch signaling is oncogenic in a variety of human tumors, such as through chromosomal translocation of NOTCH1 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0010">10</xref> amplification and overexpression of NOTCH2 in medulloblastoma,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0011">11</xref> and amplification and overexpression of NOTCH3 in ovarian cancer.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0012">12</xref> The gene mutation of Notch pathways, including NOTCH2, is reported to be involved in EC.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0014">14</xref> A notably higher NOTCH2 expression level was found in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues, and its overexpression was significantly associated with worse overall survival and progression‐free survival rates in ESCC patients.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0015">15</xref> In this study, the function of NOTCH2 in EC cells was extensively elucidated, and deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 3 (DTX3) was identified as a novel E3 ligase for NOTCH2 and promoted its degradation, revealing a potential therapeutic target for EC.</p>

<title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<sec id="cas14288-sec-0003">
<label>2.1</label>
<title>Plasmid construction</title>
<p>The shRNA for NOTCH2 and DTX3 were synthesized as oligos (Sangon), annealed and inserted into the pLKO.1 vector that was digested with EcoRI and AgeI, the specific sequence for shRNA (see Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="cas14288-sup-0001">S1</xref>). The shRNA2 for NOTCH2/DTX3 were designed and targeted for the 3′‐UTR sequence. The plasmids of pCDH, pCDH‐NOTCH2, pCDH‐DTX3‐Flag, pDEST32‐NOTCH2 and pDEST22‐DTX3 were kindly provided by Professor Ronggui Hu (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China). The plasmid of pCDH‐DTX3‐Flag (ΔRING) was generated using the QuikChange Site‐Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="cas14288-sec-0004">
<label>2.2</label>
<title>Cell culture, transfection and treatment</title>
<p>The normal human esophageal epithelial cell line (HEEC) and human esophageal carcinoma cell lines KYSE150, TE‐1 and Eca‐109 were cultured in RPMI‐1640 medium, supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (all from Gibco), in a 37°C humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The plasmids contained NOTCH2/DTX3 shRNA or DTX3 were transiently transfected into human esophageal carcinoma cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the stably transfected cell lines were screened by puromycin (2 μg/μL, Thermofisher). For bortezomib (BTZ), bafilomycin (BAF) or cycloheximide (CHX) treatments, cells were treated with BTZ (1 μmol/L), BAF (2 μmol/L) or CHX (100 μg/mL) for 6‐8 hours before harvested, then subjected to immunoblotting analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="cas14288-sec-0005">
<label>2.3</label>
<title>Quantitative RT‐PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA were extracted from cells using a Total RNA Kit (Tiangen). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix (Toyobo). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was performed to assess the relative abundances of NOTCH2 and GAPDH mRNA using specific primers (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="cas14288-sup-0002">S2</xref>), stained by SYBR Green (Toyobo) on the ABI 7500 Fast Real‐Time PCR System (ABI). The relative abundances of NOTCH2 were normalized to that of GAPDH gene expression, using the <sup>ΔΔ</sup>Ct method.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0016">16</xref> All data were obtained from three independent experiments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="cas14288-sec-0006">
<label>2.4</label>
<title>Yeast two‐hybrid screen</title>
<p>The GAL4‐based yeast two‐hybrid system (Y2H, Invitrogen) was used to screen for and analyze the protein‐protein interaction in yeast.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0016">16</xref> The plasmid pDEST32‐NOTCH2 containing the in‐frame fusion of GAL4 DNA binding domain acted as a bait. The prey vector pDEST22 containing human cDNA collections in‐frame fused to the GAL4 activating domain (Invitrogen). Using the empty pDEST22 plasmid as a negative prey control, Y2H screening was performed by transforming yeast strain (Mav203 strain) containing pDEST32‐NOTCH2 with the prey vectors for the human E3 cDNA expression library. Yeast transformants were first grown on the agar plate on SD‐2 (deficient in Leu, Trp) for selection of yeast cells containing both bait and prey vectors, and then transferred to SD‐4 (deficient in Leu, Trp, His and Ura) plates to screen for proteins that potentially interact with human NOTCH2. Colonies grown on the SD‐4 plates were picked and streaked onto another SD‐4 plate with X‐Gal (5‐bromo‐4‐chloro‐3‐indolyl‐beta‐<sc>d</sc>‐galactopyra‐noside, Sigma) added. “Positive” colonies were sequenced after amplification in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Each interaction was confirmed by transforming yeast Mav203 cells with the indicated bait and prey vectors, and allowing the transformants to grow on the SD‐2 or SD‐4 agar plates (with or without X‐Gal) for approximately 3 days at 30°C. Images of the colonies on both plates were recorded.</p>

<title>Cell proliferation assay</title>
<p>A total of 3000 cells that stably transfected with the plasmids of pLKO.1‐Scramble/pLKO.1‐NOTCH2‐shRNA or pCDH/pCDH‐NOTCH2/pCDH‐DTX3 were seeded into a 96‐well‐plate. Six hours after cell seeding was defined as the 0‐hour time point; 0, 24, 48 or 72 hours later, the cells were incubated with CCK‐8 solution (C0037, Beyotime Biotechnology) for 2 hours at 37℃; then the absorbance of cells was quantified spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450 nm using a Microplate Reader (Bio‐rad). Experiments were finished in six replicates and repeated three times.</p>

<title>Colony formation assay</title>
<p>One thousand cells that stably transfected with the plasmids of pLKO.1‐Scramble/pLKO.1‐NOTCH2‐shRNA or pCDH/pCDH‐NOTCH2/pCDH‐DTX3 were seeded into 6‐well‐plates. Seven days later, plates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (C0121, Beyotime Biotechnology); then the colony number was counted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="cas14288-sec-0009">
<label>2.7</label>
<title>Wound‐healing assay</title>
<p>Cells were plated into 6‐well plates at 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well and 100‐mL tips were used to scratch the monolayer of cells when they grew to 90% confluence in each well. Then, the plates were washed by PBS twice and filled with fresh medium for 12 hours. Images of cells migrating at the wound sites were captured using an inverted microscope (IX51, Olympus).</p>

<title>Co–immunoprecipitation, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting</title>
<p>For co–immunoprecipitation (co–IP), cells were lysed in Co–IP buffer (50 mmol/L Tris–HCl, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 1% NP‐40) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100, Roche), then cell lysates were incubated with anti–NOTCH2 antibody (1:100, ab245324, Abcam) and protein G agarose beads (Merck Millipore) overnight at 4°C. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in IP buffer (50 mmol/L Tris–HCl, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP‐40) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail after BTZ treatment (6 hours), then cell lysates were incubated with anti–NOTCH2 antibody and protein G agarose beads overnight at 4°C for Co‐IP. The immunoprecipitants were enriched and denatured at 100°C for 10 minutes in 2× SDS‐PAGE loading buffer. The inputs, immunoprecipitants and other cell lysates were then subjected to SDS‐PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio‐Rad). The membrane was incubated with the appropriate antibodies against NOTCH2 (1:000), DTX1 (1:1000, 18350‐1‐AP, Proteintech), DTX2 (1:500, 18565‐1‐AP, Proteintech), DTX3 (1:1000, ab116084, Abcam), DTX3L (1:800, 11963‐1‐AP, Proteintech), DTX4 (1:100, 25222‐1‐AP, Proteintech), NICH (1:600, ab8925, Abcam), ubiquitin (1:500, sc‐47721, Santa Cruz), Ki‐67 (1:1000, ab92742, Abcam), p‐AKT (1:500, ab38449, Abcam), Bad (1:800, 10435‐1‐AP, Proteintech), BAX (1:1500, 60267‐1‐Ig, Proteintech), MMP‐9 (1:1000, 10375‐2‐AP, Proteintech), LMNB1 (1:5000, 12987‐1‐AP, Proteintech), β‐Tubulin (1:1000, 10094‐1‐AP, Proteintech) and GAPDH (1:5000, 60004‐1‐Ig, Proteintech).

<p>Human EC tissue arrays were purchased from Shanghai Outdo Biotech. Immunohistochemistry for tissues from mice or patients with EC was performed as previously reported.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0016">16</xref> Briefly, tissues were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin and sectioned before being mounted on slides, which were then subjected to deparaffinization and rehydration. Then, the slides were microwaved for 30 minutes in 0.01 mol/L sodium citrate buffer (PH 6.0). After antigen retrieval and pre–incubation with 10% normal goat serum, anti–DTX3 (1:50, ab116084, Abcam), anti–NOTCH2 (1:80, ab245324, Abcam), anti–Ki‐67 (1:100, ab92742, Abcam) or anti–PCNA (1:100, ab29, Abcam) was used at 4℃ overnight. These slides were stained by means of the VECTSDTSIN Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories) and counterstained with hematoxylin. The density of positive staining was measured using a computerized image system (Leica Microsystems Imaging Solutions). Photographs of three representative fields were captured using Leica Win Plus v3 software under high‐power magnification (100×), and identical settings were used for each photograph. The density was counted using Image‐Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics). A uniform setting for all the slides was applied for the reading of each antibody staining. The integrated optical density of all the positive staining in each photograph was measured, and its ratio to total area of each photograph was calculated as the density.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cas14288-bib-0018">18</xref>

<title>Higher expression of NOTCH2 in human esophageal carcinoma cells</title>
<p>To explore the expression profile of NOTCH2 in human esophageal carcinoma cells, lysates of three human esophageal carcinoma cell lines (KYSE150, TE‐1 and Eca‐109) and one normal HEEC were prepared. Immunoblotting analysis indicated that the protein levels of NOTCH2 were significantly higher in the three human esophageal carcinoma cell lines compared to the normal cell line, and this was consistent with the mRNA levels of NOTCH2 detected by quantitative RT‐PCR (qRT‐PCR) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cas14288-fig-0001">1</xref>A). These results suggest higher NOTCH2expression in human esophageal carcinoma cells.</p>

<title>Ablation of NOTCH2 inhibits the proliferation and migration of human esophageal carcinoma cells</title>
<p>To explore the effect of NOTCH2 on the proliferation of esophageal carcinoma cells, shRNA for NOTCH2 were designed and tested in two esophageal carcinoma cell lines (TE‐1 and Eca‐109). Immunoblotting analysis indicated that NOTCH2 significantly decreased in cells stably transfected with shRNA compared to Scramble groups. Cell viability were detected by CCK‐8 assay at 24, 48 and 72 hours post–culture, and obvious cell growth arrest was observed in NOTCH2 knockdown cell lines compared to control groups, while reintroduction of NOTCH2 led to a reverse of this change (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cas14288-fig-0001">1</xref>B). Next, colony formation assay was performed. Significantly decreased colony numbers were found in NOTCH2 knockdown groups compared to control groups both in TE‐1 and Eca‐109 cell lines, while reintroduction of NOTCH2 could reverse this phenomenon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cas14288-fig-0001">1</xref>C). Then, the wound‐healing assay indicated that NOTCH2 knockdown cells maintained longer widths 12 hours after scratching as compared to the control groups which exhibited much smaller widths, while reintroduction of NOTCH2 led to a reverse of this change, implying a poorer migration ability of cells with NOTCH2 knockdown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cas14288-fig-0001">1</xref>D). These data suggest that ablation of NOTCH2 inhibited the proliferation and migration of human esophageal carcinoma cells.</p>

<title>NOTCH2 is a novel substrate for E3 ligase DTX3</title>
<p>The endogenous NOTCH2 protein was increased upon treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor BTZ, but not the autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (BAF) in Eca‐109 cells, suggesting that endogenous NOTCH2 protein undergoes proteasome‐dependent degradation, rather than autophagy pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cas14288-fig-0002">2</xref>A). Yeast two‐hybrid (Y2H) screening was performed to identify the potential E3 ligase for NOTCH2. DTX3 was identified and validated in yeast cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cas14288-fig-0002">2</xref>B). Co‐IP analysis showed that endogenous NOTCH2 could form a complex with endogenous DTX3 and DTX3L, but could not form a complex with DTX1, DTX2 and DTX4 in Eca‐109 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cas14288-fig-0002">2</xref>C). Immunofluorescence assay indicated that NOTCH2 and DTX3 were co–localized in the cytoplasm of human Eca‐109 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cas14288-fig-0002">2</xref>D). The nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from Eca‐109 cells. Immunoblotting analysis indicated that NOTCH2 was localized in the cytoplasm, while DTX3 could be detected in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, but was mainly localized in the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cas14288-fig-0002">2</xref>E). Further immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that DTX3 overexpression increased the ubiquitination of NOTCH2 in Eca‐109 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cas14288-fig-0002">2</xref>F). Altogether, our results indicated that DTX3 interacted with and ubiquitinated NOTCH2.</p>

<p>With the degradation of NOTCH2 protein in a proteasome‐dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cas14288-fig-0002">2</xref>A), we explored the effect of DTX3 on the stability of NOTCH2 protein. Immunoblotting analysis indicated that NOTCH2 significantly decreased in DTX3 overexpression groups compared to control groups both in TE‐1 and Eca‐109 cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cas14288-fig-0003">3</xref>A). The gene expression of NOTCH2 was detected by qRT‐PCR, and we found no significant mRNA level changes in the two groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cas14288-fig-0003">3</xref>B). Further study indicated that DTX3 degraded the NOTCH2 protein in a dose‐dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cas14288-fig-0003">3</xref>C).

Then our study found that proteasomal inhibitor BTZ could prevent the DTX3‐mediated degradation of NOTCH2 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cas14288-fig-0003">3</xref>E), and degradation of NOTCH2 by DTX3 depends on its E3 ligase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cas14288-fig-0003">3</xref>F).</p>

In our study, DTX3 was identified as a novel E3 ligase for NOTCH2, and promoted its degradation. The protein expression of DTX3 and NOTCH2 is negatively correlated in patients with EC.</p>
<p>In summary, our study suggested that the DTX3‐NOTCH2 axis plays an important role in the progression of EC, and DTX3 acts as an anti–oncogene in esophageal carcinoma, which might offer a potential therapeutic target for EC. An ongoing goal in our studies is to develop drugs that activate DTX3, and we believe that activating the expression of DTX3 might be a good approach for anticancer therapy.</p>
