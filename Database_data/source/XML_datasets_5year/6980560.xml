<title>Objective</title>
<p>To clarify the complex mechanism underlying epileptogeneis, a novel animal model was generated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>In our previous research, we have generated a melanocyte-lineage mTOR hyperactivation mouse model (<italic>Mitf-M</italic>-Cre <italic>Tsc2</italic> KO mice; cKO mice) to investigate mTOR pathway in melanogenesis regulation, markedly reduced skin pigmentation was observed. Very unexpectedly, spontaneous recurrent epilepsy was also developed in this mouse model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Compared with control littermates, no change was found in either brain size or brain mass in cKO mice. Hematoxylin staining revealed no obvious aberrant histologic features in the whole brains of cKO mice. Histoimmunofluorescence staining and electron microscopy examination revealed markedly increased mTOR signaling and hyperproliferation of mitochondria in cKO mice, especially in the hippocampus. Furthermore, rapamycin treatment reversed these abnormalities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study suggests that our melanocyte-lineage mTOR hyperactivation mouse is a novel animal model of epilepsy, which may promote the progress of both epilepsy and neurophysiology research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epilepsy affects over 70 million people worldwide[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref001">1</xref>], leading to adverse social, behavioral, health, and economic consequences. Although written records of epilepsy date back to 4000 BC, its pathophysiology remains incompletely understood[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref001">1</xref>]. As the complex mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis cannot be fully elucidated through human clinical studies, appropriate animal models are necessary.</p>
<p>Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor <italic>(Mitf)-</italic>M is expressed solely in neural crest-derived melanocytes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref002">2</xref>]. <italic>Mitf-</italic>M–expressing cells are primarily found in the skin and hair follicles but also occur in other tissues, including the eyes, heart, meninges, and other brain tissues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Skin-derived melanocytes offer a model system to investigate normal and pathological features of less accessible neurons because of their common origin and many similar signaling molecules and pathways[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref007">7</xref>]. Neurocutaneous syndromes, such as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), exhibit considerable overlap of dermatologic and neurologic manifestations, including epilepsy. In TSC, the prevalence of epilepsy is approximately 78%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>In our previous investigations of the mechanisms of melanogenesis, we constructed melanocyte-lineage <italic>Tsc2</italic> (a pathogenic gene in TSC) knockout mice in which <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase was placed under the control of regulatory elements from the <italic>Mitf</italic>-M gene[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref009">9</xref>]. These mice presented with the anticipated skin hypopigmentation and unexpectedly developed spontaneous neural epileptic activity as well. In the current study, we confirmed hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, abnormal neuronal excitability, and hyperproliferation of neuronal mitochondria in the brain of these animals. We herein suggest that this may be a useful mouse model for epilepsy research, providing novel insights into the mechanisms of seizure disorders.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p><italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> mice and <italic>Mitf-M</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic> mice were generated as described previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref009">9</xref>]. Melanocyte-specific <italic>Tsc2</italic> knockout mice were generated by breeding <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> mice with <italic>Mitf-M-Cre</italic> mice. Both lines maintained a C57BL/6 inbred background. The controls were littermates, either without cre or in a few cases, <italic>Mitf-M</italic>-cre;<italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>flox/-</sup>. For rapamycin treatment, sirolimus was purchased from Selleck (Osaka, Japan) and dissolved in distilled water for oral administration at 2.285 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks (n = 5 mice/goup). All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the experimental protocol used in this study was approved by the Committee for Animal Experiments at Osaka University (Osaka, Japan).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>EEG/EMG recording</title>
<p><italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>Mitf-M</italic></sup> cKO mice (male, 6 weeks old at the time of surgery) were instrumented with chronically implanted EEG/EMG electrodes according to previously published procedures[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref010">10</xref>].Briefly, a preamplifier (#8202) was surgically implanted in mice under isoflurane anesthesia. Mice (n = 3 mice/goup) were allown to recover from surgery for at least 12 h before recording was initiated. EEG/EMG data were recorded for a 24 h period using data acquisition system (#8200-K1-SE) and Sirenia Software (both from Neuroscience, inc).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>Histology and immunohistochemistry analyses</title>
<p>Brain tissue samples (n = 5 mice/goup) were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Subsequently, 4-μm sections were either stained with hematoxylin for morphological examination or used for immunohistochemistry analysis. The following antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry: p-S6 (#4858, Cell Signaling Technology, Tokyo, Japan) at 1:100, c-FOS (ab208942, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 1:200, Parvalbumin (SAB4200545, Sigma) at 1:100, CaMKII-α (#11945, Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:100, COXIV (#459600, Invitrogen) at 1:200, GFAP (#12389, Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:100, and MAP2 (ab5392, Abcam) at 1:2000. The stained proteins were visualized using a Biozero confocal microscope (Keyence Co., Osaka, Japan).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>Timm staining</title>
<p>For Timm staining, we intracardially perfused the mice (n = 5 mice/goup) with ice-cold 1% (w/v) sodium sulfide, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. After removal from the body, the brain was post-fixed in 10% formaldehyde overnight and embedded in paraffin. We then created 10-μm thick sagittal sections and performed modified Timm staining, as previously described[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec011">
<title>Electron microscopy examination</title>
<p>After dissection of the mouse brain (n = 5 mice/goup), hippocampal slices were prepared using a slicer (Narishige, ST-10, Tokyo, Japan), as previously described[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref012">12</xref>]. The slices were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer containing calcium chloride (pH 7.4) for 2 h and then washed three times with deionized distilled water. The samples were post-fixed in 1% OsO4 in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, and then dehydrated with a graded ethanol series and embedded in EPON. Ultra-thin sections (70–80 nm) were cut horizontally to the bottom of the dish, transferred to grids, dual-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed using a Hitachi H-7650 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec012">
<title>Primary culture of hippocampal pyramidal cells from adult mice</title>
<p>Primary neuronal cells were obtained from the hippocampus of 4-week-old wild-type and mutant mice (n = 5 mice/goup) as reported previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref013">13</xref>]. Briefly, the hippocampus was dissected and sliced into 0.5-mm sections in 2 mL HABG medium (40ml HA(Hibernate<sup>TM</sup>-A Medium, Invitrogen, #A1247501; 0.8ml B27, Invitrogen, #17504; 0.1ml L-Glutamine, Invitrogen, #25030081)) at 4°C in a 35-mm-diameter dish using tissue slicer (Dosaka microslicer, Kyoto, Japan), removing the dentate gyrus to eliminate granule cells. The sections were digested with papain (2 mg/mL, Worthington, #LS003119 in HA-Ca, BrainBits LLC) at 30°C for 30 min. Cells were released by gentle trituration with a Pasteur pipette. Finally, primary neurons were separated using density-gradient centrifugation (OptiPrep, AXS, #1114542, XX). Cells were cultured in NeurobasalA/B27 medium (Invitrogen, #10888022 and #17504044) with L-Gin (Invitrogen, #25030149), growth factors (5 ng/mL mouse FGF2, Invitrogen, #PMG0034; 5 ng/mL mouse PDGF-BB, Invitrogen, #PMG0044), and gentamycin (Wako, #078–06061) for 1 week before the experiments.</p>
<p>To evaluate neuronal activity and mitochondrial quantity, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then processed for the detection of neuronal antigens. The primary antibody was MAP2 (ab5392, Abcam) at 1:2000.</p>

After two washes with ACSF, cells were incubated for an additional 20 min in ACSF before imaging. The coverslips were transferred to a chamber and observed by microscopy (Nikon ECLIPCE E800). The excitation wavelengths for fura-2 were 340 and 380 nm, with emission at 505 nm. For the stimulation experiments, a range of K<sup>+</sup> solutions were used: 10 mM, 30 mM, and 60 mM KCl. Fluorescence intensity was quantified using Metafluor software (Universal Imaging Corporation, West Chester, PA).</p>

<title>Epilepsy behavior</title>
<p>cKO mice and littermates (n = 5 mice/goup) were tested for seizure behavior during the night, because mice are nocturnal animals and more active at night. Spontaneous seizure and seizures induced by the ringing of a clock every 1 hour were video-recorded for 5 days. The behaviors of the mice were scored by two independent observers, who were blinded to their genotype. In the rapamycin treatment experiments, behavior analysis was performed after 3 weeks of oral sirolimus (Selleck) in distilled water.</p>

<p>To further characterize these episodes, electrocorticographic activity was recorded for 6–12 hours using a digital video-EEG/EMG system (Neuroscience, inc) in cKO mice and control wild-type littermates at 6 weeks of age. Control mice showed well-organized background activity (under 100-μV spikes) during awake and at rest. By contrast, frequent (2~3 times/hour) high-amplitude sharp waves (above 300-μV spikes, over 10 seconds) were observed during awake in the cKO mice, it was accompanied with seizure-like convulsive movements determined by video recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228204.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

Furthermore, hematoxylin staining revealed no aberrant histological features in the whole brains of cKO mice, however, the hippocampus increased in size compared with the control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228204.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Hyperactivation of mTOR induced neural excitation in <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>Mitf-M</italic></sup> cKO mice</title>
<p>As a negative regulator of mTOR signaling, loss of TSC2 would be predicted to constitutive activation of mTOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref021">21</xref>] and subsequently phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (pS6). Usually, p-S6 is regarded as a specific indicator of TSC2 loss and mTOR activation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref022">22</xref>]. Marked hyperactivation of mTOR signaling was observed in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamus of cKO mice, compared with control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228204.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, panel a and b). Control mice exhibited little or no expression of pS6, especially in the hippocampus, whereas cKO mice exhibited a dramatic increase in pS6 in almost all of the hippocampus, from the dentate gyrus to the CA1 zone. To verify neuronal activity in cKO mice, immunohistochemistry staining was performed with anti-cFOS, a marker of neuronal excitability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref023">23</xref>]. Similar to the mTOR activity (pS6) results, higher expression levels of cFOS were observed in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamus of cKO mice, compared with control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228204.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, panels c and d); the increase was most pronounced in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.

<p>To quantify expression levels of pS6 and cFOS in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamus, we counted the cFOS- and pS6-positive cells in these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228204.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Almost 20% of hippocampal neurons exhibited increased mTOR activity (pS6 expression) in CKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228204.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Furthermore, excitability (cFOS expression) of hippocampal neuronal cells, increased dramatically from 9.7% in control mice to 69% in cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228204.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The cerebral cortex exhibited lower mTOR activity than the hippocampus in cKO mice, and only slightly increased neuronal excitability compared with control mice. The thalamus in cKO mice exhibited a slight increase in mTOR activity but almost no change in neuronal excitability compared with control littermates. These data suggest that the neuronal abnormality of the hippocampus may be associated with the onset of the epilepsy phenotype in this mouse model.</p>

<p>A recent report indicated that the mTOR pathway regulates excitability of the hippocampal network through controlling the excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref024">24</xref>]. Therefore, we used immunofluorescence staining to examine excitatory neurons (using anti-CaMKII-a antibody) and inhibitory neurons (using anti-Parvalbumin antibody) in the mouse hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228204.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

This phenomenon, called mossy fiber sprouting, also appeared in a granule cell–lineage mTOR hyperactivation mouse model, suggesting that epilepsy might be associated with mTOR hyperactivation-induced neuronal restructuring[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref029">29</xref>].

<p>In neuronal cell-lineage transgenic mice, mTOR hyperactivity has been previously shown to induce many structural abnormalities associated with recurrent circuit formation, including hypertrophy of soma and dendrites, aberrant basal dendrites, impaired polarization, and enlarged axon tracts[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref030">30</xref>].

Enlarged cell bodies and mitochondria were observed in the neurons of cKO mice. Somatic hypertrophy was confirmed in pyramidal cells of cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228204.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, upper panel). Furthermore, dramatic enlargement and hyperproliferation of mitochondria were observed in the pyramidal neurons of cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228204.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we found that mTOR hyperactivation resulting from loss of <italic>Tsc2</italic> in <italic>Mitf-M</italic>-derived cell lineage was associated with the development of typical epilepsy, mitochondria hyperproliferation, and aberrant intracellular calcium dynamics. Our results showed a primary defect of mitochondrial biogenesis in pyramidal neurons, leading to dramatically enhanced sensitivity and aberrant synchronization, which may be involved in increased hippocampal network excitability.</p>
<p>mTOR signaling activates the transcription of genes for mitochondrial biogenesis, including the well-known master regulator, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α (PGC-1α)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref035">35</xref>]. Also, mTOR modulates mitochondrial activity by enhancing interaction between transcription factor yin-yang 1 and PGC-1α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref036">36</xref>] or by directly modifying the expression of mitochondrial proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref039">39</xref>]. Recently, mTOR has been found to control mitochondrial activity and biogenesis through 4E-BP-dependent translational regulation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>In our previous study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref009">9</xref>], we detected swollen mitochondria in melanocytes in the presence of <italic>Tsc2</italic> deletion. In the present study, we observed not only swelling but also hyperproliferation of mitochondria in neurons.</p>
<p>It has been previously reported that activation of mTOR suppresses local translation of the potassium channel Kv1.1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref041">41</xref>], resulting in increased burst firing in neurons[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref043">43</xref>]. Furthermore, a direct correlation has been demonstrated between seizures and Kv1.1 gene expression[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref046">46</xref>]. mTOR also regulates components of neuronal RNA granules called specific RNA-binding proteins, such as fragile X mental retardation protein[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref047">47</xref>], which are involved in dendritic mRNA localization. Another line of research has demonstrated the regulatory effects of mTOR in the synthesis of new proteins in dendrites, such as PSD95 and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref049">49</xref>]. In the present study, we found that cKO neurons are more sensitive to potassium stimulation than controls, which may be attributed to an aberrant potassium channel or abnormal cellular ion levels.</p>
<p>Mitochondria contribute to various cellular processes, including ATP production, intracellular calcium signaling, cell growth and differentiation, and generation of reactive oxygen species. Neurons are critically dependent on mitochondrial function to establish membrane excitability through neurotransmission and plasticity. Electrical activity of neurons is associated with calcium influx into the cells via calcium channels, such as voltage-operated channels, store-operated channels, receptor-operated channels, and non-selective cation channels. Intracellular accumulation of calcium stimulates Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange, which maintain ionic gradients to sustain neuronal excitability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref050">50</xref>]. The dramatic increase in number of mitochondria observed in the present study may alter intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, inducing hyperexcitability of neurons.</p>
<p>It is currently thought that a number of key molecular signaling cascades are involved in the hyperexcitability of brain tissue because controlled blocking of “master regulators” of these pathways may retard or even stop the epileptogenic process[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref051">51</xref>]. Candidate regulators that have emerged in recent years include mTOR, as well as FosB[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref052">52</xref>], p-ERK1/2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref053">53</xref>], tropomyosin-related kinase B, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cascades, and neuron-restrictive silencer factor/repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor pathways[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref051">51</xref>]. Aberrant mTOR pathway signaling has been extensively characterized in genetically-determined epilepsy in patients with mutations in the <italic>Tsc1/2</italic> genes in the context of TSC. This condition manifests primarily as highly-differentiated tumors or malformations in many different organs and epilepsy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref020">20</xref>]. Because <italic>Tsc</italic> genes are negative regulators of mTOR, hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway because of <italic>Tsc</italic> gene mutations provides a rational mechanistic basis for abnormal cell growth and proliferation, causing tumors and other developmental lesions in TSC. Numerous transgenic mouse models of TSC have been developed by spontaneous or induced inactivation of the <italic>Tsc1</italic> or <italic>Tsc2</italic> genes in the neuronal cell lineage, which exhibit varying degrees of pathological brain abnormalities and evidence of neuronal hyperexcitability or seizures[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Physiological and anatomical studies have produced conflicting findings regarding mTOR hyperactivation-induced neurological abnormalities. For example, some research reported reduced dendritic spine density after <italic>Tsc</italic> deletion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref054">54</xref>], whereas another study indicated that the density increased[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref020">20</xref>]. As <italic>Tsc</italic> deletion produces a neurodevelopmental disorder, these discrepancies may depend on the role of mTOR in different types of cells and at different stages of development.</p>
<p>Until now, rodent models of spontaneous recurrent epilepsy have been generated by chemoconvulsants (primarily pilocarpine and kainic acid), neonatal hypoxia, traumatic brain injuries, electrical stimulation or genetic manipulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref055">55</xref>]. However, none of these models provide cell-type specificity in the brain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0228204.ref055">55</xref>]. By contrast, our mouse model involves <italic>Tsc</italic> knockout in specific <italic>Mitf-M</italic>-lineage cells.</p>
<p>In previous research regarding mTOR-associated epilepsy, structural abnormalities of neurons have been considered the primary etiologic factor. In the present study, we generated a novel epilepsy mouse model based on mTOR hyperactivation. The model is characterized by abnormal mitochondria, which may be responsible for the development of epilepsy by directly upregulating neuronal excitability. This model may be used to facilitate the development of new therapeutic interventions for seizure disorders.</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: 1) In material and methods, you should precise the total number of animals used in your experiment.</p>
<p>2) “The fluorescence intensity was quantified by ImageJ and showed same changes (Fig. 6C).” Could please explain the method of quantification by ImageJ?</p>
<p>3) In Fig. 3A, 3C, 4A and 4C, the scale bars are different in cKO vs WT. Why?</p>
<p>4) It would be preferable to have some sentences about electrographic seizures resumed in a single paragraph. Particularly:</p>
<p>• you should deeply precise how their activity different from baseline activity (duration, rhythms, frequency range and amplitude)</p>
<p>• you should also precise how you define the onset of the seizure: shape of the first part of the seizure, occurrence …</p>
<p>• finally, you should explain how you characterize the end of the seizure: return to baseline activity, post-ictal depression...</p>
<p>5) In results, you reported that “A recent report indicated that the mTOR pathway regulates excitability of the hippocampal network through controlling the excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance (19). Therefore, we used immunofluorescence staining to examine excitatory neurons (using anti-CaMKII-a antibody) and inhibitory neurons (using anti-Parvalbumin antibody) in the mouse hippocampus (Fig. 3A). Positive cells were counted, and the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons was calculated (Fig. 3B). No significant difference was observed in the excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance between cKO mice and control littermates (Fig. 3B).” In this regard, I think you should deeply discuss the crucial importance of different interneuron subpopulations in seizure initiation and propagation (refer to “de Curtis, M., and Avoli, M. (2016). GABAergic networks jump-start focal seizures. Epilepsia”), but also in seizure modulation (refer to "Khoshkhoo, S., Vogt, D., and Sohal, V. S. (2017). Dynamic, Cell-Type-Specific Roles for GABAergic Interneurons in a Mouse Model of Optogenetically Inducible Seizures. Neuron"). Moreover, only specific interneuron subpopulations but not others seem to be involved in the anticonvulsant effects in other models of seizures (refer to “Lucchi et al. (2017). Involvement of PPARγ in the anticonvulsant activity of EP-80317, a ghrelin receptor antagonist. Frontiers in Pharmacology”.)</p>
<p>6) In the discussion, the comparison between mTOR and other markers of neuronal activation used in literature should be done. For instance, you could refer to “Yutsudo et al. (2013). fosB-null mice display impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis and spontaneous epilepsy with depressive behavior. Neuropsychopharmacology” and to “Giordano et al. (2016). Progressive seizure aggravation in the repeated 6-hz corneal stimulation model is accompanied by marked increase in hippocampal p-ERK1/2 immunoreactivity. Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience”.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: In the current Ms, the authors investigate further their melanocyte-lineage mTOR hyperactivation mouse model and try to describe it as a new model of epilepsy.</p>
<p>This Ms provides very important data to the field of epilepsy research. However, after reading the title of this Ms, I was quite disappointed when I realised that the authors did not try any classical antiepileptic drug on their supposedly new model of epilepsy. Has this been considered?</p>
<p>I have some other concerns listed below.</p>
<p>A) The “Materials and Methods” section lacks sufficient information.</p>
<p>To give few examples:</p>
<p>1) This is not easy to find the number of animals used for each protocol.</p>
<p>2) I could not find a clear description of how the animals were sacrified or anesthetized. This comment applies for almost all sections.</p>
<p>P5 Ln84 “Histology and immunohistochemistry analyses”: How animals are sacrificed before the brains being fixed?</p>
<p>P6Ln95: “Timm staining”: How were the rats anesthetized?</p>
<p>P6LnLn100: “Electron microscopy examination”: How were the rats sacrificed?</p>
<p>3) P7LnLn110: “Primary culture of hippocampal pyramidal cells from adult mice”: How were the slices cut?</p>
<p>4) P7Ln122: Measurement of [Ca2+]i: Please could you check the composition of your ACSF? What was the osmolarity of this solution?</p>
<p>B) In the discussion at LnP310: “Until now, rodent models of spontaneous recurrent epilepsy have been generated by chemoconvulsants (primarily pilocarpine and kainic acid), neonatal hypoxia, traumatic brain injuries or electrical stimulation(44).” Please note that genetic models of epilepsy are also available to study some types of epilepsy.</p>

<p>COMMENTS FROM REVIEWER #1: </p>
<p>COMMENT: 1. In material and methods, you should precise the total number of animals used in your experiments. </p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your careful reading and valuable comment. As requested, we have added the description about the number of mice we used in each experiment in Materials and methods section in red with underline.</p>
<p>COMMENT: 2. “The fluorescence intensity was quantified by ImageJ and showed same changes (Fig. 6C).” Could please explain the method of quantification by ImageJ?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for this important comment. As suggested, we have added the description of quantification method as indicated below. </p>
<p>(manuscript, Results section, page 14, line 261-262, in red with underline).</p>
<p>The fluorescence intensity was quantified by ImageJ within the range of threshold limit (Jensen EC. Quantitative analysis of histological staining and fluorescence using ImageJ. Anat Rec (Hoboken). 2013 Mar;296(3):378-81).</p>
<p>COMMENT: 3. In Fig. 3A, 3C, 4A and 4C, the scale bars are different in cKO vs WT. Why?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you very much for the careful reading of our manuscript. Because the hippocampus is bigger than WT (as shown in Fig 1C), in Figure 3A, 3C and 4C, to put the whole hippocampus of cKO into the same frame size to WT, images of WT and cKO were shown in different magnification with their different scales respectively. And the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells of cKO is also a little bit bigger than WT, in Figure 4A, to put the whole hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell of cKO into the same frame size to WT, images of WT and cKO were shown in different magnification with their different scales respectively.</p>
<p>COMMENT: 4. It would be preferable to have some sentences about electrographic seizures resumed in a single paragraph. Particularly:</p>
<p>• you should deeply precise how their activity different from baseline activity (duration, rhythms, frequency range and amplitude)</p>
<p>• you should also precise how you define the onset of the seizure: shape of the first part of the seizure, occurrence …</p>
<p>• finally, you should explain how you characterize the end of the seizure: return to baseline activity, post-ictal depression...</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your kind advice. According to your suggestion, we have modified the description as indicated below (manuscript, results section, page 9, line 160-166, in red with underline).</p>
<p>To further characterize these episodes, electrocorticographic activity was recorded for 6-12 hours using a digital video-EEG/EMG system (Neuroscience, inc) in cKO mice and control wild-type littermates at 6 weeks of age. Control mice showed well-organized background activity (under 100-µV spikes) during awake and at rest. By contrast, frequent (2~3 times/hour) high-amplitude sharp waves (above 300-µV spikes, over 10 seconds) were observed during awake in the cKO mice, it was accompanied with seizure-like convulsive movements determined by video recording (Fig 1B).</p>
<p>COMMENT: 5. In results, you reported that “A recent report indicated that the mTOR pathway regulates excitability of the hippocampal network through controlling the excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance (19). Therefore, we used immunofluorescence staining to examine excitatory neurons (using anti-CaMKII-a antibody) and inhibitory neurons (using anti-Parvalbumin antibody) in the mouse hippocampus (Fig. 3A). Positive cells were counted, and the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons was calculated (Fig. 3B).

Involvement of PPARγ in the anticonvulsant activity of EP-80317, a ghrelin receptor antagonist. Frontiers in Pharmacology”.) RESPONSE: Thank you for this helpful advice. According to your suggestion, we have added these three references (25-27) to our manuscript and modified the description as indicated below (manuscript, results section, page 11, line 203-211, in red with underline). “A recent report indicated that the mTOR pathway regulates excitability of the hippocampal network through controlling the excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance(24). Therefore, we used immunofluorescence staining to examine excitatory neurons (using anti-CaMKII-a antibody) and inhibitory neurons (using anti-Parvalbumin antibody) in the mouse hippocampus (Fig 3A). Positive cells were counted, and the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons was calculated (Fig 3B). No significant difference was observed in the excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance between cKO mice and control littermates (Fig 3B). It suggests there might have some other players involved in seizure initiation and propagation, e.g. different interneuron subpopulations (25-27).”</p>
<p>COMMENT: 6. In the discussion, the comparison between mTOR and other markers of neuronal activation used in literature should be done. For instance, you could refer to “Yutsudo et al. (2013). fosB-null mice display impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis and spontaneous epilepsy with depressive behavior. Neuropsychopharmacology” and to “Giordano et al. (2016). Progressive seizure aggravation in the repeated 6-hz corneal stimulation model is accompanied by marked increase in hippocampal p-ERK1/2 immunoreactivity. Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience”.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for this valuable comment. we have added these three references (52, 53) to our manuscript and modified the description as indicated below (manuscript, discussion section, page 16, line 304-307, in red with underline).</p>
<p>“Candidate regulators that have emerged in recent years include mTOR, as well as FosB(52), p-ERK1/2(53), tropomyosin-related kinase B, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, Zn2+-dependent cascades, and neuron-restrictive silencer factor/repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor pathways(51).” </p>

<p>COMMENT: In the current Ms, the authors investigate further their melanocyte-lineage mTOR hyperactivation mouse model and try to describe it as a new model of epilepsy. This Ms provides very important data to the field of epilepsy research.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your careful reading and thank for your interest and compliments on our study. </p>
<p>COMMENT: However, after reading the title of this Ms, I was quite disappointed when I realised that the authors did not try any classical antiepileptic drug on their supposedly new model of epilepsy. Has this been considered?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your kind comment. We have tried to treat our mice using the classical mTOR inhibitor-Rapamycin, after 3 weeks of oral rapamycin treatment, epilepsy phenotype was dramatically improved both in frequency and duration of seizures (Fig 6A), however, we have not treated with some other classical clinical antiepileptic drugs. We would like to investigate that in our future study and report that in our next paper.</p>
<p>COMMENT: I have some other concerns listed below.</p>
<p>A) The “Materials and Methods” section lacks sufficient information.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your careful reading and valuable comment. As requested, we have modified our manuscript according to your suggestions.</p>
<p>COMMENT: 1. This is not easy to find the number of animals used for each protocol.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your careful reading and valuable comment. As requested, we have added the description about the number of mice we used in each experiment in Materials and methods section in red with underline.</p>
<p>COMMENT: 2. I could not find a clear description of how the animals were sacrified or anesthetized. This comment applies for almost all sections. P5 Ln84 “Histology and immunohistochemistry analyses”: How animals are sacrificed before the brains being fixed? P6Ln95: “Timm staining”: How were the rats anesthetized? P6LnLn100: “Electron microscopy examination”: How were the rats sacrificed?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your important comments. As requested, we have added the description of animal sacrifice as indicated below. </p>
<p>(manuscript, Methods section, page 8, line 140-144, in red with underline).</p>
<p> “Mice were anaesthetized with a lethal dose of pentobarbital and sacrificed by intracardially perfusion using ice-cold 1% (w/v) sodium sulfide, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were removed, post-fixed for 10% formaldehyde overnight and embedded in paraffin or cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/PBS.”</p>
<p>COMMENT: 3. P7LnLn110: “Primary culture of hippocampal pyramidal cells from adult mice”: How were the slices cut?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your important comments. As requested, we have added the description about the slice cut as indicated below. </p>
<p>(manuscript, Methods section, page 7, line 106-116, in red with underline).</p>
<p>“Primary neuronal cells were obtained from the hippocampus of 4-week-old wild-type and mutant mice (n = 5 mice/goup) as reported previously(13). Briefly, the hippocampus was dissected and sliced into 0.5-mm sections using tissue slicer (Dosaka microslicer, Kyoto, Japan), removing the dentate gyrus to eliminate granule cells. The sections were digested with papain (2 mg/mL, Worthington, #LS003119 in HA-Ca, BrainBits LLC) at 30°C for 30 min. Cells were released by gentle trituration with a Pasteur pipette. Finally, primary neurons were separated using density-gradient centrifugation (OptiPrep, AXS, #1114542, XX). Cells were cultured in NeurobasalA/B27 medium (Invitrogen, #10888022 and #17504044) with L-Gin (Invitrogen, #25030149), growth factors (5 ng/mL mouse FGF2, Invitrogen, #PMG0034; 5 ng/mL mouse PDGF-BB, Invitrogen, #PMG0044), and gentamycin (Wako, #078-06061) for 1 week before the experiments.”</p>
<p>COMMENT: 4. P7Ln122: Measurement of [Ca2+]i: Please could you check the composition of your ACSF? What was the osmolarity of this solution?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your careful reading and the important comment. Regret for this mistake, as suggested, we have added the reference (14) in our manuscript and revised our mistake in the concentration of NaCl (revised 45mM to 127 mM NaCl). </p>
<p>(manuscript, Methods section, page 7, line 121-126, in red with underline).</p>
<p>[Ca2+]i in single cells was detected on the basis of fura-2 fluorescence intensity, as reported previuosly(14). Briefly, neurons grown on coverslips were rinsed twice with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; 127 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.24 mM KH2PO4, 10 mM glucose, 1.4 mM MgSO4, 2.4 mM CaCl2; SIGMA) and incubated at 37°C for 45 min in the presence of fura-2 AM (fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester, DOJINDO, #CS23) with 1.25 mmol/L probenecid (SIGMA) and 0.03% Pluronic® F-127 (SIGMA) in ACSF.</p>
<p>COMMENT: B) In the discussion at LnP310: “Until now, rodent models of spontaneous recurrent epilepsy have been generated by chemoconvulsants (primarily pilocarpine and kainic acid), neonatal hypoxia, traumatic brain injuries or electrical stimulation(44).” Please note that genetic models of epilepsy are also available to study some types of epilepsy.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for the important comment. According to your suggestion, we have modified the description as indicated below.</p>
<p>(marked manuscript, Discussion section, page 18, line 324-326, in red with underline). “Until now, rodent models of spontaneous recurrent epilepsy have been generated by chemoconvulsants (primarily pilocarpine and kainic acid), neonatal hypoxia, traumatic brain injuries, electrical stimulation or genetic manipulations (55).”</p>

<p>COMMENTS FROM REVIEWER #2: </p>
<p>“The Ms has improved following the authors's reply to the reviewers's comments. However, in my opinion, supplemental information particularly in the method section, are needed to make this Ms a little bit clearer.”</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your careful reading and important suggestions. We have revised our manuscript according to your comments and suggestions. </p>
<p>COMMENT: 1. “Primary culture of hippocampal pyramidal cells from adult mice: Please could you precise in which media the slices were cut?”</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your important comments. As requested, we have added the description about the medium as indicated below. </p>
<p>(Manuscript with Track Changes, Methods section, page 7, line 106-111, in red with underline).</p>
<p>“Primary neuronal cells were obtained from the hippocampus of 4-week-old wild-type and mutant mice (n = 5 mice/goup) as reported previously(13). Briefly, the hippocampus was dissected and sliced into 0.5-mm sections in 2 mL HABG medium (40ml HA(HibernateTM-A Medium, Invitrogen, #A1247501; 0.8ml B27, Invitrogen, #17504; 0.1ml L-Glutamine, Invitrogen, #25030081)) at 4°C in a 35-mm-diameter dish using tissue slicer (Dosaka microslicer, Kyoto, Japan), removing the dentate gyrus to eliminate granule cells.”</p>
<p>COMMENT: 2. “Measurement of [Ca2+]i: Please could you precise if the ACSF was "bubbled" with carbogen?”</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your important comments. In our experiments, ACSF has been bubbled with carbogen. As requested, we have added the description as indicated below. </p>
<p>(Manuscript with Track Changes, Methods section, page 8, line 124-129, in red with underline).</p>
<p>“Briefly, neurons grown on coverslips were rinsed twice with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; 127 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.24 mM KH2PO4, 10 mM glucose, 1.4 mM MgSO4, 2.4 mM CaCl2; SIGMA) and incubated at 37°C for 45 min in the presence of fura-2 AM (fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester, DOJINDO, #CS23) with 1.25 mmol/L probenecid (SIGMA) and 0.03% Pluronic® F-127 (SIGMA) in carbogen-bubbled ACSF.”</p>

<p>Dear Dr Wataya-Kaneda,</p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Specifically, I invite you to complete and correct description of statistical analysis because:</p>
<p>- results of statistical analysis are not detailed in results, and should be better illustrated in legends to figures;</p>
<p>- in methods, I read that you used "two-way analysis of variance", but the post hoc test is not indicated.</p>

<p>COMMENTS FROM EDITOR: </p>
<p>“Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Specifically, I invite you to complete and correct description of statistical analysis.” </p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your important suggestions. We have carefully checked our manuscript again and corrected descriptions of statistical analysis in our revised manuscript. </p>
<p>COMMENT: 1. “results of statistical analysis are not detailed in results, and should be better illustrated in legends to figures”</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your kind advice. As requested, we have added the detail in legends to figures as indicated below. </p>
<p>(Manuscript with Track Changes, Figure Legend section, page 24-26, line 488-549, in red with underline).</p>
<p>“Figure 1. Deletion of Tsc2 resulted in epilepsy in Tsc2Mitf-M cKO mice without obvious histoarchitectural changes.</p>
<p>A. Images captured from video recordings, showing typical spontaneous epilepsy in a 6-week-old cKO mouse. B. EEG and EMG segments (300 s) showing normal electrography in a control (WT) mouse and typical electrographic epilepsy in a cKO mouse. C. Relative brain and body weight in cKO mice compared with control (WT) mice at 9 and 11 weeks of age. *p &lt; 0.05 and **p &lt; 0.01 versus WT mice, n = 5 in each group, unpaired t-test. D. Hematoxylin staining of murine brain tissue sections, Scale bars: 600 µm. Sizes of hippocampus, Cerebral cortex and Whole brain are shown in the right panel, **p &lt; 0.01 versus WT mice, n = 5 in each group, unpaired t-test. Data in C and D are expressed as mean ± SD. </p>

<p>A. Histoimmunostaining of whole brain sagittal sections from control (WT) mice (left panels) and cKO mice (right panels) at 5 weeks of age. p-S6 (upper panels) and c-FOS (bottom panels). The black rectangle outlines the area of hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamus, and the detail is shown in the corresponding bottom panels. The circle shows representative p-S6 cytoplasmic and c-FOS nuclear positive staining. Scale bars: large bars, 600 µm; smaller bars, 200 µm. B. p-S6 and c-FOS positive rates (p-S6 or c-Fos-positive neuron cells versus all neuron cells) in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamus. Data in C and D are expressed as mean ± SD. *P&lt;0.05 versus WT mice, n = 5 in each group, unpaired t-test.</p>
<p>Figure 3. Histopathological analyses of the hippocampal region in Tsc2Mitf CKO mice. </p>
<p>A. Immunofluorescence staining showing excitatory (CaMKII-α) and inhibitory (Parvalbumin) neurons in the hippocampus. The insets show higher magnification of positive cells (arrowheads). B. Numbers of CaMKII-α-positive cells and Parvalbumin-positive cells were double-blind counted in 10 random fields per tissue section. Ratio of inhibitory to excitatory neurons were calculated (n = 5 mice). Data in B are expressed as mean ± SD. n.s. means no significance versus WT mice, unpaired t-test. C. Timm staining. The amount of mossy fiber sprouting is similar in cKO and control (WT) mice. Scale bars: A, 200 µm; C, 200 µm. n.s., not significant.</p>
<p>Figure 4. Hyperproliferation of mitochondria in the neurons of Tsc2Mitf CKO mice. </p>
<p>A. Morphologic examination of p-S6 high-expressed hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells by electron microscopy. Enlarged cell bodies and mitochondria were observed in the neurons of cKO mice. Bottom panels represent high-magnification images of the regions designated by squares. B. Quantification of mitochondria. The number of mitochondria increased more than 5-fold and the mitochondrial size increased more than 2-fold in neurons from cKO mice, compared with control (WT) mice. (n = 20 cells/mouse, 3 mice in each group). Data in B are expressed as mean ± SD, unpaired t-test versus WT mice. C. Immunofluorescence staining showed hyperactivation of mTOR (p-S6) with hyperproliferation of mitochondria (COXIV) in the hippocampus of cKO mice. Scale bars: A upper panel, 2 µm; A bottom panel, 500 nm; C, 200 µm. </p>
<p>Figure 5. Neurons from Tsc2Mitf -M cKO mice were more excitable than neurons from control mice.</p>
<p>A. Neurons were isolated from 4-week-old mice and cultured for 1 week. Immunofluorescence staining indicates that more than 80% of the isolated cells were neurons (GFAP, astrocytes; MAP2, neurons). B. Calcium imaging of cultured neurons, with corresponding traces shown at the bottom. Neurons from cKO mice respond to particularly low (10 mM) K+ stimulation. Scale bars: A, 100 µm; B, 100 µm. WT, wild-type.</p>

Unpaired t-test versus vehicle-treated mice. B. Histoimmunostaining analyses of mTOR signaling (p-S6), mitochondria (COXIV), and neuronal excitation (c-FOS). Scale bars: 100 µm. WT, wild-type. C. The fluorescence intensity was quantified by ImageJ. n = 5 in each group. Data in C are expressed as mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA test, followed by Dunnett's post hoc test for multiple comparisons (WT mice versus cKO mice; cKO mice versus Rapamycin-treated cKO mice (cKO_Rapa); WT mice versus cKO_Rapa mice) was performed and adjusted P values were calculated. *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01.</p>

<p>COMMENT: 2. “in methods, I read that you used "two-way analysis of variance", but the post hoc test is not indicated.”</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Thank you for your careful reading and the important comment. Regret for this mistake, in our experiment, in Figure 6C, the differences of WT mice versus cKO mice, cKO mice versus Rapamycin-treated cKO mice, and WT mice versus cKO_Rapa mice were calculated using One-way ANOVA test, followed by Dunnett's post hoc test. As suggested, the description have been corrected in our revised manuscript as indicated below. </p>
