<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">ADNP was first described as a neural protective protein and has been implicated in various neural developmental disorders and cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. This protein contains nine zinc fingers and a homeobox domain, suggesting that it functions as a transcription factor. The exact roles of ADNP remain unclear, but an increasing number of studies have shown that it may function as a key chromatin regulator by interacting with chromatin remodelers or regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Mouse <italic>Adnp</italic> mRNA is abundantly expressed during early gestation and reaches its maximum expression on E9.5. <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> mice are early embryonic lethal, displaying severe defects in neural tube closure and brain formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Of note, E8.5 <italic>Adnp</italic> mutant embryos exhibit ectopic expression of pluripotency gene <italic>Pou5f1</italic> and reduced expression of neural developmental gene <italic>Pax6</italic> in the anterior neural plate. These observations strongly suggest that ADNP plays essential roles during neurogenesis of mouse embryos.</p>
<p id="Par5">De novo mutations in <italic>ADNP</italic> gene have recently been linked to neural developmental disorders, including the Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Patients may display multiple symptoms, which share many features with another neural developmental disorder: autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In fact, <italic>ADNP</italic> is one of the most frequent ASD-associated genes as it is mutated in at least 0.17% of ASD cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Due to the significant relevance of <italic>ADNP</italic> to neural developmental disorders, it is of great interests and importance in the field to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism by <italic>ADNP</italic> gene mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">In this work, we hypothesize that loss of ADNP leads to neural developmental defects. We make use of ES cell directional neural differentiation as a model system to investigate the role of ADNP in embryonic neural development. We show that ADNP is required for proper neural induction by modulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Mechanistically, ADNP functions to stabilize β-Catenin through binding to its armadillo domain which prevents its interaction with key components of degradation complex: Axin and APC. Loss of ADNP leads to hyperphosphorylation of β-Catenin by GSK3β and subsequent degradation via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, resulting in downregulation of neuroectoderm developmental genes. Small molecule-mediated activation of Wnt signaling can rescue the defects by loss of ADNP. This work provides important insights into the role of ADNP in neural development which would be useful for understanding the pathology of the Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome caused by <italic>ADNP</italic> mutation.</p>

<title>Generation and characterization of <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs</title>
<p id="Par7">To understand the molecular function of ADNP, we generated <italic>Adnp</italic> mutant ESCs by using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed to target the 3′ end of exon 4 of the mouse <italic>Adnp</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). We have successfully generated two <italic>Adnp</italic> mutant alleles (4 and 5 bp deletion in exon 4 of the <italic>Adnp</italic> gene), as revealed by DNA genotyping around the CRISPR targeting site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). ADNP protein was hardly detectable in <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs by western blot using ADNP antibodies from different resources, which strongly indicated that the mutant alleles are functional nulls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Generation of <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Cartoon depicting the gRNA target sites at exon 4 of mouse <italic>Adnp</italic> gene. <bold>b</bold> Genotyping showing the mutant alleles. <bold>c</bold> Western blot analysis of ADNP levels in control, shRNA knockdown, and <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs. <bold>d</bold> Representative image showing morphology of control and early passaged <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs. <bold>e</bold> The mRNA expression of representative pluripotency-related, mesodermal, neuroectodermal, endodermal genes in control, and early passaged <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs (<italic>n</italic> = 3 per group). <bold>f</bold> Representative image showing morphology of embryoid bodies (EBs) at indicated time points. <bold>g</bold> Heat-map analysis of DEGs of the indicated lineage-specific genes for control and <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESC-derived day 6 EBs, based on three RNA-seq replicates. <bold>h</bold> qPCR analysis showing the dynamic expression of the indicated genes during EB formation of control and <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs. qRT-PCR was based on three biologically independent experiments (<italic>n</italic> = 3 per group).

Source data are provided as a <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">Source Data</xref> file. Experiments were repeated at least two times in (<bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold>, <bold>f</bold>), and similar results were obtained.</p></caption><graphic id="d30e491" xlink:href="41467_2020_16799_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par8">In the traditional self-renewal medium containing LIF-KSR plus fetal bovine serum (FBS), the newly established <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESC colonies overall exhibited typical ESC-like morphology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). To understand how loss of ADNP affected the global gene expression, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments for control and early passaged <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs. A total of 1,026 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (log2 fold change &gt; 1 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were identified. Of which, an average of 766 genes were upregulated and 260 genes were downregulated (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). RNA-seq analysis showed that the primitive endoderm genes such as <italic>Gata6</italic>, <italic>Gata4</italic>, and <italic>Sox17</italic> were slightly upregulated in the absence of ADNP. However, loss of ADNP effects on pluripotency-related, mesodermal, and neuroectodermal genes were subtle. Our qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence (IF) analyses confirmed the RNA-seq results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>). Consistently, <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs can maintain self-renewal capacity for many generations before eventually adopting a flatten morphology and exhibiting reduced alkaline phosphatase activity, which could be rescued by reintroducing a FLAG-tagged ADNP into the mutant ESCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par9">To confirm that the observed phenotypes were not due to the possible off-target effect of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we also reduced <italic>Adnp</italic> transcript levels in ESCs by shRNA knockdown approach. The infection of lentivirus made from each of the two individual shRNAs led to about 70% reduction of <italic>Adnp</italic> mRNA levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1d</xref>). <italic>Adnp</italic> knockdown ESCs morphologically resembled <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1e</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis of the selected genes revealed that the expression change of pluripotency and lineage specifying genes in <italic>Adnp</italic> knockdown ESCs was similar to that of <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1f</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec4">
<title>ADNP promotes ES cell directional neural differentiation</title>
<p id="Par10">Next, we examined the pluripotency of <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs by performing the classical embryoid bodies (EBs) formation assay. Control ESCs were capable of forming large smooth spheroid EBs, whereas <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs formed smaller rough disorganized structures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref>). To understand how loss of ADNP affected the global gene expression, we performed RNA-seq using day 6 EBs derived from control and <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs. A total of 2004 DEGs (log2 fold change &gt; 1 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were identified. Of which, an average of 1088 genes were upregulated and 916 genes were downregulated. Extra-embryonic endodermal genes such as <italic>Gata6</italic> and <italic>Gata4</italic> were substantially upregulated, while pluripotency genes such as <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic>, and neural-ectodermal genes such as <italic>Pax6, Olig2, Sox1, Nestin</italic>, and <italic>Otx2</italic> were significantly downregulated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>). Our qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the RNA-seq results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref>). Thus, based on the ESC-derived EB model, ADNP is required for the proper expression of neuroectodermal genes which was in line with the recent report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par11">To better understand the role of ADNP in ESC neural differentiation, we directly differentiated control and <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs toward a neural cell fate. We adapted a modified three-dimensional (3D) floating neurosphere protocol that allows fast and efficient differentiation of ESCs into neural progenitors (Stage 1) and mature neurons (Stage 2) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. At the end of Stage 1 of ESC neural differentiation, neurospheres from control ESCs were large, round, and even (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). The qRT-PCR results showed that day 6 control ESC-derived neurospheres abundantly expressed neural progenitor marker genes such as <italic>Olig2</italic>, <italic>Pax2</italic>, <italic>Pax6</italic>, and <italic>Nestin</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>). Flow cytometric assay revealed that more than 60% of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were PAX6<sup>+</sup>, suggesting that our ESC neural induction was of high efficiency (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). In contrast, neurospheres from <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs were smaller, rough, and disorganized. The expression of neural progenitor markers was substantially reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a, b</xref>). Flow cytometry results showed that only 31% of <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESC-derived NPCs were PAX6<sup>+</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2c</xref>). IF staining with NESTIN antibodies showed that NESTIN signals were greatly reduced in <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESC-derived neurospheres, which could be largely rescued by restoring FLAG-ADNP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). Quantitative analysis showed that the mean fluorescence intensity of NESTIN staining was significantly lower in <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESC-derived neurospheres than in control counterparts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>ADNP is required for proper ESC neural differentiation.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Cartoon showing the two-Stage ESC neural differentiation protocol. <bold>b</bold> Representative image showing morphology of day 6 and day 20 control and <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESC-derived neurospheres and neuronal cultures from three independent experiments with similar results.

Mean fluorescence intensity was calculated based on three biologically independent experiments (<italic>n</italic> = 3–5 different regions of interest per group) in (<bold>f</bold>, <bold>i</bold>). Data are presented as mean values ± SEM and <italic>p</italic> values by two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test are shown in (<bold>c</bold>, <bold>f</bold>, <bold>g</bold>, <bold>i</bold>).</p></caption><graphic id="d30e810" xlink:href="41467_2020_16799_Fig2_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par12">When day 9 neurospheres from control ESCs were plated onto gelatin-coated plates to allow further differentiation for an additional 7–14 days (Stage 2), obvious neuronal fiber-like structures characterized by the branched and elongated morphology were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis showed that day 19 ESC-derived cells abundantly expressed neuronal and glial marker genes <italic>Tubb3</italic> and <italic>Gfap</italic>, suggesting that more mature neural cell types were formed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g</xref>). IF staining results showed that TuJ1 and GFAP were abundantly expressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2i</xref>). In contrast, when neurospheres from <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs were plated onto gelatin-coated plates for further differentiation, few neuronal fibers were observed at day 19 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). IF staining results showed that TuJ1 and GFAP signals were greatly reduced in <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESC-derived neuronal cells (~1/2 and 1/3 that of the control, respectively) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2h, i</xref>). Quantitative analysis of TuJ1 and GFAP double staining revealed that there was a 60% reduction in mean fluorescence intensity in <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESC-derived neuronal cells compared with the control (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2d</xref>). The qRT-PCR and WB results were consistent with that the expression of GFAP and TuJ1 was reduced in <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESC-derived neural cell cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g, j</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par13">Taken together, we concluded that ADNP is required to promote ESC neural differentiation, and its loss leads to defective formation of NPCs and mature neuronal cell types.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec5">
<title>Loss of ADNP inhibits early neural developmental genes</title>
<p id="Par14">During ES cell neural differentiation, ADNP levels were gradually induced, reaching its maximum level of expression at around day 4 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>). The dynamic expression pattern of <italic>Adnp</italic> was closely correlated to that of the key neuroectoderm developmental genes such as <italic>Olig2</italic>, <italic>Pax6,</italic> and <italic>Nestin</italic> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3b</xref>). Importantly, loss of ADNP caused a significant downregulation of these genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>). These observations implied that ADNP may function at early stage of neural differentiation program by controlling the expression of neuroectoderm developmental genes.</p>
<p id="Par15">To gain insights into the ADNP-dependent transcriptional program during ES cell differentiation toward a neural cell fate, we monitored the dynamic changes of gene expression by performing RNA-seq experiments at day 0, day 3/4, and day 6 of neural differentiation from control and <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). In day 3 ESC-derived neurospheres, ~1200 DEGs (log2 fold change &gt; 1 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were identified, of which 627 genes were upregulated and 578 genes were downregulated.

In day 6 ESC-derived NPCs, ~2430 DEGs (log2 fold change &gt; 1 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were identified, of which 1344 genes were significantly upregulated and 1086 genes were downregulated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>).

<title>Wnt/β-catenin signaling is reduced in the absence of ADNP</title>
<p id="Par18">Next, we sought to explore the underlying mechanisms by which ADNP controls ES cell neural induction. To answer the question, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs identified in our RNA-seq results. This revealed a strong enrichment among DEGs for annotations associated with signal transduction as well as signaling molecules and interaction (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>). Detailed analysis showed that ADNP-dependent downregulated genes were highly enriched for gene networks regulating Wnt signaling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). Consistently, the heat-map analysis revealed that there was a clear reduction in transcript levels of Wnt-related genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4b</xref>). This observation strongly suggested that loss of ADNP blocks Wnt signaling pathway. To confirm the RNA-seq results, qRT-PCR for day 3 and day 9 ESC-derived neurospheres was performed to analyze the expression of Wnt target genes such as <italic>Ccnd1, Axin2, Lef1</italic>, and <italic>Tcf712</italic>. The expression of these genes at both time points was significantly reduced in the absence of ADNP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>). Note that the expression of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> gene, which encodes for β-catenin, was barely changed. To further confirm that Wnt signaling was compromised in the absence of ADNP, we performed TopFlash luciferase reporter assay for day 3 control and mutant ESC-derived NPCs.

<p id="Par19">On the other hand, we investigated whether overexpressing ADNP could facilitate Wnt signaling. To this end, we performed the TopFlash reporter assay in HEK293T cells transfected with an increasing amount of plasmids encoding ADNP. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4c</xref>, the TopFlash reporter activities were enhanced in a ADNP dose-dependent manner, in the presence and absence of Wnt3a. Based on these data, we concluded that ADNP positively regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</p>
<p id="Par20">The above data suggested that loss of ADNP function may affect neural induction by inhibiting Wnt signaling. If this is the case, enhancing Wnt signaling should rescue the neural defects from <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs. CHIR99021 (CHIR) is a well-characterized canonical Wnt signaling pathway activator. We found that addition of 3 μM CHIR partially rescued the gene and protein expression as well as morphological defects of day 6 <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESC-derived NPCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e, f</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4d, e</xref>). Quantitative analysis showed that the fluorescence intensity of NESTIN staining was significantly higher in cells treated with CHIR than in cells without CHIR treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g</xref>). However, treatment with different doses of Wnt3a proteins had little effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4f, g</xref>). These data suggested that ADNP may regulate Wnt signaling downstream of the activity of Wnt ligands but upstream or parallel to GSK3β<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par21">Taken together, we concluded that ADNP is critical for ES cell neural differentiation by promoting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

<title>Identifying β-catenin as an ADNP interacting protein</title>
<p id="Par22">In our immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry assay (IP-Mass Spec), β-Catenin was detected as one of the top hits of ADNP immunoprecipitates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). As β-Catenin is the key player in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, we hypothesized that ADNP may regulate Wnt signaling by targeting β-Catenin. We first investigated whether ADNP interacts with β-catenin by performing co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments. The Co-IP results showed that endogenous ADNP interacts with β-Catenin in both ESCs and day 3 ESC-derived NPCs, albeit exhibiting much stronger interaction in NPCs than in ESCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b, c</xref>). We also performed the Co-IP experiments using the 3×FLAG-ADNP overexpressing <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESC line. FLAG-ADNP readily pulled down endogenous β-Catenin in day 3 ESC-derived NPCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Identifying β-catenin as an ADNP interacting protein.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic representation showing the experimental design of IP in combination mass spectrometry assay (left) and a list of representative ADNP interacting proteins (right). <bold>b</bold> Co-IP data for endogenous ADNP and β-catenin in ESCs.

<p id="Par23">Next, we mapped the interacting domains for ADNP and β-catenin by co-transfecting plasmids encoding the truncated forms of ADNP and β-catenin into HEK293T cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>). We found that it was the N-terminal fragment (1–685) but not the C-terminal fragment of ADNP (686–1108) that is responsible to interact with β-catenin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5f</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5a</xref>). To investigate whether they interact directly, we used a reticulate system to synthesize FLAG-ADNP (1–685) and HA-β-catenin. When they were mixed together, FLAG-ADNP (1–685) could readily pull down HA-β-catenin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5g</xref>). Besides the zinc finger motifs, ADNP-Nter (1–685) contains NAP (also called davunetide or CP201), an 8-amino acid neuroprotective peptide (354–361 within the ADNP-Nter) derived from the ADNP protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. NAP was shown to enhance microtubule assembly and neurite outgrowth and protect neurons and glia exposed to toxins in mouse and rat models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. A recent study has shown that major symptoms of the Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome could be partially ameliorated by daily NAP treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. We wondered whether NAP alone could be sufficient to interact with β-catenin. When plasmids encoding FLAG-ADNP-NAP and HA-β-catenin were co-transfected into HEK293T cells, FLAG antibodies could pull down HA-β-catenin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5h</xref>). Of note, ADNP-Nter without NAP could still interact with β-catenin but this interaction was much weaker than that of ADNP-Nter and β-catenin (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5b</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par24">Next, we determined the fragments of β-catenin that are responsible for interaction with ADNP. β-catenin has an N-terminal domain (residues 1–150) that harbors the binding site for GSK3β and CK1 phosphorylation, a central armadillo domain (residues 151–666) composed of 12 armadillo repeats, and a C-terminal domain (residues 667–781)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5i</xref>). Our mapping experiments showed that the central armadillo domain of β-catenin strongly interacts with ADNP, while the N-terminal (1–150) and the C-terminal fragment (667–781) barely interact with ADNP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5j</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5c</xref>). These data indicated that the armadillo domain of β-catenin primarily mediates the interaction with ADNP.</p>
<p id="Par25">Finally, IF staining was performed to investigate the cellular co-localization of ADNP and β-catenin. During ES cell neuronal differentiation, there was a marked change in the intra-cellular localization of ADNP proteins: from predominantly nuclear localization in undifferentiated ESCs to predominantly cytoplasmic localization in ESC-derived NPCs and mature neurons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5d</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5k</xref>).

<title>ADNP stabilizes β-catenin during ESC neural differentiation</title>
<p id="Par26">Given the physical association of ADNP and β-Catenin, we asked whether ADNP is involved in the turnover of β-catenin protein. First, we examined the expression levels of β-catenin in day 3 control and <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESC-derived neurospheres. Loss of ADNP led to a significant reduction of total β-catenin levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). This reduction was primarily contributed by the cytoplasmic but not the nuclear fraction of β-catenin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>). Throughout ESC neural differentiation, total β-catenin levels remained lower in the absence of ADNP than in its presence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c, d</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6a, b</xref>). Importantly, β-catenin levels in day 6 <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESC-derived neurospheres could be largely rescued by restoring FLAG-ADNP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6e</xref>). When ESC-derived NPCs were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, loss of ADNP failed to induce β-catenin degradation, suggesting that ADNP-regulated β-catenin degradation might be dependent on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6f</xref>). Further studies showed that loss of ADNP strongly enhanced the ubiquitylation levels of β-catenin, which could be reversed by restoring 3×FLAG-ADNP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6g</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6c</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>ADNP stabilizes β-catenin during ESC neural differentiation.</title><p><bold>a</bold> WB showing total β-catenin levels in day 3 control and <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESC-derived neurospheres. <bold>b</bold> WB showing β-catenin levels in the cytoplasmic and the nuclear fraction of lysates from day 3 control and <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESC-derived neurospheres.

<p id="Par27">On the other hand, we investigated the effect of overexpressing ADNP on total β-catenin levels. Total β-catenin levels were slightly elevated in day 3 neurospheres from FLAG-ADNP overexpressing ESCs compared with the control counterpart (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6h</xref>). Overexpressing ADNP also led to higher expression of β-catenin in HEK293T cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6i</xref>). Next, we asked whether overexpression of ADNP proteins affects the stability of co-expressed β-catenin by co-transfecting plasmids encoding FLAG-ADNP and HA-β-catenin into 293 T cells. The IP results showed that FLAG-ADNP could stabilize HA-β-catenin in a dose-dependent fashion (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6d</xref>). Combining both loss of function and gain of function data, we concluded that ADNP is a positive regulator of β-catenin stabilization during ESC differentiation toward a neural cell fate.</p>
<p id="Par28">A previous study has suggested that ADNP may negatively regulate the phosphorylation activity of GSK3β<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. To investigate whether ADNP regulates the stability of β-catenin through modulating GSK3β activities, WB analysis for phospho-GSK3β (Ser9) and total GSK3β was performed for day 3 control and <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESC-derived neurospheres. We found that both the phospho-GSK3β and total GSK3β levels were barely altered in the absence of ADNP (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6e</xref>). In addition, overexpression of ADNP had little effect on phospho-GSK3β and total GSK3β levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6i</xref>). These results suggested that ADNP may not modulate the levels or activities of GSK3β.</p>
<p id="Par29">Next, we asked whether ADNP is involved in the regulation of β-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3β. We found that this was the case because phospho-β-catenin levels were elevated in the absence of ADNP and were reduced when ADNP was overexpressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c–i</xref>). To understand the molecular mechanism by which ADNP may regulate β-catenin phosphorylation levels, we further mapped the armadillo repeat domain that is responsible for interacting with ADNP. The armadillo repeat domain of β-catenin has 12 armadillo repeats, containing overlapping binding sites for many binding partners, including Axin and APC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. It is well-known that Axin, APC, and β-catenin form the degradation complex that promotes the GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of β-catenin. We divided the armadillo repeat domain into two parts: one contains repeats 1–4 (Arm1) which mediates β-catenin for the interaction with the scaffolding protein Axin, and another one composed of repeats 5–12 (Arm2) which interacts with APC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The IP results showed that both the Arm1 and Arm2 were able to interact with ADNP although Arm2 displayed a stronger capacity to associate with ADNP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b, c</xref>). Based on the results, we hypothesized that ADNP may protect β-catenin from hyperphosphorylation by GSK3β through competing with Axin and APC. To directly investigate the possibility, we examined the relationship between ADNP–β-catenin and β-catenin–Axin interactions by performing competitive protein-binding assay. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7d</xref>, the amount of Axin co-immunoprecipitated with β-catenin became reduced by the increased addition of ADNP.

<p id="Par30">To further confirm that ADNP can protect β-catenin from hyperphosphorylation by GSK3β, we transfected an increasing dose of plasmids encoding wild-type ADNP or ADNP-Cter (686–1108) mutants into HEK293T cells. We found that overexpressing wild-type ADNP but not ADNP-Cter decreased the p-β-catenin levels and increased the total β-catenin levels, in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6i</xref>). This data suggested that the interaction between ADNP and β-catenin is required for β-catenin stabilization through modulating its phosphorylation levels.</p>
<p id="Par31">Finally, we asked whether increasing β-catenin protein levels could rescue the neural differentiation defects caused by loss of ADNP. To this end, we made a Tet-Express inducible HA-β-catenin transgenic <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESC line and used it for neural induction.

The ability of <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs to differentiate into neural progenitors and neuronal cells was largely rescued by the addition of Tet-Express, revealed by the quantitative analysis of NESTIN and TuJ1 staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7g–i</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7a, b</xref>).

Zebrafish has two <italic>adnp</italic> homologs: <italic>adnpa</italic> and <italic>adnpb</italic>, and the expression of which has been reported (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. After 24 h, <italic>adnpa</italic> expression was restricted to the forebrain, the midbrain, the mid-hindbrain boundary and eye area (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8b</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par33">To understand the function of zebrafish Adnp (zAdnp), we generated <italic>adnpa</italic> and <italic>adnpb</italic> mutants using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8a, b</xref>). Both <italic>adnpa</italic> and <italic>adnpb</italic> mutant embryos can grow up to adults without apparent morphological defects (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8c</xref>). We went on to obtain <italic>adnpa adnpb</italic> double mutant lines by crossing <italic>adnpa−/−</italic> and <italic>adnpb−/−</italic> zebrafish. The majority of <italic>adnpa adnpb</italic> double mutant embryos appeared normal at 1 dpf, although a small portion of the embryos exhibited axis formation defects (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8d</xref>). Strikingly, about 16% (30/190) of double mutant embryos at 36–48 hpf displayed abnormal body morphology with massive neuronal death in brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8c</xref>). To investigate whether there was neuronal death phenotype, IF assay was performed to detect the expression of HuC/D for 36 hpf control and mutant embryos. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8d</xref>, the HuC/D signal was decreased in double mutant embryos. To confirm the result, we crossed <italic>adnpa−/− adnpb−/−</italic> females to the transgenic Tg (<italic>elavl3</italic>: GFP) (formerly HuC: GFP) male fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. We found that the GFP signal was significantly reduced in Adnp deficient embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8e</xref>). Furthermore, whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) results showed that the expression of neural genes such as <italic>dlx5a, neurod1</italic>, and <italic>phox2a</italic> was greatly reduced in day 2 double mutant embryos compared with sibling controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8f</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><title>Loss of <italic>adnp</italic> leads to the defective neural development in zebrafish embryos.</title><p><bold>a</bold> CRISPR/Cas9 gRNA design and the genotyping result of the <italic>adnpa</italic> mutant allele. <bold>b</bold> gRNA design and the genotyping result of <italic>adnpb</italic> mutant allele; <bold>c</bold> representative morphology of 2 dpf control and <italic>adnpa adnpa</italic> double mutants.

<p id="Par34">To investigate whether there were early neurodevelopmental defects in <italic>adnpa adnpb</italic> double mutant embryos, we examined the expression of a set of early neural genes. The expression of early neural markers such as <italic>foxd3, pax6, sox10</italic>, and <italic>egr2b</italic> was comparable between control and mutant embryos at 8 and 13 hpf (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8g</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8e</xref>). However, when 24 hpf embryos were analyzed, we found that there was a slightly reduced expression of neural markers such as <italic>crestin</italic>, <italic>pax2</italic> and <italic>egr2b</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8h</xref>). These data suggested that zAdnp might not be required for the initial specification of neural precursors but required for neural and neuronal differentiation at a slightly later developmental stage.</p>
<p id="Par35">Next, we asked whether zAdnp regulates zebrafish neurogenesis through Wnt signaling by targeting β-catenin. To this end, we first investigated whether zAdnp interacts with β-catenin in zebrafish embryos. mRNAs encoding FLAG-tagged Adnpa were injected into one-cell stage double mutant embryos, and IF assay was performed to detect FLAG-Adnpa in embryos at different developmental stages. The IF results showed that FLAG-Adnpa was ubiquitously expressed and predominantly localized in the nucleus of 3.5 and 6 hpf embryos, and predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of 13 and 24 hpf embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9a, b</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9a, b</xref>). To investigate the cytoplasmic localization of Adnpa in the context of embryonic neurogenesis, mRNAs encoding FLAG-tagged Adnpa were injected into one-cell stage Tg (<italic>sox10</italic>: GFP) or Tg (<italic>elavl3</italic>: GFP) zebrafish embryos. The IF results showed that all Sox10 or HuC positive cells were FLAG positive, which supported that Adnpa plays important role in zebrafish neurogenesis (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9c, d</xref>). Double IF staining with FLAG and β-catenin antibodies showed that FLAG-Adnpa was extensively co-localized with endogenous β-catenin in the cytoplasm of embryos at 13 and 24 hpf. In pre-gastrulating and gastrulating embryos, FLAG-Adnpa and β-catenin were also co-localized predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9a, b</xref>). Thus, FLAG-Adnpa cellular localization was shifted from predominantly nuclear to cytoplasmic during early embryogenesis. Finally, the Co-IP results showed that FLAG-Adnpa interacts with β-catenin in zebrafish embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9c</xref>).<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><title>Loss of <italic>adnp</italic> leads to reduced β-catenin levels and Wnt signaling in zebrafish embryos.</title><p><bold>a</bold> IF staining of FLAG and β-catenin showing the co-localization of FLAG-Adnpa and β-catenin in 3.5 hpf <italic>adnpa−/− adnpb−/−</italic> embryos injected with mRNAs encoding FLAG-Adnpa.

<p id="Par36">Next, we asked whether loss of Adnp led to reduced β-catenin levels or alteration of β-catenin cellular localization. It is well-known that β-catenin nuclear localization at dorsal blastomere is critical for proper body axis formation of zebrafish embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. IF staining using β-catenin antibodies showed that neither β-catenin levels nor its cellular localization was significantly changed in double mutant embryos (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9f, g</xref>). Double IF staining of β-catenin and HuC showed that β-catenin levels were slightly reduced in HuC<sup>+</sup> cells in 16 hpf mutant embryos, and significantly reduced in 24 hpf mutant embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9d, e</xref>). WB analysis showed that total β-catenin levels were slightly reduced in double mutant embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9f</xref>). To investigate whether Wnt signaling was reduced in double mutant embryos, the TopFlash luciferase assay was performed. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9g</xref>, the TopFlash luciferase activities were significantly reduced in mutant embryos, which could be partially rescued by micro-injection of <italic>adnpa</italic> mRNAs.</p>
<p id="Par37">On the other hand, we overexpressed Adnpa by micro-injecting <italic>adnpa</italic> mRNAs into one-cell stage wild-type embryos. Adnpa overexpressing embryos exhibited phenotypes ranging from weakly dorsalized to severely dorsalized (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9h</xref>), which resembled that of β-catenin overexpressing embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Consistently, there was a slight expansion of dorsal marker <italic>chd</italic> and reduction of ventral marker <italic>eve1</italic>, and an increased expression of Wnt target gene <italic>tbx6</italic> in Adnpa overexpressing embryos (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9h</xref>). To further confirm that overexpression of Adnpa caused dorsalization of embryos, we directly examined the dorsal organizer for shield-stage control and Adnpa overexpressing embryos. We found that overexpression of Adnpa led to an enlarged dorsal organizer (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9i</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par38">Taken together, we concluded that overexpression of zAdnp leads to dorsalized embryos similar to β-catenin overexpression, and loss of zAdnp leads to reduced Wnt/β-catenin signaling and defective neurogenesis in zebrafish embryos.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par39">De novo mutations in <italic>ADNP</italic> have been recently linked to the Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome. And <italic>ADNP</italic> has been proposed as one of the most frequent ASD-associated genes as it is mutated in at least 0.17% of ASD cases. It is therefore important to determine the molecular function of this protein, especially during embryonic neurogenesis.</p>
<p id="Par40">We found that loss of ADNP had little effect on the mRNA levels of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> gene which encodes β-catenin in ESCs. This rules out that ADNP controls β-catenin levels transcriptionally. During ESC differentiation toward a neural fate, the cellular localization of ADNP was shifted from predominantly nuclear to cytoplasmic. This nucleus-cytoplasm translocation during neural differentiation was also observed by Dr. Gozes’s group using P19 cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that the intra-cellular localization of ADNP is tightly regulated during neural induction, and/or that ADNP plays an important role in the cytoplasm for the induction, maintenance and maturation of neural cell types. By IP-Mass Spec, β-catenin was identified as a top ADNP interacting protein. Considering that Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is critically required for neural induction and differentiation, we reasoned that ADNP may control neurogenesis by regulating Wnt signaling via targeting β-catenin. We provided solid evidences that ADNP promotes neural induction and neuronal differentiation by directly associates with β-catenin and regulates its stability.</p>
<p id="Par41">Canonical Wnt signaling and β-catenin have been implicated in mouse and human embryonic stem cell maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In this work, <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs only displayed a slightly reduced β-catenin levels, and they remained undifferentiated for many generations in the traditional LIF-KSR medium. During ESC neural differentiation, however, a greater reduction of β-catenin levels was observed. This suggests that ADNP is not a core component of the Wnt signaling pathway in pluripotent ESCs. Instead, it may function as a temporal-specific regulator of Wnt signaling during neurogenesis, which is better supported by our zebrafish studies.</p>
<p id="Par42">Using zebrafish as an in vivo model, we found that a small portion of <italic>adnpa adnpb</italic> double mutant embryos exhibit neurodevelopmental defects and massive neuronal cell death in the head region, which recapitulates the phenotype of <italic>Adnp</italic> deficient mouse embryos. zAdnpa is predominantly nuclear localized in pre-gastrulating and gastrulating embryos. Soon after gastrulation, zAdnpa is predominantly co-localized with β-catenin in the cytoplasm of HuC<sup>+</sup> or Sox10<sup>+</sup> neural cells. Based on the temporal change of intra-cellular localization of Adnpa, we propose that zAdnp functions to regulate β-catenin levels during zebrafish neurogenesis, which is analogous to our ESC work: ADNP stabilizes β-catenin primarily in the cytoplasm by association with it during ESC neural differentiation (but not in undifferentiated ESCs).</p>
<p id="Par43">Taken together, we propose that ADNP is a temporal- or tissue-specific modulator of the Wnt signaling pathway which is required for neural induction and neuronal differentiation. This may explain why <italic>Adnp−/−</italic> ESCs remain undifferentiated for several passages and <italic>adnpa adnpb</italic> double mutant zebrafish embryos exhibit mild Wnt-related phenotypes.</p>

<p id="Par57">Quantification of western blot bands was performed by ImageJ software, according to the website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-30.html">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-30.html</ext-link>. Briefly, the rectangle tool was selected and used to draw a box around the lane, making sure to include some of the empty gel between lanes and white space outside of the band. All lanes were selected one by one. Once all lanes are defined, go to Plot lanes to generate histograms of each lane. Then the relative values were calculated by dividing each value by the control lane. The value of the control bands was set at 1.</p>

<title>Co-immunoprecipitation assay (Co-IP)</title>
<p id="Par58">Co-IPs were performed with the Dynabeads Protein G (Life Technologies, 10004D) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1.5 mg Dynabeads was conjugated with antibodies or IgG overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies were used are: 10 μg IgG (Proteintech, B900610), or 10 μg anti-ADNP antibody (R&amp;D Systems, A5919), or 10 μg anti-FLAG antibody (Proteintech, 20543-1-AP), or 10 μg anti-HA antibody (Abbkine, A02040), or 10 μg anti-MYC antibody (Transgen Biotech, HT101). The next day, total cell lysates and the antibody-conjugated Dynabeads were incubated overnight at 4 °C with shaking. After three-times washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween, the beads were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min with the 6×Protein loading buffer and the supernatant was collected for future WB analysis.</p>

<title>Luciferase reporter assays</title>
<p id="Par59">The TopFlash-luc reporter was kindly provided by Prof. Zongbin Cui from Institute of Hydrobiology, Wuhan. HEK293T cells (about 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells) were seeded in 24-well plates in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS (Transgen Biotech, FS101-02). After 24 h, the cells were transiently transfected with the indicated luciferase reporters using Liposomal Transfection Reagent (Yeasen, 40802ES03). For mESCs transfection, the Neon Transfection System was used according to the manual. Briefly, the trypsinized mESCs were resuspended in the electroporation buffer at a density of 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml. The TopFlash-luc reporter and pTK-Renilla plasmids were added into the cells. Then electroporation was performed using the Neon Transfection System according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After transfection, the cells were treated with or without 10 ng/ml Wnt3a for 16 h. The luciferase activity was measured with Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, E1910). Renilla was used as an internal control.</p>
<p id="Par60">For luciferase reporter assays in zebrafish embryos, one-cell stage wild type and <italic>adnpa adnpb</italic> double mutant embryos were injected with 200 pg TopFlash and 20 pg pTK-Renilla plasmids, and the 24 hpf embryos were collected. Three pools of ten embryos each were lysed with the passive lysis buffer and assayed for luciferase activity according to the Dual Luciferase System (Promega). The TopFlash luciferase activities were measured with the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System. All luciferase reporter assays represent the mean ± SEM from three independent measurements of pools. At least three independent experiments were performed in different batches of embryos.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence assay</title>
<p id="Par61">ESC-derived neurospheres were collected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for half an hour at room temperature. Then the cells were washed with PBST (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100) three times, each for 15 min. Following the incubation with blocking buffer (5% normal horse serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After three-times wash with PBST, the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies (1:500 dilution in blocking buffer, Alexa Fluor 488, Life Technologies) at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. The nuclei were counter-stained with DAPI (Sigma, D9542, 1:1000). After washing with PBS twice, the slides were mounted with 100% glycerol on histological slides. Images were taken by a Leica SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope (Wetzlar, Germany). About ten images were taken for each slide at different magnifications.</p>
<p id="Par62">Quantification of IF staining was done by ImageJ software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The fluorescence intensity was measured, based on the IF images from at least three biologically independent experiments. When measuring the fluorescence intensity, the entire image or selected area was selected for both the control and mutant group. A total of 3–6 images were measured for each group, and a mean fluorescence intensity value (after subtracting background) was calculated. The control group was arbitrarily set as 1 (or 100%), and the relative fluorescence intensity was expressed as the percentage relative to that of the control group. The results were shown as mean ± SEM. <italic>p</italic> values were calculated by the two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test.</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation in combination with mass spectrometry</title>
<p id="Par63">For mass spectrometry analysis, the IP samples (immunoprecipitated by IgG or ADNP antibody) were run on SDS-PAGE gels and stained with the Coomassie Blue. Then the entire lanes for each IP samples were cut off and transferred into 15 ml tubes containing deionized water. The treatment of the samples and the mass spectrometry analysis were done by GeneCreate Biological Engineering Company (Wuhan, China).</p>

<title>Protein–protein interaction assay</title>
<p id="Par64">Protein–protein interaction assay was performed using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, L5020, USA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Tagged-ADNP, tagged-ADNP mutants, tagged-β-catenin, and tagged-β-catenin mutants were synthesized using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system according to the manual. Briefly, 1 μg of circular PCS2-version of plasmids was added directly to the TNT lysates and incubated for 1.5 h at 30 °C. 1 μl of the reaction products was subjected to WB assay to evaluate the synthesized protein. For protein–protein interaction assay, 5–10 μl of the synthesized HA- or FLAG-tagged proteins was mixed in a 1.5 ml tube loaded with 300 μl TEN buffer, and the mixture was shaken for 30 min at room temperature. Next, IP or pull-down assay was performed using Dynabeads protein G coupled with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies as described above.</p>

<title>Generation zebrafish <italic>adnp</italic> mutants by CRISPR/Cas9</title>
<p id="Par66">Zebrafish <italic>adnp</italic> mutants were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The gRNA targeting sequences for <italic>adnpa</italic> and <italic>adnpb</italic> gene were 5′-GGACTCTGGAAACCCACGTC-3′ and 5′-GGAGGACTTCATGGGGCAG-3′, respectively. gRNAs were generated using the MEGAshortscript T7 kit (Thermo Fisher). The Cas9 mRNA was synthesized using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 Kit (AM1340, Thermo Fisher). The mixture containing 200 ng/µl Cas9 mRNA and 80 ng/µl gRNA was co-injected into one-cell stage zebrafish embryos. The genomic DNA of 20 injected embryos at 24 hpf was extracted and subjected to PCR amplification. The DNA fragments containing the gRNA targeting sequences were amplified by PCR using primers 5′-TGCTCAGATTGCCCGTTT-3′ and 5′-GATAGGTGCACTTCTTGCAGTA-3′ for <italic>adnpa</italic> gene, 5′-AATGTGCACAGCGAGGACTT-3′ and 5′-GACAAGGACTGTGTAGCCCC-3′ for <italic>adnpb</italic> gene, respectively. The genotype was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Adults raised up from injected embryos were screened for mosaic founders by the amplicon sequencing. The mosaic founders were outcrossed to wild type to obtain the F1 offsprings with stable germline transmission. The F1 heterozygous carrying 7 bp deletion (<italic>adnpa</italic>) and 5 bp deletion (<italic>adnpb</italic>) were outcrossed to wild type to generate F2 heterozygous, respectively. The F2 heterozygous were inter-crossed to generate homozygous <italic>adnpa</italic>−/− and <italic>adnpb</italic>−/−, respectively. The <italic>adnpa−/−</italic> and <italic>adnpb−/−</italic> adults were outcrossed to each other to generate <italic>adnpa</italic> and <italic>adnpb</italic> double mutant. The subsequent screening was performed by high resolution melt analysis using primers 5′-TTCCGCAATGTTCACAGGGA-3′ and 5′-GGCATATGGAAGAGCCTGACG-3′ for <italic>adnpa</italic>, 5′-CACATCAGGTTGTTTCATATGCCT-3′ and 5′-TCACGTGTCTTTTCCAGACGA-3′ for <italic>adnpb</italic>, respectively.</p>

<title>Microinjections into zebrafish embryos</title>
<p id="Par67">For overexpression experiments, full-length cDNA encoding Adnpa (NC_007122.7) was amplified and cloned into the PCS2 (+) vector. The primers we used are GATGTTTCAGCTTCCAGTGAATAACC (forward) and CACAAGCCATCATCTACCAAGC (reverse). The <italic>Adnpa</italic> mRNAs were transcribed with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 Kit (Invitrogen, AM1340) and were dissolved in nuclease-free water to the final concentration of 150 ng/μl. A total of 1–5 nl mRNAs were microinjected into one-cell stage wild-type zebrafish embryo using the WPI microinjector (WPI, USA). 1–2 dpf embryos were anesthetized in 0.016% Tricaine and photographed under a Leica stereomicroscope.</p>

<title>Whole-mount immunofluorescence in zebrafish</title>
<p id="Par68">Briefly, 12–48 hpf zebrafish embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C and then underwent proteinase K treatment for 8 min at RT. The primary antibodies were anti-HuC/HuD monoclonal antibody (Life Technologies, USA, 1:350 dilution in PBST), anti-FLAG (F3165, Sigma), and anti-β-catenin (20543-1-AP, Proteintech). After blocking for 2 h at room temperature with solution (0.1% Triton X-100, 1% BSA, and 1% DMSO in PBS), the embryos were incubated overnight with the primary antibodies at 4 °C with shaking. After three-times wash with PBST, embryos were incubated with the secondary antibodies (1:1000, Goat anti-Mouse IgG secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488, Life technologies, USA) for 2 h at RT.
