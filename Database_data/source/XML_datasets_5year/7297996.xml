<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterised by Aβ and tau pathology as well as synaptic degeneration, which correlates best with cognitive impairment. Previous work suggested that this pathological complexity may result from changes in mRNA translation. Here, we studied whether mRNA translation and its underlying signalling are altered in an early model of AD, and whether modelling this deficiency in mice causes pathological features with ageing. Using an unbiased screen, we show that exposure of primary neurons to nanomolar amounts of Aβ increases FMRP-regulated protein synthesis. This selective regulation of mRNA translation is dependent on a signalling cascade involving MAPK-interacting kinase 1 (Mnk1) and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and ultimately results in reduction of CYFIP2, an FMRP-binding protein. Modelling this CYFIP2 reduction in mice, we find age-dependent Aβ accumulation in the thalamus, development of tau pathology in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, as well as gliosis and synapse loss in the hippocampus, together with deficits in memory formation. Therefore, we conclude that early stages of AD involve increased translation of specific CYFIP2/FMRP-regulated transcripts. Since reducing endogenous CYFIP2 expression is sufficient to cause key features of AD with ageing in mice, we suggest that prolonged activation of this pathway is a primary step toward AD pathology, highlighting a novel direction for therapeutic targeting.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and phosphorylated tau tangles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> are classical histological features found in brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a neurodegenerative condition that causes loss of memory and other cognitive impairments in older age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The best correlate of memory loss is the progressive degeneration of synapses, which occurs prior to neuronal death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Early changes in Aβ metabolism may result in synaptic degeneration via the production of soluble Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, a consequence of excessive amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In cultured neurons, Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers have been suggested to locally stimulate the synthesis of APP at synapses, via an mRNA translation-dependent mechanism that involves the RNA-binding protein fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In this manner, Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> may drive its own production, resulting in a feed-forward loop of toxicity at a particularly vulnerable location. FMRP binds to hundreds of mRNAs in the brain, including <italic>App</italic> mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Its primary cellular function is thought to be the inhibition of mRNA translation, which requires FMRP-mRNA interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, although in some instances FMRP may be involved in both nucleo-cytoplasmic and dendritic mRNA transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">FMRP binds to the highly conserved cytoplasmic FMRP-interacting proteins 1 and 2 (CYFIP1 and 2, also known as Sra-1 and Pir121, respectively)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Both proteins are expressed in various tissues including the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, where they localise to both excitatory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and inhibitory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> synapses of hippocampal neurons. Although little is known about their precise function due to their relatively recent discovery, they have both overlapping and unique functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. CYFIP1 is thought to repress cap-dependent translation of specific mRNAs by interacting with the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and CYFIP2 has an identical eIF4E-binding motif to CYFIP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In addition to regulating translation of mRNA, CYFIP1 and CYFIP2 are part of the Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein-family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) complex that regulates actin polymerisation at synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. CYFIP2 protein expression is reduced in post-mortem AD brain and in an AD mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Modelling the AD-related reduced CYFIP2 expression in heterozygous <italic>Cyfip2</italic> null mutant mice (<italic>Cyfip2</italic><sup>+/−</sup>), which have no overt phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, led to increased APP protein expression, enhanced tau phosphorylation at CaMKII phospho-sites in synapses, elevated soluble Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> levels, and changes in synapse morphology in the young adult hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Taken together, these findings suggested that amyloid accumulation, tau pathology, and synaptic degeneration are due to, at least in part, an Aβ-induced elevation of protein synthesis that involves CYFIP2. Here, we tested this hypothesis in primary neuronal cultures and found that nanomolar amounts of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> preparations increase net protein synthesis and modulate the association of specific putative FMRP targets with ribosomes. Mechanistically, Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> causes MAPK-interacting kinase (Mnk1)-dependent phosphorylation of eIF4E and dissociation between eIF4E and CYFIP2, ultimately resulting in ubiquitination and reduction of CYFIP2 levels. Since early changes in Aβ metabolism reduce CYFIP2 expression, we studied the phenotype of heterozygous <italic>Cyfip2</italic> null mutants in older age, as ageing is the biggest risk factor for AD, and homozygous knockouts are not viable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We establish that aged <italic>Cyfip2</italic> heterozygotes develop amyloid and tau pathology, gliosis, spine loss and more severe memory impairment than in young age, indicating that reduction of a single endogenous mouse gene can cause key aspects of AD-type pathology in the mouse brain. Therefore, our work proposes a central role for CYFIP2 in AD pathogenesis, as a potential modulator of Aβ-dependent mRNA translation.</p>

<title><italic>Cyfip2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice</title>
<p id="Par5">As detailed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, <italic>Cyfip2</italic> heterozygous null mutant mice on the C57BL/6N genetic background were obtained from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, UK). Mice designated <italic>Cyfip2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> have a <italic>Cyfip2</italic><sup>tm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi</sup> (ID:33461) allele generated by the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program which uses a ‘knockout-first’ design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Mice were maintained on the C57BL/6N genetic background. Animals were housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum and genotyped by PCR as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. All procedures were undertaken in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. For biochemical studies on younger animals, both male and female mice were used. For behavioural and histological analyses on aged animals, only females were used, including a female-only 3-month-old control group.</p>

<sec id="Sec4">
<title>Fear-conditioning memory</title>
<p id="Par6">All animals used for experiments were handled 2 min per day either for 3 days (3–4-month old) or 5 days (12-month old) before conditioning. All experiments were performed during the light cycle. During training, each mouse was placed into the chamber (Med Associates Inc., St. Albans, VT, USA) in a soundproof box. After a 120-s introductory period, a tone (75 dB, 10 kHz) was presented for 30 s, and the mouse received a 2-s foot shock (0.7 mA) which co-terminated with the tone. After an additional 30 s, the mouse was returned to the home cage. Twenty-four hours after training, the mice were brought back to the conditioning chamber for 5 min to test for contextual fear memory. Freezing behaviour during each 2-s shock was scored every 5 s, blind to genotype.</p>

<sec id="Sec5">
<title>Immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence (IHC/IF)</title>
<p id="Par7">For histological analyses of aged mice, 12-month-old female <italic>Cyfip2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants and wild-type littermates were used. To control for the effects of normal ageing, a group of 3-month-old female wild-type mice also on the C57BL/6N background were added to the analysis. Mice were anaesthetised with an intraperitoneal injection of Euthatal<sup>®</sup> (Merial, Toulouse, France), and intra-cardially perfused with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution after an initial PBS wash. Whole brains were removed and stored overnight in 30% sucrose in PBS, then cut sagittally to separate left and right hemispheres, snap frozen in isopentane, and stored at −80 °C until ready for cutting and processing. Brains were mounted onto stages using cryo-embedding compound and coronally cut into 40 µm thick sections. For every animal (biological replicate), two sections from the same brain region (technical replicate) were stained per target. Prior to processing, floating sections were washed in TBS, then blocked in 2% normal goat serum in TBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated overnight with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. Antibodies used were AT-8 (Thermo Fisher MN1020, 1:100), PHF-1 (Peter Davies, 1:100), tau (Dako A0024, 1:1000), ionised calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) (Wako Chemicals 019-19741, 1:200), GFAP (Dako Z0334, 1:1000), pGSK3β (Tyr216) (Abcam ab75745, 1:300), 4G8 (Calbiochem NE1002, 1:100). Sections were washed in TBS before incubating in a species-appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-tagged (IHC) or fluorophore conjugated (IF) secondary antibody, diluted directly in blocking solution.</p>
<p id="Par8">For IHC, sections were incubated in 2.5% v/v H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in methanol for 30 min. After secondary antibody incubation sections were washed in TBS and incubated in 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Sigma) for 2–10 min depending on the antibody used, until the tissue appeared visibly brown, in small batches and blind to group and genotype. Sections were then washed twice in TBS for 10 min, mounted onto glass slides and allowed to dry. Slides were processed for counterstaining of nuclei using haematoxylin. Briefly, mounted sections were gently rinsed with water and then placed in Gill’s haematoxylin stain (Vector Laboratories) before being differentiated in 0.5% acid alcohol, washed, and dehydrated through a series of ethanol solutions (70%, 95%, 95%, 100%, 100%). Finally, sections were cleared in two changes of xylene before being coverslipped with xylene-based mounting media (Thermo Scientific) using an automated coverslipping system (Thermo Scientific). For IF, slides were coverslipped manually using a fluorescence-compatible mounting medium (Invitrogen ProLong™ Diamond Antifade mountant with DAPI).</p>
<p id="Par9">Slides were imaged using the Olympus Slidescanner VS120 with Brightfield or Fluorescence mode. Images were taken with the 40× objective (NA 0.95, 0.17 μm/pixel), as automated maximal projections of z-stacks using the maximal density of focal points. Exposure times for fluorescent images were optimised manually prior to the scan, and automatically maintained across sections for the same experiment.</p>

<sec id="Sec6">
<title>Amytracker™ staining</title>
<p id="Par10">Manufacturer’s instructions were used to visualise protein aggregates in mouse brain sections with Amytracker™680 (Ebba Biotech). Briefly, sections were rinsed in PBS and fixed in ice-cold (−20 °C) ethanol at RT for 10 min. Tissue sections were rehydrated in a 1:1 mixture of ethanol and water for 5 min and in PBS for 5 min. Sections were incubated with Amytracker™680 dye, diluted 1:1000 in PBS, for 30 min room temperature. Sections were washed in PBS, mounted onto glass slides with ProLong™ Diamond (Invitrogen), and coverslipped. Once dry, fluorescence was visualised using the Cy5 filter set of the Olympus Slidescanner.</p>

<sec id="Sec7">
<title>Dendritic spine analysis</title>
<p id="Par11">Brains from 12-month-old female <italic>Cyfip2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants and wild-type littermates were used to analyse spine density and morphology and processed for modified Golgi–Cox impregnation according to manufacturer’s instructions (FD Rapid GolgiStain™ kit, FD NeuroTechnologies, USA). Briefly, brains were isolated as quickly as possible, rinsed in water and immersed in impregnation solutions A and B at room temperature for 2 weeks in the dark. Tissue was transferred into Golgi solution C for 72 h in the dark at room temperature. Brains were rapidly frozen by dipping into isopentane pre-cooled with dry ice and stored at −80 °C until ready for sectioning. Coronal sections of 80 µm thickness were cut and mounted on double gelatine-coated slides. Sections were rinsed, stained with solutions D and E, dehydrated through an ethanol series, and cleared with xylene, before coverslipping with Permount<sup>®</sup>. Slides were allowed to dry overnight before imaging and analysis. Pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of dorsal hippocampal sections were identified by their triangular soma shape and numerous dendritic spines. A 100× Plan Apo oil-immersion objective (NA 1.40, 0.07 μm/pixel) on the Eclipse Ti2 inverted microscope (Nikon) was used to image z-stacks of secondary and tertiary dendrites longer than 10 µm in the <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> (apical dendrites). Fifty dendritic segments were imaged and analysed for each group, and 10–12 cells were imaged per animal. Dendrites were reconstructed in 3D using the Neurolucida 360 system (MBF Bioscience, USA) and dendritic spines were identified and classified as thin, stubby, mushroom or filopodia using parameters based on three-dimensional structures of dendritic spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="Sec8">
<title>Primary neuronal culture</title>
<p id="Par12">Primary cortical neuronal cultures were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rat E18 embryos. Cells were seeded into culture plates coated with 0.2 mg/mL poly-<sc>d</sc>-lysine (Sigma) at a density of ~937 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>. Cells were cultured in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27, 0.5 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, UK). After 4 days in vitro (DIV), 200 μM of <sc>d</sc>,<sc>l</sc>-amino-phosphonovalerate (<sc>d</sc>,<sc>l</sc>-APV, Abcam) was added to the media to maintain neuronal health over long-term culture and to reduce cell death due to excitotoxicity. Fifty percent media changes were performed weekly until desired time in culture was reached (27-28 DIV).</p>

<sec id="Sec9">
<title>Synthetic Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomer preparation</title>
<p id="Par13">Oligomers from synthetic rat Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> peptide (Calbiochem) were prepared as detailed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Briefly, a stock solution was prepared at 100 μM in 200 mM HEPES (pH 8.5). The solution was gently agitated for 30 min at room temperature, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Once defrosted for treatments, aliquots were not subjected to any further freeze–thaw. This method of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> preparation is thought to form oligomers and not higher molecular weight or fibrillar aggregate forms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. To verify the composition of the Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> generated, the NativePAGE™ (Invitrogen) system was used, and manufacturer’s instructions were followed. To confirm the presence of oligomers, Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> peptides were treated in a 1:1 ratio with guanidine hydrochloride which breaks down oligomers. An antibody raised against the juxtamembrane extracellular domain of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, spanning amino acids 17–24 (clone 4G8, Millipore MAB1561, diluted 1:1000), was used for detection of rodent Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers. As a control, commonly used human Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> peptides solubilised either in hexafluoroisopropanol or trifluoroacetic acid were also prepared by removal of solvent and oligomerisation in PBS at 37 °C for 3 h (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec10">
<title>Pharmacological treatments</title>
<p id="Par14">All treatments were performed directly in cell culture media. Stock solutions of cycloheximide (CHX) (Sigma) and Mnk1 inhibitor compound CGP 57380 (Tocris) in DMSO were diluted to final concentrations in the cell culture medium, using equal volumes of DMSO as control. For oligomeric Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> treatments, aliquots were defrosted just prior to treatment, and diluted to a final concentration of 100 nM in cell culture medium, using equal volumes of HEPES buffer as control. The surface sensing of translation (SUnSET) assay was used to monitor protein synthesis in cell cultures, following a published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Briefly, puromycin (Sigma) was diluted to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml in culture medium for the last 10 min of the treatment. Samples were lysed and run as a western blot, using an anti-puromycin antibody (Kerafast EQ0001, 1:1000). Prior to blocking and primary antibody incubation, total protein levels on the membrane were detected using the Revert™ Total Protein Stain Kit (LI-COR) as per manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec11">
<title>Cell lysis</title>
<p id="Par15">At the end of the treatment culture medium was removed and plates were placed on an ice block. Cells were rinsed briefly with ice-cold PBS, then lysed in equal volumes of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA pH 8) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma), using an ice-cold plastic cell scraper. Lysates were frozen at −20 °C. Protein amounts were quantified using a BCA kit (Pierce) and proteins were detected by immunoblotting.</p>

For IP in synaptosomes in mouse hippocampus, crude synaptosomal fractions were freshly prepared, as detailed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Protein samples were incubated with pre-cleared magnetic Protein A-coupled Dynabeads™ (Invitrogen) and primary antibodies against CYFIP1 (Millipore) or CYFIP2 (GeneTex) were added in a 1:50 ratio to the lysate–bead mixture. Tubes were rotated at 4 °C overnight, spun down briefly, and the supernatant removed using a magnetic rack. Beads were washed 3× in cold IP buffer, before adding Laemmli sample buffer and boiling at 95 °C for 10 min. This IP fraction was used fresh for protein detection by immunoblotting. For certain analyses, values were normalised to those of the vehicle control to minimise error between biological replicates. For quantification of protein ubiquitination, cells treated with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 were used as a positive control to determine the correct molecular weights of ubiquitinated proteins.</p>

<title>Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> regulates differential translation of FMRP target mRNAs in neurons</title>
<p id="Par25">Previous studies have provided circumstantial evidence that sub-micromolar doses of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> may enhance protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>; however, the alternative may be a difference in protein turnover. For the purpose of this study, we selected synthetic rat peptides rather than human peptides. Although it has been suggested that the rodent Aβ sequence is unable to aggregate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, overexpression of murine Aβ in the mouse brain can result in Aβ accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Therefore, no a priori assumptions were made regarding the amyloidogenic properties of the peptide, to keep the model system as physiological as possible. To directly monitor whether Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> impacts on protein synthesis, we used the SUnSET assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> which utilises incorporation of puromycin, a structural analogue of aminoacyl tRNAs, into the nascent polypeptide chain, to directly reflect the rate of mRNA translation in vitro. Primary rat cortical neurons were cultured for 27 DIV, before being treated with a preparation of 100 nM synthetic rat Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> peptides including oligomers (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) for 24 h, or vehicle as control. Puromycin was added during the last 10 min of treatment to provide a snapshot of newly synthesised proteins and determine whether Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> exposure modulates this rate. Cells were lysed and samples subjected to western blot were analysed using an anti-puromycin antibody. When normalised to signal for total protein using Revert™, we found that Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> treatment led to a significant increase in protein synthesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a, b</xref>). Prior treatment with translational elongation inhibitor CHX blocked the increase in puromycin signal by Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, confirming it is translation dependent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a, b</xref>). To determine which mRNAs might be regulated at the level of translation by Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> treatment, we performed paired RNA sequencing in total cytosolic extracts and ribosomal-enriched fractions using sucrose cushions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>) from rat cortical neurons treated for 24 h with Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> or vehicle. A minimum of 42M reads were generated per sample (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>). Correlation analysis showed that samples cluster differently depending on the subcellular fraction (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>), suggesting that mRNAs pelleted in the sucrose cushion were distinct to total mRNAs. Differential expression between total and ribosomal-bound mRNAs showed 356 unique genes in vehicle-treated cells and 1136 unique genes in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-treated cells, with an overlap of 2624 genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">2</xref>). These data suggest that Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> exposure modulates the binding of specific mRNAs to ribosomes. We interrogated the presence of previously reported FMRP targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> in these differentially expressed genes and detected FMRP targets in both datasets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). About 11% of the differentially ribosome-bound mRNAs were FMRP targets in both vehicle and Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-treated cells. However, in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-treated cells there were more unique differentially ribosome-bound FMRP targets than in control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">2</xref>), suggesting that Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> exposure may modulate the translation of specific FMRP-bound mRNAs. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the identified unique FMRP targets that showed differential binding to ribosomes upon Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> exposure (not present in vehicle-treated cells) revealed clear groups of genes with differences between vehicle and Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> treatment and subcellular fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref>). Biological pathway analysis of these genes with Reactome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> was suggestive of pathways enriched in neuronal and synaptic function, such as ‘protein–protein interaction at synapses’ and ‘neurexins and neuroligins’ (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">3</xref>). Altogether, our data strongly suggest a role for Aβ in the ribosomal association and translation of specific genes modulated by FMRP.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> increases protein synthesis in primary cortical neurons by promoting ribosomal association of FMRP-bound mRNAs.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Protein synthesis is increased in primary neurons following 24-h treatment with 100 nM Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> preparations including oligomers, as determined by puromycin levels normalised to Revert™, a total protein stain (<italic>q</italic> = 4.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).

<title>Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> impacts on protein synthesis via the Mnk/eIF4E/CYFIP axis and reduces CYFIP2 levels</title>
<p id="Par26">Since treatment of cortical neurons with Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> preparations increased protein synthesis and appeared to modulate the translation of specific FMRP-regulated mRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>), we further explored the mechanism of this control. CYFIP1 and 2 exist as a part of the FMRP translational repressor complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, while interacting with the translation initiation factor eIF4E which is essential for initiation of cap-dependent mRNA translation in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We hypothesised that the increase in protein synthesis by Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> may depend on phosphorylation of eIF4E at Ser209, as this phosphorylation is elevated in post-mortem AD brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and because it increases translation of specific transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. To test this idea, we pharmacologically blocked eIF4E phosphorylation at Ser209 and assessed its impact on Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced protein synthesis in primary neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a–d</xref>). We used CGP 57380, a competitive inhibitor of MAPK-interacting protein kinase 1 (Mnk1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, a kinase whose only validated substrate is eIF4E<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. We found that the Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> treatment significantly increased eIF4E phosphorylation at Ser209 and the Mnk1 inhibitor blocked this increase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a, b</xref>). Blocking eIF4E phosphorylation prevented an Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced increase in protein synthesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c, d</xref>), suggesting the increased translation by Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> is dependent on eIF4E phosphorylation at Ser209.

<p id="Par27">CYFIP1 represses cap-dependent translation of specific mRNAs by interacting with eIF4E and specifically blocking the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. As CYFIP2 has an identical eIF4E-binding motif to CYFIP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, we hypothesised it could also interact with eIF4E. We found that CYFIP2 co-immunoprecipitated with eIF4E, in rat primary cortical neurons at 28 DIV, and in the mouse hippocampus, even in synaptosome-enriched fractions (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). These data suggest that CYFIP2 interacts with eIF4E. Next, we tested whether Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced phosphorylation of eIF4E would disrupt the interaction between CYFIP2 and eIF4E, using co-IP experiments in the presence or absence of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e, f</xref>). We found that treatment with Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> alone significantly reduced the amount of eIF4E bound to CYFIP2 compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e, f</xref>). Further, blocking Mnk1 prevented Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced dissociation of eIF4E and CYFIP2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e, f</xref>), and the inhibitor itself did not have any effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e, f</xref>). We also found that Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> treatment significantly reduced binding of eIF4E to CYFIP1 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5a, b</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par28">We studied whether the dissociation of eIF4E and CYFIP2 could ultimately lead to reduction of CYFIP2 expression, using immunoblotting to detect CYFIP2 levels in cell lysates which were then normalised to levels of a neuronal marker, neuron specific enolase (NSE). We found that Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> treatment led to significant CYFIP2 reduction when normalised to NSE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g, h</xref>), which was prevented by Mnk1 inhibition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g, h</xref>). CYFIP1 levels were not changed when normalised to NSE (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5c, d</xref>). In addition, the reduction of CYFIP2 expression could not be explained by synapse loss as levels of pre-synaptic marker α-synaptotagmin were not altered by Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> treatment when normalised to NSE levels (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5c, d</xref>). Levels of α-synaptotagmin were, however, reduced after 5 days of treatment with 100 nM Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5e, f</xref>), indicating CYFIP2 expression is likely reduced prior to synapse loss.</p>
<p id="Par29">We hypothesised that the reduction of CYFIP2 may result from its degradation by the proteasome. We therefore stripped the immunoblots for CYFIP2 and CYFIP1 co-IPs and re-probed with an antibody against Ub that recognises ubiquitinated proteins. We detected a significant increase in levels of Ub bound to CYFIP2 in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-treated cells compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2i, j</xref>), although the possibility that ubiquitination of proteins interacting with CYFIP2 was also detected cannot be excluded.

<title>CYFIP2 reduction leads to age-dependent accumulation of pre-tangle-like structures in the mouse brain</title>

Further, in the young, adult <italic>Cyfip2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice no differences were found at pathology-associated sites of tau phosphorylation AT-8 (Ser202/Thr205) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7c, d</xref>) or PHF-1 (Ser396/Ser404) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7c, d</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par32">However, we hypothesised that priming of tau phosphorylation by αCaMKII in a CYFIP2-dependent manner combined with age-related factors could result in pathological tau phosphorylation at the AT-8 and PHF-1 phosphorylation sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.

<title>CYFIP2 reduction results in Aβ-positive accumulations in the mouse thalamus and astrocytic and microglial responses in the mouse hippocampus</title>

<p id="Par38">To further confirm the identity of these inclusions we also used the Amytracker™ range of fluorescent tracer molecules on brain sections. These dyes function in a manner similar to Thioflavins, cell-permeable benzothiazole dyes that fluoresce upon binding to cross-β-sheet structures, a defining feature of amyloid fibrils, and are therefore typically used for detection of amyloid plaques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Amytracker™ allows improved amyloid detection compared with Thioflavin compounds, detecting levels of both fibrillar and pre-fibrillar proteins and peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. The dye revealed a trend for an increase in staining between 3-month-old and 12-month-old wild-type hippocampus (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">12a IV and V, b</xref>), but no further change was observed in 12-month-old <italic>Cyfip2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">12a</xref> VI, b).

This suggests that the dye most likely recognises other amyloid-like proteins besides Aβ, which are increased with ageing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. A further significant increase was found in 12-month-old <italic>Cyfip2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a VII, c</xref>).

The schematic in the upper panel shows that in neurons of the healthy brain, mRNAs bound by FMRP are translationally repressed via the eIF4E-binding protein CYFIP2. In Alzheimer’s disease, increased production and/or reduced clearance of Aβ results in dissociation of this complex and prolonged translation of a subset of these mRNAs due to reduction of CYFIP2, which can be blocked by inhibition of Mnk1. The lower panel shows that in the young–adult mouse brain, loss of CYFIP2 elevates Aβ production and tau phosphorylation (at CaMKII sites), causes changes in dendritic spine morphology, and impairs spatial, but not contextual, memory. These effects are exacerbated by ageing, leading to accumulation of Aβ and of tau hyperphosphorylated at AT-8 and PHF-1 sites, dendritic spine loss, contextual memory impairment, and gliosis.</p></caption><graphic id="d30e2325" xlink:href="41398_2020_882_Fig5_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par43">The loss of synapses in AD is the best correlate of memory impairment and may result from build-up of amyloid-beta (Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>) peptides during disease progression. However, the precise roles of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> in synapse modification are poorly understood. Here, we show that in neurons Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> regulates mRNA translation and modulates ribosomal association of several FMRP-bound mRNAs, primarily affecting synthesis of proteins related to synaptic function. We demonstrate that this is likely to be via a pathway involving Mnk1 and eIF4E, which results in reduction of the 4E-binding protein CYFIP2, most likely due to ubiquitination. Finally, we find that reduced expression of CYFIP2 in 12-month-old mice causes several phenotypes of the disease. These include development of phospho-tau accumulation in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, thalamic Aβ accumulation, hippocampal gliosis, dendritic spine loss and impaired hippocampus-dependent memory formation.</p>
<p id="Par44">We propose a model where CYFIP2 reduction functions as both a cause and consequence of AD pathogenesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>). Reduction of CYFIP2 levels may result from activation of the Mnk1-eIF4E-CYFIP axis by Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). Once lost, a state of prolonged protein synthesis is proposed to further contribute to the toxic loop of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> production and tau hyperphosphorylation via increased synthesis of APP and αCaMKII protein, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Ageing processes, such as Tyr216 phosphorylation-dependent activity of GSK3β<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, may then interact to drive accumulation of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> and hyperphosphorylated tau (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>) in the form of plaques and tangles. With age, CYFIP2 reduction also promotes a glial response (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>), which is likely to be secondary to neuronal injury due to the absence of CYFIP2 expression in glial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Functionally, CYFIP2 reduction may cause a failure of immature spines to stabilise into mushroom spines via reduced WAVE function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>, resulting in age-dependent loss of dendritic spines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>). This correlates with an initial spatial memory retention deficit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, which is then further exacerbated to an additional impairment in contextual memory formation with age (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par45">The presence of key AD-like characteristics in 12-month-old <italic>Cyfip2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice suggests it is useful as a model of AD. Amyloid pathology has previously been detected upon overexpression of mutant human APP, or humanisation of the murine Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> sequence in a knock-in model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Rodent Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> differs from the human sequence by three amino acids (Arg<sup>5</sup>, Tyr<sup>10</sup>, and His<sup>13</sup> are replaced by Gly, Phe and Arg, respectively); as His<sup>13</sup> is required for Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> fibrillogenesis, it makes rodent Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> less prone to forming amyloid aggregates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. A proteolytic processing difference between species may result in protection of the mouse sequence against β-secretase processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>; however, overexpression of murine Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> can lead to formation of morphologically distinct plaques in an age-dependent manner, suggesting rodent Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> can aggregate, but less efficiently than the human peptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. At 12 months, <italic>Cyfip2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice develop Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> accumulations in the thalamus, a vulnerable brain region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, which is understudied in AD research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Further characterisation will therefore be required of these Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-positive inclusions in the <italic>Cyfip2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mouse model.</p>
<p id="Par46">AD-related tau pathology is particularly difficult to model, generally only occurring independently when non-physiological amounts of tau protein are overexpressed or when a point mutant version of tau is expressed, with the limitation that <italic>MAPT</italic> mutations do not cause AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Similarly, pre-tangle-like tau inclusions are only found following co-expression of familial AD-causing mutant human APP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>, and not in double knock-in mice having both humanised APP and tau<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Instead, the <italic>Cyfip2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mouse model, which lacks one copy of an endogenous gene, rendering lower expression of CYFIP2 similar as that present in post-mortem AD brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, shows stereotypical progression of phospho-tau accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>, and may therefore be a more physiological model of sporadic AD-related tau pathology. This has the promise to allow mechanistic understanding of the emergence of both amyloid and tau abnormalities in AD.</p>
<p id="Par47">Our study shows direct evidence that nanomolar concentrations of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> preparations that include oligomers increase mRNA translation, particularly of specific transcripts that are predicted to be regulated by FMRP. The presence of unique candidates within both vehicle- and Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-treated groups suggests the regulation of translation by Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> is complex, as some mRNAs are preferentially translated or untranslated, while many mRNA transcripts are unaffected. Further analysis will be required to identify common elements of these transcripts, as well as association or localisation to distinct polyribosomal populations. Our data suggest evidence for a biphasic regulation of protein synthesis in AD. In earlier stages there could be an increase in translation of specific mRNA transcripts, eventually leading to deposition of particular proteins. In later stages of the disease global protein synthesis may be shunted as a compensatory response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Several lines of evidence suggest that prior to inducing neurotoxicity Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> can function as a beneficial agent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>, with its functions ranging from anti-microbial to enhancement of long-term potentiation and memory, akin to a neurotrophic factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. Our finding that nanomolar doses of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> enhance translation overall, via a pathway also modulated by the neurotrophin BDNF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>, lends support to this idea. As Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced signalling results in dissociation between eIF4E and both CYFIP1 and CYFIP2, it might regulate the translation of both CYFIP1 and 2-regulated mRNAs. However, the reduction of CYFIP2, but not CYFIP1, may act as a switch between reversible and irreversible processes, driving pathology.</p>
<p id="Par48">Given that our data suggest that CYFIP2 reduction by Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> can be blocked by Mnk1 inhibition, and CYFIP2 reduction results in age-dependent AD-like pathology in the mouse brain, we propose Mnk1 as a therapeutic target in AD. Our study finds tentative evidence that Mnk1 dysregulation may be associated with AD, and a previous report indicates excessive eIF4E phosphorylation in the AD brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The usefulness of Mnk inhibitors for the treatment of AD has already been noted, in part due to the role of these kinases in tau phosphorylation (patent no. WO2009065596A2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. Our study sheds further light on the involvement of Mnk1 in AD, highlighting novel therapeutic avenues. The compound used in this study is unstable in vivo; however, a different Mnk inhibitor such as eFT508 which is already in clinical trials for treatment of solid tumours and lymphomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> may be suitable.</p>
<p id="Par49">In conclusion, our study suggests that CYFIP2 reduction plays a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis and modelling its dysregulation will provide more physiological models of the disease. Our data also identify an upstream pathway which may be implicated in disease pathogenesis and can therefore be targeted for therapeutic intervention.</p>
