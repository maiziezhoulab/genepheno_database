<abstract>
<p>Organophosphates, such as chlorpyrifos (CPF), are widely used as insecticides in agriculture. CPF is known to induce cytotoxicity, including neurodevelopmental toxicity. However, the molecular mechanisms of CPF toxicity at early fetal stage have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we examined the mechanisms of CPF-induced cytotoxicity using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We found that exposure to CPF at micromolar levels decreased intracellular ATP levels. As CPF suppressed energy production that is a critical function of the mitochondria, we focused on the effects of CPF on mitochondrial dynamics. CPF induced mitochondrial fragmentation via reduction of mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) in iPSCs. In addition, CPF reduced the expression of several neural differentiation marker genes in iPSCs. Moreover, knockdown of <italic>Mfn1</italic> gene in iPSCs downregulated the expression of <italic>PAX6</italic>, a key transcription factor that regulates neurogenesis, suggesting that Mfn1 mediates neural induction in iPSCs. Taken together, these results suggest that CPF induces neurotoxicity via Mfn1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation in iPSCs. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction in iPSCs could be used as a possible marker for cytotoxic effects by chemicals.</p>

<p>Growing evidence suggests the involvement of environmental chemicals in neurodevelopmental toxicity, leading to neurobehavioral outcomes such as learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cognitive impairment, and autism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. As the fetal brain is inherently more susceptible to chemical-induced toxicity compared to the adult brain, exposure to neurotoxic chemicals during early prenatal period can cause delayed neural disorders at lower doses than in adults<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p>
<p>Organophosphates, such as chlorpyrifos (CPF), are well known to affect brain structure and neurodevelopmental outcome, resulting in delayed neural disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. In regard to this, previous studies using magnetic resonance imaging have shown that prenatal exposure to CPF caused abnormalities in the structure, size, and thickness of cerebral cortex, where was responsible for several higher-order brain functions such as attention, cognition, and emotion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Several reports indicate that CPF causes neurotoxicity in the developing brain of animals. In the developing brain of neonatal rats, CPF exposure impairs neurite outgrowth by inhibiting choline acetyltransferase activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Maternal exposure to CPF suppresses neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of rat offspring<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. In addition to <italic>in vivo</italic> effects, there has been reported the cytotoxic effects of micromolar CPF levels <italic>in vitro</italic>. For example, CPF inhibited mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> and induced apoptosis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> or human neural precursor cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. As micromolar CPF levels were detected in the blood of human newborns living in an agricultural community<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, the observations made using micromolar levels of CPF <italic>in vitro</italic> could potentially reflect the biological reactions in a living body. However, the effect of CPF on neurodevelopment has not been precisely elucidated.</p>
<p>Morphological changes of mitochondria are known to contribute to homeostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Under normal circumstances, mitochondria fuses together and forms excessive tubular networks (mitochondrial fusion). These fusion is regulated by fusion factors mitofusin 1 and 2 (Mfn1, Mfn2) and optic atrophy 1 (Opa1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In contrast, under stress conditions, mitochondrial networks convert into large numbers of small fragments with spherical and punctate morphology (mitochondrial fission), and are regulated by fission factors, such as fission protein 1 (Fis1) and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. This morphological dynamics contributes to the maintenance of mitochondrial functions, including energy generation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Moreover, several studies have shown the relationship between mitochondrial fragmentation and cellular and neurodevelopmental defects. For example, Mfn1 or Mfn2 knockout mice die in midgestation embryo, accompanying with developmental delay. In addition, embryonic fibroblasts from these knockout mice display distinct types of fragmented mitochondria, a phenotype due to a severe reduction in mitochondrial fusion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Thus, Mfn1 is considered to be functionally different from Mfn2. In support to this, Mfn1, not Mfn2, is reported to contribute to Opa1-mediated fusion of mitochondrial inner membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present study, we investigated the effect of CPF on neural differentiation using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as a model of human organ development. We focused on the effects of micromolar levels of CPF on mitochondrial dynamics, examining the molecular mechanisms of the process. Our results show that micromolar CPF levels inhibited ATP production through Mfn1 reduction, followed by mitochondrial fragmentation. Moreover, Mfn1-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction suppressed early neural induction by decreasing levels of <italic>PAX6</italic>, a key transcription factor that regulates neurogenesis. These data suggest that CPF-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity is based on impairment of mitochondrial functions in human iPSCs.</p>

<title>Effect of CPF on neural differentiation of iPSCs</title>
<p>To investigate whether CPF affects early neurodevelopment, we examined neural differentiation capability of iPSCs, which was induced by dual SMAD inhibition protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>). First, we determined the critical CPF concentration, affecting neural differentiation. At day 4 after neural induction with different concentrations of CPF, the expression of <italic>PAX6</italic>, an early neuroectodermal marker that regulates neurogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, was analyzed using real-time PCR. We found that exposure to 30 μM CPF significantly decreased <italic>PAX6</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Next, we performed time course experiments for expression of several neural differentiation markers at days 2, 4, 6, and 8 after exposure to 30 μM CPF. At day 9, almost all cells exposed by CPF (30 μM) were detached from the culture dish. Real-time PCR analysis revealed upregulated expression of <italic>PAX6</italic> by day 4, and <italic>FOXG1</italic>, a neuroectodermal marker that also regulates neurogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">D</xref>). Representative neural maturation marker <italic>NCAM1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> continuously increased, confirming that further neural differentiation occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>). In addition, CPF exposure reduced the expression of these neural induction markers by day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C–E</xref>). These data suggest that CPF has an inhibitory effect on early neural differentiation of iPSCs.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Mitochondrial function of iPSCs exposed to CPF</title>
<p>As neural differentiation process requires ATP as a source of energy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, we examined intracellular ATP content in iPSCs. Treatment with 30 μM CPF significantly reduced the ATP content of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We have previously shown that 0.1 μM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), which functions as a mitochondrial uncoupler<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, decreased ATP levels in iPSCs. Because CPF inhibited ATP production, we focused on several mitochondrial functions. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was decreased by exposure to 30 μM CPF for 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">C</xref>). As a positive control, exposure to 0.1 μM CCCP reduced MMP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1</xref>). In addition, CPF exposure increased the number of cells with fragmented mitochondria displaying punctate morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D</xref>) and decreased the number of cells exhibiting mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E</xref>). We have already confirmed that 0.1 μM CCCP also increased the occurrence of fragmented mitochondria. These results suggest that CPF induces mitochondrial dysfunction, including MMP depolarization and mitochondrial fragmentation, in iPSCs.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Expression of mitochondrial fission and fusion factors in iPSCs exposed to CPF</title>
<p>To examine the molecular mechanisms by which CPF induces mitochondrial fragmentation in iPSCs, we assessed the expression levels of mitochondrial fission (<italic>Fis1</italic> and <italic>Drp1</italic>) and fusion genes (<italic>Mfn1, Mfn2</italic>, and <italic>OPA1</italic>). Real-time PCR analysis showed that the gene expression of the factors was not altered after CPF exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Interestingly, western blot analysis revealed that CPF significantly decreased Mfn1 protein levels. In contrast, protein expression levels of other factors, including Mfn2, were not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">C</xref>). These data suggest that CPF-induced mitochondrial fragmentation is caused by reduction of Mfn1 protein levels.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Effects of CPF in iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells</title>
<p>To investigate whether the effects of CPF selectively occur in the early stage of neural differentiation in iPSCs, we used iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which were induced by dual SMAD inhibition protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1A</xref>). Treatment with 30 μM CPF had little effect on ATP content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1B</xref>). Similarly, exposure to 30 μM CPF had little effect on mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1C and D</xref>), which was confirmed by the fact that CPF did not alter the protein levels of mitochondrial fission and fusion factors containing Mfn1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1E</xref>). These data suggest that iPSCs, not NPCs, are sensitive to CPF exposure.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Effect of Mfn1 knockdown on neural induction of iPSCs</title>
<p>To further investigate the involvement of Mfn1 in the effects of CPF on neural induction, we performed knockdown (KD) of Mfn1, using lentivirus-delivered shRNAs. Real-time PCR analysis showed that KD was selective for <italic>Mfn1</italic>, not <italic>Mfn2</italic>, and that the efficiency was approximately 70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The KD effects were also confirmed by protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">C</xref>). The Mfn1 KD cells were used to perform neural induction. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that Mfn1 KD decreased the expression of <italic>PAX6</italic> (day 4), <italic>FOXG1</italic> (day 6) and <italic>NCAM1</italic> (day 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>). These data suggest that Mfn1 is involved in CPF-mediated negative effects on neural induction of iPSCs.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Negative regulation of neural induction by CPF exposure</title>
<p>A previous report indicates that ERK signaling inhibits neural induction via <italic>PAX6</italic> silencing in human embryonic stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. ERK has been reported to be activated after depletion of Mfn1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. We focused on ERK signaling in the effect of CPF on neural induction. We found that CPF exposure significantly increased basal ERK phosphorylation levels, which were abolished by treatment with the ERK inhibitor U0126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">B</xref>). To further study whether <italic>PAX6</italic> downregulation in CPF-exposed cells occurred through ERK signaling, we examined the effect of U0126 on <italic>PAX6</italic> expression. Incubation with U0126 recovered the expression levels of <italic>PAX6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). These data suggest that CPF activates ERK and prevents neural induction via <italic>PAX6</italic> downregulation.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Effect of Mfn1 knockdown on neural induction</title>
<p>To confirm the involvement of Mfn1 in the inhibition of neural induction by CPF, we used Mfn1 KD cells. Mfn1 KD significantly increased basal ERK phosphorylation levels that were abolished by treatment with the ERK inhibitor U0126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">B</xref>). To further study whether <italic>PAX6</italic> downregulation in Mfn1 KD cells occurred through ERK signaling, we examined the effect of U0126 on <italic>PAX6</italic> expression. Mfn1 KD decreased <italic>PAX6</italic> by 64% by in the vehicle-treated cells. In contrast, Mfn1 KD decreased <italic>PAX6</italic> by 30% in the U0126-treated cells. Thus, incubation with U0126 partially recovered the <italic>PAX6</italic> expression in the Mfn1 KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that Mfn1 reduction by CPF exposure activates ERK and prevents neural induction via <italic>PAX6</italic> downregulation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrated that exposure to micromolar CPF targeted mitochondrial quality control in human iPSCs. We showed that CPF induced Mfn1 reduction, thereby promoting mitochondrial fragmentation. These negative effects of CPF on mitochondrial quality control could suppress ATP production and neural differentiation. Based on the data observed in our study, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref> shows a proposed mechanism of CPF cytotoxicity via mitochondrial dysfunction.</p>
<p>Our studies showed that treatment with micromolar CPF levels caused mitochondrial dysfunction of human iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). We observed that iPSCs were sensitive to CPF exposure, unlike iPSC-derived NPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1</xref>). Previous reports support this difference in CPF sensitivity. The inhibitory effect of CPF on DNA synthesis in undifferentiated C6 glioma cells is found to be much higher than in differentiated cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies indicate that immature organisms are more susceptible to CPF-induced toxicity compared to adults due to lower levels of CPF metabolizing enzymes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Thus, the difference in CPF sensitivity between iPSCs and NPCs may be dependent on the maturation of CPF detoxification pathways. We are currently conducting experiments to determine the mechanism causing the differences in sensitivity to CPF.</p>
<p>We showed that CPF induced mitochondrial fragmentation via Mfn1 reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>). Consistent with this, our previous knockdown studies indicated that Mfn1 reduction was sufficient to promote mitochondrial dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. CPF-induced Mfn1 reduction might mediate mitochondrial fragmentation, decrease ATP levels, and inhibit iPSC growth. Although Mfn2 is also involved in mitochondrial fission and energy supply processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, our results indicated that CPF specifically targeted Mfn1, not Mfn2. Regarding this apparent CPF specificity, E3 ubiquitin ligase membrane-associated RING-CH 5 (MARCH5) has been reported to selectively bind to Mfn1 dependent on its acetylation, and degrade among all mitochondrial proteins, including Mfn2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In addition, we have reported that organotin compounds induced Mfn1 degradation through MARCH5, thereby promoting mitochondrial fragmentation in iPSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Thus, CPF may specifically target Mfn1 protein via MARCH5 in iPSCs without affecting mRNA levels. Furthermore, the difference in CPF sensitivity between iPSCs and NPCs may be dependent on Mfn1 and MARCH5 expression levels or MARCH5 activity. Further studies should determine whether CPF reduces Mfn1 via MARCH5-mediated degradation in iPSCs.</p>
<p>We demonstrated that ERK phosphorylation mediated the negative effects of CPF on early neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref>). A previous report indicates that Mfn1 directly binds Ras and Raf, resulting in the inhibition of Ras-Raf-ERK signaling by the biochemical analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Mfn1 reduction by CPF or shRNA may reverse this ERK signaling inhibition. Mobilization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores, including mitochondria was reported to result in phosphorylation of MAPKs, as the process was suppressed by chelation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in human T lymphoblastoid cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. As mitochondria are known to uptake into the matrix of any Ca<sup>2+</sup> that has accumulated in the cytosol, dependent on MMP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, mitochondrial dysfunction by CPF exposure may cause an overload of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, resulting in ERK activation. Moreover, ERK signaling was reported to inhibit neural induction by <italic>PAX6</italic> silencing via upregulation of stemness factors <italic>NANOG/OCT4</italic> and downregulation of homeobox transcription factor <italic>OTX2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. NANOG and OCT4 act as repressors of <italic>PAX6</italic> induction, whereas OTX2 is a positive inducer of <italic>PAX6</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Therefore, ERK signaling evoked by CPF could affect the expression of these transcriptional network, including <italic>NANOG, OCT4</italic> and <italic>OTX2, by</italic> regulating <italic>PAX6</italic>. In future studies, we should further investigate the mechanisms of CPF-induced negative regulation of neural induction via ERK.</p>
<p>We further demonstrated that Mfn1 reduction mediated cytotoxic effects of CPF on iPSCs via <italic>PAX6</italic> downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figs 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">6</xref>). <italic>FOXG1</italic> was downregulated, along with <italic>PAX6</italic>, during neural differentiation of iPSCs exposed to CPF. <italic>PAX6</italic> and <italic>FOXG1</italic> act as transcriptional regulators during forebrain development in vertebrates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Targeted disruption of <italic>PAX6</italic> and <italic>FOXG1</italic> in rodents led to the loss of anterior neural tissues, suggesting the central role of these genes in forebrain development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. CPF causes various defects in the development of hippocampus and cortex of rodents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Thus, CPF-induced defects of forebrain architecture may be caused by transcriptional silencing of anterior neural markers during early neurogenesis. As <italic>NCAM1</italic> was downregulated during neural differentiation of iPSCs exposed to CPF, further studies using NPCs are required to reveal how CPF affects neural maturation processes.</p>
<p>In summary, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism underlying cytotoxicity, including neurodevelopmental toxicity of CPF in iPSCs. Recently, significant progress has been made in the induction of differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into a variety of cell types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Further studies are needed to evaluate the developmental effects of CPF on various types of iPSC-derived cells. Moreover, we show that CPF toxicity is caused by Mfn1-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, which is involved in the cytotoxicity of organotin compounds<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Thus, mitochondrial functions influenced by Mfn1 might be a good starting point for investigating toxic mechanisms induced by exposure to other chemicals.</p>

The cells were seeded at a density of 7 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in TeSR-E8 medium on Matrigel-coated plates in order to reach nearly confluent within two days after seeding. The initial differentiation medium was knockout serum replacement (KSR) medium [Knockout DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing KSR (Thermo Fisher Scientific), L-glutamine, NEAA, 2-ME, PS] with SB431542 (TGFβ inhibitor, 10 μM) and LDN193189 (BMP inhibitor, 1 μg/ml). After 4 days, N2 medium [Neurobasal containing N2, B27, GlutaMAX, PS] was added to the KSR medium with LDN193189 every two days.</p>

<title>Measurement of intracellular ATP levels</title>
<p>Intracellular ATP content was measured using an ATP Determination Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the cells were washed and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS. The resulting cell lysates were added to a reaction mixture containing 0.5 mM D-luciferin, 1 mM DTT, and 1.25 μg/mL luciferase and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Luminescence was measured using a Fluoroskan Ascent FL microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The luminescence intensities were normalized to the total protein content.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Measurement of MMP</title>
<p>A Cell Meter JC-10 Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Assay Kit (AAT Bioquest, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was used to detect MMP. Briefly, the cells were suspended in staining buffer containing JC-10 and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. After the cells were treated with CPF, a FACS Aria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences) was used to measure the fluorescence intensity ratio, JC-aggregate (F-590)/JC-monomer (F-535).</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Assessment of mitochondrial fusion</title>
<p>After treatment with CPF (30 μM, 72 h), the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 50 nM MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and 5 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich). Changes in mitochondrial morphology were observed using a confocal laser microscope (Nikon A1). Images (n = 5) of random fields were taken, and the number of cells displaying mitochondrial fusion (&lt;10% punctiform) was determined in each image, as previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>.</p>

<title>Western blot analysis</title>
<p>Western blot analysis was performed as previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Briefly, the cells were lysed with Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling Technology). The proteins were then separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membranes were probed with anti-Drp1 monoclonal antibodies (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Fis1 polyclonal antibodies (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-Mfn1 polyclonal antibodies (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Mfn2 monoclonal antibodies (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Opa1 monoclonal antibodies (1:1000; BD Biosciences), anti-ERK1/2 polyclonal antibodies (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) monoclonal antibodies (1:2000; BD Biosciences), and anti-β-actin monoclonal antibodies (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich). The membranes were then incubated with secondary antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling Technology). The bands were visualized using an ECL Western Blotting Analysis System (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). Images were acquired using an LAS-3000 Imager (FUJIFILM, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
