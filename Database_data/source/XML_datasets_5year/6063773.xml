<p id="P1">Risk variants for schizophrenia affect more than 100 genomic loci, yet cell- and tissue-specific roles underlying disease liability remain poorly characterized. We have generated for two cortical areas implicated in psychosis, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, 157 reference maps from neuronal, neuronal-depleted and bulk tissue chromatin for two histone marks associated with active promoters and enhancers, H3-trimethyl-lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and H3-acetyl-lysine 27 (H3K27ac). Differences between neuronal and neuronal-depleted chromatin states were the major axis of variation in histone modification profiles followed by substantial variability across subjects and cortical areas. Thousands of significant histone quantitative trait loci (hQTLs) were identified in neuronal and neuronal-depleted samples. Risk variants for schizophrenia, depressive symptoms and neuroticism were significantly overrepresented in neuronal H3K4me3 and H3K27ac landscapes. Our PsychENCODE and CommonMind sponsored resource highlights the critical role of cell-type specific signatures at regulatory and disease-associated non-coding sequences in the human frontal lobe.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="P2">Recent progress in understanding the genetic basis of many psychiatric diseases has identified both rare and common variants responsible for genetic risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Integrating epigenomics data from disease-relevant cell types and tissues promises to enhance interpretation of these risk variants and the mechanisms by which they confer disease liability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. This includes the exploration of non-coding regulatory DNA, and its epigenetic variation in mediating the effects of genetic risk variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, the long-term goal of the PsychENCODE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and CommonMind<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> consortia is to generate a large-scale epigenomics resource for the human brain to serve as a foundation for integrative genomics in psychiatric research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. To this end, nucleosomal histone modifications contribute to genome organization and function, with various histone methylation and acetylation markings—including H3-trimethyl-lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and H3-acetyl-lysine 27 (H3K27ac)—considered key regulators for active promoters and enhancers and other <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory non-coding sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Importantly, molecular regulators for such types of open chromatin-associated histone modifications rank as top scoring biological pathways by genome-wide association in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, further underscoring the importance of fine mapping histone landscapes in brain. However, to date, only a few publically available histone datasets and resources exist for the human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, all of which were created from bulk tissue homogenate. These tissue homogenate-based resources have clearly contributed to a deeper understanding of the genetic risk architecture of common psychiatric disease. However, there is evidence that even in the context of normal cortical development and aging, vast portions of the neuronal genome show a very different histone modification landscape in comparison to the surrounding glia and other non-neuronal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, the degree to which cell type- and region-specific epigenomic signatures mediate the influence of genetic risk factors for psychiatric disease remains largely unexplored.</p>
<p id="P3">Here we present the largest dataset to date of open chromatin-associated histone modifications mapped separately in neurons versus the remaining neuron-depleted cell fraction from two higher order brain areas implicated in schizophrenia and other psychiatric diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Our publicly accessible resource, available at psychencode.org and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4566010">https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4566010</ext-link> includes data, results and UCSC browser visualizations for cell-type specific maps from N=129 samples, complemented with another N=28 maps from tissue homogenate from adult control subjects without known neurological or psychiatric disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). This epigenomics resource reveals hitherto unexplored insights into cell- and region-specific histone methylation and acetylation landscapes, including sites with extraordinarily high inter-individual variability. We elucidate the role of genetic regulation in influencing chromatin state and identify thousands of significant histone quantitative trait loci (hQTLs). We report striking enrichments of risk variants for schizophrenia, educational attainment, neuroticism and depressive symptoms highly specific to neuronal chromatin, thereby critically confirming cell type as a key variable in the neurogenomic architecture of psychiatric disease.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Samples and Sequencing</title>
<p id="P4">Nuclei were extracted from frozen-thawed gray matter collected from two frontal lobe areas implicated in higher order processing serving cognition and emotion: the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) at the superior frontal gyrus, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) positioned immediately dorso-anterior to the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel). ChIP-Seq from chromatin immunoprecipitates with anti-H3K4me3 and anti-H3K27ac antibodies followed by 100 base pair paired end sequencing was performed for neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei separately after NeuN neuronal marker immunotagging and fluorescence-activated sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel). NeuN, broadly expressed in the vast majority of cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> is a prototype neuronal marker in adult human cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. We herein refer to the NeuN<sup>+</sup> fraction as neuronal and the NeuN<sup>−</sup> fraction as ‘neuron-depleted’, while acknowledging that each of these two cell types is comprised of many different subpopulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Performing cell type-specific ChIP-Seq on 17 subjects (14 males and 3 females) × 2 brain regions, we generated N=129 cell-type specific (N=63 H3K4me3; N=66 H3K27ac), and N=28 tissue homogenate-based libraries from N=19 additional controls (N=11 H3K4me3, 4 female, 7 male; N=17 H3K27ac, 8 female, 9 male) passing ENCODE quality controls (&gt;10 million uniquely mapped reads, normalized strand coefficient (NSC) &gt; 1 and PCR bottleneck coefficient &gt; 0.8, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P5">For downstream analysis, we consolidated multiple ChIP-Seq datasets by cell type for each brain region and histone mark as 1) H3K4me3-PFC neuronal 2) H3K4me3-PFC neuron-depleted 3) H3K4me3-ACC neuronal 4) H3K4me3-ACC neuron-depleted and 5) H3K27ac-PFC neuronal 6) H3K27ac-PFC neuron-depleted 7) H3K27ac-ACC neuronal 8) H3K27ac-ACC neuron-depleted. Tissue homogenate samples for each histone mark were consolidated as 9) H3K4me3-PFC HBCC homogenate and 10) H3K27ac-PFC HBCC homogenate (although all our samples were acquired through the HBCC brain bank, the “HBCC” prefix was only used for the homogenate samples in order to distinguish them from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project tissue homogenates in our subsequent analysis.) <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref> shows the list of samples in each of the 10 consolidated datasets (see Methods for a detailed description of the consolidation steps). The average number of uniquely mapped and non-redundant reads for the consolidated datasets by cell-type and brain region ranged from 13–41 million for H3K4me3 and 23–125 million for H3K27ac, reflecting that H3K27ac samples were sequenced at twice the coverage depth due to their larger width (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). The subsequent steps of peak calling, read quantification of each peak, exploration of technical and biological covariates, differential modification analysis and functional annotation of peak sets (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref> for workflow diagram) were performed on each consolidated dataset. Across all individuals and both histone marks, ~50–70% of consolidated peaks in the cell type-specific data and ~20–40% in the tissue homogenate data had read coverage of at least 1 count per million (CPM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">In order to evaluate the specificity of our histone-modification maps, we compared the peak coordinates to published H3K4me3 and H3K27ac maps from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project (REP) covering 111 tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The maximum similarity (estimated based on Jaccard’s <italic>J</italic>) was found when our consolidated subset was compared to the REP brain tissues, while overlap with non-neural and peripheral REP tissues was lower (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). For both brain regions and epigenetic marks, our neuron-depleted samples which overwhelmingly are comprised of non-neuronal cells, had a higher similarity with REP brain samples than neuronal samples. Likewise, our NeuN<sup>−</sup> H3K27ac landscapes displayed a higher similarity with H3K27ac and also H3-acetyl-histone lysine 9 (H3K9ac) landscapes collected from bulk cortex tissue (homogenate) from independent brain cohorts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. These observations, taken together, likely reflect the fact that the majority of cells residing in cortical gray matter are indeed non-neuronal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4" sec-type="methods">
<title>Genome-wide analysis of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac peaks reveal cell type specificity</title>
<p id="P7">The cell type-specific peaksets (peaks called on consolidated datasets 1–8, above) varied by the fraction of the genome covered by peak regions, as well as by the degree of overlap with other subsets. As expected, the 61,000 – 95,000 narrow H3K4me3 peaks (range reflecting different cell types and cortical areas) covered a much smaller fraction of the genome than the 91,000 – 116,000 broader H3K27ac peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). For example, in PFC neurons, H3K4me3 peaks covered 82Mb (2.8%) of the genome, while H3K27ac covered 595Mb (19.8%) in the same subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B–E</xref>). Only minimal differences in the percentage of genomic coverage by H3K4me3 peaks (2.7–2.9%) was observed across cell types, whereas H3K27ac showed much higher genomic coverage for neuronal (19.8–20.4%) than neuron-depleted (15.5–16.9%) chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed distinct clusters of neuronal, neuron-depleted/non-neuronal and homogenate samples for both histone marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F,G</xref>
<italic>and</italic>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>), however, samples from the PFC and ACC clustered together (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>). This indicates a relatively high degree of epigenetic difference between neuronal and non-neuronal chromatin compared to a minimal difference between cortical areas. In contrast, chromatin from our PFC tissue homogenate samples and additional homogenate brain tissue from other sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, fall in between the FACS sorted cells along the first principal component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Notably, the HBCC homogenate PFC samples are much more similar to the non-neuronal component and the fraction of NeuN<sup>−</sup> nuclei in our tissue homogenates comprised, on average, 60–70% of the total population of (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>), which is consistent with the fact that non-neuronal cells out number neurons by 1.6–2:1 in the human frontal lobe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. To further explore this similarity of PFC homogenate with non-neuronal cells, we quantified and analyzed the non-overlapping regions of PFC neuronal, PFC neuron-depleted and PFC HBCC homogenate peaksets. PFC neuronal chromatin included vast amounts of H3K27ac (369Mb) and H3K4me3 (46Mb) peak sequences not shared with either neuron-depleted or tissue homogenate, while only 245Mb (H3K27ac) and 15Mb (H3K4me3) of peak sequences were unique to non-neuronal chromatin not shared with tissue chromatin extracts or neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Taken together, these characteristics illustrate a crucial advantage of cell-specific data over homogenate data. Functional enrichment of genes in close proximity to these non-overlapping modified peak regions using GREAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> indicated distinct biological functions by cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7A–F</xref>). Neuron-specific H3K4me3 and H3K27ac peaks were enriched for ion channels, neurotransmitter signaling and synaptic genes, while genome regions marked in neuron-depleted and tissue homogenate peak sets showed enrichment for broader, less defined categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">While this analysis has described large-scale trends, cell specificity of histone modification is readily visualized at the gene level. As representative examples, we consider <italic>CAMK2A</italic> and <italic>OLIG1</italic>, which are neuronal and non-neuronal specific genes, respectively <italic>(see</italic>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>).</p>
<p id="P10">Collectively, our findings affirm that the neuronal epigenomic landscape is distinct from both non-neuronal and tissue homogenate landscapes. Although our findings indicate that chromatin maps from homogenate may omit critical neuron-specific epigenomic signatures, they do however provide a better representation of non-neuronal chromatin. Indeed, analysis of published brain histone QTLs from H3K27ac profiles in cortical homogenate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> showed modest enrichment for overlap with our NeuN<sup>−</sup> H3K27ac peaks, but a depletion for overlap with our NeuN<sup>+</sup> H3K27ac peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>). This enrichment was highly specific as these hQTLs where depleted for overlap with H3K4me4 peaks. Moreover, analysis of another type of H3-acetyl mark (H3K9ac) from brain tissue homogenate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> showed only depletion for overlap with the two marks from neuronal and neuron-depleted chromatin in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>).</p>

<title>Neuronal histone modification landscapes show strong enrichment of schizophrenia GWAS loci</title>
<p id="P11">Due to the distinct histone modification landscapes between neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the frontal lobe, we wanted to better understand the role of cell- and region-specific epigenomic regulation associated with various psychiatric and non-psychiatric traits. To this end, we used the LD-score partitioned heritability method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> to examine the enrichment of common genetic variants identified by genome wide association studies (GWAS) within genomic regions with cell type-specific histone modifications. Altogether, 18 different types of brain and non-brain related diseases and conditions were included in these analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">The strongest enrichment was found for schizophrenia-associated loci; weaker (nonetheless significant) enrichments were found for the genetic architectures associated with education years, intelligence, neuroticism, depressive symptoms, body mass index (BMI), chronotype and sleep duration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S8 A,B</xref>). Strikingly, each of these enrichments were almost exclusively limited to the neuronal histone modification landscapes of the PFC and ACC, suggesting that the aforementioned GWAS datasets link disease-associated vulnerabilities specifically to neurons. Indeed, the neuron-specific enrichment for sequences implicated in schizophrenia risk were consistently more significant than the comparatively weaker enrichment for these risk sequences in the histone modification maps from brain tissue homogenate herein, as well as in published H3K27ac<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and H3K9ac<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> maps from brain tissue homogenate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>). For non-brain related traits such as height, coronary artery disease, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, we observed little enrichment for peaks from either neuronal and neuron-depleted chromatin. Furthermore, the strongest enrichment of brain related traits was identified in the non-overlapping peak regions of PFC neurons compared with the PFC HBCC homogenate peaksets, which further corroborates the association of GWAS loci of neuropsychiatric diseases with neuronal chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S8 C,D</xref>). Finally, LD-score regression coefficients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> from the enrichment analysis of schizophrenia were significantly larger in neuronal as compared to neuron-depleted chromatin and this effect was consistently observed for both histone marks in the two cortical regions, ACC and PFC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>). However, neither neuronal nor neuron-depleted PFC and ACC chromatin showed any significant overlap with Alzheimer’s disease associated variants, consistent with the hypothesis that Alzheimer’s disease risk variants are enriched for regulatory sequences within cells of myeloid origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup></p>

<title>Decomposing quantitative variation in histone modification into multiple components</title>
<p id="P13">Quantitative epigenetic variation could be attributed to biological variation across cell types, subjects, brain regions and sexes. In order to quantify the percentage of variation in histone modification in each peak region that is attributable to each of these four variables plus residual variation, we fit a linear mixed model using variancePartition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Since variance percentages sum to 100%, these values can be easily compared across variables, peak regions and histone marks. The variance percentages are easily interpretable visually: a peak region with high variation across cell types shows distinct levels of histone modification in neuronal versus neuron-depleted chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The genome-wide trend across all peak regions for each mark indicates that cell type is the strongest source of variation in histone modification, followed by subject (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). In contrast, variation across brain regions is very limited. Finally, as expected, variation across sexes was minimal genome-wide while exerting a strong effect on chrX and chrY linked genes. Thus, to further clarify the extent by which epigenomic differences between male and female frontal cortex are driven by histone peaks located on the sex chromosomes, we conducted principal component analysis of our 83 H3K27ac samples (11 female, 72 male) including cell-type specific and tissue homogenate datasets. Indeed, inclusion of regions on chrX and chrY resulted in strong sex-specific clustering on the 4<sup>th</sup> principal component while male and female brains completely intermixed when the analyses with repeated under exclusion of histone-tagged sequences specific to the X and Y chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">Finally, in order to interpret the peak regions with the highest variation across subjects, we computed the overlap of peak regions from the current dataset with regions that have genome-wide significant histone QTLs identified in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) and human brains for the H3K4me3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and H3K27ac<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> epigenetic marks, respectively. Indeed, peak regions with high variation across subjects were enriched for regions that are histone QTLs in LCLs and human brains for their respective histone mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). This is consistent with variation in histone modification across subjects being driven at least in part by genetic regulatory variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.

<title>Genetic regulation of histone modification in neuronal and neuronal depleted fractions</title>
<p id="P15">To examine whether there is cell type specific genetic regulation of histone modifications (as has been observed for gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> previously) we applied RASQUAL (Robust Allele-specific Quantitation and Quality Control), a QTL approach integrating allele-specific and between-subject differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Indeed, each of the 4 neuronal, neuron-depleted and bulk tissue chromatin preparations harbored thousands of histone quantitative trait loci (hQTLs), ranging from 6695 to 8042 for H3K27ac and 1565 to 3517 for H3K4me3 at FDR &lt; 0.05, depending on chromatin fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S9</xref>). Of note, H3K27ac-tagged chromatin showing unexpectedly strong enrichment for <italic>Gene Ontology GREAT biological processes</italic> such as <italic>neurofilament organization</italic>, <italic>regulation of synaptic plasticity</italic>, <italic>associative learning,</italic> catecholamine-dependent signaling and various other pathways highly relevant to the neurobiology of schizophrenia and other common psychiatric disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S13</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">Since hQTLs calling is slightly underpowered due to the small sample size (n=36), we took a simple approach of comparing our cell specific and bulk tissue hQTLs with data from genome wide association studies (GWAS) for schizophrenia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We took all associations with p &lt; 5 ×10<sup>−8</sup> that are in high LD (r<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.8) with the lead SNP and evaluated their overlap with our hQTLs. Comparisons across bulk tissue, neuronal and neuronal-depleted chromatin revealed strong cell type-specific effects for many of these risk-associated loci. For example, H3K4me3 peaks near MIR137 showed stronger hQTLs in neuronal samples than neuronal depleted and bulk tissue samples with localization of lead SNP rs1702294. H3K27ac peaks showed even stronger cell specific hQTL signal near the voltage-gated calcium channel CACNA1C in neuronal samples, whereas peaks for both histone marks near FURIN showed an hQTL single only in neuronal depleted samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S10A–J</xref>).</p>

<title>Epigenomic variation between ACC and PFC</title>
<p id="P17">Cell type is the major source of quantitative variation in histone modification, with 55,628 H3K4me3 and 117,708 H3K27ac peak regions epigenetically different across cell types at FDR 5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S14A</xref>). Unsurprisingly, for each histone mark, functional enrichment by gene categories was highly specific for cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, differences in histone modification between ACC and PFC were much smaller due to the similarity between the brain regions. Differential histone modification analysis between brain regions in neuronal cells identified 508 H3K4me3 and 10,797 H3K27ac peaks with increased modification in ACC, as well as 696 H3K4me3 and 10,665 H3K27ac peaks in PFC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S14B, S15A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S11, S12</xref>). Interestingly, there was minimal region-specific signal in neuron-depleted chromatin with only 27 H3K4me3 and 18 H3K27ac peaks with increased modification in ACC were identified, and none in PFC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S15D</xref>). These results indicate dramatically higher regional specificity for the population of neurons compared to their surrounding non-neuronal cells in the frontal lobe. It remains to be determined whether the differential histone acetylation landscapes in PFC vs. ACC neurons are reflective of differences in neurocognitive function between these cortical areas. For example, there is robust ACC activation with regard to reward processing, pain, affect and emotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In contrast, dorsolateral PFC is frequently implicated in the regulation of goal directed behavior including working memory and executive functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We note that multiple peak regions that are differentially modified between PFC and ACC neurons are proximal to neuropsychiatric risk genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S13, S14</xref>).

<title>Transcriptional signatures of promoter-bound histone methylation and acetylation</title>
<p id="P18">While histone peaks from neuronal and neuron-depleted chromatin were bound to promoters, introns and intergenic elements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S16</xref>), annotation of the H3K4me3 and H3K27ac peak sequences in the consolidated subsets revealed a large majority of sequences (70–79% of H3K4me3-tagged and 57–68% of H3K27ac-tagged) were bound to promoters within 5Kb of annotated transcription start sites (TSS). We therefore examined whether levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac modification are associated with gene expression magnitude in an independent set of post mortem brain samples from dorsolateral PFC from the CommonMind Consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. To this end, we calculated the number of ChIP-Seq reads aligned within 15kb of the annotated TSS of genes in 5 gene sets grouped by expression magnitude. As expected from findings in peripheral cells and tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, both H3K4me3 and H3K27ac ChIP-Seq reads were enriched around the TSS of genes with high levels of expression compared to genes with low levels of expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S17</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">In our final analyses, we examined the association of neuronal, neuron-depleted and homogenate chromatin landscape with gene expression magnitudes in multiple subtypes of neurons and glia recently identified by massively parallel profiling of single brain nuclei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Indeed, there were strong cell-type specific chromatin effects, with neuron-depleted chromatin showing strong enrichment for oligodendrocyte- and astrocyte-specific transcripts while, conversely, neuronal chromatin profiles were stronger associated with transcripts of the various types of neurons as compared to glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, these enrichments showed no cell type specificity for chromatin fractions prepared from tissue homogenate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P20">Interpreting the functional consequences of recently identified genetic variants contributing to the risk of neuropsychiatric disease requires a deeper understanding of the epigenomic context of these variants in brain and other tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. We built the largest dataset of cell type specific reference maps for NeuN<sup>+</sup> neuronal and NeuN<sup>−</sup> (overwhelmingly non-neuronal) histone modification landscapes for H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, which are typically associated with active promoter and enhancer regions, respectively. Importantly, non-neuronal chromatin showed a high degree of concordance with epigenomic landscapes of cortical homogenates from multiple sources. In contrast, histone methylation and acetylation landscapes form ACC and PFC neurons showed considerable ‘epigenomic distance’ to neuron-depleted and tissue homogenate samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F,G</xref>, <italic>S5A</italic>) suggesting they are likely a poor surrogate for neuron-specific alterations in the context of cognitive function and neurological disease. Given that the differences between neuronal and non-neuronal H3K4me3 and H3K27ac landscapes are the major axis of epigenomic variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), it will be essential for future studies to pursue additional sample fractionation by cell type, in order to capture the estimated 16 neuronal populations defined by single cell RNA sequencing in human cerebral cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> and potentially similar degrees of heterogeneity in glia as recently reported for mouse brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Such a higher resolution approach is expected to reveal vast numbers of genomic loci with an epigenomic signature unique to a specific type of neuron or glia, and provide deeper insight into the interrelation of transcriptome and histone modification landscapes. We also note the unexpectedly large quantitative H3K27ac differences between cell types, with a much larger genome coverage (20%) in neuronal chromatin decorated by histone acetylation versus only 15–16% genome coverage in neuron-depleted chromatin. The extended H3K27ac coverage broadly included intronic and intergenic sequences in addition to many promoter-bound peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S12</xref>). While the functional implications of the extended H3K27ac peak coverage in the neuronal genome remains to be explored, we note that drugs interfering with the regulation of histone acetylation, including histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and suppressors of histone-acetyl-reader proteins, show a surprisingly broad therapeutic profile, improving cognition and neuronal function in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disease models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Furthermore, consistent with previous gene expression profiles in adult frontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, the transcriptional histone marks of the present study, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, showed few sex-specific histone methylation and acetylation differences in the autosomal genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11</xref>). However, previous DNA methylation profiling in cortical tissue homogenate from elderly brains revealed sex-specific effects for approximately 10% of age-sensitive methyl-CpG marks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Presently, it is not known whether sex-specific regulation of histone modifications is increased in aged brain.</p>
<p id="P21">One primary goal of the PsychENCODE Consortium is to explore regulatory non-coding DNA associated within the genetic risk architectures of common neuropsychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Using linkage disequilibrium-score regression to partition heritability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, we found strong, specific enrichments for schizophrenia, and somewhat weaker association with depression, neuroticism and education attainment in both H3K4me3 and H3K27ac peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This effect is primarily if not exclusively driven by neuronal chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <italic>S8</italic>), with minimal or no contribution from neuron-depleted chromatin. Intriguingly, the strongest association with brain region specific peaks identifies risk variants for schizophrenia and educational attainment specifically in PFC neurons, consistent with the key role of the PFC in executive function Taken together, these findings underscore the importance of ‘epigenomic fine mapping’ with maximal region- and cell-type specific resolution for the human brain, in order to link the genetic risk architectures of neuropsychiatric disorders to selected cell populations or neural circuits.</p>

<p>Data on coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction have been contributed by CARDIoGRAMplusC4D investigator. We additionally thank the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP) for providing summary results data for these analyses. The investigators within IGAP contributed to the design and implementation of IGAP and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report. IGAP was made possible by the generous participation of the control subjects, the patients, and their families. The i–Select chips was funded by the French National Foundation on Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders. EADI was supported by the LABEX (laboratory of excellence program investment for the future) DISTALZ grant, Inserm, Institut Pasteur de Lille, Université de Lille 2 and the Lille University Hospital. GERAD was supported by the Medical Research Council (Grant no. 503480), Alzheimer’s Research UK (Grant no. 503176), the Wellcome Trust (Grant no. 082604/2/07/Z) and German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF): Competence Network Dementia (CND) grant no. 01GI0102, 01GI0711, 01GI0420. CHARGE was partly supported by the NIH/NIA grant R01 AG033193 and the NIA AG081220 and AGES contract N01–AG–12100, the NHLBI grant R01 HL105756, the Icelandic Heart Association, and the Erasmus Medical Center and Erasmus University. ADGC was supported by the NIH/NIA grants: U01 AG032984, U24 AG021886, U01 AG016976, and the Alzheimer’s Association grant ADGC–10–196728.</p>

<title>Enrichment of heritability for brain and non-brain related phenotypes within cell- and tissue-specific histone peaks</title>
<p>Using LD-score regression to partitioned heritability, we tested if the genetic variants contributing to 18 brain and non-brain-related phenotypes were enriched for (A) H3K4me3 and (B) H3K27ac. In (A), heritability enrichment analysis was preformed on multiple sets of genome regions that are visualized in 3 blocks. (1) Regions marked in blue and golden show enrichment values from PFC neuronal: 63,642 (105,075) peaks, ACC neuronal: 61,043 (116,714) and PFC neuronal-depleted: 95,501 (91,037) peaks, ACC-neuronal-depleted: 87,292 (101,885) from consolidated H3K4me3 (H3K27ac) datasets. (2) Regions marked in black show enrichment value of PFC tissue from our dataset: 158,345(183,885) peaks and PFC tissue: 75,912(317,582) peaks, ACC tissue: 79,844(260,288) peaks from the Roadmap Epigenomics project for H3K4me3(H3K27ac) marks. (3) Regions showing statistically significant differential histone modification either between the two cell types or two brain regions. Results for peaks that show increased histone modification in neurons: 28,838(59,588) peaks or non-neurons: 31,790(58,120) peaks from H3K4me3(H3K27ac) marks are indicated in blue and gold, respectively. Results for peaks that show increased histone modification in PFC: 696(10,665) peaks or ACC: 508(10,797) peaks from H3K4me3(H3K27ac) are indicated in purple and green, respectively. (B) Layout is the same as in (A) except that enrichment of 56,503 peaks from PFC tissue from Sun, et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and 26,384 peaks from Ng et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> were added.
