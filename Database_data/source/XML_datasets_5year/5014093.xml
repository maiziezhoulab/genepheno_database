<abstract>
<sec id="S1">
<title>Importance</title>
<p id="P1">At least 11 rare copy number variants (CNVs) have been shown to be
major risk factors for schizophrenia (SZ). These CNVs also increase the risk
for other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as intellectual disability. It
is possible that additional intellectual disability–associated CNVs
increase the risk for SZ but have not yet been implicated in SZ because of
previous studies being underpowered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Objective</title>
<p id="P2">To examine whether additional CNVs implicated in intellectual
disability represent novel SZ risk loci.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Design, Setting, and Participants</title>
<p id="P3">We used single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data to evaluate a
set of 51 CNVs implicated in intellectual disability (excluding the known SZ
loci) in a large data set of patients with SZ and healthy persons serving as
controls recruited in a variety of settings. We analyzed a new sample of
6934 individuals with SZ and 8751 controls and combined those data with
previously published large data sets for a total of 20 403 cases of SZ and
26 628 controls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Main Outcomes and Measures</title>
<p id="P4">Burden analysis of CNVs implicated in intellectual disability
(excluding known SZ CNVs) for association with SZ. Association of individual
intellectual disability CNV loci with SZ.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Results</title>
<p id="P5">Of data on the 20 403 cases (6151 [30.15%] female) and 26 628
controls (14 252 [53.52%] female), 51 intellectual disability CNVs were
analyzed. Collectively, intellectual disability CNVs were significantly
enriched for SZ (<italic>P</italic> = 1.0 × 10<sup>−6</sup>;
odds ratio [OR], 1.9 [95% CI, 1.46-2.49]). Of the 51 CNVs tested, 19 (37%)
were more common in SZ cases; only 4 (8%) were more common in controls (no
observations were made for the remaining 28 [55%] loci). One novel locus,
deletion at 16p12.1, was significantly associated with SZ after correction
for multiple testing (rate in SZ, 33 [0.16%]; rate in controls, 12 [0.05%];
corrected <italic>P</italic> = .017; OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.61-7.05), and 2 loci
reached nominal levels of significance (deletions at 2q11.2: 6 [0.03%] vs 1
[0.004%]; OR, 9.3; 95% CI, 1.03-447.76; corrected <italic>P</italic>
&gt; .99; and duplications at 10q11.21q11.23: 5 [0.2%] vs 0 [0.03%]; OR,
infinity; 95% CI, 1.26-infinity; corrected <italic>P</italic> = .71). Our
new data set also provided independent support for the 11 SZ risk loci
previously reported to be associated with the disorder and for the
protective effect of 22q11.2 duplication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Conclusions and Relevance</title>
<p id="P6">A large proportion of CNV loci implicated in intellectual disability
are risk factors for SZ, but the available sample size precludes statistical
confirmation for additional individual loci.</p>
