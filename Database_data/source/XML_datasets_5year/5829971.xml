<p>AAV-mediated CRISPR screens empower autochthonous functional cancer genomics in the mouse liver.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Cancer genomics consortia have charted the landscapes of numerous human cancers. Whereas some mutations were found in classical oncogenes and tumor suppressors, others have not yet been functionally studied in vivo. To date, a comprehensive assessment of how these genes influence oncogenesis is lacking. We performed direct high-throughput in vivo mapping of functional variants in an autochthonous mouse model of cancer. Using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) carrying a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) library targeting putative tumor suppressor genes significantly mutated in human cancers, we directly pool-mutagenized the livers of Cre-inducible CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)–associated protein 9 (Cas9) mice. All mice that received the AAV-mTSG library developed liver cancer and died within 4 months. We used molecular inversion probe sequencing of the sgRNA target sites to chart the mutational landscape of these tumors, revealing the functional consequence of multiple variants in driving liver tumorigenesis in immunocompetent mice. AAV-mediated autochthonous CRISPR screens provide a powerful means for mapping a provisional functional cancer genome atlas of tumor suppressors in vivo.</p>

<body><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Large-scale molecular profiling of patient samples has tremendously improved our understanding of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>). The multidimensional landscapes produced by international consortia such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), encompassing key data sets such as somatic mutations, copy number variants, epigenetic marks, mRNA and microRNA transcriptomes, as well as protein levels, have illuminated the molecular underpinnings of cancer at an unprecedented resolution and scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>). Consequently, we now have an extensive catalog of genes that are recurrently mutated across different patients, both within and across histological subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>). Whereas some of these recurrently mutated genes (RMGs) are well-known tumor suppressors or oncogenes, many other RMGs still have an unclear role in cancer. Although the identification of RMGs is an important first step toward the development of new therapeutic avenues, functional evidence is required to definitively determine which genomic alterations are essential for the growth of an individual cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>). A number of statistical algorithms, which aim to distinguish RMGs that are “drivers” of cancer growth from those that are mere “passengers,” have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>). These RMGs are represented by thousands of mutant variants; however, the functional roles of many of these mutants remain to be explicitly tested in controlled experimental settings.</p><p>Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) have been instrumental for studying the mechanisms of oncogenes and tumor suppressors in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>). Conditional or germline knockout alleles enable in vivo modeling of diverse diseases, including a wide variety of cancer types. Because the microenvironment is increasingly recognized to have a critical influence on cancer progression, GEMMs enable autochthonous modeling of cancer, that is, in the native tissue of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>), which provides a higher degree of precision for cancer modeling and preclinical testing. However, the production of GEMMs is time-consuming and requires a complex multistep process, involving embryonic stem cell modifications, the generation of chimeras, germline transmission, and mouse colony expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>). Owing to the technical difficulties of this process and the complexity of breeding with large numbers of genetic modifications, GEMMs have largely been limited to the study of only a handful of genes at a time. Thus, a systematic characterization of the hundreds of RMGs identified through tumor sequencing studies is impractical using regular GEMMs.</p><p>One promising approach for high-throughput assessment of cancer RMGs is through the use of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–mediated genome engineering in mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>). Hydrodynamic injection of plasmids encoding single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>) has been used to directly mutate several tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in the mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><italic>25</italic></xref>). Viruses have also been used to generate loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutations in tumor suppressors and oncogenes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><italic>30</italic></xref>). In addition, the CRISPR system has been used to perform genome-scale knockout screens in vitro and in transplant models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><italic>31</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34"><italic>34</italic></xref>). However, current screens rely on the sequencing of sgRNAs, which is an indirect measurement of the selective forces acting on specific gene perturbations.</p><p>To directly interrogate the comparative selective advantage of mutants in the tumor-initiating organs, it is necessary to first generate and then subsequently sequence pools of mutant cells within the native tumor environment. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are powerful carriers of transgenes and have been shown to mediate efficient genome editing in various organs in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><italic>29</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35"><italic>35</italic></xref>). Given that AAVs can efficiently infect the liver after intravenous injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36"><italic>36</italic></xref>), we reasoned that liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC; also known as HCC), a deadly cancer with poor 5-year survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37"><italic>37</italic></xref>), would be a suitable and relevant model.</p><p>Here, we directly mapped functional cancer genome variants of tumor suppressors in the autochthonous mouse liver using massively parallel CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. We performed a direct in vivo CRISPR screen by intravenously injecting AAV pools carrying a library of 278 sgRNAs that target a set of the most frequently mutated, known, or putative TSGs into <italic>Rosa-LSL-Cas9-EGFP</italic> knock-in mice (LSL-Cas9 mice) to generate highly complex autochthonous liver tumors, followed by direct readout of the Cas9-generated variants at predicted sgRNA cut sites using molecular inversion probe (MIP) sequencing. This combination of direct mutagenesis and pooled variant readout illuminated the mutational landscape of the tumors. Mutagenesis of individual or combinations of the top genes represented by high-frequency variants led to liver tumorigenesis in fully immunocompetent mice.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>We first sought to compile a list of the top RMGs in the pan-cancer TCGA data sets. Applying a similar approach, as in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>), we identified the top 50 RMGs after excluding known oncogenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Of the top 50 putative TSGs, 49 genes had mouse orthologs (mouse TSGs, hereafter referred to as mTSG). We also selected seven housekeeping genes to serve as controls. Then, we designed a library of sgRNAs targeting these 56 different genes, with 5 sgRNAs for each gene, totaling 280 sgRNAs (hereafter referred to as the mTSG library; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and table S1). For <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> and <italic>Rpl22</italic>, only four unique sgRNAs were synthesized, with the fifth sgRNA being a duplicate. The duplicates were treated as identical in downstream analyses. After oligo synthesis, we cloned the mTSG library into a base vector containing a U6 promoter driving the expression of the sgRNA cassette, as well as a Cre expression cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Because mutation of a single TSG rarely leads to rapid tumorigenesis in humans or autochthonous mouse models, we included an sgRNA targeting <italic>Trp53</italic> in the base vector with the initial hypothesis that concomitant <italic>Trp53</italic> loss of function might facilitate tumorigenesis. Sequencing of the plasmid pool revealed a complete coverage of the 278 unique sgRNAs represented in the mTSG library (table S2). After generating AAVs (serotype AAV9) containing the base vector or the mTSG library, we then intravenously injected phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), vector AAVs, or mTSG AAVs into fully immunocompetent LSL-Cas9 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Upon AAV infection, Cre is expressed and excises the stop codon, activating Cas9 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>AAV-CRISPR mTSG library rapidly induces robust liver tumorigenesis in LSL-Cas9 mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of the overall design and experimental outline. First, the top MGs were identified from pan-cancer TCGA data sets. After removing known oncogenes and genes without mouse orthologs, a set of 49 most recurrently mutated putative TSGs were chosen (mTSG). Seven additional genes with housekeeping functions were spiked-in, leading to a final set of 56 genes. sgRNAs targeting these genes were then identified computationally, and five were chosen for each gene. Two hundred eighty sgRNAs plus 8 NTC sgRNAs were synthesized, and the sgRNA library (mTSG; 288 sgRNAs) was cloned into an expression vector that also contained Cre recombinase and a <italic>Trp53</italic> sgRNA. AAVs carrying the mTSG library were produced and injected into the tail veins of LSL-Cas9 mice. After a specified time period, the mice were subjected to MRI, histology, and MIP capture sequencing for readout and deep variant analysis of molecular landscape of all targeted genes and mutations.

No mTSG-treated mice survived longer than 4 months after treatment, whereas all PBS- and vector-treated animals survived the duration of the experiment. Statistical significance was assessed by the log-rank test (<italic>P</italic> = 1.8 × 10<sup>−11</sup>).

S1, A and B; and table S3). The total tumor volume in each mouse was significantly larger in mTSG samples compared to PBS and vector samples (one-sided Mann-Whitney test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0286 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.0286, respectively; fig. S1B). These data suggest that the AAV-CRISPR mTSG library is sufficient to induce rapid tumorigenesis in the livers of LSL-Cas9 transgenic mice.</p><p>Mice that received the AAV-CRISPR mTSG library (<italic>n</italic> = 27) did not survive more than 4 months (median survival, 90 days; 95% confidence interval, 84 to 90 days), whereas mice that were treated with PBS (<italic>n</italic> = 10) or vector control (<italic>n</italic> = 11) all survived the duration of the experiment (log-rank test, <italic>P</italic> = 1.8 × 10<sup>−11</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and table S4). By gross examination under a fluorescent dissecting scope, detectable GFP<sup>+</sup> nodules were observed in mTSG-treated livers but not in PBS or vector samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref> and fig. S2). Notably, in mTSG-treated mice, we occasionally observed tumors that were not primarily located in the liver. Chief among these were several big abdominal tumors (BATs; <italic>n</italic> = 6), as well as a few sarcomas (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and ear tumors (<italic>n</italic> = 2), although BATs were later found to be of liver origin on the basis of histological analysis.</p><p>We analyzed endpoint histological sections from PBS-treated (<italic>n</italic> = 7), vector-treated (<italic>n</italic> = 5), and mTSG-treated mice (<italic>n</italic> = 13), sacrificed 3 to 4 months after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and figs. S3 and S4). No tumors were found in PBS-treated mice, whereas rare small tumors were found in vector-treated mice (total tumor area = 5.96 ± 3.27 mm<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Consistent with the MRI results, mice that received the mTSG library had significantly larger liver tumors, with the pathology of LIHC (total tumor area = 100.6 ± 47.19 mm<sup>2</sup>; one-sided Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.027 compared to PBS and <italic>P</italic> = 0.034 compared to vector; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, A and B, and table S5). Because these mice were found to have multiple liver tumors, we also compared the size of each individual tumor across the three treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The mTSG-treated mice collectively had tumors that were significantly larger (26.69 ± 6.18 mm<sup>2</sup>) than those found in vector-treated animals (3.31 ± 1.55 mm<sup>2</sup>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0003), although the latter were too small to be detected by gross examination under a GFP dissecting scope. We assessed the proliferation of liver samples from PBS-, vector-, and mTSG-treated mice by Ki67 expression and found that rapid proliferation was restricted to tumor cells (fig. S4B). In addition, we found that the tumors in mTSG-treated mice, but not in vector-treated mice, were largely positive for AE1/AE3 (pan-cytokeratin), which is a marker of LIHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref> and fig. S4C). These data collectively indicate that the AAV-CRISPR mTSG library directly promotes aggressive liver tumorigenesis in otherwise wild-type LSL-Cas9 mice.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Histology analysis of autochthonous tumors generated by AAV-CRISPR mTSG library.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of liver sections from mice treated with PBS (<italic>n</italic> = 7), vector (<italic>n</italic> = 5), or mTSG library (<italic>n</italic> = 13).

As opposed to simply sequencing the sgRNA cassettes to find the relative enrichment of each sgRNA within the cell population, MIP capture sequencing enables a direct quantitative analysis of the mutations induced by the Cas9-sgRNA complex. To generate this pool of MIPs (termed mTSG-MIPs; table S6), we synthesized a total of 266 extension and ligation probes targeting 266 genomic loci with an average size of 158 ± 8 (SEM) bp, covering 278 unique sgRNA sites. Liver genomic DNA was extracted from PBS-treated (<italic>n</italic> = 8 mice), vector-treated (<italic>n</italic> = 8 mice), and mTSG-treated mice (<italic>n</italic> = 27 mice; 37 liver lobes in total). To assess the potential for AAV-CRISPR–mediated mutagenesis of other organs, we also collected DNA from all observed non-liver tumors (<italic>n</italic> = 23), as well as a wide variety of tissues (such as brain, lung, colon, spleen, and kidney) without detectable tumors under a fluorescent dissecting scope (<italic>n</italic> = 57 samples) from all three groups. We performed MIP capture sequencing on all genomic DNA samples (total <italic>n</italic> = 133; table S7). Sequencing depth of the sgRNA target regions was sufficiently powerful to detect variants at &lt;0.01% frequency, with a mean read depth of 13,286 ± 1033 (SEM) across all MIPs after mapping to the mouse genome (table S8). Median read depth across all MIPs approximated a log-normal distribution, indicating relatively even capture of the target loci (fig. S5A). Insertions and deletions (indels) were then called across all samples to reveal detectable indel variants at each sgRNA cut site (Materials and Methods; table S9). We excluded single-nucleotide variants from the analysis because indels are the dominant variants generated by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) following Cas9-mediated double-strand breaks (DSBs) in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>). For downstream analysis, we only considered indels that overlapped the ±3-bp flanks around each of the predicted sgRNA cut sites because Cas9 tends to create DSBs within a tight window near the predicted sgRNA cut site in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>).

The low background variant frequencies observed in vector- and PBS-treated samples may be due to noise that was generated during sequencing, as well as stochastic or germline mutations.

Because we were most interested in analyzing dominant clones that had undergone strong positive selection in the tumor, we further required that at least 5% of the reads must have an indel in that region to call an MS (table S11). Different mTSG-treated liver samples presented with highly heterogeneous mutational signatures, indicating that a diverse array of mutations had undergone positive selection in different samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref> and fig.

Of the 37 mTSG-treated liver samples, 33 (89%) were found to have major indels (≥5% sum variant frequency and FDR &lt; 0.0625; Materials and Methods) in one or more of the 56 genes in the mTSG library (average number of MGs per sample, 11.7 ± 1.53). <italic>Trp53</italic>, <italic>Setd2</italic>, <italic>Cic</italic>, and <italic>Pik3r1</italic> were the top MGs in the cohort (mutated in 24 of 37, 18 of 37, 17 of 37, and 17 of 37 samples, respectively). <italic>Trp53</italic> is a well-known tumor suppressor that has been found to directly induce liver tumors upon loss of function in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><italic>40</italic></xref>); <italic>Setd2</italic> is an epigenetic modifier that has been implicated in clear cell renal carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"><italic>41</italic></xref>) but is not yet functionally characterized in liver cancer; <italic>Cic</italic> is a transcriptional repressor that has been shown to be a negative regulator of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42"><italic>42</italic></xref>); <italic>Pik3r1</italic> is a modulator of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, and loss-of-function mutations of this gene have been found to induce liver tumorigenesis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43"><italic>43</italic></xref>). In terms of cellular pathways, epigenetic modifiers and cell death/cell cycle regulators were frequently mutated, with multiple genes that were mutated in more than 20% of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).

Because the variant frequency is a metric for the positive selection that acts on a given mutation, genes whose variant frequencies are highly correlated across samples could also be synergistic in driving tumorigenesis. A caveat is that some passenger mutations could be hitchhiking on strong drivers within a given tumor; however, the probability of finding a co-occurring passenger-driver mutation pair is vanishingly small across increasing numbers of mice. We calculated the total variant frequency for each gene by summing all the values from all five sgRNAs, used these summed gene-level variant frequencies across each sample to calculate the Spearman correlation between all 1540 possible gene pairs, and assessed whether the correlations were statistically significant (Materials and Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref> and table S14).

Across all 37 mTSG-treated liver samples, we identified 593 unique variants that had a variant frequency of ≥1% in at least one sample (table S15). The majority of these variants (80.94%) were deletions rather than insertions (table S15). Hierarchical clustering of the variant-level data across all mTSG-treated liver samples revealed the existence of sample-specific variants: 70.15% (416 of 593) of the variants were sample-specific (private variants), whereas 29.85% (177 of 593) of the variants were found across multiple samples (shared variants; fig. S9). Shared variants could originate from convergent processes of NHEJ following Cas9/sgRNA-mediated DSBs, leading to the same indel pattern. Alternatively, shared variants in different liver lobes from the same mouse could also arise from clonal expansion or metastasis.</p><p>To deepen our understanding of the clonal architecture in this genetically complex, highly heterogeneous yet fully gene-targeted autochthonous tumor model, we focused on a single mTSG-treated mouse that had presented with multiple visible tumors in several liver lobes, five of which had been harvested for MIP capture sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Analysis of the sgRNA-level variant frequencies in the five lobes revealed strong pairwise correlations between multiple lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref> and table S16). For instance, lobes 3 and 5 were significantly correlated [Spearman rank correlation (<italic>R</italic>) = 0.700, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>]. Lobes 2 and 4 were also significantly correlated, though to a lesser extent (<italic>R</italic> = 0.207, <italic>P</italic> = 5.08 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). Furthermore, lobes 1, 2, and 4 were also significantly correlated with lobe 5 (<italic>R</italic> = 0.248, <italic>P</italic> = 2.99 × 10<sup>−5</sup>; <italic>R</italic> = 0.146, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0146; and <italic>R</italic> = 0.243, <italic>P</italic> = 4.31 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, respectively).

Cluster 8 was found in four of five lobes and is characterized by mutations in <italic>Mll3</italic>, <italic>Setd2</italic>, and <italic>Trp53</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="aao5508-F6"></graphic></fig><p>To delineate any potential clonal mixtures among the five lobes, we next examined the unique variant patterns across these samples. We identified 178 unique variants (≥1% variant frequency threshold) represented within the five liver lobes (table S17). Using binary variant calls (that is, whether a given variant is present or absent in a sample), we clustered these 178 variants into eight groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref> and table S17). Variants in clusters 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 were specific to a single lobe (private variant clusters), whereas variants in clusters 4, 7, and 8 were present across multiple lobes (shared variant clusters). By averaging the variant frequencies within each cluster for a given sample, we then analyzed the relative contribution of each cluster to the overall composition of the five lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, D and E). The degree of correlation between lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>) is echoed by their degree of variant cluster sharing (lobe 1 shares cluster 4 with lobe 5, lobes 2 and 4 share variant cluster 8 with lobe 5, and lobe 3 shares clusters 7 and 8 with lobe 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, D and E). The presence of cluster 8 in four of five lobes is especially notable, because it comprised a large percentage of the mutational burden in these four lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, D and E). Cluster 8 was defined by mutations in <italic>Mll3</italic> (also known as <italic>Kmt2c</italic>), <italic>Setd2</italic>, and <italic>Trp53</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). Variant-level analyses therefore recaptured the pairwise correlations identified on the sgRNA level, suggesting clonal mixture between individual liver lobes within a single mouse.</p><p>We individually tested the functional roles of mutations in several of the top genes in a <italic>Trp53</italic>-sensitized background. We chose gene pairs based on their ranking in the screen, potential biological function, and literature. We generated an AAV vector for liver-specific CRISPR knockout that expressed Cre recombinase under a <italic>TBG</italic> promoter, together with a <italic>Trp53</italic>-targeting sgRNA cassette and an open (GeneX-targeting) sgRNA cassette (fig. S10A). The vector also contained a firefly luciferase gene (FLuc) co-cistronic with Cre under the <italic>TBG</italic> promoter for live imaging of tumorigenesis in mice. We cloned either a nontargeting control (NTC) sgRNA (thus only mutating <italic>Trp53</italic>) or a top candidate GeneX-targeting sgRNA (GTS; thus mutating both <italic>GeneX</italic> and <italic>Trp53</italic>) into the second sgRNA expression cassette. After AAV packaging, we injected NTC + Trp53 or GTS + Trp53 AAVs into LSL-Cas9 mice (fig. S10A). We assessed the growth of potential liver tumors by monitoring their luciferase activities using a bioluminescent in vivo imaging system (IVIS; fig. S10B). Compared to mice treated with NTC AAVs (<italic>n</italic> = 8), sgRNAs targeting multiple candidates identified in the screen, including <italic>Cic</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 4), <italic>Pik3r1</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 7), <italic>Pten</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 4), <italic>Stk11</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 8), <italic>Arid2</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 3), and <italic>Kdm5c</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 3), had significantly stronger luciferase activity (two-sided unpaired <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 for all groups; fig. S10, B to D), suggesting that knocking out these genes accelerated liver tumorigenesis at high penetrance in a <italic>Trp53</italic>-sensitized background. Double knockouts such as <italic>Pik3r1</italic> + <italic>Pten</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 3) and <italic>Arid2</italic> + <italic>Kdm5c</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 4) also had significantly stronger luciferase activity compared to NTC (two-sided unpaired <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001) but not significant compared to respective single knockouts (fig. S10, C and D), suggesting that these genes are strong drivers alone but do not have synergistic effect with each other. <italic>B2m</italic> + <italic>Kansl1</italic> is one of the top co-occurring gene pairs identified in the screen (co-occurrence rate = 11/18 = 61%, <italic>P</italic> = 3.6 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). Whereas LSL-Cas9 mice injected with AAVs for individual knockout of <italic>B2m</italic> or <italic>Kansl1</italic> alone did not show significantly stronger luminescence intensities compared to the NTC group, AAVs targeting the <italic>B2m</italic> + <italic>Kansl1</italic> combination showed significantly higher luminescence intensities as compared to NTC (two-sided unpaired <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), <italic>B2m</italic> alone (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), and <italic>Kansl1</italic> alone (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; fig. S10, C and D). These results suggested that combinatorial knockout of <italic>B2m</italic> and <italic>Kansl1</italic> had a synergistic effect in accelerating liver tumor development, whereas the single knockouts of <italic>B2m</italic> or <italic>Kansl1</italic> were not sufficient to induce liver tumorigenesis in a <italic>Trp53</italic>-sensitized background. In summary, the single and combinatorial AAV-CRISPR knockout experiments further confirmed the phenotypes of several top-ranked genes and co-occurring gene pairs in liver tumorigenesis. Our study demonstrates a powerful strategy for quantitatively mapping functional suppressors in the cancer genome and their synergistic relationships directly in vivo in a fully immunocompetent setting.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We developed an approach for direct in vivo CRISPR screens to directly map functional variants of tumor suppressors in mice in an autochthonous cancer model. Using an AAV library carrying 278 different CRISPR sgRNAs, we generated hundreds of variants in the top 49 known or putative TSGs and assayed their ability to promote tumorigenesis in the mouse liver upon loss of function by Cas9 mutagenesis. Capture sequencing of the resultant liver tumors revealed a heterogeneous mutational landscape, indicating that several of the genes in the mTSG library function as tumor suppressors. Notably, our experiments were conducted in immunocompetent mice; considering the critical role of the tumor microenvironment and associated immune context in human disease progression, the use of autochthonous tumor models in immunocompetent animals is especially important to enhance clinical relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>).</p><p>Compared to conventional sgRNA sequencing, MIP capture sequencing enabled direct, multiplexed analysis of the indels induced by Cas9 mutagenesis. By refocusing our analysis to the variant level, we systematically dissected the variant compositions across multiple liver lobes from a single mouse, uncovering evidence of clonal mixture between lobes. We thus demonstrate that massively parallel autochthonous in vivo CRISPR screens can be achieved through the use of pooled AAVs in conjunction with MIP capture sequencing in the mouse liver. To date, library-scale CRISPR screens have largely been demonstrated in in vitro or cellular transplant studies; however, it has remained a challenge to perform such screens in a direct in vivo manner. Because AAVs do not typically integrate into the genome, direct sgRNA cassette readout is rendered infeasible. Instead, we read out a high-throughput in vivo CRISPR experiment by targeted capture sequencing, demonstrating a new approach for in vivo CRISPR screens. Whereas traditional sgRNA sequencing can only provide information about the relative abundances of each sgRNA, capture sequencing enables high-resolution analysis of individual indel variants for clonal analysis of tumor heterogeneity.</p><p>Co-mutation analysis identified several pairs of significantly co-occurring mutations. A binary metric, such as mutation occurrence (that is, number of mice or patient with a gene mutated), tends to reflect the prevalence of a driver. On the other hand, a quantitative metric such as allele frequency of a mutant or a gene in a complex tumor tends to reflect the strength of in vivo selection, where dominant mutants with strong effects may outcompete other mutant cells in the same mouse. To gain a more comprehensive picture of both processes, we had leveraged both binary metrics and allele frequency as surrogate statistics (tables S10 and S11), each of which has distinct advantages and limitations. We picked a top co-occurring pair (<italic>B2m</italic> + <italic>Kansl1</italic>), two moderate co-occurring pairs (<italic>Pik3r1</italic> + <italic>Pten</italic> and <italic>Pik3r1</italic> + <italic>Stk11</italic>), and a nonsignificantly co-occurring pair (<italic>Arid2</italic> + <italic>Kdm5c</italic>). We then knocked out these genes, individually and combinatorially, to study their independent and synergistic roles in liver tumorigenesis along with <italic>Trp53</italic> loss in immunocompetent mice. According to the IVIS data (fig. S10), combinatorial knockout of the top co-occurring pair <italic>B2m</italic> + <italic>Kansl1</italic> led to significantly faster liver tumorigenesis than knocking out either <italic>B2m</italic> or <italic>Kansl1</italic> individually, whereas the combinatorial knockout of the gene pair <italic>Arid2</italic> + <italic>Kdm5c</italic> that was not found to significantly co-occur did not show any synergistic effect. The validation results were consistent with our analysis of the screening data, indicating that the in vivo AAV-CRISPR screen is an effective approach to identify potent TSGs and potential synergistic drivers of liver tumorigenesis in immunocompetent mice.</p><p>In the pooled AAV-CRISPR tumorigenesis system, some passenger mutations could be hitchhiking on advantageous mutated clones, thus showing relatively high mutation frequencies. Nevertheless, because neutral mutations hitchhike by chance, the probability for a passenger mutation to be recurrently co-mutated with a strong driver across multiple samples is low compared to co-mutation of two true drivers. Here, we adopted both binary mutant calls and allele frequency analysis in exploring potentially synergistic interactions to minimize the possibility of identifying selectively neutral passenger-driver pairs.</p><p>As an approximation to the clonality of these tumors, we also calculated the number of major clusters (fig. S11), in which each major cluster has one or more mutations at similar frequencies as compared to other mutants. From this analysis, we found that 6 of 30 mTSG livers had single-cluster tumors, with the majority (24 of 30) being composed of multiple clusters (fig. S11). Given the nature of pooled mutagenesis, the detected mutations comprising co-occurring gene pairs can be either in the same clone or in different clones within the same tumor. On the basis of allele frequency analysis, we would expect that most of the significantly correlated gene pairs had coevolved in the same clone. To definitively distinguish the monoclonal or multiclonal synergistic effects of gene pairs in vitro and in vivo, double knockouts must be introduced simultaneously into the same cell using a dual-sgRNA expression system and compare them to single knockout cells.</p><p>The AAV-CRISPR screen approach can potentially be extended to identify genetic factors with a significant impact on various cancer types and other human diseases. Our strategy for selecting genes to target in the mTSG library was based on pan-cancer TCGA data sets, with an initial aim of identifying genes that are more likely to function as tumor suppressors in a wide variety of tissues such that the same AAV-CRISPR mTSG library could potentially be used in other organs. We recently applied this approach to map functional tumor suppressors in glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45"><italic>45</italic></xref>), finding that the strongest single and co-occurring driver mutations differ between mouse liver and brain. A technical distinction is that the present study used MIPs for reading out variants, whereas the glioblastoma study used Roche probes. MIPs provide more flexibility and are more cost-efficient as compared to Roche probes, making it simple for utilization of the AAV-CRISPR–MIP screening approach. In light of the previous success of in vivo transposon-based, short hairpin RNA (shRNA), or lentiviral screens in other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46"><italic>46</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49"><italic>49</italic></xref>), we anticipate that our approach (AAV-CRISPR mutagenesis followed by MIP capture sequencing) can be readily expanded to other organ systems, potentially enabling the construction of a multiorgan functional variant mapping of tumor suppressors.</p><p>One limitation of this study is the exclusion of oncogenes. Because advantageous alterations in proto-oncogenes are generally thought to occur through several different mechanisms, such as mutations to specific amino acid residues, increased expression by transcriptional amplification, or copy number amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>), modeling proto-oncogenes in a massively parallel manner requires more sophisticated methods. Several in vitro gene activation screens using CRISPR have been described, opening the possibility for overexpression screens of proto-oncogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50"><italic>50</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51"><italic>51</italic></xref>). CRISPR has also recently been engineered to mutate specific DNA nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52"><italic>52</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53"><italic>53</italic></xref>). Adapting these new tools for use in vivo would allow high-throughput oncogene screens, thereby enabling functional variant mapping of oncogenes. Although we focused on a set of highly mutated pan-cancer tumor suppressors in mouse liver in this study, given the immense programmability of CRISPR-mediated genome editing, it is feasible to apply this AAV-CRISPR screen approach to target different sets of genes or noncoding elements, potentially at genome scale, to functionally assess phenotypes in an unbiased fashion. The versatility of this new platform provides a powerful means for mapping a provisional functional cancer genome atlas of tumor suppressors, oncogenes, and other types of genetic events of tumor evolution, in isolation or as combinations and larger pools, in virtually any cancer type. Application of this approach in conjunction with therapeutic agents will enable precision preclinical testing for rapid identification of effective compounds against specific mutant genotypes, paving new ways for cancer target discovery.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Design, synthesis, and cloning of the mTSG library</title><p>Pan-cancer mutation data from 15 cancer types were retrieved from the TCGA portal via cBioPortal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54"><italic>54</italic></xref>) and Synapse (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.synapse.org">www.synapse.org</ext-link>).

For each sgRNA, we first took the highest % variant read frequency across all control liver samples; for a mutation to be called in an mTSG sample, the % variant read frequency had to exceed the control sample cutoff. However, because the base vector contained a <italic>Trp53</italic> sgRNA (p53 sg8) whose cut site was only 1 bp away from the target site of <italic>Trp53</italic> sg4 (from the mTSG library), we only considered PBS samples when calculating the false discovery cutoff for <italic>Trp53</italic> sg4. Finally, because we were most interested in identifying the dominant clones in each sample, we further set a 5% variant frequency cutoff on top of the false discovery cutoff. These criteria gave us a binary table (that is, not mutated versus mutated) detailing each sgRNA and whether its target site was mutated in each sample. To convert mutated sgRNA sites into MGs, we simply collapsed the binary sgRNA scores by gene such that, if any of the five sgRNAs for a gene were found to be strongly cutting, the entire gene would be called as mutated.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Coding frame analysis</title><p>For coding frame and exonic/intronic analysis, we only considered the indels that were associated with an sgRNA, which had been considered mutated in that particular sample. This final set of significant indels was converted to .avinput format and subsequently annotated using ANNOVAR v. 2016Feb01, using default settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60"><italic>60</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Co-occurrence and correlation analysis</title><p>Co-occurrence analysis was performed by first generating a double-mutant count table for each pairwise combination of genes in the mTSG library. Statistical significance of the co-occurrence was assessed by two-sided hypergeometric test. To calculate co-occurrence rates, we defined the “intersection” as the number of double-mutant samples, and the “union” as the number of samples with a mutation in either (or both) of the two genes, and then divided the intersection by the union. For correlation analysis, we first collapsed the table of variant frequencies to the gene level (that is, summing the variant frequencies for all five of the targeting sgRNAs for each gene). Using these summed variant frequency values, we calculated the Spearman or Pearson correlation between all gene pairs across each mTSG sample. Statistical significance of the correlation was determined by converting the correlation coefficient to a <italic>t</italic> statistic and then using the <italic>t</italic> distribution to find the associated probability. For both co-occurrence and correlation analyses, <italic>P</italic> values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing by the Benjamini-Hochberg method to obtain <italic>q</italic> values.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Unique variant analysis</title><p>Instead of first collapsing variant calls to the sgRNA level as above, unique variants and their associated mutant frequencies were compiled across all sequenced samples. To be considered present in a given sample, a particular variant must have a mutant frequency of ≥1%. Heat maps of the unique variant landscape were created in R using the NMF package, with average linkage and Euclidean distance. We also performed a focused analysis on the unique variant landscape within a single mouse, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>. For the correlation heat map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>, we used Spearman rank correlation to assess the pairwise correlation between different liver lobes. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, clusters of variants were defined on the basis of binary mutation calls (that is, whether a given variant is present or not within each sample). To determine the proportional contribution of each cluster, for each sample, we only included the clusters in which at least half of the variants in the cluster are present in that sample. We then took the average mutant frequency across the variants within each cluster and used these values to determine the relative contribution of each cluster to the overall sample. To identify the top four variants in each cluster, we ranked all the variants by the average variant frequency across all lobes in which the variant cluster was considered present.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Clustering of variant frequencies to infer clonality of tumors</title><p>For each mTSG liver sample, we extracted the individual variants that comprised the MS calls in that sample, with a cutoff of 5% variant frequency to eliminate low-abundance variants. To identify clusters of variant frequencies in an unbiased manner, we modeled the variant frequency distribution with a Gaussian kernel density estimate, using the Sheather-Jones method to select the smoothing bandwidth. From the kernel density estimate, we then identified the number of local maxima (that is, “peaks”) within the density function. The number of peaks thus represents the number of variant frequency clusters for an individual sample, which is an approximation for the clonality of the tumors.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Direct in vivo validation of drivers or combinations</title><p>Liver-specific AAV-CRISPR vectors were designed to co-cistronically express FLuc and Cre recombinase for induction of Cas9 expression under a <italic>TBG</italic> promoter when delivered to LSL-Cas9 mice (plasmids available at Addgene). Two sgRNA expression cassettes were built in these vectors, one encoding an sgRNA targeting <italic>Trp53</italic>, with the other being an open sgRNA cassette (double Sap I sites for GTS cloning). The vector was generated by gBlocks Gene Fragment synthesis (IDT) followed by Gibson assembly (NEB). Each specific sgRNA targeting a driver gene was cloned separately into this vector. AAV9 virus was produced and qPCR-titrated, as described above. Total viral particles (1 × 10<sup>11</sup>) were introduced by intravenous injection into LSL-Cas9 mice. For combinations of two AAVs, 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles were used from each AAV to generate equal titer mixtures and injected. Four to six mice were injected per group. Starting 1 month after injection, mice were imaged by IVIS each month. Briefly, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and imaged for in vivo tumor growth using an IVIS machine (PerkinElmer) with firefly <sc>d</sc>-luciferin potassium salt (150 mg/kg body weight) injected intraperitoneally. Relative luciferase activity was quantified using Living Image software (PerkinElmer).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Blinding statement</title><p>Investigators were blinded for histology scoring and MIP sequencing but were not blinded for dissection, MRI, or survival analysis.</p></sec></sec>
