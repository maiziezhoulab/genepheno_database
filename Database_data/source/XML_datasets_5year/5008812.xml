<abstract>
<p>Infection of the genitourinary tract with Group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (GBS), an opportunistic gram positive pathogen, is associated with premature rupture of amniotic membrane and preterm birth. In this work, we demonstrate that GBS produces membrane vesicles (MVs) in a serotype independent manner. These MVs are loaded with virulence factors including extracellular matrix degrading proteases and pore forming toxins. Mice chorio-decidual membranes challenged with MVs <italic>ex vivo</italic> resulted in extensive collagen degradation leading to loss of stiffness and mechanical weakening. MVs when instilled vaginally are capable of anterograde transport in mouse reproductive tract. Intra-amniotic injections of GBS MVs in mice led to upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammation mimicking features of chorio-amnionitis; it also led to apoptosis in the chorio-decidual tissue. Instillation of MVs in the amniotic sac also resulted in intrauterine fetal death and preterm delivery. Our findings suggest that GBS MVs can independently orchestrate events at the feto-maternal interface causing chorio-amnionitis and membrane damage leading to preterm birth or fetal death.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Preterm birth is a major health concern globally as it is not only a leading cause of neonatal death, but also has long term consequences including defective brain development. Infection of vagina and cervix of pregnant women with the bacteria, Group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (GBS), causes chorio-amnionitis that significantly increases the probability of preterm births. We report that, GBS produces small extracellular membrane vesicles (MVs) which are toxic to both fetal and maternal cells. In animal studies, we found that the MVs disrupt the connective tissue of the fetal membrane reducing its mechanical strength which may cause premature rupture of amniotic sac. Further we show that even in absence of the bacteria, the MVs directly led to extensive inflammation in the mouse resulting in chorio-amnionitis, preterm births and still births. Collectively, our findings reveal how GBS while colonizing the lower genitourinary tract might orchestrate events at the fetal membrane leading to premature birth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal mortality worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref001">1</xref>]. Globally, an estimated 13 million babies are born prematurely each year, out of which more than one million succumb to death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref002">2</xref>]. In addition, being the leading cause of neonatal death, preterm birth also increases the risk of neonatal infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref003">3</xref>]. The survivors of preterm birth are also at increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairments, respiratory and gastrointestinal complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Amongst the various causes of preterm birth, intrauterine infections by various bacterial pathogens have been suggested to be one of the main reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref005">5</xref>]. Group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (<italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>, GBS) the β-hemolytic, gram-positive bacteria colonizes the genitourinary tract of almost 20–30% pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref008">8</xref>] and is frequently associated with preterm births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref009">9</xref>]. Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that colonization of vagina and cervix with GBS significantly increases the probability of intra-amniotic infection, chorio-amnionitis, endometriosis, preterm premature rupture of amniotic membrane (PPROM) and preterm births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref015">15</xref>]. It is postulated that ascending GBS infection from the vagina to the feto-maternal space decreases amniotic membrane integrity causing PPROM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref016">16</xref>]. This effect is attributed to the hemolytic pigment of GBS which causes chorio-amnionitis <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>While bacterial infections have been strongly associated with preterm births, it is not clear how preterm labor-related infections occur. Although ascending infections are postulated to be the main reason of preterm births, recent studies have suggested that intra-amniotic inflammation associated with spontaneous preterm labor occurs even in the absence of detectable microorganisms in the feto-maternal interface and amniotic fluid, a phenomenon, referred to as ‘sterile intra-amniotic inflammation’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref018">18</xref>]. Similar observations were made in an experimental model of rhesus monkeys where GBS was not detected in the amniotic fluid despite extensive inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref019">19</xref>]. These observations led us to postulate that the physical presence of the bacteria in the amniotic fluid and/or the chorio-decidua may not be necessary for intra-amniotic inflammation and preterm birth.</p>
<p>Interaction with the environment and other units of life forms an important cellular phenomenon and is mediated via the action of either cell surface associated or secreted molecules. The latter bypasses the need for physical presence of the cell at the site of interaction which often might not be possible due to limitations of size, distance, presence of hostile molecules etc. Prokaryotes have a wide variety of secretion system which includes the classical secretory (Sec) system, the TAT system, accessory Sec system and ABC transporters. Apart from these, outer membrane vesicles secreted by gram-negative bacteria have been proposed to be an ancillary secretory mechanism. These bilayered structures were found to be secreted almost ubiquitously by most, if not all gram negative bacteria wherein they perform a wide range of functions including quorum sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref020">20</xref>], biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref021">21</xref>], nutrient acquisition, defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref022">22</xref>] and stress resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref023">23</xref>]. Lately, extracellular membrane vesicles (MVs) are also reported to be produced by a number of gram positive bacteria. These include <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref024">24</xref>], <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref025">25</xref>], <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref026">26</xref>], <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref027">27</xref>] and very recently in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref028">28</xref>] and <italic>Streptococcus suis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref029">29</xref>]. Loaded with toxins and other virulence factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref025">25</xref>], adhesins and immuno-modulatory substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref030">30</xref>], these MVs contribute to the survival, virulence and dissemination of the pathogens in the host. While GBS is not known to produce similar vesicular structures; based on the observations in other pathogenic organisms, we hypothesized that GBS may also produce MVs, which at the feto-maternal interface/or amniotic fluid cause tissue damage resulting in PPROM and/or preterm delivery.</p>
<p>In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that independent of the strains, GBS produces MVs. These MVs are capable of anterograde transport in mouse reproductive tract, have collagenase activity and reduce the stiffness of mouse chorio-decidual membrane <italic>ex vivo</italic>. <italic>In vivo</italic> injection of GBS MVs in mouse amniotic sacs causes chorio-amnionitis and inflammation resulting in premature delivery and fetal demise. Collectively, these findings provide a novel insight into how GBS can orchestrate events at the fetal membrane leading to premature birth.</p>

<title>Detection and isolation of extracellular membrane vesicles produced by GBS</title>
<p>Visualization of ultracentrifuged culture supernatant from GBS strain A909 (serotype IA) by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) revealed numerous spherical structures of varying sizes resembling MVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005816.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The budding and release of MVs by GBS cells were observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) where the vesicles were found to be aggregated both at the time of secretion and following discharge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005816.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). We also determined the presence of MVs associated with GBS by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005816.s001">S1A Fig</xref>).

<p>We stained the putative MVs from GBS strain A909 with DiO, a lipophilic fluorescent dye. Flow cytometry of the labeled MVs revealed that almost 99% of the vesicles were DiO positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005816.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) of the vesicle preparations revealed two distinct populations, one &lt; 50 nm and the other in the range of 150–300 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005816.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Some larger structures (&gt; 300 nm) observed in DLS analysis was thought to be vesicular aggregates, supporting our observations from SEM analysis. Quantitatively, 1 ml of late exponentially grown GBS culture was estimated to produce 1.7x10<sup>4</sup> vesicles. The number of vesicles increased in a growth phase dependent manner, mostly due to increase in cell numbers. Maximum number of vesicles were attained at an OD of 1.2 corresponding to late-exponential phase of growth for GBS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005816.s001">S1C Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The vesicles from strain A909 also contain DNA at a concentration of ~33 ± 5 ng/μg of MV protein. We attempted to amplify few genes encoding various GBS virulence factors, such as, <italic>cylE</italic> (acyl CoA acyl transferase involved in hemolysin synthesis), <italic>cfb</italic> (CAMP factor), <italic>pepB</italic> (metallopeptidase), <italic>zooA</italic> (zoocin) and <italic>gapN</italic> (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) from the DNA isolated from MVs. A PCR product (750 bp) was obtained when primers specific for <italic>cfb</italic> gene was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005816.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). No PCR products were detected when primer sets of other genes (<italic>cylE</italic>, <italic>pepB</italic>, <italic>zooA</italic> and <italic>gapN</italic>) were used for PCR, revealing the absence of the cognate DNA from isolated MVs. However, all these genes could be successfully amplified when genomic DNA of GBS was used as template in PCR.</p>
<p>We next attempted to determine if MVs can interact with host cells by studying the effects of purified MVs from GBS strain A909 on HeLa cells. A significant dose dependent reduction in the viability of HeLa cells was observed within 24 h of challenge with MVs. The reduction in viability was statistically significant at concentrations greater than 100 μg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005816.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). BSA entrapped liposomes that were used as negative control had no effect on HeLa cells viability even at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005816.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), revealing that the cytotoxicity was specific for GBS MVs.</p>
<p>To determine if MVs can enter host cells, HeLa cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled MVs and visualized using a confocal microscope. FITC labeled MVs could be readily detected inside HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005816.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Extracellular MVs could be distinguished from the internalized MVs by double immunofluorescence where the internalized vesicles remain green and the extracellular MVs are red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005816.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).</p>

In liposome (BSA entrapped) treated membranes (negative control), intense collagen staining was observed in the region below the epithelial layer and the collagen fibers were continuous. However, in the membranes treated with MVs, collagen was fragmented and thread like structures were observed indicative of collagen degradation. The collagen degrading effect could be attributed to the activity of proteases present in MVs since this could be attenuated when the chorio-decidual tissue was incubated with MVs in presence of protease inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005816.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>GBS MVs lead to preterm birth and fetal demise</title>
<p>Considering our findings on the widespread effect of GBS MVs on fetal membrane components we tested if MVs from GBS strain A909 are capable of inducing preterm birth. For this purpose amniotic sacs of mice were injected with either 5 or 10 μg of GBS MVs or PBS and animals were monitored every 6 h up to 72 h for signs of preterm birth (vaginal bleeding, pups in cage). Administration of 5 μg and 10 μg of MVs in the amniotic fluid resulted in preterm births (by day 18 of pregnancy) of 55% and 68% of fetuses, respectively. Only 10% of such events were observed in the PBS treated group. Along with preterm birth, increased frequency of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD, defined as resorption or presence of a macerated fetus in amniotic sac) was observed in the group treated with GBS MVs as compared to PBS treated controls (36% and 29% vs 3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005816.g008">Fig 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005816.s006">S2 Table</xref>). Interestingly, in the groups where MVs were injected, fetuses were either resorbed or delivered by 48 h. Moreover, the delivered fetuses from MV injected sacs exhibited significant reduction in size and abnormal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005816.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Collectively these suggest that GBS MVs lead to fetal demise, preterm birth and cause fetal injury.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Membrane vesicles are bilayered structures, found to be secreted almost ubiquitously by gram negative bacteria and a large number of gram positive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref034">34</xref>]. In the current study, we demonstrate for the first time that GBS (a gram positive bacteria) is capable of secreting MVs in a strain independent manner. Employing different microscopic techniques we could not only detect the presence of vesicles in GBS culture supernatant, but also demonstrate the budding of vesicular structures from GBS surface. Interestingly, similar budding structures from GBS surface resembling MVs have been reported in GBS colonized in the murine genital tract, implying that GBS could also produce MVs <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref035">35</xref>]. We isolated and characterized these MVs both physically and biochemically and examined their pattern of interaction with host cells in order to explore their potential contribution in GBS pathogenesis. Intriguingly, we could extract DNA and amplify the <italic>cfb</italic> gene, an important virulence factor of GBS, using the MV DNA as template. Occasionally, DNA has been found to be associated with MVs from other microorganisms such as <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref036">36</xref>], <italic>S</italic>. <italic>vesicuolsa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref037">37</xref>] and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>perfringens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref026">26</xref>]. Though DNA is detected in GBS MVs, we believe this DNA is fragmented as we could only detect the <italic>cfb</italic> gene, but genes representing other virulence factors (<italic>cylE</italic>, <italic>pepB</italic>, <italic>zooA</italic>) or housekeeping gene (<italic>gapN</italic>) could not be amplified. This implies that the DNA packaged in MVs is perhaps not a random phenomenon but may involve a regulated mechanism. While the functional significance of the DNA packaging in MVs is yet unknown, since the MVs fuse with the host or other bacterial cells, these might act as carriers of DNA from one cell to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref038">38</xref>]. It will be of interest to determine if the MV DNA specifically enters the cells to induce a pathological activation of host nuclease machinery.</p>
<p>Proteomic analysis of the GBS MV proteins revealed presence of numerous ECM degrading enzymes. The preferential packaging of ECM degrading enzymes compared to other abundant membrane proteins implies presence of a selective sorting mechanism. Such a sorting mechanism have been identified in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>gingivalis</italic> which not only facilitates preferential packaging of important virulence factors but also enables it to exclude other abundant outer membrane proteins from the cargo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref039">39</xref>]. Similar enrichment of acidic glycosidases and proteases were observed in <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species suggesting presence of a species specific machinery devoted to selectively pack proteins into the vesicles to do specific jobs, in this case securing nutrients for the benefit of the whole bacterial community present in the microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>The presence of various ECM degrading enzymes in GBS MVs therefore points towards its significant role in GBS pathogenesis. Indeed, we observed that the MVs could not only interact with HeLa cells extracellularly but also internalize and cause cell death. These observations prompted us to hypothesize that the presence of various virulence factors and ECM degrading proteins in GBS MVs might lead to tissue degradation and cell death that may contribute to PPROM and preterm births. We next performed a series of experiments to investigate this hypothesis.</p>
<p>The fetal membranes (amnion and chorion) rest upon a collagenous basement membrane of type II and IV collagen and beneath this layer lays a fibrous layer that contains collagen types I, III, V, and VI. Collagen, therefore provides major structural strength for the membranes and degradation of it leads to loss of membrane integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref043">43</xref>]. The enrichment of ECM degrading proteases, coupled with the presence of gelatinolytic activity in GBS MVs suggested that these might cause loss of fetal membrane integrity by ECM degradation. Indeed, <italic>ex vivo</italic> treatment of chorio-decidual membrane with GBS MVs led to collagen fragmentation. This collagen fragmentation had profound effect on fetal membrane integrity as the stiffness of the membranes challenged with MVs were significantly reduced. It is likely that during pregnancy, GBS via its MVs lead to collagen degradation and reduction in tissue stiffness which together would resist further expansion of the amniotic sac, a prerequisite to accommodate the growing fetus. Thus our findings suggest that GBS MVs lead to loss of ECM and weaken the amniotic membrane making it susceptible to rupture upon pressure from the growing fetus.</p>
<p>Epidemiological data suggest that colonization of vagina and cervix with GBS increases the probability of chorio-amnionitis. We suspected that the MVs produced by GBS while colonizing can move upwards in the female reproductive tract and affect cells and tissue at distant sites. Budding structures resembling MVs have been observed in GBS colonized in the murine genital tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref035">35</xref>]. Extending this data, herein we show that GBS MVs when vaginally instilled could traverse anterogradely upto anterior most segment of the uterus. Recently, it has been shown that GBS mutant for hyaluronidase is not capable of ascending infection in a mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref044">44</xref>]. Since, hyaluronidase is also enriched in our GBS MV preparations; it is possible that it could aid ascend of MVs into the female tract. While it needs to be demonstrated that like GBS, MVs can also anterogradely transport into the gravid uterus; it is tempting to hypothesize that GBS colonization at a distant site such as vagina can affect the feto-maternal tissues in the uterus by the virtue of secreting MVs.</p>
<p>We next asked if GBS MVs have any pathogenic effects <italic>in vivo</italic>. Corroborating our <italic>ex-vivo</italic> observations; we observed that instillation of GBS MVs intra-amniotically led to extensive disruption of the chorio-decidual structure. This disruption is also associated with collagen fragmentation which could be due to the proteases present in the MVs. Beyond collagen, extensive alterations in the expression of genes encoding for extracellular matrix proteins has been reported in chorio-decidua of rhesus monkeys infected with GBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref016">16</xref>]. While it will be of interest to see the alterations in other ECM molecules in response to MVs, we believe that the changes in extracellular matrix and collagen degradation would contribute to the mechanical weakening of the tissue resulting in the loss of membrane stiffness. Indeed we did see a reduction on stiffness of the chorio-decidua tissue challenged with MVs <italic>ex vivo</italic>. It will be of interest to test the effects of MVs derived from GBS mutants for various ECM degrading enzymes and determine the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon. Along with loss of collagen, we also detected extensive apoptosis in the chorio-decidua derived from sacs injected with MVs. These observations suggested that coupled with mechanical weakening, cell death might further contribute to loosening of the membrane. Such tissue damage by MVs could make the membrane prone to rupture leading to PPROM.</p>
<p>A leading feature of PPROM and preterm births due to inflammation is chorio-amnionitis. Chorio-amnionitis is acute inflammation of the fetal membrane and chorion which is typically caused due to ascending microbial infection especially in case of infection with genital mycoplasmas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref045">45</xref>]. Histologically, chorio-amnionitis is characterized by leukocyte infiltration in the chorion/amnion and the decidua. In the context of GBS, <italic>in vivo</italic> administration of the live bacteria in pregnant mice led to histopathologic characteristics resembling chorio-amnionitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref016">16</xref>]. Herein for the first time we demonstrated that chorio-amnionitis can be caused by MVs even in absence of live bacteria. We observed that intra-amniotic administration of GBS MVs caused extensive leukocytic infiltration in the subchorion layer and in decidua resembling chorio-amnionitis. Beyond leukocytic infiltration, the decidua of mice injected with GBS MVs also had macrophage infiltration. Moreover, these vesicles also induced inflammatory cytokines such as, <italic>Kc</italic>, <italic>Il-1β</italic>, <italic>Il-6</italic>, and <italic>Tnf-α</italic> in the decidua. Levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines are also known to be elevated in the amniotic fluid of patients in independent contexts of GBS infections and PPROM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref046">46</xref>]. Since HeLa cells also showed similar response upon treatment with MVs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005816.s003">S3B Fig</xref>), we believe that the elevation in levels of these cytokines in the decidua may not be exclusively due to higher numbers of immune cells present in these tissues, but because of the ability of MVs to generate an inflammatory response in the decidual cells. We therefore conclude that GBS by the virtue of production of MVs activates the host immune system which might trigger the immune cell homing and activation leading to chorio-amnionitis. These observations are novel as for the first time we have shown that even in absence of active infection in the chorio-decidua, features resembling clinical chorio-amnionitis could be mimicked by MVs. Clinically this observation is highly relevant as 50–80% women with chorio-amnionitis do not have bacteria in their amniotic fluid or the decidual tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref050">50</xref>]. Based on our findings we can hypothesize that MVs secreted by the pathogens residing in lower genital tract may be responsible for cases with unexplained chorio-amnionitis. It would be imperative to study the presence of MVs in amniotic fluid and chorio-decidual tissues of woman with culture negative chorio-amnionitis.</p>
<p>Since, GBS MVs lead to tissue damage, inflammation and chorio-amnionitis, resulting in mechanical weakening of the fetal membrane, we finally asked if GBS MVs can lead to premature birth. Indeed, we observed that intra-amniotic injection of GBS MVs lead to preterm delivery. More than 50% of mouse pups were delivered preterm (almost 2 days prior to their expected day of delivery) when challenged with MVs. Finally, we also observed that like live GBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref017">17</xref>], the MVs are also highly pathogenic to the fetus. Almost 30–40% of fetuses died <italic>in utero</italic> amounting to resorption and some fetuses were still born. The fetuses that were stillborn or recovered from uterine sacs after GBS MV challenge, were smaller and had major damage to its organs. These results together imply that GBS MVs can cause IUFD or preterm births. To our knowledge this is the first report describing the direct role of membrane vesicles produced by any pathogenic bacteria in disease pathogenesis. In the light of the fact that intrauterine infections can lead to autism like changes in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref051">51</xref>], it is possible that GBS MVs might have a similar effect. It will be of interest to study the effects of sub-lethal dose of GBS MVs on fetal development and physiology.</p>
<p>In summary, the results of the present study have shown that GBS MVs cause host cell death, membrane weakening and inflammation of the feto-maternal interface which causes preterm birth and IUFD. Coupling this with the fact that pathogen derived vesicles can function as vehicles for long distance delivery of virulence factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref052">52</xref>], our results imply that the production of extracellular membrane vesicles serves not only as a tool for secretion but also arms GBS with an additional weapon by which while colonizing it can orchestrate events at distant sites including the fetal membrane. Our findings provide a plausible explanation for the occurrence of PPROM and premature delivery in woman with chorio-amnionitis without detectable bacteria in their amniotic fluid or the decidual tissue. We conclude that GBS utilizes MVs as a surrogate to spread its virulence factors in the host which are responsible for the clinical features of GBS infection during pregnancy. Prevention of vesicle biogenesis may therefore be a viable therapeutic option to prevent GBS mediated preterm birth.</p>

<title>Atomic force microscopy for tissues</title>
<p>Chorio-decidual membrane was collected from pregnant mice on E14.5. Immediately after dissection, the membranes were incubated in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS (Invitrogen) at 37°C and treated for 24 h with either PBS, or BSA entrapped liposomes (100 μg/ml) or MVs (100 μg/ml) in presence or absence of protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Collagenase (10 μg/ml) was used as positive control. Following incubation, the membranes were washed, carefully spread on a slide layered with double adhesive tape, allowed to air dry for 5 min. Subsequently, the membranes were hydrated with PBS, and their mechanical properties were probed with an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). A 5 μm diameter spherical probe with a nominal spring constant of 32.66 pN/nm was used. Using a custom-written code, force-indentation curves were fitted with Hertz model to estimate the Young’s modulus of elasticity of each of the membranes. Each sample was probed randomly multiple number of times (greater than 50) at multiple different positions to estimate average stiffness of the membranes.</p>

<title>Anterograde transport of MVs</title>
<p>The vagina of mice in estrus phase were flushed thrice with 40 μl of 0.2% Triton X-100 in 0.9% saline followed by 40 μl 0.9% saline. MVs were labeled with FITC as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref057">57</xref>] and 100 μg of FITC labeled GBS MVs in 100 μl PBS were vaginally instilled in 25–30 μl aliquots using a micropipette. Control mice received PBS only. After 6 h mice were euthanized and the reproductive tract (cervix to uterus) was collected. Tissues were briefly fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and mounted on slides with Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Images of different parts of the tissue such as utero-cervical junction, distal uterus and proximal uterus were captured with an oil immersion Plan-Apochromat 40X/1.3 NA objective of a confocal laser scanning microscope.</p>

<sec id="sec024">
<title>Intra-amniotic administration of MVs</title>
<p>For pregnancy-outcome experiments, C57BL6/J- were bred and maintained at the Experimental Animal Facility of NIRRH under constant temperature and 12 h light and dark cycles were used. Female mice in estrus were impregnated naturally by a male of proven fertility and mating was confirmed by the presence of a vaginal plug (E0.5). Intra-amniotic injections were performed on E14.5 of a 19–20 d gestation. Briefly, animals were anesthetized and a 1.5-cm midline incision was made in the lower abdomen. The mouse uterus is a bicornuate where the fetuses are arranged in a “beads-on-a-string” pattern. Both the horns were exposed and individual fetal sacs were injected with 100 μl of MVs (5 or 10 μg protein) or equivalent amount of PBS or BSA-liposomes. After injection the uterus was returned to the abdomen, muscle and skin layers were sutured and dams were returned to their cages and monitored on regular intervals. Surgical procedures lasted ∼10 min and post-operative care was taken as per standard protocols at NIRRH. Delivery of one or more pups in the cage or lower vagina within 48 h was considered preterm.</p>
<p>For collection of tissues, animals were euthanized 24 h after surgery. The inoculated horns were incised longitudinally along the anti-mesenteric border. Gestational tissues (full-thickness biopsies from the middle region) and fetal membranes were harvested and frozen in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and stored at −80°C for RNA extraction or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for histopathology. Fixed tissues were paraffin embedded and 5 μm thick paraffin sections were collected on poly-lysine coated glass slides and processed for routine hematoxylin and eosin staining.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec025">
<title>RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR</title>
<p>RNA from HeLa cells or mouse tissue was isolated using Trizol reagent as detailed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref059">59</xref>]. RNA was treated for 30 min with DNaseI to remove any DNA contamination and processed for reverse transcription. The details of qRT-PCR have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref059">59</xref>]. Briefly, 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScriptTM First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). The cDNA was further used for quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) for various cytokines. β-actin (for HeLa cells) and 18S (for mouse tissues) were used as the house keeping genes. The sequences of the primers are as mentioned in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005816.s005">S1 Table</xref>. Care was taken to design primers that spanned an intron to eliminate any amplification due to genomic DNA contamination. The specificity of amplicons was confirmed by performing dissociation / melt curve analysis. Only those primer pairs that resulted in a single sharp melt peak with a consistent melt temperature were included in the study. The relative changes in the expression of above genes was analyzed by 2<sup>-ΔΔCt</sup> method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref060">60</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec026">
<title>Quantification of leukocytes</title>
<p>Hematoxylin and Eosin stained slides of the chorio-decidua were examined under 40X objective for neutrophils and lymphocytes. The cells were identified based on their morphology. The number of neutrophils and lymphocytes per field were counted in 8–10 random fields per section. Five random sections from each fetus were analyzed. The analysis was done in three biological replicates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec027">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Immunohistochemistry on tissue sections was performed as detailed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref061">61</xref>]. For detection of macrophages, paraffin embedded 5 μm sections of the chorio-decidual membrane (with or without MV treatment) were stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-F4/80 Ab (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and detected using HRP conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:100; Dako) and 3.3’ Diaminobenzidine with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted in DPX.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec028">
<title>Collagen staining</title>
<p>Total collagen staining in chorio-decidual membrane sections were performed using Picrosirius red [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005816.ref062">62</xref>]. Paraffin sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated in graded methanol series and stained with hematoxylin followed by 0.5% Direct Red 80 (Sigma) prepared in picric acid. Following dehydration with 100% methanol and clearing in xylene, the slides were mounted with DPX.</p>

<p>Induction of apoptosis by GBS MVs was analyzed by <italic>In Situ</italic> Cell Death Determination Kit (Roche) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, following deparaffinization, tissue sections were rehydrated and digested using proteinase K. After permeabilization with 0.25% Triton X 100, the sections were incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and fluorescein-dUTPs for 1 h at 37°C. Following washing to remove unbound dUTPs, the sections were mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories).
