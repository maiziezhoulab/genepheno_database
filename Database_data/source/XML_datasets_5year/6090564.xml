<p id="P1">The rapid elimination of dying neurons and non-functional synapses in the brain is carried out by microglia, the resident myeloid cells of the brain. Here we show that microglia clearance activity in the adult brain is regionally regulated and depends on the rate of neuronal attrition. Cerebellar, but not striatal or cortical, microglia exhibited high levels of basal clearance activity, which correlated with an elevated degree of cerebellar neuronal attrition. Exposing forebrain microglia to apoptotic cells activated gene expression programs supporting clearance activity. We provide evidence that the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) epigenetically restricts the expression of genes that support clearance activity in striatal and cortical microglia. Loss of PRC2 led to the aberrant activation of a microglia clearance phenotype, which triggers changes in neuronal morphology and behavior. Our data highlight a key role of epigenetic mechanisms in preventing microglia-induced neuronal alterations that are frequently associated with neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Development and ageing of the brain are associated with the attrition and loss of neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Despite the overall low rate of neuronal death during adulthood, functionally distinct brain areas display significant differences in neuronal loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. One of the brain regions displaying the most pronounced age-dependent neuronal loss is the cerebellum, where neuronal numbers start declining at the end of adolescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The loss of neurons in the cerebellum contrasts with that of other brain structures, such as the striatum, cortex, and hippocampus, which stably maintain their size and neuronal numbers throughout adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">The clearance of dying cells and debris in the brain is carried out by microglia, the brain-resident macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Brain region-specific differences in neuronal attrition suggest the possibility that microglia may fine-tune their clearance activity to the load of cell debris. Accordingly, the clearance activity of microglia must be suppressed in areas with low rates of neuronal death in the adult brain. Exacerbated activation of microglia has been shown to promote microglia-mediated neuronal attrition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. These findings underscore the essential role of mechanisms that modulate microglia activation in the maintenance of brain integrity.</p>
<p id="P4">Here we show regional differences in microglia clearance activity in the adult brain and demonstrate the importance of its tight regulation for normal brain function. We found that cerebellar microglia display a distinct clearance phenotype characterized by the expression of numerous genes supporting the engulfment and catabolism of cells and cellular debris. The cerebellar microglia phenotype is reminiscent of microglia during early brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> as well as microglia associated with neurodegenerative disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In contrast, microglia in the striatum, which like the cerebellum, is characterized by a rather homogenous neuron population, display a homeostatic surveillance phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. We found that the suppression of clearance activity in striatal microglia has an epigenetic underpinning. The suppression of clearance genes in striatal microglia is governed by Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which catalyzes the repressive chromatin modification histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Accordingly, microglia-specific ablation of PRC2 leads to the aberrant acquisition of a clearance phenotype in striatal and cortical microglia even in the absence of dying neurons. This aberrant clearance activation has a negative impact on neuronal morphology and associated neuron-mediated behaviors, leading to impaired motor responses, to decreased learning and memory, and to the development of anxiety and seizures in mice.</p>

<title>Cerebellar microglia display cellular phenotypes and gene expression patterns associated with cell clearance</title>
<p id="P5">We found that cerebellar microglia (cbMg), unlike microglia in the striatum (stMg), display morphological features and gene expression patterns that support clearance function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). cbMg in the adult mouse brain show a primed/phagocytic microglia phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> characterized by a less ramified morphology, reduced branching sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>), decreased cell volume (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>), and an increase in CD68+ lysosome content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>). A significant fraction of microglia in the cerebellum contains lysosomes carrying cell nuclei fragments as determined by the presence of DAPI-positive nuclear material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>), which is indicative of apoptotic cell clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The relatively high CD68+ lysosome content of cbMg is reminiscent of microglia in the dentate gyrus and olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>), where ongoing neuronal turnover is associated with high rates of cell death in the adult brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">To study gene expression in microglia in a minimally invasive fashion <italic>in vivo</italic>, we established a microglia-specific Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> (TRAP) approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). To generate microglia-specific TRAP mice, we bred mice that carry a loxP-flanked STOP cassette (LSL) upstream of the <italic>eGFP-L10a</italic> coding sequence under the control of ubiquitously expressed eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1, <italic>Eef1a1 (Eef1a1<sup>LSL.eGFPL10a/+</sup>)</italic> to mice that express the Cre recombinase under the control of a microglia-specific gene promoter. The <italic>Cx3Cr1<sup>CreErt2/+</sup></italic> strain was chosen based on the inducibility, selectivity, and highest efficiency of Cre expression in microglia in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Importantly, we show that the TRAP approach not only allows for the region-specific analysis of microglia-enriched mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) but also precludes nonspecific microglia activation and concurrent up-regulation of immediate early and pro-inflammatory genes that occur during commonly used microglia isolation approaches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">We found that cbMg display a significant enrichment in mRNAs associated with cell clearance functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). In contrast, stMg are enriched in mRNAs encoding mature microglia-specific homeostatic surveillance proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, including those that mediate G-protein-coupled chemosensing, chemotaxis, GTP signaling, and actin polymerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). A large fraction of the cbMg-enriched genes, including <italic>Apoe, Axl, Colec12, Cd74, Lilrb4, Mrc1</italic>, and <italic>Ms4a7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), encode proteins involved in apoptotic cell detection, engulfment, clearance of cell debris, and lipid/protein catabolism and have been shown to support clearance activity in phagocytic macrophages in peripheral tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, cbMg show an increase in the expression of genes characteristic of immature microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, as well as genes that are expressed in neurodegenerative disease-associated microglia (such as primed microglia, MGnD, and DAMs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Notably, in contrast to neurodegenerative disease-associated microglia, the cbMg are not enriched in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as <italic>Cxcl10, Il1b, Il6</italic>, and <italic>Tnf</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">The differential cbMg clearance- versus stMg surveillance-gene expression patterns were confirmed by microglia single-nuclei RNA-sequencing analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 5,6</xref>) and RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a-c</xref>). The expression of selected cbMg-enriched genes associated with clearance functions has been further validated at the level of protein expression. Expression of the clearance-associated proteins AXL, ApoE, CD74, MHCII, and MRC1 is significantly higher in cbMg, while actin polymerization-regulating FSCN1 protein expression shows a significant enrichment in stMg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7d</xref>). In support of cbMg clearance activity, we also found a significant enrichment in LC3 protein expression in cbMg as compared to stMg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In addition to its known role in autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, LC3 has been recently identified as a novel regulator of rapid apoptotic cell clearance in macrophages in a process termed LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), which occurs in the absence of immune activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Lastly, we found that adult cbMg display a significantly increased efficiency in the engulfment of apoptotic cells as compared to stMg. Co-incubation of acutely isolated cbMg and stMg from 3-4 month-old <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> mice with apoptotic Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 7e</xref>) resulted in increased apoptotic cell uptake by cbMg as compared to stMg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig 7f</xref>).</p>

<title>Cerebellar microglia are involved in the clearance of dying cells</title>
<p id="P9">The cerebellar microglia clearance phenotype, which is stably maintained during adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), could reflect either an inherent region-specific feature of the cbMg and/or the activation of clearance function by exposure to dying cells. While the age-dependent loss of cerebellar mass and neuronal numbers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> implies ongoing cell death, we could not detect dying cells in the cerebellum of adult wild-type mice. We speculated that dying cells in the cerebellum are rapidly removed by microglia. In such a scenario, one would anticipate an increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the absence of microglia. Microglia can be efficiently ablated in mice by chronic treatment with PLX5622 (PLX), a pharmacological inhibitor of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor, CSF1R, which is required for microglia survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The treatment of 2-month-old wild-type mice for &gt;3 weeks with PLX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>) results in the near complete ablation of microglia (~99%) in the adult brain, including in the cerebellum and striatum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>). The chronic depletion of microglia led to the accumulation of a significant number of apoptotic cells positive for cleaved Caspase 3 (cCASP3) and TUNEL in the cerebellum but not in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8c-e</xref>). Co-labeling with different cell type-specific markers revealed that the majority of the apoptotic cells are of neuronal origin and are distributed within all layers of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a,b</xref>). The clearance of dying cells by microglia is further supported by a significant accumulation of cCASP3+ cells in the dentate gyrus and the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9c,d</xref>), two brain regions displaying continuous neuronal turnover in the adult brain. At the same time, the lack of microglia did not lead to the appearance of cCASP3+ cells in the striatum or cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9c,d</xref>). In a complementary approach, we addressed the presence of apoptotic cells in the cerebellum of mice that lack TAM receptors (AXL/MERTK), which regulate apoptotic cell detection/clearance by microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. We found that AXL/MERTK deficiency results in the accumulation of apoptotic cCASP3+ cells in the cerebellum of adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), suggesting that the presence of dying cells is not caused by the loss of microglia but reflects the attenuation of microglia clearance function. These data suggest that microglia are responsible for the continuous clearance of dying cells in the cerebellum, and that the presence of dying cells may instruct the activation of cbMg clearance function.</p>

<title>Exposure to dying cells triggers the expression of clearance genes in microglia <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p id="P10">We found that exposure of primary forebrain microglia to apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref>) leads to the progressive induction of numerous pro-phagocytic genes that are also enriched in cbMg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10b</xref>). This exposure to dying cells was associated with the time-dependent induction of cbMg-enriched transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10c</xref>) as well as the down-regulation of stMg enriched homeostatic surveillance genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10d,e</xref>) in the absence of pro-inflammatory gene activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10f</xref>). Among the genes that become rapidly induced in microglia upon exposure to apoptotic cells were the cbMg-enriched <italic>Kdm6a/b</italic>, which encode histone demethylases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10g</xref>). KDM6A/B mediate the removal of the suppressive chromatin modification H3K27me3, which is associated with silenced genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The up-regulation of <italic>Kdm6a/b</italic> and the associated induction of clearance genes in response to apoptotic cells is reminiscent of the <italic>Kdm6a/b</italic> induction and H3K27me3 demethylation at inflammatory gene loci during macrophage activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.

<title>PRC2 controls a clearance-related gene expression program <italic>in vivo.</italic></title>
<p id="P11">H3K27me3 is mediated by PRC2, which has a well-established role in the regulation of cell differentiation during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Similar to neurons and other cell types, microglia express all of the core components of PRC2: EZH1, EZH2, EED, and SUZ12 (data not shown). Enrichment of mRNAs encoding the H3K27me3-specific demethylases, KDM6A/B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> in cbMg (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) as well as the up-regulation of <italic>Kdm6a/b</italic> in microglia upon exposure to dying cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10g</xref>) point to the possible role of PRC2/H3K27me3 in suppressing clearance-promoting genes in stMg. The genome-wide analysis of H3K27me3 distribution in <italic>ex vivo</italic> isolated microglial nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>) showed that the majority of transcriptionally suppressed genes in microglia are associated with H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11a</xref>).

<p id="P12">To address the role of PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 in the suppression of clearance genes, we inactivated PRC2 specifically in microglia. PRC2 inactivation was achieved by the genetic ablation of EED, a core subunit of PRC2, which is essential for complex stability and catalytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.

The loss of H3K27me3 and the up-regulation of cbMg-enriched clearance genes in <italic>Eed</italic>-deficient stMg is accompanied by a significant down-regulation of a large number of stMg signature genes (313/643) implicated in the regulation of homeostatic surveillance functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Most of these down-regulated genes are H3K27me3-negative and are, therefore, not directly controlled by PRC2 in stMg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). The increase in clearance-associated genes and the reduction in surveillance-related genes in PRC2-deficient stMg are reminiscent of transcriptional changes observed in microglia during neurodegenerative disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11h</xref>). The shift of stMg from a surveillance state toward a more clearance-promoting cbMg-like state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>), while not affecting overall microglia numbers or morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11i</xref>), is associated with a significant increase in the stMg lysosomal content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P15">In contrast to stMg, H3K27me3 is not present at clearance-related gene loci in cbMg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>).

Accordingly, loss of PRC2 in cbMg, while following a similar temporal pattern of progressive PRC2 target gene induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11e</xref>), is associated with the up-regulation of selected stMg-enriched genes and the down-regulation of cbMg-enriched genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d,e</xref>). The changes in PRC2-deficient cbMg gene expression patterns are associated with enhanced cbMg-ramification, a reduction in cbMg lysosomal content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>), and an increased number of cCASP3+ cells in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g</xref>).

<title>Aberrant expression of clearance-specific genes in striatal microglia has a negative impact on striatal neuron morphology and function</title>
<p id="P16">We found that the switch in PRC2-deficient stMg from the surveillance to a more clearance-promoting phenotype has a profound impact on striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) morphology and associated behaviors. Quantitative spine analysis of MSNs revealed a significant reduction in spine numbers in mice with <italic>Eed</italic>-deficient microglia as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Notably, changes in MSN spine numbers are not caused by the overall negative effect of <italic>Eed</italic>-deficient microglia on MSN survival.

<p id="P17">The changes in spine density of MSNs are associated with alterations in specific MSN-controlled behaviors.

The induction of behavioral locomotor sensitization in response to cocaine depends on the structural plasticity of MSNs and is associated with lasting changes in MSN spine density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. PRC2 deficiency in cbMg, on the other hand, has no significant impact on cerebellar Purkinje cell spine numbers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12e</xref>) and cerebellum-dependent behaviors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P18">Like in the striatum, we found that loss of PRC2 activity in cortical microglia (cxMg) is associated with a similar switch towards a microglia clearance phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12g</xref>), including an increase in cxMg lysosomal content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12h</xref>).

<p id="P19">Disorders accompanied by alterations in spine numbers, including neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, are frequently associated with the development of anxiety and seizures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> and cognitive decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we found that loss of PRC2 activity in microglia leads to enhanced anxiety behavior in the open field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13a</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P20">The comparative analysis of microglia gene expression patterns in the striatum and cerebellum suggests the existence of two markedly different microglia phenotypes. The analysis of brain region-specific microglia heterogeneity requires a maximal approximation between the gene expression states <italic>in vivo</italic> and those obtained during various analytical procedures. We generated brain region-specific gene expression signatures of microglia by “extracting” microglial RNAs directly from mouse brain tissue. This approach is based on non-invasive Translating Ribosome-Associated Purification (TRAP) of mRNAs from specific cell types of interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and has several major advantages compared to the commonly used <italic>ex vivo</italic> microglia purification approaches. When comparing these approaches, we found that microglia isolation by FACS leads to the expression of numerous genes that are indicative of cell activation and that are barely detectable when measured by TRAP. In addition to the non-invasive nature of the TRAP approach, we applied a stringent bioinformatics step during data analysis that excludes genes that are not enriched in microglia as compared to the input brain tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> (Methods). Notably, this approach, while being well-suited to generate signatures of mRNAs enriched in microglia subpopulations in different brain areas, bears certain shortcomings as it may omit genes that are shared between microglia, neurons, astrocytes, or other cell types in the specific region. These differences should be considered when comparing data generated by TRAP to those generated from purified microglia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14a</xref>).</p>
<p id="P21">In our studies, we expanded the depth of the population-based microglia TRAP approach by using single microglia RNA sequencing analysis, which allows for further assessment of inter- and intra-populational microglia diversity. In these studies, we continued to adhere to less invasive approaches and used rapid nuclei purification from specific mouse brain regions followed by FACS-based isolation of the GFP+ microglial nuclei. We found that microglia nuclei isolation, in contrast to whole microglia cell purification, diminishes aberrant microglia activation. The cross-comparison between the microglia region-specific TRAP and single nuclei-based RNA expression patterns confirmed the distinct clearance-supporting phenotype in cbMg. Moreover, single microglia nuclei-based analysis allowed us to exclude perivascular macrophages <italic>(Cx3cr1</italic>+, <italic>Tmem119</italic>-, and <italic>P2ry12-</italic>low)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> as potential factors driving the cbMg clearance-promoting gene expression signature.</p>
<p id="P22">In particular, a significant fraction of the cbMg-expressed genes have been implicated in the detection, engulfment, and catabolism of debris both in peripheral macrophages carrying out cell clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> as well as in microglia associated with ageing and neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Recent evidence suggests that microglia can sense and clear apoptotic cells at the earliest stages of apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. This process, often referred to as efferocytosis, is a multi-step process: (i) the recognition of “eat-me” signals presented by apoptotic cells, (ii) engulfment of cells/debris, (iii) degradation of engulfed material, and (iv) excretion of metabolic products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The expression of numerous efferocytosis/clearance-associated genes in cbMg comprises a set that encodes transcription factors implicated in the regulation of macrophage polarization, clearance, and differentiation, including AHR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, TFEC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, and RARG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. These transcription factors are also induced upon exposure to apoptotic cells as well as in the <italic>Eed</italic>-deficient stMg, which acquire an aberrant clearance phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P23">Our findings suggest that the cerebellum displays relatively higher levels of cell loss as compared to the striatum or cortex. While dying cells in the adult cerebellum cannot be readily detected in the presence of microglia, we found that the ablation of microglia leads to an increase in the numbers of cCASP3+ apoptotic cells in the cerebellum. This scenario is compatible with the rapid microglia-mediated removal of dying neurons in the subventricular zone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> as well as apoptotic thymocytes during T-cell development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. While most of the newly generated neurons/T-cells undergo apoptotic cell death, the dying cells cannot be readily detected due to their rapid removal by resident macrophages/microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Consistent with this model, microglia in the cerebellum are likely to contribute to the effective removal of dying cells. Accordingly, we found that both the deletion of microglia as well as the attenuation of their cell clearance capability are associated with the accumulation of dying cells in the cerebellum but not in the striatum or the cortex. The clearance activity of cbMg is further supported by recent live imaging data from adult mice showing significantly decreased parenchymal surveillance activity of cbMg as compared to forebrain microglia <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. In parallel, we and others found that acutely isolated cbMg are significantly more efficient in the uptake of apoptotic cells or other biological materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Notably, while these data strongly imply the enhanced clearance activity of cbMg in the healthy brain, a comparative analysis that quantifies the levels of phagocytic activity in individual cbMg versus stMg <italic>in vivo</italic> is still needed.</p>
<p id="P24">We found that the cbMg-specific clearance gene expression pattern significantly overlaps with the signature of microglia associated with neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> and early brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, two stages of life characterized by enhanced neuronal attrition and heightened microglia clearance activity. In addition to the induction of cell clearance genes, the cbMg are further characterized by a significant reduction in homeostatic microglia genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. This is another key characteristic feature of early microglia progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> as well as microglia exposed to dying neurons during different diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Notably, one of the commonalities between the three previously discussed microglia phenotypes—microglia during early development, disease-associated microglia, and cbMg—is their likely active involvement in the clearance of apoptotic cells and cellular debris. Hence, we speculate that the similarities in their gene expression profiles may be driven by the activation of a microglia clearance function in response to dying cells.</p>
<p id="P25">While we consider the differential exposure to dying cells as a major contributor to regional microglia specification, we cannot fully exclude the potential impact of other cues, including region-specific differences in neuronal activity, neurotransmitter release, and other microglia-recognized ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. However, in strong support of a causal contribution of ongoing cerebellar cell death to the induction of the cbMg clearance phenotype, we found that the exposure of forebrain microglia to dying cells <italic>in vitro</italic> leads to a progressive induction of some of the key microglia cbMg-enriched clearance genes, including <italic>Colec12, Lilrb4</italic>, and <italic>Apoe</italic>. Our findings are supported by data from Krasemann et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> showing an induction of selected cbMg-enriched clearance genes in cortical microglia upon injection of dead cells into the healthy mouse brain <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14c</xref>). Overall, our data support the instructive nature of the cbMg phenotype, where continuous exposure to dying cells leads to the expression of genes that support cell clearance function. Our data also suggest that the exposure to and clearance of dying cells induces a distinct pattern of clearance-associated genes that is not intrinsically linked to the activation of pro-inflammatory genes. The lack of inflammatory gene activation in cbMg suggests that the microglia clearance activity may antagonize/suppress the activation of inflammatory genes in a fashion that has been observed in peripheral macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In such a scenario, active clearance of cell debris in cbMg may lead to tolerance of cbMg against self, and thereby preclude potential damaging effects of an aberrant attack by activated cbMg on healthy cerebellar neurons. Consequently, there could be a mechanistic dissociation between the induction of clearance gene expression and microglia pro-inflammatory activation observed during neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, which may be mediated by additional cues from the local environment.</p>
<p id="P26">Our data also show that microglia clearance function, while important for the removal of dying cells, must be tightly controlled in other brain regions to avoid microglia-mediated damage of healthy neurons. We found that the transcriptional silencing of some of the clearance-related genes correlates directly with the abundance of the major suppressive histone modification H3K27me3 in stMg. The possible causal role of H3K27me3 in suppressing clearance-promoting genes in microglia is supported at several levels. First, the clearance-specific genes display negligible amounts of H3K27me3 in cbMg as compared to stMg. Moreover, exposure of forebrain microglia to dying cells <italic>in vitro</italic> increases the expression of the H3K27me3-specific demethylases, <italic>Kdm6a/b</italic>, and is associated with the progressive activation of cbMg-enriched clearance genes. While a potential demethylase-independent function of KDM6B can not be excluded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, recent studies using a small molecule-based inhibitor specifically targeting KDM6A/B demethylase activity revealed that H3K27 demethylation, and more specifically KDM6A/B catalytic activity, are critical determinants of pro-inflammatory gene activation in human primary macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Based on these data, it is plausible that clearance gene expression in microglia is controlled in a KDM6A/B/H3K27me3-dependent fashion and that the induction of clearance genes is associated with a targeted reduction in H3K27me3 levels at specific clearance gene loci <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p id="P27">Our data show that PRC2 plays an important role in the maintenance of region-specific functional specification of microglia. The lack of H3K27me3 leads to slow but progressive transcriptional changes in all <italic>Eed</italic>-deficient microglia subpopulations analyzed. The delay between the inactivation of PRC2 and PRC2-target gene induction in stMg, cxMg, and cbMg mimics our previous findings in neurons and is likely based on the combination of slow histone H3 protein turnover, as well as the slow catalytic activity of the H3K27me3 demethylases, KDM6A/B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. While following a similar temporal pattern, the nature of PRC2-controlled target genes differs among the microglia subpopulations. In the striatum, deficiency in <italic>Eed</italic> leads to up-regulation of specific clearance-associated genes and transcription factors. Only a small fraction of PRC2-controlled genes in stMg overlap with genes induced in PRC2-deficient cbMg or cxMg (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P28">Aberrant intrinsic activation of clearance phenotypes in PRC2-deficient microglia in the striatum and cortex is associated with alterations in neuronal spines. The observed microglia-mediated reduction in spine numbers resembles the patterns of spine alterations caused by pathological microglia activation in mouse models of Alzheimer’s Disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. While PRC2-deficient stMg and cxMg show no up-regulation of complement or pro-inflammatory genes generally associated with microglia activation during neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, it is still plausible that their aberrant clearance activity may lead to the enhanced engulfment of C1q/C3-tagged spines, the presence of which increases with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Aberrant synaptic pruning might also be mediated in a complement-independent fashion by TAM receptors, which can bind exposed phosphatidylserine on synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. At the same time, it is possible that the reduction in spine density reflects the down-regulation of stMg-enriched surveillance genes promoting spine formation and/or maintenance in the adult brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P29">The ability of aberrant intrinsically activated microglia to cause neuronal damage is further supported by recent findings showing that cell-autonomous activation of the RAF–MEK–ERK pathway in microglia leads to the loss of synapses and the development of a severe late-onset neurodegenerative disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Notably, the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade has been intrinsically linked to the regulation of PRC2 activity at several levels. While the loss of PRC2 activity is associated with reduced MEK-ERK activation in ES cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, the inhibition of MEK-ERK activity leads to attenuated PRC2 chromatin association on PRC2 target genes in these cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. On the other hand, increased activation of the MEK-ERK pathway has been linked to <italic>Ezh2</italic> overexpression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Increased EZH2 expression/activity is associated with a genome-wide redistribution of H3K27me3 that includes the loss of H3K27me3 and the transcriptional activation of numerous PRC2 suppressed genes in these cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Furthermore, aberrantly activated EZH2 was recently found to synergistically cooperate with hyperactive BRAF in the regulation of tumorigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is possible that neuronal damage caused by the aberrant activation of the RAS-MEK-ERK pathway in microglia may reflect a role of this pathway in PRC2–mediated aberrant microglia clearance activity.</p>
<p id="P30">Our studies underscore the causal contribution of aberrant microglia clearance activation to neuronal damage and complex behavioral alterations associated with neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. The development of novel approaches to control microglia clearance activity via targeting specific epigenetic or signaling mechanisms may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of neurological diseases. Our studies may also have implications for the understanding of well-described brain region-specific susceptibilities to different neurodegenerative disorders. For example, the cerebellum appears to be particularly resistant to Aβ accumulation and neurodegeneration during Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. It is tempting to speculate that the enhanced cbMg clearance activity may contribute to more efficient clearance of Aβ aggregates and damaged cells in the absence of inflammation.</p>

Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI medium (Gibco 11875) supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, and 1% Penicillin-streptomycin. On the day of microglia treatment, Jurkat cells were transferred to fresh growth medium at 1 million/ml and treated with 1 μM Staurosporine for 3 hours.

The cells were then washed with PBS and resuspended in microglia medium at 10 million/ml. Primary microglia from the cerebellum and striatum of adult mice that were cultured for 5h were given an equal number of pHrodo-labeled EAJ. Cell confluency was determined using IncuCyte Live-Cell Analysis System and Software (Essen BioScience, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA). Cells pretreated with 2 μM Cytochalasin D (Sigma-Aldrich, C8273) for 30 min before and during the incubation of microglia with pHrodo-EAJ were used as a negative control. After 3 hours, the supernatant was discarded and microglia were trypsinized. Pooled wells were collected in one tube, centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in 500 μl 1% BSA in PBS with 1μg/ml DAPI and placed on ice. 10,000-20,000 events were recorded on an LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences). To quantify the uptake of pHrodo-labeled EAJ, events were gated on the SSC-A and FSC-A to exclude debris and then on GFP+ microglia to quantify the percent of GFP+/pHrodo+ cells.

<p id="P51">RNA clean-up from isolated microglial cells (50,000), TRAP samples and 5% of the unbound fractions from TRAP samples was performed using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity was assayed using an RNA Pico chip on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), and only samples with RIN&gt;9 were considered for subsequent analysis. Double-stranded cDNA was generated from 1-5 ng of RNA using Nugen Ovation V2 kit (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions. Fragments of 200 bp were obtained by sonicating 500 ng of cDNA per sample using the Covaris-S2 system (Duty cycle: 10%, Intensity: 5.0, Bursts per second: 200, Duration: 120 seconds, Mode: Frequency sweeping, Power: 23W, Temperature: 5.5°C - 6°C, Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA). Subsequently, these fragments were used to produce libraries for sequencing by TruSeq DNA Sample kit (Ilumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following manufacturer’s instructions.

<title>Fear Conditioning</title>
<p id="P83">In a standard fear conditioning paradigm (Med Associates), the test chamber (neutral context) was made of clear Plexiglas. The bottom of the test chamber was a grid floor used to deliver a mild electric foot shock. The test chamber was placed inside a sound-attenuated chamber. One mouse was placed in the test chamber (house lights on) and allowed to explore freely for 200 sec. A white noise (80 dB), which served as the conditioned stimulus, was then presented for 18 sec, followed by a mild (2 sec, 0.5 mA) foot shock, which served as the unconditioned stimulus. The same sequence of auditory cue-shock pairing was repeated two more times with 2-minute intervals. The mouse was removed from the chamber 30 sec later and returned to its home cage. Freezing behavior was recorded every 10 sec during the time spent in the test chamber. Chambers were cleaned with ethanol between experiments. 24 hours later, the mouse was placed back into the test chamber for 3 min, and the presence of freezing behavior was recorded (context test). Two hours later, the mouse was tested for its freezing response to the auditory cue. Environmental and contextual cues were changed for the auditory cue test: a white Plexiglas circular insert was placed in the chamber to alter its shape, spatial cues and color; the wire grid floor was covered with white Plexiglas; and the chamber was wiped with isopropanol to alter the smell. The auditory cue test was divided into two phases. During the first phase, freezing behavior was recorded for 99 sec in the absence of the auditory cue. In the second phase, the auditory cue was turned on, and freezing was recorded for another 60 sec. The number of freezing intervals for each test was measured by Video Freeze Software (Med Associates) and converted to a percentage of freezing value per component time. 15-month-old C<italic>x3cr1<sup>CreErt2/+</sup>; Eed<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and their respective littermate controls (n=11 control and 10 mutant) were tested.</p>
