<p id="P3">Human brain organoids generated with current technologies recapitulate histological features of the human brain, but they lack a reproducible topographic organization. During development, spatial topography is determined by gradients of signaling molecules released from discrete signaling centers. We hypothesized that introduction of a signaling center into forebrain organoids would specify the positional identity of neural tissue in a distance-dependent manner. Here, we present a system to trigger a sonic hedgehog (SHH) protein gradient in developing forebrain organoids that enables ordered self-organization along dorso-ventral and antero-posterior positional axes. SHH-patterned forebrain organoids establish major forebrain subdivisions that are positioned with <italic>in vivo</italic>-like topography. Consistent with its behavior <italic>in vivo</italic>, SHH exhibits long-range signaling activity in organoids. Finally, we use SHH-patterned cerebral organoids as a tool to study the role of cholesterol metabolism in SHH signaling. Together, this work identifies inductive signaling as an effective organizing strategy to recapitulate <italic>in vivo</italic>-like topography in human brain organoids.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="P4">Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have the intrinsic capacity to self-organize into multicellular organ-like structures called organoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Brain organoids recapitulate the cellular diversity and micro-architectural features characteristic of discrete brain regions, providing unprecedented opportunities to model human brain development and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. However, in these organoids, individual brain regions are ordered randomly, non-reproducibly and lack the characteristic <italic>in vivo</italic> anterior-posterior, dorso-ventral, and medio-lateral positioning that supports the emergence of complex brain structure and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.

Region-specific organoids attempt to overcome positional heterogeneity by restricting cellular identities to a single brain area such as the optic cup<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, adenohypophysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, forebrain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, midbrain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, or hindbrain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, using bath-application of patterning factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.

<title>Establishing a SHH protein gradient in 3D hPSC culture</title>
<p id="P6">Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) is a signaling factor whose graded expression specifies the spatial organization of discrete progenitor domains across the neuraxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. To test whether introduction of a SHH signaling gradient into developing forebrain organoids could specify positional domains, we engineered an inducible SHH-expressing hPSC line (iSHH) that could be embedded at one pole of a developing organoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The iSHH line was generated by TALEN-mediated gene targeting into the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus of an hPSC line with constitutive RFP expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. A constitutively active reverse tetracycline transactivator is expressed from one allele of the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus, while full-length human <italic>SHH</italic> is expressed from the other allele, under the control of a tetracycline response element (TRE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This strategy resulted in titratable <italic>SHH</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and commensurate post-translational palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>). The iSHH line induced robust expression of the SHH target gene <italic>FOXA2</italic> during neural differentiation in the presence of doxycycline, indicating appropriate biological activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">We next developed a method to embed iSHH cells at one pole of an hPSC spheroid, mimicking a developmental organizer. First, 1,000 iSHH cells were seeded in low-attachment round bottom microwells and allowed to aggregate for 24 hours (day −2 to −1). The next day 10,000 wild-type H9 hPSC were seeded on top of the iSHH cells (day −1 to 0) and allowed to aggregate for another 24 hours, resulting in a reproducible chimeric iSHH-H9 spheroid in which a small cluster of iSHH cells are embedded within a larger spheroid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref>, &gt;90% efficiency). We refer to these chimeric 3D hPSC cultures as SHH-spheroids. For the specific induction of forebrain identity, we devised a strategy that combines aspects of several previous organoid induction protocols. In brief, SHH-spheroids were cultured in the presence of inhibitors of TGFβ, BMP, and WNT (3-inhibitor protocol) for 6-8 days to promote specification of anterior forebrain identity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. After 6-8 days of differentiation, spheroids were embedded in matrigel droplets to promote neuroepithelial organization and moved to an orbital shaker upon outgrowth of neuroepithelial buds, which was typically 4-6 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1c</xref>). Doxycycline (400ng/ml) was added to the differentiation medium starting at day 0 to induce an asymmetric SHH signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Under those conditions, the iSHH-organizer typically remained positioned at one end of the developing organoid, though we observed small clusters of organizer cells separated from the main organizer in 25% of instances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1d</xref>). To assess whether this strategy generates a gradient of SHH protein, we performed immunocytochemistry at day 4 of the differentiation. In the absence of doxycycline, no SHH protein was detectable. In the presence of doxycycline, high levels of SHH expression were detected in the region of the iSHH cells, and the abundance of SHH protein was reduced as a function of distance from the SHH-organizer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>).</p>

<title>Specification of developmental axes in SHH-organoids</title>
<p id="P8">Functional subdivisions in the mammalian forebrain are located at discrete positions within a Cartesian coordinate system, whose axes are arranged in the dorso-ventral, medio-lateral, and antero-posterior directions. Each of the dorso-ventral and antero-posterior domains can be identified by the expression of characteristic transcription factors. PAX6 is expressed in the dorsal forebrain and NKX2.1 in the ventral forebrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). FOXG1 is expressed in the anterior forebrain, or telencephalon, while it is absent from the posterior forebrain, or diencephalon. In contrast, OTX2 is expressed in the diencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). When we differentiated H9 spheroids or SHH-spheroids in the absence of doxycycline, they predominantly expressed PAX6 and FOXG1 within self-organized neuroepithelium, in agreement with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g,h</xref>). This indicates that the default identity of our 3D cultures is dorsal-anterior forebrain, which gives rise to the neocortex. SHH-spheroids grown in the presence of doxycycline (400 ng/ml) induced NKX2.1 near the organizer, while PAX6 expression was suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">Surprisingly, FOXG1 expression was also suppressed near the organizer, while OTX2 expression was maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>), suggesting that SHH can lead to posterior forebrain specification. We therefore examined the expression of TCF7L2, which is expressed in the diencephalon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and SIX3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, which is expressed in optic recess and hypothalamus, in SHH organoids. Both TCF7L2 and SIX3 were induced near organizer tissue, supporting a role for SHH in anterior-posterior patterning, as well as dorsoventral patterning. SHH exhibited dose-dependent induction of <italic>DKK1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref>), a secreted antagonist that shapes the anterior-posterior WNT gradient <italic>in vivo</italic>, that is commonly induced in regions of high WNT/β–catenin activity and that is a critical regulator of anterior-posterior patterning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Thus, SHH might exert anterior-posterior patterning activity via regulation of WNT signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Topographic organization of SHH-organoids</title>
<p id="P10">Given that a SHH protein gradient could specify distinct dorso-ventral and antero-posterior positional domains, we next sought to determine whether the resulting forebrain subdivisions were aligned according to an anatomically appropriate topography. The position of the presumptive forebrain subdivisions <italic>in vivo</italic> can be defined by their distance from the SHH source in the hypothalamus. The neocortex (PAX6+/FOXG1+) represents the anterior and dorsal subdivision of the forebrain which is located most distal from the SHH source. Just ventral to the neocortex is the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) characterized by the co-expression expression of GSH2+/FOXG1+, followed by the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) characterized by co-expression of NKX2.1+/FOXG1+, the antero-dorsal hypothalamus characterized by expression of NKX2.2+, and finally the ventro-posterior hypothalamus characterized by the expression of NKX2.1+/FOXG1-, representing the brain region located most ventral and proximal to the SHH source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">When differentiated in the presence of doxycycline (400 ng/ml), SHH-spheroids formed at least five topographically distinct presumptive forebrain domains. Quantification of the distance of forebrain domains from the SHH-organizer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), identified by protein expression, revealed that the positioning of these domains mimics the pattern observed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Topographic organization could be triggered in a similar manner in at least five additional hPSC or iPSC lines using the same H9-based iSHH organizer, though the specific growth rates and size of regional domains could differ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). We next identified presumptive neocortical (FOXG1+/PAX6+), LGE (GSH2+), MGE (FOXG1+/NKX2.1+), anterior hypothalamic (NKX2.2+) and ventro-posterior hypothalamic (NKX2.1+/FOXG1-) regions by immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). FOXG1 expression was absent from the organizer tissue itself, but robust expression of NKX2.1 was observed in at least a subset of the organizer cells, suggesting hypothalamic identity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4a</xref>). The resulting topographic patterning is in contrast to the patterning exerted by bath application of SHH agonist to forebrain organoids, which results in subpallium-restricted identities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Topographic patterning could also be achieved in the absence of matrigel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4b</xref>). SHH-spheroids differentiated in the absence of doxycycline expressed markers of dorsal-anterior forebrain, including PAX6 and FOXG1, with a small proportion of GSH2 expressing cells. These 3D cultures in the absence of doxycycline did not express the ventral identity genes NKX2.1 and NKX2.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P12">Interestingly, tissue cytoarchitecture differed between areas that are proximal (hypothalamic-like) and distal (telencephalic-like) to the SHH source. At day 20, PAX6+ distal neuroepithelia acquired circular, rosette-like morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>, inset), consistent with the self-organizing radial structures described for forebrain organoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In contrast, the NKX2.1+ proximal region contained many thin and highly extended neuroepithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>, inset) as observed previously for 3D structures of early hypothalamic lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. This appears to be restricted to diencephalic NKX2.1+ regions, as presumptive MGE domains (FOXG1+/NKX2.1+) typically acquired circular, rosette-like morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4c</xref>). Our data indicate that an asymmetric SHH cue enables the ordered patterning and topographical organization of brain regions without interfering in the self-organization process, which leads to the establishment of region-specific tissue microarchitectures. We term these 3D cultures SHH-organoids.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>Cell-type diversity within SHH-organoids</title>
<p id="P13">To explore the degree to which topography is maintained over time, we cultured SHH-organoids for up to 70 days. FOXG1+ and OTX2+ domains remained largely discrete at this stage, typically with the OTX2+ domain located proximal to the organizer, while the FOXG1+ domain was located distal to the organizer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5a</xref>). Radially organized PAX6, TBR2, TBR1 cerebral cortex-like tissue and DARPP32+ striatum-like tissue emerged in distal domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5b-d</xref>), while hypothalamic-like tissue, expressing LHX6, OTP, POMC, and TH, was found in the immediate vicinity of the organizer cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5d-f</xref>). In some instances organoid topography was more difficult to discern because the organizer seemed to have dispersed throughout the tissue. In addition, tissue necrosis in the center of those larger organoids may degrade organization over time.</p>
<p id="P14">The identity of LHX6+ cells including the presence of cortical interneurons was further defined by differentiating SHH-organoids using an <italic>LHX6</italic>-citrine hPSC line. As expected, LHX6+, putative hypothalamic precursors, emerge near the organizer, with some cells co-expressing NKX2.1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6a</xref>). A subset of LHX6+ cells co-expresses FOXG1+ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6b</xref>), while a subset is negative for FOXG1, suggesting the presence of both MGE and hypothalamic LHX6 lineages. Some FOXG1+/LHX6+ cells exhibit a leading-process morphology characteristic of migrating interneurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6c</xref>). Cells expressing SST, PV, or CR were observed in SHH-organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6d-f</xref>), suggesting the emergence of diverse interneuron populations. However, PV+ cells did not co-express LHX6 indicating that those PV+ cells many not represent cortical interneurons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>Mechanism of long-range SHH signaling</title>
<p id="P15">We next sought insight into the mechanisms by which a SHH signaling gradient establishes forebrain topography. Using the suppression of PAX6 as a read-out of SHH signaling activity, we compared the radial extent of PAX6 suppression in 2D versus 3D cultures. High-dox conditions (2mg/ml) were used in assessing SHH activity. In 3D cultures, we observe the suppression of PAX6 expression at an average distance of 335 ± 54 μm from the organizer tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Interestingly, this range is similar to the distances reported for SHH signaling <italic>in vivo</italic> based on studies across multiple tissues of the developing mouse or chick embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. However, in 2D cultures in which a similar 1:10 ratio of iSHH to wildtype cells is maintained, we saw suppression of PAX6 at much shorter average distances (75 ± 31 μm) from the SHH source tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">The observation that the range of SHH signaling activity is restricted in 2D raises the question how SHH establishes long-range gradients in 3D. We generated 2 theoretical models based on known mechanisms of SHH signaling <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The first model is a concentration-dependent model. In this model, SHH signaling activity is determined by the local concentration of SHH morphogen, and is dependent on mechanisms that can transport SHH protein over long distances, such as diffusion, facilitated transport, or cell-to-cell relay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The second model is a temporal model. In this model, SHH signaling is restricted to tissue immediately adjacent to the source, which is relieved of SHH signaling as tissue grows away from the source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Tissue that grows away from a SHH source will record a brief duration of signaling activity, while tissue that remains near the SHH source will record a long duration of signaling activity. This temporal model does not rely on transport of SHH over long distances.</p>
<p id="P17">To experimentally test these models, we embedded the iSHH organizer within a circumscribed ring of GFP-expressing hPSCs. This was achieved by sequential plating of 1,000 iSHH cells, followed by 1,000 GFP cells 8 hours later, followed by 10,000 H9 cells the next day. We reasoned that if the activity of SHH extends past the GFP boundary, this would support a long-range concentration-dependent mechanism. On the other hand, if the GFP boundary expands coincident with the extent of SHH activity, this would support a temporal model in which tissue growth rather than protein transport establishes long-range SHH activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). After growing SHH-GFP-organoids for 20 days in doxycycline (2mg/ml), we observed that the GFP-expressing cells stayed within 285 ± 44 μm to the SHH organizer cells. The activity of SHH, determined as suppression of PAX6 expression, extended to 430 ± 96 μm, past the green boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). These data provide evidence for a concentration-dependent signaling mechanism in which SHH protein is transported long distances away from producing cells. Still, because the long-range SHH signal degrades in 2D culture while a short-range signal persists, our data do not exclude the possibility of a concurrent short-range signaling mechanism in which the activity SHH is restricted to the immediate vicinity of producing cells. In fact, during limb patterning, SHH is known to act by both short- and long-range signaling mechanisms, and such an interplay of short- and long-range signaling may also be critical during forebrain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>SHH-organoids as a model of neurodevelopment</title>
<p id="P18">The reproducible topography of SHH-organoids might make them suitable as a tool to study signaling mechanisms during early forebrain patterning. Cholesterol is integrally linked to the SHH pathway in many ways. Cholesterol is an agonist of the smoothened receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. SHH long-range signaling is dependent on the cholesterol post-translational modification of SHH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, cholesterol rich lipid rafts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, and can be facilitated by cholesterol-rich macromolecular soluble complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P19">To explore the multifaceted relationship of cholesterol to SHH signaling, we treated SHH-organoids (400ng/ml doxycycline) from day 0-10 with small molecules that inhibit cholesterol synthesis at different points along the biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). AY9944 is a specific inhibitor of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7), which facilitates the terminal step of cholesterol synthesis. Lovastatin is an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, an early step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Cyclopamine, a Smoothened antagonist that blocks all SHH activity, was used as a control. At day 20 in the no drug condition, SHH-organoids established distinct positional domains marked by the expression of PAX6, GSH2, NKX2.2, and NKX2.1 at discrete distances from the SHH-organizer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). As expected, SHH-organoids grown in the presence of cyclopamine (1 μM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>) were nearly uniform for PAX6 expression, with some GSH2 expression, consistent with a near complete inhibition of SHH signaling activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>). AY9944 (1.25 μM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>) treatment reduced the efficacy and range of SHH signaling activity, shifting the organoid to a more dorsal identity. NKX2.2 induction was largely blocked, while cells just adjacent to the organizer expressed GSH2 and PAX6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>). Lovastatin (5 μM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>) treatment caused similar, but milder effects, than AY9944. There was a partial block in NKX2.2 induction, with concomitant increase in GSH2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>), consistent with a dorsal shift and reduction in the efficacy and range of SHH signaling activity. Notably, the organizer cells retained diencephalic NKX2.1 expression in the presence of AY9944 or lovastatin but not cyclopamine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7a</xref>), suggesting that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis has minimal impact on local SHH activity.</p>
<p id="P20">In addition to the effects on patterning, all drugs affected organoid growth. Overall organoid size was reduced in all treatment conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b,c</xref>). However, AY9944 and Lovastatin did not reduce the size of the organizer itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7b</xref>), consistent with the interpretation that cholesterol-synthesis inhibition has differential effects on local and long-range SHH activity. To dissociate growth and patterning phenotypes, we analyzed organoids at day 6, during the early stages of SHH patterning, and prior to the major phase of tissue growth (which occurs after matrigel embedding). We used NKX2.2, a direct target of GLI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, as a read-out of SHH signaling activity. By measuring the distance at which NKX2.2 is expressed from the SHH producing cells, we could infer the distance of SHH signaling activity. Lovastatin reduced the distance at which NKX2.2 is induced from the organizer in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). AY9944 strongly inhibited NKX2.2 induction at all concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7c</xref>). Neither AY9944 nor lovastatin grossly perturbed processing of SHH peptide length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7d</xref>). Together, these data support a model in which inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by Lovastatin or AY9944 result in a complex developmental phenotype characterized by impaired growth and a reduction in the range of SHH signaling activity, though perhaps in distinct ways.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P21">This study reveals that an asymmetric morphogenetic cue provides positional information from which <italic>in vivo</italic>-like topography can emerge in brain organoids. Furthermore, we present evidence that SHH uses a long-range signaling mechanism during forebrain organoid development, recapitulating its <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. The emergence of long-range activity in 3D that is not present in 2D cultures highlights the importance of tissue geometry on the spatial dynamics of signaling activity.</p>
<p id="P22">The strategy of generating topographically patterned organoids allowed us to investigate how alterations in cholesterol metabolism perturb SHH-dependent patterning. Our data suggest that while both AY9944 and Lovastatin impair SHH-dependent patterning, they may do so in different ways. AY9944 has previously been shown to block Smoothened activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, consistent with the reduction in NKX2.2 induction at day 6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7c</xref>). On the other hand, Lovastatin reduced the range of SHH signaling at day 6 without reducing the intensity of signaling. While future studies are required to determine mechanism of action, there are multiple possible explanations for this observation. First, statin treatment could disrupt lipid raft integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, which is required for long-range hedgehog signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> and perhaps SHH oligomerization at the membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Second, statins could lead to removal of the C-terminal SHH cholesterol modification, which is required for long-range signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. While it is unlikely that statins block the initial cholesterylation of SHH during auto-cleavage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, SHH can subsequently lose its C-terminal cholesterol through proteolytic cleavage, or ‘shedding’, at the cell membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Notably, disruption of lipid rafts by sterol-reduction, either with statins or methyl-β-cyclodextrin, increases shedding of multiple membrane-associated proteins, including SHH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Third, statin treatment could reduce the formation of cholesterol-rich multimeric SHH complexes involved in long-range transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Finally, it is possible that statins perturb SHH patterning through isoprenoid pathway inhibition or off-target effects given the high concentration of drug used. Statins have been reported to be associated with fetal maldevelopment, including holoprosencephaly, in a small number of cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Our data suggest that some of these cases may be due to impaired SHH signaling, although caution must be exercised given the high concentration of statin used in our experiments (5μM) compared to the typical plasma concentration of statin (15-20 nM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P23">A key feature of the patterning strategy presented here is the establishment of well-ordered positional domains during early organoid development. In future studies it will be important to determine the extent to which the topography of these domains can be retained during long-term <italic>in vitro</italic> culture for the study of region-specific neuronal diversity as well as connectivity and function. It is possible that additional tissue engineering approaches will be required to facilitate the maintenance of topography over time and to prevent increasing cell mixing or inappropriate migration, processes that could blur the boundaries between positional domains over time. For example, manipulating soluble ECM components has been used to improve the maintenance of radially organized structures within organoids over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P24">For disease modeling, current organoid technologies have been successful at modeling cortical progenitor dynamics that ultimately result in changes in brain size. Pre-patterning and fusion of pallial- and subpallial-specific spheroids have been used to study specific phenotypes related to cortical interneuron migration and connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The establishment of forebrain topography in organoids shown here opens the possibility of studying a wide range of phenotypes in a single organoid system. In particular, it would be interesting to study complex neurodevelopmental diseases that have been hypothesized to alter or derive from regional specification during forebrain patterning, including autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>,or suprasellar pediatric gliomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. In the future it will important to develop strategies, such as bio-engineering approaches to reduce the variability of topography in long-term cultures. Finally, it will be exciting to test whether our strategy could be used as a general approach to establish topographies across all regions of the CNS beyond the forebrain.</p>

<title>Quantification of organoid patterning and SHH activity</title>
<p id="P30">Organoid topography was quantified by first dividing each image into a grid of 20μm × 20μm squares (day 20 analysis) or 5μm × 5μm squares (day 6 analysis) that form a Cartesian coordinate grid. Each square is a discrete region of interest (ROI) that is associated with an X and Y coordinate. The origin of the grid was calculated for each image as the “center of mass” of the iSHH-organizer cells: CM<sub>x</sub> = Σ m<sub>i</sub>x<sub>i</sub> / M and CM<sub>y</sub> = Σ m<sub>i</sub>y<sub>i</sub> / M, where m = grey value intensity of iSHH cells for individual ROIs, × or y = coordinate, and M = total intensity for all ROIs, and the sum includes all x or y coordinates in the image. Next, ROI’s that were positive for expression of a given protein (e.g. PAX6) were defined by thresholding staining intensity and determining ROIs with positive immunoreactivity. The linear distance from the origin to each ROI (sqrt((ROI<sub>x</sub>-CM<sub>x</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (ROI<sub>y</sub>-CM<sub>y</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)) was calculated. We attempted to analyze every sixth section for each regional marker per organoid (2-5 sections typically), thus sampling the organoids in 150μm intervals using uniform random sampling.</p>
<p id="P31">In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref> ROI frequencies are plotted as a function of distance from the center of mass. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3c</xref> the GFP shell distance is defined as the radial distance from the center of mass at which the ratio of GFP ROIs / DAPI ROIs drops below 35%. The SHH-activity distance is the radial distance from the center of mass to the edge of the PAX6-negative territory, defined as the distance at which the ratio of PAX6-negative ROIs / DAPI ROIs dropped below 95% (PAX6-negative ROIs were obtained by subtracting PAX6 thresholded pixels from DAPI thresholded pixels). The 35% and 95% parameters were determined prior to analysis as accurately cut off values by comparing with manual distance measurements. Area measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4b</xref> are determined by calculating the number of positive ROIs positive for a given gene (e.g. PAX6) divided by the ROIs positive for DAPI.
