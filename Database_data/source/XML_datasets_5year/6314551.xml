<abstract>
<p>Differential inclusion or skipping of microexons is an increasingly recognized class of alternative splicing events. However, the functional significance of microexons and their contribution to signaling diversity is poorly understood. The Met receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) modulates invasive growth and migration in development and cancer. Here, we show that microexon switching in the Arf6 guanine nucleotide exchange factor cytohesin-1 controls Met-dependent cell migration. Cytohesin-1 isoforms, differing by the inclusion of an evolutionarily conserved three-nucleotide microexon in the pleckstrin homology domain, display differential affinity for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (triglycine) and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (diglycine). We show that selective phosphoinositide recognition by cytohesin-1 isoforms promotes distinct subcellular localizations, whereby the triglycine isoform localizes to the plasma membrane and the diglycine to the leading edge. These data highlight microexon skipping as a mechanism to spatially restrict signaling and provide a mechanistic link between RTK-initiated phosphoinositide microdomains and Arf6 during signal transduction and cancer cell migration.</p>

<body><sec id="s01" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Met receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) coordinates invasive growth in response to its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). This is tightly regulated during development to promote a morphogenic program that is essential for liver development and migration of muscle precursors into the limb bud as well as wound healing in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gherardi et al., 2012</xref>). Under pathophysiological conditions, deregulated signaling by the Met RTK leads to enhanced cell migration and metastatic spread of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gherardi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parachoniak and Park, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knight et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The proinvasive properties of Met are tightly regulated by spatial localization of signaling complexes on subcellular compartments, including dorsal ruffles, invadopodia, lamellipodia, and endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maroun et al., 1999a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palamidessi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abella et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rajadurai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ménard et al., 2014</xref>). Each of these compartments possesses distinct morphological and molecular features. While Met recruits many different effectors, not all complexes are assembled at each subcellular location where Met is active and additional determinants must define the localization of different signaling complexes. For example, the plasma membrane is the predominant source of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) in the cell, however this lipid may be modified by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) to locally generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Whitman et al., 1988</xref>), thereby affecting local recruitment and activity of proteins possessing PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-binding domains.</p><p>The small GTPase Arf6 is critical for Met-dependent invasive growth, although the molecular mechanisms that link Met to Arf6 activation in cancer cells are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tushir and D’Souza-Schorey, 2007</xref>). Arf small GTPases are members of a superfamily of molecular switches that mediate changes in cell morphology, endomembrane traffic, and cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillingham and Munro, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Simanshu et al., 2017</xref>). Arf6 is unique among Arf proteins in that it localizes primarily to the plasma membrane and endosomes, as opposed to Arf1 and Arf3, which localize predominantly to the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donaldson and Jackson, 2011</xref>). Active, GTP-bound Arf6 modulates processes that are critical for cell migration and tumor metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muralidharan-Chari et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yoo et al., 2016</xref>). These include endosomal recycling of the Met RTK or integrin receptors, clathrin-independent endocytosis, and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Powelka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eyster et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parachoniak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ratcliffe et al., 2016</xref>). Like the majority of small GTPases, Arf6 cycles between an “off” GDP-bound state and an “on” GTP-bound state. Cycling between these states is enhanced by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which promote GDP release, and GTPase activation proteins, which promote hydrolysis of GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donaldson and Jackson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Simanshu et al., 2017</xref>). Subcellular localization of GEF and GTPase activation proteins imposes spatiotemporal regulation on small GTPase signaling, restricting activity to specific subcellular locations. However, the in vivo subcellular determinants for Arf6 activation remain to be fully defined.</p><p>Arf GEFs fall into seven families, three of which encompass putative Arf6 GEFs, including cytohesin (1–4), IQSEC (1–3), and PSD (1–4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casanova, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donaldson and Jackson, 2011</xref>). These families are defined by the presence of a Sec7 domain that enhances the release of GDP from Arf proteins. In addition, there are multiple splice variants of Arf GEFs. Some differ by an entire domain, whereas others involve microexons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ogasawara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukaya et al., 2016</xref>). The best-characterized microexon splice variants are two isoforms of cytohesin-2. These isoforms differ by a 3-nt microexon, whose splicing leads to an additional glycine residue within the cytohesin-2 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cronin et al., 2004</xref>), yet a functional difference for these has not been determined.</p><p>Microexons are a recently described class of exons that are ≤27-nt long and predominantly found in structured regions of proteins. Microexons are frequently identified in brain-derived transcripts, including cytohesin-2, and are alternatively regulated in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Irimia et al., 2014</xref>). However, their functional roles in other diseases, particularly cancer, are unknown. Furthermore, despite decades of research on signaling from RTKs, such as Met, the role of alternative splicing in generating multiple isoforms of downstream effectors is also largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate differential functions for cytohesin-1 isoforms whereby a splice variant of cytohesin-1 that lacks a 3-nt microexon has distinct phospholipid binding and is uniquely required for HGF-dependent cell migration. Thus, we provide a mechanistic understanding into the regulation of HGF-dependent cell migration by microexon skipping in a specific effector acting downstream of Met.</p></sec><sec id="s02" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>Cytohesin-1 regulates HGF-dependent cell migration</title><p>Stimulation of epithelial and many cancer cells with HGF promotes activation of the Met RTK and subsequent cellular morphological changes leading to enhanced cell migration. The migratory and invasive program induced by the Met RTK specifically requires the small GTPase Arf6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tushir and D’Souza-Schorey, 2007</xref>). Using previously described siRNAs targeting Arf family GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ratcliffe et al., 2016</xref>), we confirmed the role of Arf6 in Met-dependent rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. S1). However, the regulation of Arf6-dependent actin remodeling by Met is not fully understood. To identify Arf GEFs required for HGF-dependent cell migration, we measured the expression of putative Arf GEFs, which are defined by the presence of a Sec7 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donaldson and Jackson, 2011</xref>). We used HeLa cells, which have been extensively studied for both Met-dependent migration and Arf6-dependent cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palamidessi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parachoniak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frittoli et al., 2014</xref>). Out of 10 putative Arf GEFs, six were detectably expressed in HeLa cells, as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. S2 A). These include cytohesin-1, cytohesin-2, cytohesin-3, IQSEC1, IQSEC2, and PSD3.</p><p>To assess the effect of Arf GEFs on cell migration, each Arf GEF was independently reduced by siRNA-mediated silencing to ≤30% (Fig. S2 B), and cells were imaged every 15 min for 24 h in the presence and absence of HGF. Quantification of cell speed between 16 and 24 h after stimulation revealed that silencing of cytohesin-1 and IQSEC2 reduced HGF-dependent cell migration to 36% and 46% of control cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In contrast, silencing of IQSEC1 (also known as BRAG2) enhanced HGF-independent cell migration, with no further increase of cell speed observed following HGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This enhancement in cell speed is likely mediated by an increase in the cell surface levels of integrins caused by IQSEC1 silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moravec et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Cytohesin-1 depletion reduces HGF-dependent cell migration.

This implies that IQSEC2 depletion may have a more general effect on the actin cytoskeleton, while the effects of cytohesin-1 silencing in these cells are required for HGF/Met signaling and cell migration.</p><p>Met and Arf6 activity have each been implicated in breast cancer cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hashimoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knight et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2015</xref>). To establish if cytohesin-1 played a role in Met-dependent migration, the basal-like breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and HCC1143, which express cytohesin-1, cytohesin-2, and cytohesin-3, were investigated (Fig. S2 C). Migration speed of both cell lines is increased following HGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>), consistent with previous observations for MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rajadurai et al., 2012</xref>). Silencing cytohesin-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells increased cell migration, and there was a trend toward reduced HGF-dependent cell migration in HCC1143 cells, supporting a role for cell-type–specific effects for cytohesin-2. Silencing cytohesin-1 reduced HGF-dependent cell migration in both MDA-MB-231 and HCC1143 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>; and Fig. S2 D). Hence, we focused on cytohesin-1. The decreased migratory phenotype observed by siRNA-mediated depletion of cytohesin-1 was validated by generating HeLa cells with stable knockout (KO) of cytohesin-1 using the lentiCRISPR v2 system, with two independent guide RNAs targeting exon 2 of <italic>CYTH1</italic> (Fig. S2 D). When HGF-dependent cell migration was compared in three control and <italic>CYTH1</italic> KO clones, <italic>CYTH1</italic> KO phenocopied siRNA-mediated silencing of cytohesin-1, whereby all clones displayed reduced HGF-dependent migration speed when compared with control clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). We did not observe a significant difference in Met stability or Met, Akt, or Erk1/2phosphorylation between control and <italic>CYTH1</italic> KO cells upon HGF treatment (Fig. S3). These data support a model in which cytohesin-1 regulates HGF-dependent cell migration independently of known downstream signaling targets and may represent a novel pathway to Arf6 activation.</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>Diglycine cytohesin-1 regulates HGF-dependent cell migration and invasion</title><p>Cytohesin-1 belongs to a family of four proteins (cytohesin-1, cytohesin-2 [also known as ARNO], cytohesin-3 [also known as Grp1], and cytohesin-4). These proteins consist of a coiled-coiled domain, a Sec7 domain with Arf GEF activity, and a PH domain that selectively recognizes phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chardin et al., 1996</xref>). Two isoforms of cytohesin family members are expressed that differ by the inclusion of a evolutionarily conserved 3-nt microexon resulting in an additional glycine residue in the PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ogasawara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Irimia et al., 2014</xref>). We refer to these isoforms as diglycine and triglycine variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The microexons of cytohesin-1 and cytohesin-2 show similar inclusion (or percent spliced in [PSI]) values in HeLa cells (76% and 69%) and HCC1143 cells (66% and 66%) but different PSI values in MDA-MB-231 cells (93% and 45%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>), whereas cytohesin-3 shows a reduced PSI of 5% in HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cells and 21% in HCC1143 cells. To identify the splice variant of cytohesin-1 that mediates HGF-dependent cell migration, we generated a panel of stable cell lines expressing GFP-tagged isoforms or mutants of cytohesin-1 in the <italic>CYTH1</italic> KO cell background (Fig. S4 A). Under these conditions the diglycine GFP-CYTH1, but not triglycine GFP-CYTH1, rescued HGF-dependent cell migration when compared with empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Rescue was dependent on the nucleotide exchange activity of the diglycine isoform, as expression of a GFP-CYTH1 construct with a mutation of a glutamic acid essential for exchange activity (E157K) was unable to rescue HGF-dependent cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). In addition to a decrease in cell migration in 2D, CYTH1 KO reduced HGF dependent invasion through a 3D collagen matrix, which could be rescued by expressing the diglycine, but not triglycine, isoform of cytohesin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). Rescue of HGF-induced cell invasion is similarly dependent on the exchange activity of diglycine cytohesin-1, since the E157K cytohesin-1 mutant failed to rescue cell invasion in response to HGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). Given these observations, we propose that the diglycine isoform of cytohesin-1 acts downstream of the Met RTK and is required for cancer cell HGF-dependent migration and invasion.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Diglycine cytohesin-1 regulates HGF-dependent cell migration and invasion.

Consistently, in <italic>CYTH1</italic> KO cells, the percentage of cells with HGF-induced peripheral actin ruffles was reduced (51% in CTL versus 23% in KO).

This suggests that while the triglycine variant was unable to rescue HGF-dependent cell migration, overexpression of this isoform is sufficient to promote downstream signals that enhance membrane ruffling. Consistent with this, the GEF inactive E157K triglycine mutant showed decreased ability to promote peripheral actin ruffles (16%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and C</xref>).

The localization of cytohesin-1 at the periphery of the cell and known roles for Arf6 in endocytosis suggest that cytohesin-1 isoforms may differentially regulate Met endocytosis and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mayor et al., 2014</xref>).

Using multiple approaches, including structure function, live cell imaging, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic deletion, we find that a splice variant of cytohesin-1 lacking a 3-nt microexon is specifically required for HGF activation of Met RTK-dependent cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration.</p><p>Alternative splicing diversifies the number of possible transcripts from a single gene. Indeed, it is believed that ∼95% of multiexon genes undergo alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pan et al., 2008</xref>). While significant effort has been put into establishing the regulatory mechanisms of alternative splicing, the functional significance of many of these events remains unknown.

For example, microexons have been implicated in autism spectrum disorders, which is in keeping with their abundance in neuron-specific transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Irimia et al., 2014</xref>). In a small cohort of symptomatic neuroblastoma patients, a highly phosphorylated neuronal microexon–containing splice variant of the non-RTK Src is lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brugge et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pyper and Bolen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsunaga et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keenan et al., 2015</xref>).

However, a functional distinction between microexon splice variants has not been addressed. Here, we show by ITC and confocal microscopy that microexon splicing is a novel phosphoinositide switch whereby the shorter cytohesin-1 isoform lacking a single glycine residue (diglycine) binds PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> in vivo and the longer isoform (triglycine) binds PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Thus, the diglycine cytohesin-1 variant, but not triglycine cytohesin-1, is a molecular link between Met activation, PI3K signaling, Arf6, and HGF-dependent biology. Initial data from brain tissue indicated that triglycine PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding cytohesin-1 was the predominant isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ogasawara et al., 2000</xref>). However, recent analysis of RNA-sequencing data from a variety of tissues indicates that PSI values for the cytohesin-1 microexon can vary from 25% in liver and epithelial cells (predominantly diglycine) to &gt;95% in muscle and white blood cells (predominantly triglycine; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Irimia et al., 2014</xref>). These values may reflect a need for constitutive versus growth factor dependent activation of Arf proteins in different tissues. To our knowledge, our study is the first to characterize a functional difference between cytohesin-1 splice variants. This points to a key role for these proteins and their splicing in normal development and disease.</p><p>HGF stimulation of Met promotes PI3K activation and recruitment of diglycine cytohesin-1 to the leading edge for prolonged periods (60 min).

Lentiviral particles were produced by Lipo2000 transfection of EGFP-CYTH1, psPAX2, and pMD2.G vectors into 293T lines. Filtered supernatant containing lentiviral particles was then concentrated by adding 1 vol PEG8000 to 3 vol supernatant, incubating overnight at 4°C, centrifuging at 2,750 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4°C, and resuspending the pellet in DMEM. HeLa clonal population 1 expressing lentiCRISPR v2 gRNA3 was infected, and 2 d later, stable cell lines were selected and cultured in 10% FBS in DMEM and 600 µg/ml Hygromycin (10687010; Thermo Fisher). mCherry2-PTEN was generated by PCR amplifying mCherry2 (plasmid 54563; Addgene) and subcloning into pcDNA3 GFP-PTEN (plasmid 10759; Addgene) between BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. NEB Q5 site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the C124S mutant. Stable cell lines expressing mCherry2-PTEN WT or C124S were generated by transfecting pcDNA3 vectors and, after 48 h, culturing in standard media with 1.2 mg/ml G418. After 1 wk, mCherry2-positive cells were sorted by FACS, and the mCherry2<sup>+</sup> population was expanded.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Commercial antibodies to cytohesin-1 (2E11; mouse MA1-060) were obtained from Thermo Fisher; GAPDH (rabbit sc-25778) from Santa Cruz; GFP (rabbit A6455) from Life Technologies; and Akt (mouse 2920S), p-Akt1 (rabbit 9018S), p44/42 MAPK (mouse 9107S), p-p44/42 MAPK (T202/Y204; rabbit 9101L), Met (mouse 3127L), p-Met (rabbit 3077S), and PTEN (rabbit 9188S) from Cell Signaling.
