<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent and drug-refractory neurological disorders. Zinc finger DHHC-type containing 8 (ZDHHC8) is a putative palmitoyltransferase that is highly expressed in the brain. However, the impact of ZDHHC8 on seizures remains unclear. We aimed to explore the association of ZDHHC8 with epilepsy and investigate its in epileptogenesis in in vivo and in vitro models through behavioral, electrophysiological, and pathological studies. We used kainic acid- and pilocarpine-induced C57BL/6 mice and magnesium-free-induced pyramidal neurons as experimental epileptic models in this study. We first found increased ZDHHC8 expression in the brains of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients, similar to that observed in chronic epileptic mice, strongly suggesting that ZDHHC8 is correlated with human epilepsy. In the in vitro seizure models, knocking down ZDHHC8 using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) delayed seizure precipitation and decreased chronic spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs) and epileptiform-like discharges, while ZDHHC8 overexpression had the opposite effect. ZDHHC8 levels were consistent with seizure susceptibility in induced mice with SRSs. In an in vitro magnesium-free model, neuronal hyperexcitability and hypersynchrony were reduced in ZDHHC8-knockdown neurons but were increased in ZDHHC8-overexpressing neurons. To further explore the potential mechanisms, we observed that ZDHHC8 had a significant modulatory effect on 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2-oxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid (AMPA) receptor-related excitatory, but not inhibitory, glutamatergic synaptic neurotransmission, further affecting the inward rectification of AMPA currents in acute hippocampal slices in whole-cell recordings. ZDHHC8 facilitated GluA1 trafficking to the neuronal surface in the hippocampus, as shown by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. These results suggest that ZDHHC8 may promote the generation and propagation of seizures in humans and that knocking down ZDHHC8 might produce anti-epileptogenic effects in drug-resistant epilepsy. Our study provides evidence that may facilitate the development of an alternative approach for the treatment of epilepsy by modulating AMPA/GluA1-mediated neurotransmission.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par2">Epilepsy is a disabling and drug-refractory neurological disorder characterized by recurrent spontaneous seizures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Approximately 30% of patients do not respond adequately to anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment and often require lifelong medication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Surgical resection of the epileptic focus is an invasive approach and is not an optimal therapeutic option for the majority of resistant patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Epilepsy has been associated with many pathophysiological mechanisms, including inflammation, gliosis, ion channel dysfunction, and synaptic remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission that results in hypersynchronous discharge of neurons in a focal area of the brain or throughout the entire brain is the most widely accepted mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Current AEDs primarily target voltage-gated ion channels to reduce neuronal excitability either directly or via synaptic transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, AEDs lack efficacy in some patients due to a complex array of brain mechanisms. Thus, a detailed understanding of the regulatory mechanisms responsible for this imbalance is necessary to control seizure susceptibility and develop new therapeutic approaches.</p>
<p id="Par3">Palmitoylation of proteins is important for neural protein trafficking and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and may provide greater efficacy and tolerability. Zinc finger DHHC-type containing 8 (ZDHHC8), a putative palmitoyltransferase that contains a conserved cysteine-rich signature catalytic (DHHC) domain, is highly expressed in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Previous studies have reported that hemizygous deletion of the ZDHHC8 gene in 22q11 microdeletion carriers may be associated with schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and neurodevelopmental deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. ZDHHC8 has also been associated with cerebellar and cortical synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, no studies investigated the anticonvulsant efficacy of ZDHHC8 on the behavior, electrophysiology, and pathology of chronically epileptic tissue characterized by morphological, molecular, and functional changes.</p>
<p id="Par4">Therefore, we first examined ZDHHC8 expression and localization in the epileptogenic brain tissues of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) subjects and mice. Then, we utilized recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated knockdown and overexpression of ZDHHC8 in mice to test spontaneous seizures and latent periods in two chronic seizure models. We studied neuronal hyperexcitability and hypersynchrony and their underlying mechanisms in hippocampal slices in an in vitro magnesium-free model. To further explore the mechanisms of ZDHHC8, we monitored its effect on GluA1 trafficking, which might be responsible for seizures. Our results indicate that ZDHHC8 may offer a new strategy for therapeutic interventions in epilepsy.</p>

<title>Neuronal localization and expression of ZDHHC8 in TLE patients and epileptic mice</title>
<p id="Par5">We first investigated whether in vivo seizure activity affects ZDHHC8 levels. The protein levels of ZDHHC8 in the brain tissues of pharmaco-resistant TLE patients and pilocarpine-induced chronic epileptic mice were tested. Higher levels of ZDHHC8 were detected in TLE specimens than in controls (***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>n</italic> = 16; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a, b</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). In pilocarpine-induced epileptic mice, ZDHHC8 levels were also increased in the hippocampus and temporal neocortex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c, d</xref>; Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>). In addition, immunofluorescence analysis showed that ZDHHC8 co-localized with the neuronal dendrite-specific marker MAP-2 but not with the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the controls and both the TLE patients and the epileptic mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e, f</xref>; Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2A</xref>). The co-expression of MAP-2 with ZDHHC8-positive cells was strongly increased in the epileptic tissues compared with that in the control tissues, which was consistent with the western blot results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>). These data suggest that ZDHHC8 has similar expression patterns in TLE specimens and chronic epileptic mice and may be associated with human epilepsy.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>ZDHHC8 upregulation in the brain tissues of epileptic patients and mice.</title><p><bold>a, b</bold> ZDHHC8 levels were increased in temporal lobe samples from TLE patients compared with those in the controls.

<title>In vivo effect of ZDHHC8 on seizure susceptibility in animal models</title>
<p id="Par6">To determine if changes in the levels of ZDHHC8 had any effects on seizure susceptibility, we generated a kainic acid (KA)-induced chronic seizure model. The KA model appears to be highly isomorphic to TLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The experimental mice were used for analysis 3 weeks after rAAV vector injection (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>A-S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1D</xref>). Hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining indicated that the brains of the mice injected with rAAV had normal gross anatomy (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1E</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par7">The activity of the observed phenotype might be changed in the status epilepticus (SE), thereby impacting the development of chronic epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. We first sought to confirm whether ZDHHC8 affects acute seizures in KA-induced SE. Interestingly, no differences in behavioral (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>A-S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4D</xref>) and electrographic (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>E-S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">4H</xref>) seizures during SE were detectable in rAAV-ZDHHC8-sh-injected and rAAV-ZDHHC8-injected mice compared with control mice. Moreover, analyses of ZDHHC8 protein levels revealed that they were not altered between the SE and non-SE groups (Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">6A</xref>). These results provide evidence that ZDHHC8 does not affect KA-induced SE.</p>
<p id="Par8">We next sought to verify whether ZDHHC8 changed the development of chronic, spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs). SRSs were detected using continuous video monitoring after SE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a, f</xref>). SE spontaneously remitted within 24 h of KA administration, and the first spontaneous seizures were generally observed between 5 and 30 days later, with an average of 14 days after KA injection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Consistent with the normal course of epilepsy in this model, the period before the first spontaneous seizure after SE (latency) averaged 13 days in rAAV-Scr-sh, rAAV-Empty-GFP or control mice, whereas rAAV-ZDHHC8-sh-injected mice were epileptic by day 19.33 ± 1.57 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0011, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g</xref>, right). Fewer SRSs were observed in the rAAV-ZDHHC8-sh (10.33 ± 1.76) animals compared with the rAAV-Scr-sh (23.33 ± 2.82) and control (22.33 ± 2.40) animals during the 1–30 days immediately after SE (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0004, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g</xref>, left), indicating that rAAV-ZDHHC8-sh treatment attenuated SRSs recurrence and retarded seizure precipitation. In contrast, ZDHHC8 upregulation increased the number of SRSs and shortened the latency (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>ZDHHC8 regulates seizure susceptibility in chronic seizure models in vivo.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic of the experimental protocol. Mice were administered rAAV via intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection after 3 weeks.

<p id="Par9">To measure changes in epileptiform activity, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) in the KA model mice with stable baseline SRSs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2h</xref>). LFP analysis revealed that the frequency and duration of high-amplitude, high-frequency discharges, called epileptiform-like discharges, which are associated with damage-causing pathologic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, were reduced in the rAAV-ZDHHC8-sh-injected mice (frequency, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0084; duration, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0429; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2i</xref>), as were the energy spectra. This effect was qualitatively similar to the seizure suppression observed in the animals. To further assess this hypothesis, we performed the opposite study by injecting rAAV-ZDHHC8 into mice treated with KA; however, the duration of epileptiform-like discharges showed no change (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2i</xref>). Pilocarpine-induced chronic seizures are similar to those observed in human TLE patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par10">According to these results, seizure degree and the level of ZDHHC8 expression appeared to be related. Finally, we performed western blots in each group of epileptic mice an average of 9 weeks after SE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2l, m</xref>). The rAAV-ZDHHC8-sh-injected mice displayed lower ZDHHC8 expression compared with the controls, consistent with the spontaneous seizures and latency findings. Similarly, the higher level of ZDHHC8 in the rAAV-ZDHHC8-injected mice reflected the appearance of multiple spontaneous seizures. Therefore, ZDHHC8 expression was linked with seizure susceptibility, further confirming the precisely targeted vector injection. Overall, ZDHHC8 regulated seizure susceptibility in different chronic seizure models related to TLE.</p>

The paroxysmal depolarization shift (PDS) represents single neuronal hypersynchrony, which is initiated from neuronal depolarizations eliciting trains of APs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>) and is correlated with interictal spikes in the EEGs of epileptic patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

<title>ZDHHC8 affects postsynaptic neurotransmission</title>
<p id="Par14">The observed pathological excitability suggests that the disturbances in synaptic transmission in pyramidal neurons are related to changes in ZDHHC8 regulation. We measured glutamatergic synaptic transmission and GABAergic synaptic transmission in the CA1 pyramidal neurons of hippocampal slices via whole-cell recordings with Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a, b</xref>). We observed a significantly lower mean amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0006, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>, left) but not miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.4896, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>, left), in slices from the ZDHHC8-knockdown mice compared with those from the control and rAAV-Scr-sh mice. The cumulative probability curve also indicated a leftward shift toward smaller amplitudes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>, left). We further investigated this finding and found that the mEPSC amplitude of the ZDHHC8-overexpressing mice was increased (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0212, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>, right) without a change in the mIPSC amplitude (<italic>P</italic> = 0.5047, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>, right). The cumulative probability curve exhibited a rightward shift toward larger amplitudes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>, right). Additionally, no change in the mEPSC and mIPSC frequencies was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e, f</xref>), suggesting that ZDHHC8 did not alter the quantal size of the presynaptic transmitters. This selective deficit in mEPSC amplitude suggests that ZDHHC8 mutations may alter postsynaptic glutamatergic receptor response probabilities, whereas inhibitory events are not altered.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>ZDHHC8 may alter the postsynaptic glutamatergic receptor response probability.</title><p><bold>a, b</bold> Representative traces showing mEPSCs (<bold>a</bold>) and mIPSCs (<bold>b</bold>) recorded from CA1 pyramidal cells. <bold>c, d</bold> Cumulative probability plots of mEPSC (<bold>c</bold>) and mIPSC amplitudes (<bold>d</bold>).

<p id="Par15">This hypothesis was further verified by immunofluorescence staining, which showed that ZDHHC8 was distributed in the membranes of neurons in both epileptic and control tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g, h</xref>; Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2B, a-c</xref>), consistent with previous reports that ZDHHC8 is a transmembrane protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Consistent with the mEPSC findings, we observed ZDHHC8 to co-localize with PSD95-positive neurons but not with GAD67 (an enzyme that produces the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA)- (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g, h, d–g</xref>; Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2B, d-g</xref>) or Gephyrin (a major scaffolding protein at inhibitory synapses)-positive neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g, h, i–o</xref>; Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2B, i-o</xref>). Nevertheless, ZDHHC8 did not co-localize with the presynaptic marker vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (Vglut1), but it localized with PSD95 in excitatory pyramidal neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g–k</xref>; Fig. S<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2B, h-k</xref>), suggesting that ZDHHC8 is present in individual postsynaptic neurons.

<title>ZDHHC8 is involved in neurotransmission through GluA2-lacking calcium-permeable AMPARs in the hippocampus</title>
<p id="Par16">Measurements of glutamatergic synaptic strength were performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and defined the amplitudes of AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs relative to the amplitudes of NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs as the so-called AMPA/NMDA ratio. To further determine whether a ZDHHC8 mutation causes a deficit in excitatory synaptic transmission, we measured excitatory synaptic strength by assessing the AMPA/NMDA ratio in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>. In this assay, rAAV-ZDHHC8-sh-treated slices produced a significant decrease in the AMPA/NMDA ratio, while an increase was observed in the rAAV-ZDHHC8-treated slices (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). These results were consistent with the mEPSC findings, which indicated that impairment in synaptic strength occurs through a postsynaptic receptor-dependent neurotransmission mechanism in ZDHHC8-mutant mice. We investigated whether this abnormality in synaptic strength was due to changes in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) function and/or NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function. The results showed that AMPAR-mediated current amplitudes were significantly reduced compared with those from the control and rAAV-Scr-sh mice in the rAAV-ZDHHC8-sh slices, in contrast to the results from the rAAV-ZDHHC8 slices (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>). ZDHHC8 had no effect on the amplitudes of NMDAR-mediated currents (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par20">The present study identifies a previously unknown role for ZDHHC8 in the generation and recurrence of seizures. We utilized two in vivo seizure models based on KA- or pilocarpine-induced SRS and an in vitro Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free seizure model. We also detected high levels of ZDHHC8 expression in the brain tissues of both TLE patients and epileptic mice. Furthermore, electrophysiological studies showed a reduction in only the mEPSC amplitude in ZDHHC8-knockdown neurons, suggesting a change in excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurotransmission. Both the AMPA/NMDA ratio and the PPR indicated that ZDHHC8 was involved in postsynaptic APMA receptor function. In addition, ZDHHC8 regulated GluA1 trafficking to the neuronal surface in the hippocampus, which is responsible for hyperexcitability and eventual seizure activity.</p>
<p id="Par21">In experimental models of chronic epilepsy and in patients with TLE, the brain displays several abnormalities in the form of morphological and functional synaptic rearrangements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. An association between seizures and changes in protein expression has been suggested by recent profiling work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Our experiments revealed increased ZDHHC8 expression in the neocortical tissue of TLE subjects, similar to that observed in the hippocampus and adjacent cortex of chronic seizure model mice, suggesting that in vivo regulation of ZDHHC8 is coupled to epileptic or pathogenic brain activity and that ZDHHC8 plays a role in human epilepsy. We were unable to compare hippocampal ZDHHC8 expression with that in the neocortex (control) in TLE patients due to practical and ethical concerns. However, the animal study provides direct evidence that seizure activity leads to increased ZDHHC8 in the hippocampus and cortex.</p>
<p id="Par22">Although it is not clear that ZDHHC8 participates in the chain of events leading to the precipitation and recurrence of seizures, our animal studies indicated that behavioral seizures seldom recurred in the rAAV-ZDHHC8-sh-treated animals but were higher in the rAAV-ZDHHC8-treated mice, whereas epilepsy developed normally in the control and rAAV-Empty-GFP-treated mice. These findings are consistent with previous reports that AEDs were effective in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, suggesting that ZDHHC8 inhibition can interrupt epileptogenesis or prevent epileptic seizures from occurring due to a prolonged anti-epileptogenic effect. Although the two chronic seizure models yielded similar results in terms of latency to SRSs, behavioral symptoms, and average total numbers of SRSs, these outcomes were induced by different methods. Intrahippocampal administration of KA was used to investigate the effect of ZDHHC8 on seizures and epileptiform activities in circumscribed pathological networks and was propagated throughout the brain, whereas systemic injection of pilocarpine was employed to study susceptibility to seizures under conditions of a more widespread epileptic disease. The changes in the frequency of spontaneous epileptiform discharge in LFPs in animals also supported the behavioral results. However, the mean duration of epileptiform events did not markedly differ between the ZDHHC8-overexpressing mice and the control mice. These effects might be related to the degree of activation, the density of active neurons in the area, and the temporal pattern of the input<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, though the exact mechanisms underlying these differences are currently unknown. The hyperexcitability of epileptic neurons and abnormal hypersynchronous discharge of neuronal networks result in epileptic seizures. Hippocampus is prone to the generation of epileptiform activity and seizures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In our in vitro Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free seizure model, electrophysiological data clearly showed that epileptiform activity in the firing of single neurons and networks in the CA1 area of hippocampal slices was inhibited by ZDHHC8 knockdown and increased by ZDHHC8 overexpression. Thus, ZDHHC8 may represent a major therapeutic target in epilepsy.</p>
<p id="Par23">The mechanism by which ZDHHC8 regulates seizure susceptibility is unknown, but our study suggests the intriguing possibility that the effect occurs via changes to AMPA receptors. We determined the effect of ZDHHC8 on synaptic transmission in the CA1 area of the hippocampus and found that ZDHHC8 regulated mEPSC amplitude in epileptic environments, in a manner consistent with a postsynaptic effect, similar to previous reports that ZDHHC8 is associated with excitatory receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Moreover, ZDHHC8 had no appreciable effect on inhibitory transmission. Our immunofluorescence labeling also supported this hypothesis. The alternations in the AMPAR-to-NMDAR EPSC ratio elicited by ZDHHC8 reflect the regulation of AMPAR-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission. These findings are consistent with previous reports that AMPA receptors are targets for seizure control and mediate generation and propagation of epileptic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. AMPARs are distributed in areas of the cerebral cortex, amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus, which are all relevant to epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Furthermore, blocking AMPARs can inhibit seizures in various in vitro and in vivo epilepsy models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Here, we showed that AMPA receptor antagonism by ZDHHC8 knockdown is sufficient to explain its antiseizure effect. These results were confirmed using perampanel, a novel AMPA receptor antagonist that has already been approved to treat refractory epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Thus, our results showing that ZDHHC8 knockdown reduces the magnitude of fast glutamatergic signaling in the hippocampus are consistent with previous reports that AMPA receptors are a recognized target for antiseizure therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Conversely, ZDHHC8 overexpression can promote the onset of epileptic seizures.</p>
<p id="Par24">Notably, AMPAR subunits are increased in association with chronic temporal lobe seizures, and alterations in receptor subunit composition probably contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability, excitatory neurotransmission and seizure susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Our experiments revealed that GluA1 protein levels decreased in the rAAV-ZDHHC8-sh-treated epileptic mice and increased in the rAAV-ZDHHC8-treated epileptic mice, indicating that ZDHHC8 regulates seizure susceptibility through GluA1 subunits during postsynaptic activation and seizure propagation. However, AMPAR-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission is highly dynamic in the brain. Many proteins interact with AMPAR subunits and affect their synaptic localization. AMPARs are also continuously transported in and out of synapses by membrane trafficking, which involves insertion and internalization via specific vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. We found that cell-surface GluA1 expression was decreased and cytosolic expression was increased in ZDHHC8-knockdown mice, whereas total protein levels did not change, indicating increased GluA1 endocytosis or impaired GluA1 trafficking from intracellular pools to the cell surface. Therefore, ZDHHC8 may regulate the trafficking of GluA1 subunits, resulting in seizure activity.</p>
<p id="Par25">In summary, to our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate increased ZDHHC8 expression in brain specimens from TLE subjects. These subjects are highly prone to seizure precipitation, suggesting that the ZDHHC8 may play a key role in human epilepsy. Although reduced GluA1 AMPAR trafficking to the plasma membrane by ZDHHC8 knockdown as the mechanism for the seizure suppressant effects is a compelling speculation, few studies have indicated that ZDHHC8 knockdown can be used as an optimal target for anti-epileptic treatment or that ZDHHC8 regulates AMPAR trafficking in seizures. Therefore, our findings may represent a partial compensatory mechanism in seizure susceptibility. Our study provides evidence that may aid in the development of alternative approaches to treat epilepsy through the modulation of AMPA/GluA1-mediated neurotransmission.</p>

All mice were sacrificed after behavioral observation. The hippocampus and cortex were separated and stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent use. Human lysates and hippocampal and cortex homogenates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to membranes, and probed with antibodies for the following: ZDHHC8, ZDHHC5, and GADPH. The immunoreactivity of individual bands on Western blots was measured by ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) and normalized to GADPH immunoreactivity. Representative results of immunoblotting from at least three independent experiments are shown.</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation</title>
<p id="Par44">Mice were anesthetized and decapitated, and brain tissue was quickly extracted. The hippocampus was rapidly dissected on ice, incubated in modified RIPA buffer (Beyotime, Nantong, China) on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged at ~200,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and supplemented with 100 µl protein A/G-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C on a wheel. The beads were then allowed to sediment at the bottom of the tube, and the supernatant was collected. ZDHHC8 (1:200, Abcam), rabbit anti-GluA1 pAb (1:500; Abcam), rabbit anti-GluA2 pAb (1:200; Proteintech Group, Inc.), rabbit anti-GluA3 pAb (1:500; Bioworld Technology, Inc.), and rabbit anti-GluA4 pAb (1:200; Proteintech Group, Inc.) antibodies were incubated in equal amounts with the supernatant. Protein A/G-agarose beads were added to the supernatant, and the supernatant was incubated for 2 h at room temperature on a wheel. The beads were then washed three times with RIPA buffer and submitted to SDS-PAGE. The mixture was boiled for 10 min. The Western blots were detected using ZDHHC8 and GluA1, GluA2, GluA3, and GluA4 antibodies for immunoprecipitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="Sec26">
<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p id="Par45">After epileptic and control mice were deeply anesthetized and the hearts were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), the brain tissue was removed. Then, the tissues were postfixed in 4% PFA at 4 ˚C for 8 h. The brains were dehydrated with 30% sucrose in PBS for ~48 h at 4 ˚C, and then covered in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT, Tissue-Tek), frozen by slow immersion in chilled isopentane, cryoprotected, and cut into 30 µm coronal sections (−1.8 mm to −2.3 mm relative to bregma) on a cryostat (CM1860; Leica, Mannheim, Germany)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. The neocortical tissue from TLE patients (10 slides were cut from each sample, 16 samples from TLE patients and 10 samples from epileptic mice, and three slides were randomly selected from each sample for immunofluorescence) was removed from liquid nitrogen for the same dehydration treatment and then frozen in sections. Frozen sections were immersed in 100% acetone for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with 1% Triton-X 30 min at 37 °C. Then, sections were blocked with 10% goat serum (Beijing Zhongshan Golden Bridge Co., Ltd.) for 30 min at 37 °C and finally washed with ice-cold PBS. Sections were then incubated with a mixture of polyclonal rabbit anti-ZDHHC8 with either guinea pig anti-MAP2 mAb, chicken anti-GAD67 mAb, mouse anti-GFAP mAb, mouse anti-PSD95 mAb, guinea pig anti-VGLUT1 mAb, mouse anti-Gephyrin mAb, or DAPI at 4 °C overnight. Sections were washed and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-coupled goat anti-rabbit (1:50, Beyotime, Inc.), Alexa Fluor 594-coupled goat anti-mouse (1:50, Beyotime, Inc.), Alexa Fluor 647-labeled goat anti-guinea pig IgG (1:200, Beyotime, Inc.), or Alexa Fluor 405-labeled goat anti-chicken IgG (1:400, Abcam) in a darkroom for 60 min at 37 °C. They were then washed with PBS and mounted in 1:1 glycerol/PBS. Fluorescence images were captured via laser scanning confocal microscopy (Leica Microsystems) using an Olympus IX 70 inverted microscope (Olympus) equipped with a FluoView FVX confocal scan head.</p>
<p id="Par46">The ZDHHC8-positive cells that were co-localized with MAP-2 and showed a visible nucleus and/or a complete cell contour were counted in the cerebral cortex and the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers of the dorsal hippocampus in the epileptic brains vs. control brains (<italic>n</italic> = 8 in each group). Cell counting in humans was performed by evaluating the temporal cortex regions (<italic>n</italic> = 8 in each group). In each sample, two representative adjacent non-overlapping fields of the areas of interest were captured using rectangular frames (magnification ×40; 300 µm × 300 µm) and digitized using a laser scanning confocal microscope.All cell types within the captured images were marked by one operator blinded to the treatment conditions, and an automated cell count was generated. The data obtained in each hippocampal subfield were added together to provide one single value per slice in each sample. Although this cell counting method has some limitations compared to designed-based stereological analyses, the occurrence of any bias in counting should similarly affect the control and experimental samples since these samples underwent the same procedures in parallel.</p>

<sec id="Sec27">
<title>Antibodies</title>
<p id="Par47">The following primary antibodies were used in this study: purified rabbit anti-ZDHHC8 pAb (1:200; Abcam); rabbit anti-ZDHHC8 pAb (1:100; Bioss); rabbit anti-ZDHHC5 pAb (1:500; Proteintech Group, Inc.); rabbit anti-GADPH mAb (1:1000; Proteintech Group, Inc.); guinea pig anti-MAP2 mAb (1:200; Synaptic Systems); mouse anti-GFAP mAb (1:100; Proteintech Group, Inc.); chicken anti-GAD67 mAb (1:300; Synaptic Systems); mouse anti-PSD95 mAb (1:50; Proteintech Group, Inc.); guinea pig anti-VGLUT1 mAb (1:200; Synaptic Systems); mouse anti-gephyrin mAb (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); DAPI (1:50; Sigma-Aldrich); rabbit anti-GluA1 pAb (1:500; Abcam); rabbit anti-GluA2 pAb (1:200; Proteintech Group, Inc.); rabbit anti-GluA3 pAb (1:500; Bioworld Technology, Inc.); rabbit anti-GluA4 pAb (1:200; Proteintech Group, Inc.); Anti-Sodium Potassium ATPase mAb (1:1000; Abcam); and GABAAR β2/3 (1:200; Proteintech Group, Inc.).</p>

<sec id="Sec28">
<title>HE staining</title>
<p id="Par48">After 3 weeks, rAAV-injected and non-injected C57BL/6 male mice were anesthetized with 3.5% chloral hydrate (100 g/ml) and intracardially perfused with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Subsequently, the brain was removed and postfixed in 4% PFA at 4 ˚C overnight and sectioned into frontal sections for histological analyses. Coronal sections from the dorsal hippocampus (−1.8 mm to −2.3 mm relative to bregma) were analyzed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. The brain regions mainly included the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers and the dentate gyrus (<italic>n</italic> = 5 per group).</p>
<p id="Par49">HE staining was performed in hippocampal tissue samples to detect neuronal loss. First, 4-µm-thick sections were deparaffinized, hydrated, stained with hematoxylin for 5 min, and washed under low speed running tap water for 2 min. Then, sections were counter-stained with eosin for 10 s and washed again. Slides were then dehydrated and cover-slipped. Images were obtained at ×4 by a light microscope (Olympus, Japan).</p>

<sec id="Sec29">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p id="Par50">The data were analyzed using Clampfit 10.0.3 (Molecular Devices), Mini Analysis Program software (version 6.0.3; Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA, USA), GraphPad 6 (GraphPad software, La Jolla, California, USA), SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and CorelDRWX4 (Corel, Canada). The values are presented as the mean ± SEM. Unless otherwise noted, comparisons between two groups were analyzed using unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests, comparisons of &gt;2 groups were performed by one-way ANOVA, and multi-group comparisons were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests. For cumulative probability plots, Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) tests were used. <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
