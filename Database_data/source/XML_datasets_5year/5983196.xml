<abstract>
<p>The ability to block biological processes with selective small molecules provides advantages distinct from most other experimental approaches. These include rapid time to onset, swift reversibility, ability to probe activities in manners that cannot be accessed by genetic means, and the potential to be further developed as therapeutic agents. Small molecule inhibitors can also be used to alter expression and activity without affecting the stoichiometry of interacting partners. These tenets have been especially evident in the field of translation. Small molecule inhibitors were instrumental in enabling investigators to capture short-lived complexes and characterize specific steps of protein synthesis. In addition, several drugs that are the mainstay of modern antimicrobial drug therapy are potent inhibitors of prokaryotic translation. Currently, there is much interest in targeting eukaryotic translation as decades of research have revealed that deregulated protein synthesis in cancer cells represents a targetable vulnerability. In addition to being potential therapeutics, small molecules that manipulate translation have also been shown to influence cognitive processes such as memory. In this review, we focus on small molecule modulators that target the eukaryotic translation initiation apparatus and provide an update on their potential application to the treatment of disease.</p>
