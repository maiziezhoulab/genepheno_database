<p>In this case-control study of 407 074 individuals in the UK Biobank study, neurodevelopmental disorder copy number variants appear to be associated with the risk of depression in those without neurodevelopmental disorders.

<p>The role of large, rare copy number variants (CNVs) in neuropsychiatric disorders is well established, but their association with common psychiatric disorders, such as depression, remains unclear.</p>

<title>Design, Setting, and Participants</title>
<p>This case-control study used data from the UK Biobank study sample, which comprised 502 534 individuals living in the United Kingdom. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, or bipolar affective disorder diagnoses were excluded.

<title>Main Outcomes and Measures</title>
<p>For the primary outcome, individuals who reported that a physician had told them they had a depression diagnosis were defined as cases. Analyses were repeated using 2 alternative depression definitions: self-reported lifetime depression with current antidepressant prescription at the time of visit 1, and hospital discharge diagnosis of depression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="ab-yoi190017-9">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Copy number variants were identified in 488 366 individuals aged 37 to 73 years. In total, 407 074 individuals with European genetic ancestry (220 201 female [54.1%]; mean [SD] age of 56.9 [8.0] years) were included in the study. Of these individuals, 23 979 (5.9%) had self-reported lifetime depression and 383 095 (94.1%) reported no lifetime depression. The group of 53 neurodevelopmental CNVs was associated with self-reported depression (odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.19-1.49, uncorrected <italic>P</italic> = 1.38 × 10<sup>−7</sup>), and these results were consistent when using 2 alternative definitions of depression. This association was partially explained by physical health, educational attainment, social deprivation, smoking status, and alcohol consumption. A strong independent association remained between the neurodevelopmental CNVs and depression in analyses that incorporated these other measures (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.11-1.43; <italic>P</italic> = 2.87 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). Eight individual CNVs were nominally associated with risk of depression, and 3 of these 8 CNVs (1q21.1 duplication, Prader-Willi syndrome duplication, and 16p11.2 duplication) survived Bonferroni correction for the 53 CNVs tested. After the exclusion of carriers of neurodevelopmental CNVs, no association was found between measures of CNV burden and depression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The role of large rare copy number variants (CNVs) in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia, is well established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r5">5</xref></sup> In schizophrenia, associations have been reported with both individual CNVs and an increased burden of rare deletions and duplications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r8">8</xref></sup> In contrast, the association between CNVs and risk of depression remains unclear. Studies of CNVs in depression have been based on relatively small samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r15">15</xref></sup> and have generated inconsistent results, and their findings have not met the criteria for genome-wide significance. The UK Biobank database now offers an opportunity to investigate the association between CNVs and depression in a well-phenotyped sample and on a larger scale than has been possible.</p>
<p>We report a CNV analysis of depression in the entire UK Biobank sample. Previous studies have shown that a substantial proportion of CNV enrichment in schizophrenia is explained by CNVs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r16">16</xref></sup> Depression shares a genetic risk with schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r18">18</xref></sup> and is a frequent comorbidity with neurodevelopmental disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r20">20</xref></sup> Together, these findings suggest the hypothesis that, if CNVs play a role in depression, neurodevelopmental CNVs are those most likely to be associated. We also tested a more general hypothesis that, at a genome-wide level, CNV burden is associated with depression.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This current study was conducted from January 2017 to September 2018, under the conditions of the UK Biobank project number 14421. Ethical approval was granted to UK Biobank by the North West Multi-Centre Ethics Committee, and all participants provided informed consent to participate in UK Biobank projects.</p>
<sec id="H2-1-YOI190017">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Between 2006 and 2010, the UK Biobank study recruited 502 534 individuals (54% female) aged 37 to 73 years living in the United Kingdom. Phenotypic data were collected at assessment centers through touchscreen devices and nurse-led interviews. Participants provided blood, urine, and saliva samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="H2-2-YOI190017">
<title>Depression Phenotypes</title>
<p>Analyses of depression in the UK Biobank to date have used multiple definitions of the disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r22">22</xref></sup> In view of this lack of consensus on case definition, we used a relatively liberal definition of lifetime depression, rating as cases those individuals who reported that a physician had told them they have depression. We repeated our analyses using 2 alternative, more conservative definitions of depression: (1) self-reported lifetime depression with current antidepressant prescription at the time of visit 1 and (2) hospital discharge diagnosis of depression.</p>
<p>For self-reported depression with antidepressant prescription at visit 1, we constructed a binary depression variable using the self-reported depression code 1286 in UK Biobank field 20002 and the antidepressant prescription codes in UK Biobank field 20003. Individuals were included as cases (affected status) if they reported that a physician had told them they have depression and that they received a prescription for an antidepressant medication at the time of first assessment. Individuals who fulfilled only 1 of the 2 criteria (ie, self-reported depression or antidepressant prescription alone) were excluded from analyses.</p>
<p>For hospital discharge diagnosis of depression, we included individuals as affected if they had a hospital admission with a primary or secondary <italic>International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)</italic>, code for depression (UK Biobank fields 41202 and 41204) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="yoi190017f1">Figure 1</xref>). For individuals assessed at Scottish assessment centers, records from general hospitals but not psychiatric hospitals were included (for assessment centers in Wales and England, the records covered both general and psychiatric hospitals). For these individuals, we accepted a secondary <italic>ICD-10</italic> code for depression as evidence of depression diagnosis as it could be coded during admission to a general hospital. However, in the absence of primary <italic>ICD-10</italic> codes for depression, we were unable to determine the absence of depression in controls (those with unaffected status). Therefore, we removed Scottish controls from this variable.</p>

</fig>
<p>In 2017, a total of 157 397 individuals completed an online follow-up mental health questionnaire. We aimed to further characterize the associations with depression phenotypes in individuals who stated on this questionnaire that they had ever experienced prolonged feelings of sadness or depression (UK Biobank field 20446). We examined data from the following variables: (1) age at first episode of depression (UK Biobank field 20433), (2) duration of worst depression (UK Biobank field 20438), and (3) lifetime number of depressed episodes (UK Biobank field 20442). The duration of worst depression was coded in ranges of months (eg, less than a month, between 1 month and 3 months). Previous data have shown that the median duration of a depressive episode is 3 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r23">23</xref></sup> Therefore, this variable was dichotomized into 0 to 3 months and more than 3 months. The lifetime number of depressed episodes was dichotomized using a median split approach (median = 1).</p>

<sec id="H2-3-YOI190017">
<title>Genotyping and CNV Calling</title>
<p>DNA was extracted from whole blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r24">24</xref></sup> and then genotyped (at the Affymetrix Research Services Laboratory) on the UK Biobank Axiom and UK BiLEVE arrays. Genotypes were released to Cardiff University after application to UK Biobank. We carried out CNV calling with PennCNV-Affy 1.0.3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r25">25</xref></sup> protocols (PennCNV) using biallelic markers common to both genotyping platforms; this process is described in detail elsewhere (eTable 6 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-YOI190017-1-s">Supplement</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r26">26</xref></sup> As reported in our group’s previous CNV analyses in UK Biobank, no batch effects were observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r27">27</xref></sup> The CNV burden analysis was carried out on the CNV calls generated by PennCNV-Affy using the PLINK 1.07 analysis toolset (eTable 7 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-YOI190017-1-s">Supplement</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r28">28</xref></sup> Individual samples were excluded if they had 30 or more CNVs, a waviness factor greater than 0.03 or less than –0.03, a single-nucleotide polymorphism call rate lower than 96%, or log R ratio SD higher than 0.35. Individual CNVs were excluded if they were covered by fewer than 20 probes, had a density coverage of less than 1 probe per 20 000 base pairs, or a confidence score lower than 10. eTable 9 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-YOI190017-1-s">Supplement</xref> provides the criteria for calling individual CNVs.</p>

<title>Defining CNV Sets and Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Following the approach of our group’s recent study using UK Biobank data,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r26">26</xref></sup> we defined a group of neurodevelopmental CNVs as those 54 CNVs for which at least a nominally statistically significant evidence of association with neurodevelopmental disorders exists (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05; eTable 11 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-YOI190017-1-s">Supplement</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r3">3</xref></sup> We excluded the high-frequency 15q11.2 duplication, resulting in a final list of 53 neurodevelopmental CNVs. The level of significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. In exploratory analyses, we examined each of the CNVs with 5 or more observations for association with self-reported depression, and the results were subjected to correction for 53 tests (<italic>P</italic> value threshold of .00094).</p>
<p>The CNV burden analyses were carried out using PLINK on regions of variable copy number at 3 size thresholds: (1) 100 kilobase (kb) or greater, (2) 500 kb or greater, and (3) 1 megabase (Mb) or greater. The CNVs were filtered for frequency at less than 1% using the cnv-freq-exclude-above command, and the overlapping lower copy repeat regions were filtered out using the cnv-exclude command. PLINK outputs were converted into CNV carrier status, which was used in regression analyses. For all burden analyses, carriers of the group of 53 CNVs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders were excluded.</p>

<title>Association Between CNVs and Depression Severity</title>
<p>We used data from the 157 397 individuals who completed an online follow-up mental health questionnaire to examine the association between CNVs and markers of depression severity (age at onset, number of depressive episodes, and duration of worst depressive episode). We restricted these analyses to the 68 684 affected individuals who reported experiencing prolonged feelings of sadness or depression (57 243 unaffected), a phenotype that itself was associated with neurodevelopmental CNV carrier status (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.07-1.36; <italic>P</italic> = .002). We did not find any association between neurodevelopmental CNVs and markers of depression severity that survived correction for multiple testing (eTable 2 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-YOI190017-1-s">Supplement</xref>). The mental health questionnaire provides potential alternative depression variables. Among these variables are a depression phenotype constructed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview—Short Form, as reported by Davis et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r39">39</xref></sup> and an alternative self-reported depression variable. We examined these depression phenotypes for their association with neurodevelopmental CNVs and found consistent results when compared with the primary depression definitions, although the effect sizes were somewhat smaller, as would be expected for milder depression definitions (eTable 10 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-YOI190017-1-s">Supplement</xref>).</p>

<title>Further Investigation of the Neurodevelopmental CNV and Depression Association</title>
<p>To better understand the association between neurodevelopmental CNVs and depression, we investigated whether the association could be explained by measures of (1) educational attainment (qualifications), (2) physical health (presence or absence of an associated medical phenotype), (3) social deprivation (Townsend deprivation index), (4) smoking (smoking status), and (5) alcohol consumption (alcohol intake frequency). These variables were chosen because of their known associations with depression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r34">34</xref></sup> their postulated or proven association with CNVs, and their availability in a large proportion of the UK Biobank sample.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this research is the largest study of CNVs in depression to date. We performed a CNV analysis of depression in the UK Biobank sample of 407 074 individuals with European genetic ancestry. The primary definition of depression was an individual’s self-report of ever having received a medical diagnosis of depression (self-reported depression). To ensure that the findings were not restricted to this definition, we also tested 2 more conservative phenotypes: (1) lifetime self-reported depression with current antidepressant prescription at the time of visit 1 and (2) hospital discharge diagnosis of depression. We sought association with depression for a group of 53 CNVs known to be associated with neurodevelopmental disorders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r3">3</xref></sup> and after excluding individuals with CNVs relevant to the primary hypothesis, we tested for a residual explained burden among CNVs of 100 kb or greater, 500 kb or greater, and 1 Mb or greater. The results support our first hypothesis that CNVs that were previously associated with neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with increased risk of lifetime depression, whether defined on the basis of self-reported diagnosis, self-reported diagnosis combined with antidepressant treatment, or on hospital discharge diagnosis. This analysis excluded those with a neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric diagnosis, and thus the association is unlikely to have been explained by associations with these disorders.</p>
<p>Three neurodevelopmental CNVs (1q21.1 duplication, Prader-Willi syndrome duplication, and 16p11.2 duplication) were individually associated with depression at levels of statistical significance, surviving Bonferroni correction for the 53 neurodevelopmental CNVs tested. None of these CNV loci overlap with risk loci recently identified in a large depression genome-wide association study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r18">18</xref></sup> The risk of depression in CNV carriers in the current study (whether CNVs were considered individually or collectively) was lower compared with the risk identified in previous studies of schizophrenia. However, qualitatively, the results followed a similar pattern: The highest risk for both disorders was conferred by 3q29del (depression OR, 11.22 vs schizophrenia OR, 57.65) and the lowest risk for both disorders was conferred by 16p12.1del (depression OR, 1.47 vs schizophrenia OR, 3.3).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r6">6</xref></sup> After excluding neurodevelopmental CNVs, we found no evidence of residual burden of risk for depression among CNVs of 100 kb or greater, 500 kb or greater, and 1 Mb or greater.</p>
<p>Further investigation of the association between neurodevelopmental CNVs and depression risk indicated that this association is partially explained by educational attainment, social deprivation, physical health, smoking status, and alcohol consumption. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show these CNVs are associated with neighborhood measures of social deprivation, and thus it implicates an important mechanism by which CNV carrier status could increase the risk of depression. Longitudinal data on these measures are needed to establish the causal directionality between depression and social deprivation.</p>
<sec id="H2-11-YOI190017">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has some limitations. The primary depression definition relied on self-report, a method known to be subject to information bias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r40">40</xref></sup> However, this definition is unlikely to have markedly affected the findings, given the almost identical, or even stronger, results from using the clinicians’ hospital discharge diagnosis of depression phenotype. Another limitation is the relatively low rate of depression compared with the population estimates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r41">41</xref></sup> This lower rate may have been associated with the better-than-average health and functioning of the UK Biobank sample and the imprecise definition of depression. However, these factors were not likely to have generated spurious CNV associations and would instead have diluted the associations with CNV carrier status.</p>

<sec id="H1-5-YOI190017">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Neurodevelopmental CNVs have incomplete penetrance for major developmental disorders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r42">42</xref></sup> yet beyond their association with mild cognitive impairment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="yoi190017r43">43</xref></sup> little is known about their phenotypic associations with CNV carrier status. This study, to our knowledge, is the first to robustly demonstrate the association between these CNVs and risk of depression and thus extends the spectrum of clinical phenotypes that are associated with CNV carrier status. This work reiterates that carriers of CNVs without neurodevelopmental disorders cannot be assumed to be unimpaired. It appears that along with cognitive and physical health manifestations, wider implications for depression and social deprivation must be considered in assessing CNVs at the population level.</p>
