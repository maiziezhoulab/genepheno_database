<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Loss-of-function mutations in <italic>SCN1A</italic> cause Dravet syndrome (DS), a catastrophic childhood epilepsy in which patients experience comorbid behavioral conditions, including movement disorders, sleep abnormalities, anxiety, and intellectual disability. To study the functional consequences of voltage-gated sodium channel mutations, we use zebrafish with a loss-of-function mutation in <italic>scn1lab</italic>, a zebrafish homolog of human <italic>SCN1A</italic>. Homozygous <italic>scn1lab</italic><sup>s552/s552</sup> mutants exhibit early-life seizures, metabolic deficits, and early death. Here, we developed <italic>in vivo</italic> assays using <italic>scn1lab</italic><sup>s552</sup> mutants between 3 and 6 d postfertilization (dpf). To evaluate sleep disturbances, we monitored larvae for 24 h with locomotion tracking software. Locomotor activity during dark (night phase) was significantly higher in mutants than in controls. Among anticonvulsant drugs, clemizole and diazepam, but not trazodone or valproic acid, decreased distance moved at night for <italic>scn1lab</italic>
<sup>s552</sup> mutant larvae. To monitor exploratory behavior in an open field, we tracked larvae in a novel arena. Mutant larvae exhibited impaired exploratory behavior, with increased time spent near the edge of the arena and decreased mobility, suggesting greater anxiety. Both clemizole and diazepam, but not trazodone or valproic acid, decreased distance moved and increased time spent in the center of the arena. Counting inhibitory neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> revealed no differences between <italic>scn1lab</italic>
<sup>s552</sup> mutants and siblings. Taken together, our results demonstrate conserved features of sleep, anxiety, and movement disorders in <italic>scn1lab</italic> mutant zebrafish, and provide evidence that a zebrafish model allows effective tests of treatments for behavioral comorbidities associated with DS.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>Certain mutations cause severe genetic diseases that affect brain development, leading to seizures, cognitive impairment, and abnormal behaviors in affected children. One of the best studied of these genetic diseases is Dravet syndrome (DS), which results from mutations in a channel that normally controls sodium flux in the brain. Although the genetic cause of DS is known, no effective treatment is available. Animals, including zebrafish, share sodium channels that are similar to the human ones, and mutating a sodium channel also leads to an epilepsy disorder in developing zebrafish. We found that zebrafish with a DS-like mutation also exhibit problems with locomotion, sleep, and anxiety, and that these behaviors were modulated by antiepileptic drugs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for generation and propagation of neuronal action potentials in central and peripheral nervous systems. Mutations of these channels are a major cause of genetically inherited epilepsies and other neurologic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Dichgans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Meisler and Kearney, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Catterall, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">Waxman et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>SCN1A</italic>, which encodes the pore-forming alpha subunit of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, is expressed throughout mammalian nervous systems, primarily in axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Gordon et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Duflocq et al., 2008</xref>). Confirming the conserved importance of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 for neural function, homologs of <italic>SCN1A</italic> are present in other vertebrates, including teleost fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Novak et al., 2006a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">Widmark et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Nonsense and missense mutations in <italic>SCN1A</italic> are associated with a catastrophic epilepsy of childhood known as Dravet syndrome (DS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Escayg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Claes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">Sugawara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Harkin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Depienne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Dravet, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Catterall, 2014</xref>). In DS, seizures commonly appear in the first year of life (often accompanied by fever), and progress to prolonged myoclonic, atypical absence, or focal events with frequent status epilepticus episodes requiring emergency care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Gataullina and Dulac, 2017</xref>). Generalized and multifocal abnormalities are seen in the electroencephalography. Starting as early as the second year of life, DS children develop comorbid conditions such as psychomotor regression, motor disorder, abnormal sleep microarchitecture, and intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Nolan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Dhamija et al., 2014</xref>). The risk for premature death is also high in this patient population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Genton et al., 2011</xref>). Unfortunately, effective treatments are not available to address the range of seizure phenotypes and comorbidities associated with DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Chiron and Dulac, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Catterall, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">Wilmshurst et al., 2014</xref>). Studies in animal models, which now include zebrafish as well as mice, offer a means to address this problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Catterall, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Grone and Baraban, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Kaplan et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Mice with heterozygous deletion of <italic>Scn1a</italic> reproduce many DS phenotypes, including epilepsy with early onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>), susceptibility to febrile seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Oakley et al., 2009</xref>), sleep and circadian abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Han et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Papale et al., 2013</xref>), and premature death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Kalume et al., 2013</xref>). Reduced neuronal excitability and behavioral abnormalities are also found in <italic>Scn1a</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Han et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Ito et al., 2013</xref>). Although mice offer strengths for understanding the basic biology and physiology of ion channels and for testing treatments, they are not ideally suited to drug discovery.</p>
<p>Zebrafish have emerged as a powerful model organism for analyzing genetic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Ablain and Zon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Grone et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">Tuschl et al., 2016</xref>). Zebrafish with a missense loss-of-function mutation in <italic>scn1lab</italic>, one of two <italic>SCN1A-</italic>like genes found in teleost fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Novak et al., 2006b</xref>), show oculomotor defects, early life seizures, pharmacoresistance, and metabolic deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Schoonheim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Baraban et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Sourbron et al., 2016</xref>). Like <italic>Scn1a</italic> null mice, which develop ataxia and die at about postnatal day 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>), homozygous <italic>scn1lab</italic>
<sup>s552/s552</sup> mutant larvae do not survive beyond 14 d postfertilization (dpf; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Schoonheim et al., 2010</xref>). This well-conserved overall phenotype suggests that the <italic>scn1lab</italic> gene in zebrafish shares essential conserved functions with mammalian <italic>Scn1a</italic>. Whether <italic>scn1lab</italic> mutant zebrafish exhibit comorbidities normally associated with DS, including movement disorders, anxiety, or sleep disturbances, is not known. Here, we provide the first assessments of these behaviors in a zebrafish model of DS, i.e., <italic>scn1lab</italic>
<sup>s552</sup> mutants. We used a set of assays based on zebrafish sleep patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Zhdanova et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Yokogawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Rihel et al., 2010</xref>), and behavioral responses to novel environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Richendrfer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Schnörr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Ahmad and Richardson, 2013</xref>). We found that the homozygous <italic>scn1lab</italic>
<sup>s552</sup> mutants exhibit nighttime hyperactivity, decreased time spent in the center of an open arena, and decreased responsiveness to sudden darkness. Diazepam and clemizole have previously been found to suppress convulsive seizure behaviors in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Baraban et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Griffin et al., 2017</xref>). We found that both of these drugs also reduced nighttime locomotor activity and the time spent in the center of the open field. Taken together, our results suggest that behavioral comorbidities can be studied in larval zebrafish models of genetic epilepsies, and that these mutant fish could aid in identifying new treatments.</p>

<p>Adult male and female zebrafish were maintained according to standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Westerfield, 2000</xref>) and following guidelines approved for this study by the University of California, San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The <italic>Tg(1.4dlx5a-dlx6a:GFP)</italic> fish line has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Ghanem et al., 2003</xref>) and was generously provided by the laboratory of Dr. Marc Ekker. The <italic>scn1lab</italic><sup>s552</sup> line has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Schoonheim et al., 2010</xref>) and was generously provided by the laboratory of Dr. Herwig Baier. Zebrafish of the TL strain were obtained from the Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC). The zebrafish room was maintained on a 14/10 h light/dark cycle, with lights-on at 9 <sc>A.M.</sc> and lights-off at 11 P.M. Fish system water conditions were maintained in the following ranges by automated feedback controls: 29–30°C, pH 7.5–8.0, conductivity (EC) 690–710. Zebrafish embryos and larvae were raised in an incubator maintained at 28.5°C, on the same light-dark cycle as the fish facility. At 5 dpf, zebrafish have not yet experienced sexual differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Liew and Orbán, 2014</xref>). Water used for embryos and larvae (“embryo medium”) was made by adding 0.03% Instant Ocean and 0.000002% methylene blue to reverse-osmosis distilled water. Embryos and larvae were raised in plastic Petri dishes (90 mm in diameter, 20 mm in depth) and their housing density was limited to ∼60 individuals per dish.</p>

Each well contained ∼200 μl of embryo medium. Behavior was monitored at room temperature (21–22°C) using two DanioVision systems and EthoVision XT locomotion tracking software version (Noldus). The older system with EthoVision XT 8 software was used for initial experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The newer system with EthoVision XT 11 software was used for all other experiments. Total distance moved measurements were consistent within systems, but not comparable between systems as the software detection parameters and image quality are not identical on the two systems; 5-dpf larvae were allowed to acclimate to the tracking arena for 3–4 h, and then 24 h of continuous behavioral data were recorded beginning at 4 <sc>P.M.</sc> The light-dark cycle continued as usual: lights-off occurred at 11 P.M. and lights-on at 9 A.M.</p>

<title>Behavioral phenotyping, open field</title>
<p>Open field behavior was examined in wells of a six-well plate, each containing 6 ml of egg water; 5-dpf zebrafish larvae were placed individually in separate wells, using a glass Pasteur pipette. Larvae are initially placed near the center of the arena, but tend to shift slightly as the plate is transferred into the recording apparatus. Using EthoVision, 5 min of tracking data were immediately recorded with no acclimation period. The video data were analyzed in 30-s time bins. For each group, we calculated distance traveled and time spent in the center zone (diameter = 25.5 mm) of the well (inner diameter = 36.6 mm).</p>
<p>For drug treatment trials, drugs in DMSO were diluted in embryo medium to a final concentration of 250 μM, 25 μM, or 2.5 μM, as described (with 2.5% DMSO). Zebrafish larvae were incubated in embryo medium containing the drug or DMSO for 30 min before transfer to the open field (in groups of three fish in 2 ml of solution in a well of a 24-well plate). Individual larvae were then transferred to a single well of a six-well plate containing DMSO (2.5%) or drug dissolved in DMSO, for the duration of the assay.</p>

<p>For imaging of interneurons, we in-crossed <italic>scn1lab</italic><sup>s552/+</sup>;<italic>Tg(1.4dlx5a-dlx6a:GFP)</italic> adult zebrafish. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing larvae were raised in PTU and imaged at 5 dpf using a Zeiss Z.1 light sheet microscope with 20× objective. The sample chamber was filled with embryo medium. Zebrafish larvae were anesthetized in 0.04% tricaine mesylate for 10 min, then embedded in 2% low melting point agarose inside a glass capillary. Image stacks were taken extending from the first dorsal GFP-positive neuron, at intervals of 4.94 μm with 20 slices per fish. Imaging files were coded and analyzed <italic>post hoc</italic> by an investigator blind to phenotype and genotype. Following imaging, the fish were removed from agar and genotyped.</p>

<title>Open field deficits in mutant larvae</title>
<p>To study anxiety-like and locomotor behavior in more detail, we adapted a version of the open field test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">Walsh and Cummins, 1976</xref>). This assay is designed to give temporal as well as spatial resolution regarding position and movement over time after larvae are introduced to a novel cylindrical chamber. Single larvae were placed in individual wells of a flat-bottom six-well plate and movement was tracked during a 5-min recording epoch. DMSO (2.5%) was tested for effects on larval behavior compared to embryo medium using Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test (<italic>N</italic> = 6 per group). No significant effects were found for total duration in center (mean ± SEM): water, 87.9 ± 44.7; DMSO, 116.6 ± 45.2 (<italic>t</italic><sub>(10.0)</sub> = 0.451, <italic>p</italic> = 0.662) or total distance moved (mean ± SEM, measured in mm): water, 869.8 ± 69.8; DMSO, 815.2 ±36.0 (<italic>t</italic><sub>(7.49)</sub> = 0.695, <italic>p</italic> = 0.508), or any of the individual time bins.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Behavioral deficits greatly decrease quality of life for DS patients. Our findings here demonstrate that zebrafish provide useful models of behavioral as well as neurophysiological symptoms of epileptic encephalopathies such as DS. While <italic>Scn1a</italic> haploinsufficiency is known to cause sleep and circadian abnormalities, hyperactivity, autistic- and anxiety-like behavior in mouse models, these comorbidities have not been previously investigated in a systematic way in <italic>scn1lab</italic> mutant zebrafish. The significant behavioral differences from wild-type larvae, as demonstrated here, and their sensitivity to pharmacological treatments, expand the repertoire of assays that can be used to characterize zebrafish models for neurologic disease and uncover new treatments.</p>
<sec id="s5A">
<title>Sleep</title>
<p>Evidence from patients, mice, and zebrafish suggest that <italic>SCN1A</italic> homologs play a conserved role in regulating motor activity and daily patterns of locomotion. Zebrafish, including larvae, are diurnal in laboratory conditions, with a light-entrainable circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cahill et al., 1998</xref>). Wild-type larvae exhibit hallmarks of sleep, including immobility, increased arousal threshold that can rapidly be reversed, characteristic posture, and sleep rebound following deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Zhdanova et al., 2001</xref>). Sleep in zebrafish can be quantified as bouts of immobility at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Elbaz et al., 2013</xref>). Our assay simplifies this approach to measure activity levels in day and night without specifying the microstructure of rest bouts. We found disrupted levels of locomotor activity at several points throughout the light-dark cycle, with a consistently increased activity in <italic>scn1lab</italic>
<sup>s552/s552</sup> larvae compared to wild types during the dark phase. Like humans, and in contrast to mice, zebrafish sleep at night, making them a useful model for diurnal behavioral patterns. High levels of cycling alternating pattern activity in non-REM sleep were reported in DS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Dhamija et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice similarly exhibit disrupted circadian activity patterns compared to controls, with decreased activity in the active (dark) phase and increased activity in the rest (light) phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Han et al., 2012a</xref>). Mice with a heterozygous knockin missense <italic>Scn1a</italic> mutation showed increased wakefulness in the active (dark) phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Papale et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, data from zebrafish and mouse models suggest that diurnal behavioral deficits associated with mutations in <italic>SCN1A</italic> homologs may be an important and conserved feature of <italic>SCN1A</italic> deficiency.</p>
<p>The increased movement that we observed in <italic>scn1lab</italic><sup>s552/s552</sup> larvae during the dark phase (night) may correspond directly to the greater electrical signals that were detected during the dark phase using a recently developed microfluidic multielectrode recording chamber method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Hong et al., 2016</xref>). Further development and characterization of zebrafish models of epileptic encephalopathies could reveal important mechanistic insights related to sleep. Future <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging and electrophysiology may also contribute to our understanding of neural activity patterns during the course of waking and sleeping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Open field exploration</title>
<p>Our open field assay featured high temporal resolution and revealed severe deficits in open field exploration and movement. Exploration in an open field assay was similarly disrupted in a zebrafish <italic>mecp2</italic> mutant model for Rett syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Pietri et al., 2013</xref>). Key features of our assay include the use of six-well plates with 36.6-mm diameter wells, pretreatment with drug for 30 min followed by continuous drug exposure, and immediate recording of locomotion following addition of the larvae to the novel wells. Binning the data into 30-s time bins revealed previously unappreciated features of the <italic>scn1lab</italic>
<sup>s552/s552</sup> mutant larvae behavior that could have been obscured with larger time bins, including a worsening (decreasing) trend in distance moved over the 5-min assay, accompanied by an improving (increasing) amount of time spent in the center of the arena. In contrast, no evidence was found for habituation in wild-type larvae in a larger (9.6 cm) dish over 15 min (using 5-min time bins; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Ahmad and Richardson, 2013</xref>). Reduced overall level of movement appears to be the primary effect of clemizole and diazepam in wild-type and mutant larvae, leading to increased variability and differences in duration spent in the center of the arena. Our findings correspond directly to the efficacy of these drugs at this concentration in reducing behavioral measures of seizures, as shown in previous papers. The zebrafish open field test, like the mouse equivalent, has clear limitations as an assay of cognitive function, and should be interpreted with caution as a measure of anxiety since many factors can influence open field behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">Walsh and Cummins, 1976</xref>). Several other cognitive assays have been reported for adult zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Meshalkina et al., 2017</xref>) but are not reliably established for larvae. Overall, our results suggest that modifications to the open field assay were important for revealing behavioral deficits and could be applied to a variety of larval zebrafish mutant models.</p>

<title>Pharmacology</title>
<p>Valproic acid, diazepam, trazodone, and clemizole have all been studied for antiepileptic activity in <italic>scn1lab</italic> zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Baraban et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Griffin et al., 2017</xref>). For these drugs, effects in wild-type zebrafish on diurnal rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Rihel et al., 2010</xref>) or other aspects of locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Herrmann, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Richendrfer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Baraban et al., 2013</xref>) have also been investigated. Valproic acid, a broad spectrum antiepileptic drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Tomson et al., 2016</xref>) commonly used in DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Chiron and Dulac, 2011</xref>), exerts protective effects in larval or adult zebrafish exposed to the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazole: (1) decreasing behavioral or electrographic seizure activity and (2) improving deficits in learning of a passive avoidance response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Valproic acid has also been shown to increase “waking” activity in wild-type larvae, with a lowest effective dose of 15 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Rihel et al., 2010</xref>). Although valproic acid at a concentration of 1 mM exerted antiepileptic activity in <italic>scn1lab</italic>
<sup>s552/s552</sup> mutant larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Baraban et al., 2013</xref>), no significant effect on behavior was observed here with valproic acid at a concentration of 250 μM. Trazodone, a drug commonly prescribed for insomnia and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Rickels et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Mendelson, 2005</xref>), potentiates the high-speed movements caused by light flash in larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Koseki et al., 2014</xref>), and can increase rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Rihel et al., 2010</xref>), but had no significant effects on the behaviors we assayed in the range of concentrations we tested (2.5-250 μM). Diazepam, a benzodiazepine and antiepileptic drug, decreases locomotor activity, seizures, and measures of anxiety in wild-type zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Zhdanova et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Baraban et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Schnörr et al., 2012</xref>). Diazepam has been tested at a range of concentrations from 10 nM up to 1 mM in larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Zhdanova et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Baraban et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Richendrfer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Baraban et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Griffin et al., 2017</xref>). We found that 250 μM diazepam significantly decreased locomotion in an open field test of the <italic>scn1lab</italic>
<sup>s552/s552</sup> mutant larvae, extending previous results that showed nearly complete elimination of movements at a 100 μM concentration, compared to minimal effects at a 1 μM concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Zhdanova et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Baraban et al., 2005</xref>). An even higher concentration of clemizole (667 μM) led to nearly complete elimination of movement in <italic>scn1lab</italic>
<sup>s552/s552</sup> mutants following a brief exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Baraban et al., 2013</xref>). Clemizole, a first-generation antihistamine recently identified as a potential antiepileptic drug acting on serotonin receptors in <italic>scn1lab</italic>
<sup>s552/s552</sup> mutant larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Baraban et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Griffin et al., 2017</xref>), decreased behavioral activity in the hyperactive <italic>scn1lab</italic>
<sup>s552/s552</sup> larvae in both the diurnal and open field assays. Clemizole had no significant effects on locomotion at concentrations between 6.25 μM and 50 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Baraban et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, clemizole can also increase “rest” activity in wild-type larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Rihel et al., 2010</xref>), supporting our finding of decreased nighttime locomotion in mutant larvae.</p>
<p>Caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist, is thought to produce anxiogenic effects in fish, rodents, and humans. Larval zebrafish exposed to caffeine at 100 mg/l (515 μM) exhibited decreased locomotor activity and reduced swim speed in the open field test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Maximino et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Richendrfer et al., 2012</xref>). A locomotor depressive effect of high concentrations of caffeine has also been observed in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Finn and Holtzman, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">Svenningsson et al., 1995</xref>). Our control studies using 250 μM caffeine are consistent with these reports that high concentrations of caffeine will decrease locomotor activity in wild-type larval zebrafish and support a conclusion that features of exploration and anxiety may be conserved between larval zebrafish and mammals.</p>

<title>Interneuron density</title>
<p>Interneuron defects are thought to be responsible for pathology in DS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Ogiwara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Mistry et al., 2014</xref>). Deficits in GABA-mediated inhibition may reflect changes in the number of inhibitory synapses or neurons. Using <italic>in vivo</italic> light sheet microscopy and an interneuron reporter line (i.e., dlx5/6:GFP) we found no difference in the number of GFP-positive neurons in <italic>scn1lab</italic>
<sup>s552/s552</sup> mutant larvae and control siblings. As these GFP cells are primarily GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Robles et al., 2011</xref>), our data suggest that interneurons are present in normal abundance at these early stages of development. Consistent with our findings in a zebrafish model, differences in interneuron density in mouse models of <italic>Scn1a</italic> deficiency, or patients with DS, have not been reported.</p>

<p>Some of the greatest advantages of <italic>in vivo</italic> disease modeling using larval zebrafish are the ease of genetic modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">Varshney et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Gagnon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Li et al., 2016</xref>), the broad range of behavioral assays available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Brockerhoff et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Budick and O'Malley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Fero et al., 2011</xref>), and the scalability for phenotype-based drug screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Rihel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Gut et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Dinday and Baraban, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bruni et al., 2016</xref>). As demonstrated here, clinically relevant comorbidities such as sleep, movement disorders, and anxiety can be efficiently assayed in a larval zebrafish model of DS, despite concerns that “lower model organisms” such as zebrafish would not allow assessment of comorbid symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">EpiPM Consortium, 2015</xref>). Moreover, these assays combined with the unique attributes of larval zebrafish for higher throughput drug screening (e.g., large clutch sizes, multi-well readouts, and small-molecule permeation), can be used for the rapid identification of drugs that reduce behavioral deficits.</p>

<p>Reviewing Editor: Alfonso Represa, INSERM</p>
<p>Decisions are customarily a result of the Reviewing Editor and the peer reviewers coming together and discussing their recommendations until a consensus is reached. When revisions are invited, a fact-based synthesis statement explaining their decision and outlining what is needed to prepare a revision will be listed below. The following reviewer(s) agreed to reveal their identity: Gerald Downes.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>Dear authors,</p>
<p>Both reviewers evaluated again you revised version and appreciated the improvements. They are still supportive of your report and recognize the interest of your data. There are however a few points that would require revision and that you'll find described below. Note that both referees wonder if the interpretations of data from open field tests, mainly on the pharmacologic effects, are convincing and make some suggestions for clarifying the issue. I think this is important to do.</p>

<p>1) The limits of the model should be clearly stated (also in the abstract) and discussed: this zebrafish model can be used to reproduce some of the behavioral comorbidities associated with Dravet syndrome, but it has clear limits as a model of other comorbidities (e.g. cognitive defects).</p>
<p>2) From the data in fig 4, it seems that with diazepam &amp; clemizole fish basically don't move (in particular with diazepam): they stay in the center without moving... Is this a real amelioration? Moreover, in the open field Wt fish move more than mutant ones. This defect is amplified by diazepam or clemizole...</p>
<p>3) For the statistical analysis of the data shown in fig 2 and table 1, ANOVA or a non parametric equivalent should be used. Which test has been used to check normality and equality of variance (e.g. Welch t-test has been used in Fig 1, fig 3 but not for Table 1</p>
<p>4) In their response, the authors stated:</p>
<p>‘Locomotion tracking software automatically detects larvae that are darker than the background in the DanioVision system (Noldus). We have two DanioVision systems in the lab and the older system circa 2012 (which was used for the initial light-dark studies presented in Figure 1) has a camera that appears to be less sensitive than the newer DanioVision system circa 2016 (used for all subsequent studies). Thus, the absolute values in mm for distance moved are different between DanioVision systems and not directly comparable.’</p>
<p>This should be clearly described in the methods section</p>
<p>5) Results p8 line 215-216. The time with and without DMSO should be reported</p>
<p>Referee 2:</p>
<p>6) Given that the authors state that there are new features of their open field assay compared to previously published data, the wild-type responses to different drugs should be shown in this new context. Also, for the reader's convenience, the authors should plot the wild-type activity obtained in Figure 3 in Figure 4. This would facilitate evaluation of whether drugs restore mutant activity to wild-type levels.</p>
<p>7) The decreased locomotion reported in the open field pharmacology experiments seem to preclude meaningful conclusions about anxiety. With increased anxiolytic effects alone, you would expect to observe increased exploratory behavior along with increased time in the center. The data shown here are only decreases in locomotor behavior and the increased time in the center could be incidental to the starting location. For example, would a deeply anesthetized or dead larva provide a different result than the 250uM diazepam results? What would the diazepam data look like if the larvae started out at the edge of the well? The authors could address this concern by taking into account the starting positions of the larvae in the well and/or, for comparison purposes to the drugs they used, testing drugs have been shown to regulate anxiety and locomotion separately.</p>
<p>8) The concentration of diazepam utilized to reveal an effect in the open field pharmacology experiments seems too high. 250uM is several fold higher than that used in at least a couple previous studies which describe its anxiolytic effects in larval zebrafish (for example, Richendrfer et al. 2012). Intermediate concentration(s) of should be used.</p>
<p>9) Minor correction: -The orientation and abbreviations used in Figure 5 should be articulated in the figure legend.</p>
