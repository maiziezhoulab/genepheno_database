<abstract>
<p>Rac GTPases regulate the development of cortical/hippocampal GABAergic interneurons by affecting the early development and migration of GABAergic precursors. We have addressed the function of Rac1 and Rac3 proteins during the late maturation of hippocampal interneurons. We observed specific phenotypic differences between conditional Rac1 and full Rac3 knockout mice. Rac1 deletion caused greater generalized hyperactivity and cognitive impairment compared with Rac3 deletion. This phenotype matched with a more evident functional impairment of the inhibitory circuits in Rac1 mutants, showing higher excitability and reduced spontaneous inhibitory currents in the CA hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Morphological analysis confirmed a differential modification of the inhibitory circuits: deletion of either Rac caused a similar reduction of parvalbumin-positive inhibitory terminals in the pyramidal layer. Intriguingly, cannabinoid receptor-1-positive terminals were strongly increased only in the CA1 of Rac1-depleted mice. This increase may underlie the stronger electrophysiological defects in this mutant. Accordingly, incubation with an antagonist for cannabinoid receptors partially rescued the reduction of spontaneous inhibitory currents in the pyramidal cells of Rac1 mutants. Our results show that Rac1 and Rac3 have independent roles in the formation of GABAergic circuits, as highlighted by the differential effects of their deletion on the late maturation of specific populations of interneurons.</p>

<body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons are fundamental players in modulating the activity of the neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C2">Batista-Brito and Fishell 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C19">Gelman and Marín 2010</xref>). The abnormal maturation of cortical and hippocampal interneurons is believed to alter the balance between excitatory and inhibitory activity in the brain, and to cause neural and intellectual disabilities as those observed in epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C4">Brooks-Kayal 2011</xref>). The majority of the cortical and hippocampal GABAergic interneurons are born in the ventral telencephalon, migrating from either the caudal or medial ganglionic eminences (CGE and MGE, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C49">Wonders and Anderson 2006</xref>). These GABAergic interneurons distribute throughout the cortex and hippocampus where they establish synaptic contacts with excitatory pyramidal neurons or other interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C32">Morozov et al. 2006</xref>).</p><p>Several extracellular cues have been shown to drive the migration and differentiation of the cortical and hippocampal GABAergic cells, while very little is known about the intracellular mechanisms that drive the different phases of their maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C22">Hernández-Miranda et al. 2010</xref>). Rac proteins are members of the family of Rho GTPases with important regulatory functions on the cytoskeleton, and critical in several aspects of neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C15">de Curtis 2008</xref>). Vertebrates express 2 Rac proteins in their brain, Rac1 and the neural-specific, developmentally regulated Rac1B/Rac3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C30">Malosio et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C3">Bolis et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C10">Corbetta et al. 2005</xref>). Recent studies have used mouse genetics to address the function of the 2 Rac proteins in the development of cortical and hippocampal interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C7">Chen et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C42">Vidaki et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C41">Vaghi et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C39">Tivodar et al. 2015</xref>). We have shown that the deletion of both proteins affects the migration of postmitotic interneurons, leading to the impairment of the brain circuitry and the early onset of spontaneous epileptic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C41">Vaghi et al. 2014</xref>). These phenotypes correspond to a defect in the development of specific neuronal populations. The number of Lhx6-positive cortical and hippocampal interneurons originating in the MGE was reduced. This finding matches with a drastic decrease of the number of parvalbumin (PV)-positive cells, largely deriving from precursors born in the MGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C40">Tricoire et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C23">Inan et al. 2012</xref>). The severity of this defect was dependent on the combined loss of Rac1 and Rac3, although we could observe milder but significant decreases in the number of PV-positive cells also in the developing brain of single Rac1N or Rac3KO mice. Therefore, while the loss of one Rac protein may be compensated by the other in the development of this class of interneurons, each GTPase also performs specific functions. Here, we have addressed the effects of single Rac deletion on the maturation of the cortical–hippocampal interneuronal network, with the aim of identifying specific functions for the 2 GTPases. We found that Rac1 and Rac3 contribute differently to the development of hippocampal PV-positive GABAergic interneurons. Deletion of either Rac leads to a similar moderate loss of PV-positive interneurons, but affects differently the morpho-functional development of the hippocampal circuits. These dissimilarities may underlie the distinct behavioral and neurological consequences observed in Rac1N and Rac3KO mice. The analysis of single Rac deletion during late neuronal maturation highlights specific morphological and functional phenotypes that are not compensated by the remaining Rac.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mice</title><p>Experimental handling of mice was approved by the National Ministry of Health, in accordance with institutional guidelines and EEC regulation 86/609/CEE.

Food and water were available ad libitum in the home cage. All behavioral procedures were approved by the Animal Care of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute, and by the National Ministry of Health (IACUC #653). All the behavioral tests were assessed on 3 to 4-months-old mice, comparing WT with Rac3KO littermates, and Rac1N with Rac1flox littermates. Additionally, to exclude effects of the Syn-Cre transgene on behavioral performance, Rac1flox mice were compared with Syn-Cre and WT (C57Bl6/N) mice in the emergence and spontaneous alternation tests.</p><p>Dark–light box, emergence and novelty tests were used to assess explorative and emotional behavior (for detailed test procedure see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C29">Madani et al. 2003</xref>). The hidden-platform version of the water maze was used to test spatial reference memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C47">Wolfer and Lipp 1992</xref>). Visual ability was tested in the flag-visible version for 4 consecutive trials in one day. Spontaneous alternation task was used to measure hippocampus-dependent spatial working memory in a nonfood rewarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C13">D'Adamo et al. 2014</xref>) task. A mouse was released in the central hub of a cross maze (4 arms) and left free to explore for 10 min. Number and sequence of arm entries were recorded. A correct alternation was considered when no more than one repetition over 5 entries was made. Spatial working memory was tested in food rewarded 8-arm radial maze as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C14">D'Adamo et al. 2002</xref>). Trace fear conditioning was used to test hippocampal-dependent associative memory as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C14">D'Adamo et al. 2002</xref>). Briefly, during the training phase the delivery of the unconditioned stimulus (US: foot shock) was delivered at the end of the presentation of the conditioned stimulus (CS: tone), with a CS–US interval of 15 s. Twenty-four hours after conditioning, context memory (CTX) and CS memory (CUE) were tested. CTX took place in the training chamber and consisted of 2-min observation. CUE memory took place in a different chamber and consisted of 1-min without (Bl: baseline) followed by 1-min with the CS turned on (CUE).</p><p>During all tests, animals were video-tracked using the EthoVision 2.3 system (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, Netherlands), with an image frequency of 4.2/s. Raw data were transferred to Wintrack 2.4 for off-line analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was used for statistical analysis (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Normal distribution and homogeneity of variances among our data samples were tested with the K–S normality test and Bartlett’s test for homogeneity. Our data did not differ significantly from computed ideal variables. Main effects were verified using nonparametric tests.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Electrophysiological experiments were performed on hippocampal slices prepared from 3 to 6-weeks-old WT, Rac1flox, Syn-Cre, Rac1N, and Rac3KO mice. Animals were anesthetized by inhalation of isofluorane and transcardially perfused with cold (&lt;4°C), carboxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) cutting solution (70 mM sucrose, 80 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 15 mM glucose, 7 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>). Transversal 350-μm-thick slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C38">Stoop and Pralong 2000</xref>) were transferred to an incubation chamber filled with carboxygenated aCSF medium (125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 15 mM glucose, 1.3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>). All recordings were performed at 23–25°C on submerged slices perfused at 0.6 mL/min with aCSF. The recording chamber was mounted on an E600FN microscope equipped with a 4× lens and a 40× water-immersion objective (Nikon), and connected to a near-infrared CCD camera. The data were derived from CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in voltage- and current-clamp mode. To investigate the susceptibility to induce ictal-like epileptiform activity, the following intracellular solution was used: 130 mM K-gluconate, 4 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM creatine phosphate, 2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.3 mM Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3 with KOH). To register the inhibitory chloride-mediated GABAergic postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), pipettes were filled with 120 mM Cs-methanesulphonate, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM EGTA, 4 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.3 mM Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, 5 mM lidocaine <italic>N</italic>-ethylbromide, 8 mM HEPES (pH 7.3 with KOH). Membrane voltage was corrected off-line for a measured liquid junction potential. Series resistance was always compensated by 70–90% and monitored throughout the experiment. Recordings were made with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and digitized with a Digidata 1322 computer interface (Molecular Devices). Data were acquired using the software Clampex 9.2 (Molecular Device), sampled at 20 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz.</p><p>All drugs were added to the aCFS medium. The induction of epileptiform-like discharges was performed by perfusion with 500 μM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, Sigma-Aldrich), a selective blocker of the A-type potassium channels.</p><p>The IPSCs recordings were carried out in the presence of glutamatergic synaptic blockers: 10 μM 2,3-Dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[<italic>f</italic>]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX, Tocris Cookson), an AMPA receptor antagonist, and 30 μM 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP, Tocris Cookson), an NMDA receptor antagonist. IPSCs were abolished by 10 μM bicuculline methiodide (bicuculline, Sigma-Aldrich), a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist. <italic>N</italic>-piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-pyrazolecarboxamide HCL (SR141716A, Sigma-Aldrich) was used diluted to 1 µM in aCFS supplemented with 1 g/L BSA to antagonize the CB1Rs.</p><p>Data were analyzed with the software Clampfit 10.2 (Molecular Devices) and Origin (Microcal). Cell surface was estimated by integrating the capacitive current evoked by a −10 mV pulse. Neuronal input resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub>in</sub>) was calculated in the linear portion of the <italic>I–V</italic> relationship during depolarizing voltage responses near the resting potential. To analyze the 4-AP-induced seizure-like activity, the preictal events, the ictal discharge, and the afterdischarge were detected and characterized. For the analysis presented in this study, synchronous epileptiform events shorter than 3 s that generally precede the ictal-like discharge are indicated as “preictal activity”, while sustained events are termed “ictal-like activity”; highly synchronous events that may occur after the ictal-like activity are indicated as afterdischarges.</p><p>The IPSCs were detected manually: the amplitude of the events obeyed a log-normal distribution and accordingly the mean amplitudes were computed using a log-normal function; the interevent intervals were distributed exponentially, and mean frequencies were obtained from the best monoexponential fit of each distribution. All measurements are presented as means ± SEM. Statistical significance was determined by the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test and by one-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Video-EEG Recording and Analysis</title><p>WT (<italic>n</italic> = 12), Syn-Cre (<italic>n</italic> = 12), Rac1flox (<italic>n</italic> = 20), Rac1N (<italic>n</italic> = 20) and Rac3KO (<italic>n</italic> = 20) mice underwent video-electroencephalogram (EEG) recording, as already described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C6">Cambiaghi et al. 2013</xref>).

Two electrodes were placed on the right and left parietal areas and one over cerebellum as a common reference. After 3 days, mice were monitored by video-EEG for 6–48 h. Data were digitally recorded with a System Plus device (Micromed, Mogliano Veneto, Italy). EEG traces were filtered between 0.53 and 60 Hz, sampled at 256 Hz and coded with 12 bits. Four animals per genotype were recorded for each age group, each one consisting of 20 consecutive days, between postnatal day 20 (P20) and P120. Video-EEG recordings were visually inspected to detect spontaneous seizures, defined as high-amplitude (at least 2 times the baseline) rhythmic discharges lasting at least 5 s.</p><p>Power spectra of the background EEG activity were calculated by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using the Welch periodogram method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C44">Welch 1967</xref>). The analysis was performed during the awake state recognized by video recording inspection. For each recording, 3–4 min of artefact-free traces were selected for spectral analysis, at least 1 h after the start of recording. EEG sessions including spontaneous seizures at any time were not considered. FFT was applied on epochs of 2 s within the selected period, tapered with a Hanning window, obtaining a spectrum for each epoch with a frequency resolution of 0.5 Hz. The mean power spectrum was then estimated by averaging the single epoch spectra and the 2 channels. Absolute power values were then normalized to the total absolute power to obtain relative values comparable among the different animals. Spectral analyses were performed using the EEG Analyzer function included in the software Micromed System PLUS.</p><p>The mean dominant frequency (MDF), defined as the “center of mass” of a frequency band, was calculated from power spectra within delta (1–4 Hz), and theta–alpha (6–10 Hz) bands, as the weighted mean of the frequencies included within the band, with their corresponding power values as weight. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C6">Cambiaghi et al. 2013</xref>). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA on delta and theta–alpha relative power and MDF values, considering the factor GROUP (WT, Syn-Cre, Rac1flox, Rac1N and Rac3KO) and using the Bonferroni post hoc analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Rac1N Mice Show Generalized Hyperactivity</title><p>We previously found that Rac3 KO mice show hyperactivity not associated with anxiety or curiosity, but to higher generalized basal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C9">Corbetta et al. 2008</xref>).

We postulated a differential effect of the deletion of either Rac on the maturation of the remaining hippocampal PV-positive cells. The main population of hippocampal PV-positive cells is represented by the basket cells that innervate the perisomatic area of the excitatory pyramidal cells. Within the hippocampal CA fields, the PV-positive axon terminals are concentrated in the pyramidal layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C36">Sik et al. 1995</xref>). The signal for PV was markedly reduced in the CA pyramidal layer in both KO lines (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F4">4</xref><italic>D</italic> and <italic>D</italic>): in the CA1 pyramidal layer the PV-positive area was decreased by 45% in Rac1N and by 37% in Rac3KO mice, while in the CA3 region the signal was reduced by 43% and 40% in Rac1N and Rac3KO respectively compared with their control littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F4">4</xref><italic>E</italic>).

Different types of GABAergic interneurons may express either one or both GAD65 and GAD67 isoforms. As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C18">Fish et al. 2011</xref>), the colocalization of PV with GAD65 was limited, while PV colocalized extensively with GAD67 around the soma of pyramidal neurons (data not shown).

The area of colocalization of PV, GAD67, and VGAT was significantly decreased in the CA1 pyramidal layer from both Rac1N and Rac3KO with respect to their controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F5">5</xref><italic>D</italic>, left graph). These data show that the PV-positive signal was significantly affected in the pyramidal layer of both KO animals. Interestingly, the fraction of VGAT-positive area in the CA1 pyramidal layer (=total VGAT-positive area) colocalizing with PV and GAD67 was strongly decreased in Rac1N and only weakly reduced in Rac3KO mice compared with controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F5">5</xref><italic>D</italic>, right graph). The difference between the reduction observed in Rac1N (−42%) and Rac3KO mice (−11%) was significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). This result fits with the unexpected finding that the total VGAT-positive area in the CA1 pyramidal layer was significantly decreased in Rac3KO versus WT mice (−25%), but not in Rac1N versus Rac1flox mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F5">5</xref><italic>E</italic>). Finally, the evaluation of the density of dots positive for both PV and VGAT confirmed that the PV-positive GABAergic presynaptic terminals were significantly decreased in the hippocampal pyramidal layer of Rac1N and Rac3KO mice compared with their respective controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F5">5</xref><italic>F</italic>).

We first examined the electrophysiological passive properties of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, which appeared normal in terms of their number and capacity to form morphological synapses (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cercor/bhv274/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 3</ext-link>).

Bath perfusion of brain slices with 500 µM 4-AP induced epileptic-like ictal discharges (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F6">6</xref><italic>A</italic>) in 56% of WT, 60% of Rac1flox, and 63% of Syn-Cre hippocampal pyramidal cells examined, and in 82% and 80% of the cells from Rac1N and Rac3KO mice, respectively. Preictal activity was present in all the cells analyzed, including those not showing ictal-like activity, and independently from the genotype. Cells showing ictal-like activity always showed afterdischarges. Despite the time of incubation with 4-AP was similar in all the recorded cells (300 ± 4 s), the interval between the beginning of stimulation with 4-AP and the appearance of the ictal event (TTI, time-to-ictal event) was significantly shorter in Rac1N pyramidal cells (388 ± 29 s) compared with either WT (610 ± 18 s), Rac1flox (593 ± 15 s), or Syn-Cre cells (606 ± 22 s) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F6">6</xref><italic>B</italic>). The ictal events were also significantly longer-lasting in Rac1N than in control cells (duration of ictal-like activity: 53.6 ± 8.5 vs. 22.3 ± 1.8 s) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F6">6</xref><italic>C</italic>).

Accordingly, incubation of brain sections with the CB1R antagonist SR141716A (1 µM) induced an increase in the frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs in both Rac1N and WT CA1 neurons. We measured an increase of 17–19 ± 3–4% in the frequency of sIPSCs in control neurons (from either WT, Rac1flox, or Syn-Cre mice), of +11 ± 2% in Rac3KO neurons, and of +42 ± 9% in Rac1N neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F8">8</xref><italic>E</italic>). The increase in frequency induced by the CB1R antagonist measured in Rac1N neurons was significantly larger compared with that observed in WT neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F8">8</xref><italic>F</italic>). Moreover, we observed a significant increase in the amplitude of sIPSCs in Rac1N neurons treated with the CB1R antagonist, while no effects were induced by the drug in either Rac3KO, WT, Rac1flox, or Syn-Cre neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F8">8</xref><italic>G</italic>,<italic>H</italic>).

Altogether these results indicate that blockade of the CB1Rs by an antagonist partially rescues the defect in sIPSCs observed in Rac1N neurons, possibly by preventing the CB1R-dependent inhibition of GABA release. The data also suggest that the specific increase in CB1R-positive terminals observed in the CA1 of Rac1N mice may contribute to the stronger phenotype observed in these mutants mice compared with Rac3KO mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have addressed the role of Rac1 and Rac3 GTPases during GABAergic interneuron development, and shown that single deletion of either Rac has different consequences on the late development of specific populations of hippocampal interneurons. These morphological defects result in the distinct alterations of the hippocampal inhibitory circuits, which are paralleled by different behavioral and functional phenotypes. Previous studies have established that Rac proteins are important for the development of cortical and hippocampal GABAergic interneurons. In particular, Rac1 is required for the exit from the cell cycle of the MGE-born interneuron precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C42">Vidaki et al. 2012</xref>), and to confer migratory competence to the differentiating progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C7">Chen et al. 2007</xref>).

Tests evaluating the exploratory activity of the mice have shown a greater generalized hyperactive behavior of Rac1N mutants compared with the one previously described in Rac3KO mice. Contrary to previous observations on Rac3KO mice, we found here that Rac1N mutants had evident spatial reference memory defects in the water maze. On the other hand, we cannot exclude that the impairment in spatial learning is a consequence of the water phobia shown by Rac1N mice during this test. More tests revealed additional defects specific for Rac1N mice. Working memory measured by the spontaneous alternation and 8-arm radial maze tests was normal in Rac3KO mice, but clearly affected in Rac1N mice: both tests revealed hyperactivity and reduced performance in these animals. Again, the results indicate that the impairment of working memory in Rac1N mice may be a consequence of their greater hyperactivity. Finally, the comparison of the Rac mutants in the auditory fear-conditioning test revealed a defect only in Rac1N mice: they were able to learn during the training period, but defective in retaining the information, indicating an impairment of their associative memory. Two main conclusions from the comparative behavioral analysis are that (1) both Rac GTPases are required for the development of normal behavior, (2) but depletion of Rac1 affects behavior more severely by affecting also hippocampus-dependent cognitive functions.</p><p>We have recently described the specific reduction of the PV-positive interneurons in the double Rac1/Rac3 KO mice, while other major classes of GABAergic interneurons including somatostatin-, calretinin-, and nNOS-positive cells were only weakly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C41">Vaghi et al. 2014</xref>). The reduction of PV-positive cells is caused by defects in the migration of their MGE-derived precursors. Here, we have characterized the later maturation of these neurons in the single KO mice that appeared to develop normally up to the second postnatal week. Deletion of either Rac leads to a limited decrease (≈10–15%) of PV-positive neurons in adult mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F4">4</xref><italic>A–C</italic>). On the other hand, we observed a stronger reduction (≈50%) of the synaptic terminals in the pyramidal layer of Rac1N and Rac3KO mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F5">5</xref>). Our interpretation of these data is that the limited loss of PV+ cells in single Rac KO animals may be due to a minor migratory defect originating from the loss of one Rac protein, while the stronger loss of terminals is also due to the effect of either RacKO on the maturation of the remaining PV-positive GABAergic cells. We observed similar reductions of the PV-/VGAT-/GAD-67-positive presynaptic terminals in the CA area of the hippocampus of the 2 mutants. These results indicate that depletion of either Rac has similar negative effects on the late development of the hippocampal PV-positive interneurons that cannot account by themselves for the distinct behavioral phenotypes observed in the 2 mutants.</p><p>The comparative EEG and electrophysiological analysis to identify possible defects in the brain and hippocampal circuitry has highlighted other differences between Rac1N and Rac3KO animals. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that the passive properties of CA pyramidal neurons were similar in WT and single KO mice, showing that depletion of either Rac does not alter the intrinsic functional properties of these neurons. On the other hand the CA1 pyramidal cells from Rac1N mice are more sensitive to the action of the convulsant 4-AP, since they could develop earlier and more prolonged ictal-like events compared with either control mice (WT, Rac1flox, or Syn-Cre) or Rac3KO mice that were less sensitive than Rac1N, but more prone than control animals to develop ictal-like events (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F6">6</xref>).</p><p>Quantitative EEG on freely moving mice revealed abnormal brain activity in both Rac KO mice, with more evident significant slowing of theta–alpha rhythms in Rac1N than in Rac3KO animals (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cercor/bhv274/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 4</ext-link>). Since Rac1N but not Rac3KO have seizures, the observed slowing of background oscillatory activity in these 2 groups cannot be fully explained as a mere consequence of repeated epileptic discharges, but is rather consistent with the observed histological and electrophysiological hippocampal abnormalities, being this structure the main source of theta brain rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C5">Buzsáki 2002</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the electrophysiological and EEG data demonstrate a stronger hyperexcitability of Rac1N mice. The hypothesis that this stronger hyperexcitability was due to an altered balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs on pyramidal cells was supported by the finding that spontaneous GABAergic IPSCs were reduced in the CA1 of Rac1N mice compared with control (WT, Rac1flox, Syn-Cre) and Rac3KO mice, probably due to a reduction in spontaneous firing from GABergic interneurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F7">7</xref>). Again, the similar reduction of PV-positive synaptic contacts observed in the CA1 of either mutant is not sufficient to explain the noticeable differences observed in the excitability of their pyramidal cells.</p><p>Two main types of interneurons target the soma of hippocampal pyramidal cells to control their activity: the MGE-derived PV-positive basket cells and the CCK-positive basket cells deriving from the caudal GE and characterized by synaptic terminals positive for CB1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C33">Morozov et al. 2009</xref>). PV-positive basket cells form the majority of presynaptic GABAergic contacts on the pyramidal cells of hippocampal CA1/CA3. Therefore the important loss of PV-positive presynaptic terminals observed in the CA1 of Rac mutants should cause a decrease of the total VGAT-positive terminals in the pyramidal layer. While VGAT was significantly decreased in the CA1 of Rac3KO mice, to our surprise it was not reduced in Rac1N mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F5">5</xref><italic>E</italic>). On the other hand, we detected a striking increase in CB1R-positive terminals only in the CA1 of Rac1N, which may account for the higher concentration of VGAT-positive terminals in the pyramidal layer of these mice.</p><p>The CB1R-/CCK-positive basket cells modulate the excitability of both hippocampal pyramidal and PV-positive basket cells by making GABAergic synaptic contacts with both neuronal types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C24">Karson et al. 2009</xref>). In turn CCK-positive cells are modulated by cannabinoids: activated pyramidal cells release cannabinoids that activate the CB1R on the terminals of CCK-positive basket cells, thereby inhibiting the release of GABA specifically on the active pyramidal neurons: a form of short-term plasticity known as depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C26">Katona et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C25">Katona et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C34">Ohno-Shosaku et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C45">Wilson et al. 2001</xref>). The upregulation of CB1R-positive terminals in the CA1 of Rac1N mice may underlie the different behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes observed in these animals.</p><p>We speculate that 2 mechanisms may contribute to the increased excitability observed in the Rac1N pyramidal cells. First, the observed increase in CB1R may increase the cannabinoid-mediated inhibition of GABA release on pyramidal cells, thus increasing their excitability. In this view, CB1R represents a target to attempt the partial rescue of the drastic decrease of the frequency of sIPSCs in Rac1N pyramidal cells. In support of this hypothesis, we have shown that incubation with a CB1R antagonist that prevents the cannabinoid-induced inhibition of GABA release from CCK-positive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C26">Katona et al. 1999</xref>) is able to increase the frequency of the sIPSCs both in Rac1N and in WT CA1 pyramidal cells; and the effect was more conspicuous in the Rac1N cells, suggesting that preventing the inhibition of GABA release by the CB1Rs can partially rescue the defect in the Rac1N animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F8">8</xref>). Second, we hypothesize that in Rac1N mice the increase of the CB1R-positive terminals by CCK cells on pyramidal neurons may be accompanied by an increase of CB1R-negative terminals made by the same population of CCK-positive cells onto PV-positive interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C24">Karson et al. 2009</xref>). This is expected to reduce the excitability of the PV-positive cells, and therefore it may at least in part be responsible for the observed decrease in the frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs observed in CA1 Rac1N pyramidal cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BHV274F7">7</xref>).</p><p>It has been proposed that CCK- and PV-positive cells play distinct roles to coordinately modulate the outcome of hippocampal pyramidal cells, by contributing differently to network oscillations: given their firing time and their sensitivity to endocannabinoids, CCK-positive cells may aid in differentiating subgroups of pyramidal neurons, whereas PV-positive cells would synchronize the entire network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C27">Klausberger et al. 2005</xref>). The reduction of GABA release from the CB1R-positive terminals in the CA region of the hippocampus is the proposed mechanism by which CB1R ligands may influence the oscillations of the hippocampal network and the associated cognitive functions. In this respect, CB1R activation appears to impair memory formation and consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C8">Clarke et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C35">Puighermanal et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C46">Wise et al. 2009</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that the increase in CB1R-positive terminals observed in the Rac1N mice may at least in part explain the negative effects observed on different forms of memory in these mutants.</p><p>In this study, we have identified distinct alterations of specific inhibitory components upon deletion of either Rac1 or Rac3, which result in different alteration of neuronal excitability and behavior. The effects are more pronounced in the Rac1N mutants, where morphological alterations of the inhibitory circuitry are more evident.</p><p>Rac GTPases act by interacting with specific effectors to trigger specific signaling pathways. The information about effectors or pathways specifically triggered by either one of the 2 Rac proteins analyzed in this study is very limited. Rac3 has been shown to have some specific effects in different cell lines. For example, knockdown of Rac3, but not of Rac1, results in the induction of autophagy in different cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C52">Zhu et al 2011</xref>). Moreover, it has been reported that Rac1 and Rac3 have opposite effects on the adhesion of N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C20">Hajdo-Milasinović et al. 2007</xref>). In contrast to Rac1, Rac3 inhibits differentiation of neuroblastoma cells by interacting differently with GIT1/βPIX, a protein complex involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C21">Hajdo-Milasinović et al. 2009</xref>). We have not been able to find biochemical differences in the interaction of Rac1 and Rac3 with the GIT complexes isolated from the embryonic brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C16">Di Cesare et al. 2000</xref>). On the other hand, we have been able to observe specific positive effects of the avian ortholog of Rac3 overexpression on the branching of cultured primary retinal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C1">Albertinazzi et al 1998</xref>). Based on these observations, it will be interesting to investigate the role of these proteins in the Rac-dependent maturation of interneurons, by exploiting the possibility of analyzing their development in vitro. Interestingly, it has been recently shown that GIT1 deficiency in mice causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-like phenotypes, as well as reduced inhibitory presynaptic input and PV-positive signal in the hippocampal CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C48">Won et al 2011</xref>), as observed in the Rac KO mice described here.</p><p>Several questions remain to be addressed to fully understand the role of each Rac on the different interneurons analyzed in this study. The alteration of the development of CB1R-positive CCK- and of PV-positive cells has been implicated in neurological and psychiatric disorders, and suggested to underlie the cortical oscillation deficits and working memory impairments observed in neural disorders such as schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C12">Curley and Lewis 2012</xref>). Interestingly, CB1Rs are present also on the hippocampal glutamatergic terminals of principal cells, where they have been shown to provide endogenous protection against kainate-induced epileptic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="BHV274C31">Monory et al. 2006</xref>). Therefore, any further insights in the role of Rac GTPases and associated intracellular mechanisms in the late maturation of CCK- and PV-positive interneurons, as well as in the endocannabinoid-mediated control of hippocampal glutamatergic neurotransmission will be important to the understanding of the pathogenesis of disorders associated with the alteration of the excitatory neuronal activity.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cercor/bhv274/-/DC1">Supplementary Material can be found at http://www.cercor.oxfordjournals.org/ online.</ext-link></p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by <funding-source>Telethon—Italy</funding-source> (grant number <award-id>GGP12126 to IdC</award-id>).
