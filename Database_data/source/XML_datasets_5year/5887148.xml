<abstract>
<p>Locomotion is one of the most prominent behaviors in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Neuronal circuits that ultimately produce coordinated dorso-ventral sinusoidal bends mediate this behavior. Synchronized locomotion requires an intricate balance between excitation and inhibition at the neuromuscular junctions (NMJ), the complex cellular and molecular mechanisms of which are not fully understood. Here, we describe the role of a cell adhesion molecule <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">CASY-1</ext-link>, which functions to maintain this balance at the NMJ. In this study, we dissect out mechanisms by which the longer CASY-1A isoform could be affecting the excitatory cholinergic signaling at the NMJ by modulating the activity of sensory neurons. Mutants in <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> appear to have hyperactive sensory neurons, resulting in accelerated locomotion and motor circuit activity. These sensory neurons mediate increased motor activity via enhanced glutamate release. Using genetic, pharmacological, and optogenetic manipulations, we establish that CASY-1A is required to monitor the activity of these neurons. Our study illustrates a novel neuromodulatory role of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">CASY-1</ext-link>-mediated signaling in regulating the excitation-inhibition balance of the motor circuit.</p>

<body>
<p>BEHAVIORAL output of an organism depends on the combined activity of multiple neural networks in which individual circuits are either activated or inhibited by the action of neurotransmitters or modified through neuropeptides. Locomotion is a very basic yet complex behavior in most organisms. An in-depth understanding of the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> neural connectome provides an excellent model with which to understand the complex molecular and cellular mechanisms operating in locomotory circuits. Neural circuits that produce coordinated dorso-ventral sinusoidal bends allow for normal locomotion in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Locomotory behavior is synchronized at multiple levels and involves the integration of diverse sensory cues that are processed by the interneurons and ultimately cause changes at the neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Bono and Maricq 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bargmann 2012</xref>). At the <italic>C. elegans</italic> NMJ, cholinergic motor neurons stimulate muscle contraction as well as activate GABAergic motor neurons that inhibit contraction of the contralateral muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">White <italic>et al.</italic> 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfonso <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McIntire <italic>et al.</italic> 1993a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duerr <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). Despite an extensive understanding of the development and functioning of the ventral cord motor neurons, the mechanisms controlling motor coordination are still elusive. In mammals, disruption in this motor activity synchronization results in an excitation-inhibition imbalance that has been implicated in several neurological disorders like autism and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fetissov <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lerner <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> NMJ provides an excellent model to understand the genetic factors that coordinates this balance, thus providing deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of these disorders.</p>

<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">CASY-1</ext-link> is an ortholog of mammalian calsyntenin genes. Calsyntenins are Cadherin superfamily type-I transmembrane proteins characterized by the presence of two cadherin-like tandem repeats, an LG/LNS domain in the extracellular region, and an intracellular region that carries two kinesin light-chain binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hintsch <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2004</xref>). All these regions are conserved in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> calsyntenin ortholog, <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic>. Mammals have three calsyntenin genes (<italic>clstn1</italic>, <italic>clstn2</italic>, and <italic>clstn3</italic>) that are highly enriched in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hintsch <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). Similarly, <italic>C. elegans</italic>
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">CASY-1</ext-link> expression is also observed in most head neurons and some other tissues like intestine and gonadal sheath cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikeda <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoerndli <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Polymorphisms of the human <italic>clstn2</italic> allele have been associated with increased episodic memory performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Preuschhof <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>). <italic>C. elegans <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> has also been reported to be required for memory formation, thus suggesting conservation of functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikeda <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoerndli <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Mammalian <italic>clstn3</italic> regulates excitatory and inhibitory synapse development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pettem <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Um <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>), while <italic>clstn1</italic> acts as a kinesin-1 adaptor that regulates trafficking and processing of amyloid precursor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Konecna <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araki <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steuble <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vagnoni <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). Calsyntenins are also considered biomarkers for several age-related neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vagnoni <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uchida <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Alterations in calsyntenin expression and function in neurological disorders make them potential candidates that can be explored further at the molecular and physiological levels for their potential roles in the pathogenesis of diseases.</p>
<p>In this study, we are proposing a novel neuromodulatory role of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">CASY-1</ext-link>-dependent signaling in the regulation of motor circuit dynamics and locomotion. We show that the CASY-1A isoform functions in the sensory neurons to inhibit the activity of command interneurons, thus negatively regulating motor circuit activity and locomotion. The CASY-1A isoform does this by controlling the release of glutamate from glutamatergic sensory neurons. Together, our results support a crucial role of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">CASY-1</ext-link> in regulating locomotion dynamics by modulating the activity of the sensorimotor circuit.</p>

<title>Aldicarb assay</title>
<p>The Aldicarb assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mahoney <italic>et al.</italic> 2006b</xref>). NGM plates containing Aldicarb at a final concentration of 1 mM were used in this assay. For each assay, ∼20 young adult hermaphrodites were transferred onto Aldicarb plates and scored for paralysis every 15 min for &gt;2.5 hr. Animals were considered paralyzed when they failed to show any body bends following prodding three times on the head.</p>
<p>For optogenetics-based Aldicarb assay, animals were exposed to a 1-min pulse of low-intensity blue light before, and after every 30 min during the Aldicarb assay. For this assay, Aldicarb plates were seeded with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=OP50;class=Strain">OP50</ext-link> containing 0.8 mM all-trans retinal (ATR).</p>
<p>For histamine-induced silencing of command interneurons, NGM-HA plates were prepared. For this, 1 M histamine-dihydrochloride stock in water was added to NGM agar at ∼65° immediately before pouring plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pokala <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Histamine-free control plates were poured from the same NGM batch. Histamine-containing plates were used for Aldicarb within 2 days after pouring.</p>
<p>All assays were performed with the experimenter blind to the genotypes. Each assay was performed at least three times or more as indicated at the base of each bar with &gt;20 animals for each replicate. A graph was plotted with the average percentage of <italic>C. elegans</italic> that had paralyzed at 105 min.</p>
<p>The rate of Aldicarb-induced paralysis was found to vary in few of the experiments, although the Aldicarb concentration used in all the experiments was same. This variation could likely be due to different batches of Aldicarb used for these sets of experiments. However, the overall outcome of the result drawn from these assays was consistent for all the strains used in these assays.</p>

<italic>E. coli</italic>. These plates were seeded 12 hr before the start of the assay and the bacteria were allowed to grow at 20°. The animals were allowed to equilibrate for 1 min after transfer to the assay plate. For all analysis, a 3-min video was made using a Zeiss Lumar V12 fluorescence Stereomicroscope. This video was then segmented into shorter videos of 20 sec using custom code written in MATLAB (MATLAB Release 2012b; The MathWorks, Natick, MA). The 20-sec-long video was then scored by eye for body bends. A body bend was defined as a change in the direction of propagation of the part of the animal corresponding to the posterior bulb of the pharynx along the <italic>y</italic>-axis, assuming the <italic>C. elegans</italic> was traveling along the <italic>x</italic>-axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsalik and Hobert 2003</xref>).</p>

For iGluSnFR analysis, animals were imaged in the head region of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> for the AVA neuron cell body and axonal processes. For cell body measurements, images oriented sideways were included in the quantification analysis. For axonal fluorescence, worms positioned in dorsal up orientation were analyzed. For analysis of GABA motor neurons iGluSnFR, animals were imaged for the dorsal nerve cord in the posterior portion of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> halfway between the vulva and the tail. Quantitative imaging of GLR-1::GFP and NMR-1::GFP was performed using a Zeiss AxioImager microscope with a 63× 1.4 NA Plan APOCHROMAT objective equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam MRm CCD camera controlled by Axiovision software (Zeiss Micro-imaging). Animals were imaged for the ventral nerve cord in the posterior portion of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> halfway between the vulva and the tail. For fluorescent analysis, image stacks 10 µm optical slice (20 slices at 0.5 μm distance) were taken and maximum intensity projections were obtained using Image J software.

<title>Mutants in <italic>casy-1</italic> have elevated Aldicarb sensitivity and locomotion rates</title>
<p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> NMJ provides an excellent model with which to understand various aspects of synapse development and function. An intricate balance between the excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory GABAergic signaling maintains normal sinusoidal locomotion in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and any imbalance in this signaling results in altered behavior (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richmond 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seifert <italic>et al.</italic> 2006)</xref>.</p>
<p>Previously, an Aldicarb-based RNAi screen was performed to identify the role of cell adhesion molecules in NMJ functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babu <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; and K. Babu and J. M. Kaplan, unpublished data). Aldicarb is a pharmacological inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholine esterase that prevents the breakdown of excitatory neurotransmitter acetylcholine at the NMJ. WT <italic>C. elegans</italic> show a time-course-induced paralysis upon exposure to Aldicarb. It has been shown that mutations that increase synaptic transmission result in Aldicarb hypersensitivity, while mutations that decrease synaptic transmission result in Aldicarb resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sieburth <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mahoney <italic>et al.</italic> 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vashlishan <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>).

To validate the results of the RNAi screening, the <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> mutant allele, <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00249748;class=Variation">tm718</ext-link></italic> was tested in the Aldicarb assay. <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBVar00249748;class=Variation">tm718</ext-link>)</italic> showed significant hypersensitivity to Aldicarb, suggesting neuromuscular signaling defects in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, CASY-1A expression is not seen in cholinergic or GABAergic ventral cord motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thapliyal <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>). However, it is strongly expressed in several sensory neurons and interneurons located in the anterior region of the animal (Figure S1 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.118.300834/-/DC1/FileS1.pdf">File S1</ext-link> and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikeda <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). Previous studies also support the absence of CASY-1A expression in ventral cord motor neurons. For instance, expression of CASY-1A in head neurons and not in cholinergic or GABAergic motor neurons has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoerndli <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Some expression was seen in the ventral nerve cord, but that expression belongs to the axonal processes from the head neurons that traverse along the entire length of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> body. Moreover, the first study characterizing the <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> gene in <italic>C. elegans</italic> also reported a similar expression pattern for <italic>casy-1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikeda <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). Thus, based on two previously reported expression studies and our own results, we concluded that the CASY-1A isoform is unlikely to express in motor neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Recent publications have nicely highlighted how genes expressed in higher levels of locomotory circuits, <italic>i.e.</italic>, in sensory and interneurons, could affect synaptic signaling at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fry <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Based on these previous publications, we hypothesized that the increased sensitivity to Aldicarb and the elevated locomotory rates in <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> mutants could be due to increased signaling from the sensory neurons and/or interneurons. We were specifically interested in understanding the role of CASY-1A in sensory neurons, since previous reports have shown that learning deficits in <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> mutants can be completely rescued by expressing CASY-1A in a single sensory neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikeda <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). Further, a salt-sensing neuron ASER has been reported to show increased synaptic transmission in <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohno <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). To test whether CASY-1A could function at the level of sensory neurons to regulate motor circuit activity, a transgenic line expressing CASY-1A in several sensory neurons using the <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00003851;class=Gene">odr-4</ext-link></italic> promoter was obtained. Expressing CASY-1A in sensory neurons completely rescued the Aldicarb phenotype of <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> mutants, in fact the animals became resistant to Aldicarb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). CASY-1A expression in sensory neurons also rescued the increased locomotory rate of <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results demonstrate that the CASY-1A isoform can regulate motor circuit activity from the sensory neurons. It also indicates that CASY-1A functions in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system to inhibit the motor circuit activity.</p>
<p>The <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> gene locus in <italic>C. elegans</italic> encodes three isoforms; CASY-1A is a 984 residue full-length protein containing all the conserved domains of mammalian calsyntenins while CASY-1B and CASY-1C are truncated proteins encoding 167 and 160 residues, respectively, and lack most of the N-terminus of the calsyntenin gene (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To validate the exclusive role of CASY-1A isoform in regulating excitatory cholinergic transmission from sensory neurons and hence modulating the motor activity, transgenic lines expressing the shorter isoforms of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">CASY-1</ext-link>, CASY-1B, and CASY-1C in sensory neurons using the <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00003851;class=Gene">odr-4</ext-link></italic> promoter were generated.

<title>CASY-1A affects glutamatergic signaling</title>
<p>CASY-1A expression in sensory neurons using the <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00003851;class=Gene">odr-4</ext-link></italic> promoter rescued the Aldicarb hypersensitivity and increased locomotion rates of <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> mutants. The <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00003851;class=Gene">odr-4</ext-link></italic> promoter drives gene expression in 12 pairs of sensory neurons (ADF, ADL, ASG, ASH, ASI, ASJ, ASK, AWA, ASB, AWC, PHA, and PHB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dwyer <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>). The neurotransmitter identity of these 12 neurons was next determined from previously published reports, and it appeared that ∼75% of these neurons are glutamatergic and release glutamate as the neurotransmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gendrel <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). However, some sensory neurons also release acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter; hence, we cannot rule out a potential role for acetylcholine in the <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> mutant phenotype. Nonetheless, this analysis raised the possibility that increased synaptic signaling and increased locomotion rates in <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> mutants could be due to increased glutamatergic signaling at the sensory level. To test this hypothesis, several experiments were performed.</p>
<p>To determine if increased glutamate signaling from sensory neurons mediates enhanced cholinergic transmission at the NMJ of <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> mutants, <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00001135;class=Gene">eat-4</ext-link></italic>/<italic>vGLUT</italic> (vesicular glutamate transporter) mutants, in which glutamatergic signaling is disrupted, were examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>). The Aldicarb hypersensitivity in <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> mutants was suppressed significantly by inactivating <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00001135;class=Gene">eat-4</ext-link>/vGLUT</italic>, indicating that the increased glutamate signaling facilitates sensory-evoked increase in motor circuit activity in <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To address the reason for increased glutamatergic signaling, the Aldicarb sensitivity of <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> mutants was analyzed by introducing mutations that inactivate ion channels required for sensory transduction; <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00003839;class=Gene">ocr-2</ext-link>/trpv</italic> (transient receptor potential channel), <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006526;class=Gene">tax-4</ext-link>/cng</italic> (a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel), and <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00003168;class=Gene">mec-4</ext-link>/degenerin</italic> (amiloride-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> channel protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Driscoll and Chalfie 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Komatsu <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tobin <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>).

Briefly, in this approach, one promoter drives the expression of floxed ChR2* and the GFP construct (using a pan-neuronal <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00004267;class=Gene">rab-3</ext-link></italic> promoter) and a second neuron-specific promoter drives the expression of Cre (the recombinase). Thus, by promoter overlap, the expression of ChR2* will occur specifically in the neuron of interest (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00003851;class=Gene">odr-4</ext-link></italic> promoter driving expression in sensory neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flavell <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fry <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). This slow inactivating variant of ChR2* allowed us to monitor progressive paralysis in Aldicarb assays with intermittent blue light exposure (1-min pulse of blue light after every 30 min). Interestingly, in WT animals, photoactivation of sensory neurons results in Aldicarb hypersensitivity—a phenotype very similar to <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> mutants.

<p>CASY-1A is required for the activity of sensory neurons, which promotes motor circuit activity. (A) Activation of sensory neurons using ChR2* (C128S) induces Aldicarb hypersensitivity in WT animals just like <italic>casy-1</italic> mutants. (B) Blocking vesicle release using sensory neuron-specific tetanus toxin (TeTx) induces Aldicarb resistance in WT animals. Blocking synaptic release from sensory neurons using TeTx, in the <italic>casy-1</italic> mutant background, causes the Aldicarb hypersensitivity of the <italic>casy-1</italic> mutants to reach WT levels.

<p>Next, we silenced the command interneuron signaling using histamine-gated chloride channels, expressed specifically in command interneurons using the <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00003774;class=Gene">nmr-1</ext-link></italic> promoter.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Locomotion is one of the most studied behavioral outputs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and is mediated by a neuronal circuit that generates coordinated sinusoidal movement. The locomotor circuit in <italic>C. elegans</italic> works through a “cross-inhibition model” where the excitatory cholinergic motor neurons form dyadic synapses onto both the ipsilateral muscle as well as onto the inhibitory GABAergic motor neurons that then synapse onto the contralateral muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">White <italic>et al.</italic> 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">1986</xref>). An important principle that maintains locomotion is a coordinated balance between the excitation (E) and inhibition (I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Isaacson and Scanziani 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stawicki <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Despite reports on the involvement of E/I imbalance in the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders, genetic factors that control and modulate this balance have not all been identified. Previously, <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000042;class=Gene">acr-2</ext-link>(gf)</italic> has been reported to alter this E/I balance resulting in spontaneous convulsions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stawicki <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). More recently, the neuronal calcium sensor protein <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00003564;class=Gene">NCS-2</ext-link> has been reported to regulate asynchronous release mediated E/I imbalance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). And the phosphorylation status of an endoplasmic-reticulum resident chaperone, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00004363;class=Gene">RIC-3</ext-link> has been shown to dictate the E/I balance at the muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Safdie <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Our studies have identified <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">CASY-1</ext-link> as a regulator of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, thus emerging as a novel controller of E/I balance.</p>
<p>We have recently shown that <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">CASY-1</ext-link> is required for regulating GABA release, and, hence, maintaining normal GABAergic neurotransmission at the <italic>C. elegans</italic> NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thapliyal <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>). In this study, we report a possible mechanism for CASY-1A-mediated regulation of excitatory cholinergic transmission. Mutants in <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> show enhanced locomotion on food, suggesting heightened motor circuit activity. Our results demonstrate that CASY-1A functions in multiple classes of sensory neurons to decrease the motor circuit activity. In this study, we propose one such mechanism that might explain the role of CASY-1A in this function. Mutants in <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> have heightened sensory responsiveness, resulting in increased glutamate release, which in turn affects interneurons signaling and finally results in enhanced motor circuit activity.</p>
<p>In WT <italic>C. elegans</italic>, CASY-1A is expressed in sensory neurons to inhibit the motor circuit activity. In sensory neurons, it functions partly by regulating the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Loss of <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> results in enhanced glutamate release that could exaggerate the motor circuit activity through increased signaling from the command interneurons. Increased signaling from the command interneurons can in turn result in increased acetylcholine release at the NMJ, thus increasing the excitatory signals, leading to enhanced motor circuit activity and Aldicarb hypersensitivity (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Our study proposes a model in which increased glutamatergic signaling from sensory neurons results in increased motor circuit activity, and, hence, Aldicarb hypersensitivity, in <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> mutants.

Further, mutants for various ion channels required for sensory transduction in glutamatergic neurons like <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006526;class=Gene">tax-4</ext-link></italic> and <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00003168;class=Gene">mec-4</ext-link></italic> are also expected to show decreased glutamatergic signaling. Previous reports have also presented data suggesting the hypersensitivity phenotype for <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00001135;class=Gene">eat-4</ext-link></italic> and <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00006526;class=Gene">tax-4</ext-link></italic> mutants on the Aldicarb assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2015</xref>). Further, mutations activating glutamatergic signaling have also been reported to show hypersensitivity in the Aldicarb assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fry <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). These studies report conflicting results for effect of glutamatergic activation on Aldicarb sensitivity. Future investigations uncovering the specific mechanisms for glutamatergic signaling regulated motor circuit activity might provide better insights into the role of mutants that show altered glutamatergic signaling.</p>
<p>Although this study focused mainly on the role of increased glutamatergic transmission from sensory neurons, <italic>C. elegans</italic> sensory neurons are also peptidergic and release neuropeptides along with classical neurotransmitters, and, hence, can act as diverse modulators of neural circuit function. Enhanced sensory activity in <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> mutants might also play a role at the level of neuropeptide release from these neurons, thus adding another level of complexity to the regulation of motor circuit activity. Mammalian calsyntenins have not been addressed to interact with components of neuropeptidergic signaling. It will be interesting to investigate the functional role of <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> in regulating neuropeptide-mediated behaviors.</p>
<p>Despite presenting a convincing mechanism for sensory-evoked enhancement for cholinergic transmission at NMJ, several questions in this study remains unanswered. For example, how exactly is CASY-1A involved in modulating the activity of sensory neurons? Our isoform-specific rescue experiments suggest that the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">CASY-1</ext-link> C-terminal is dispensable for this function. The extracellular N-terminal region of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">CASY-1</ext-link> harbors some conserved domains, such as cadherin and LG/LNS domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikeda <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). Previously, the LG/LNS domain has been shown to be absolutely required for rescuing the learning deficits in <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/db/get?name=WBGene00000403;class=Gene">casy-1</ext-link></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikeda <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). It will be interesting to identify the role of the LG/LNS domain in regulating synaptic signaling at the NMJ. Also, identifying the interacting partners for <italic>casy-1a</italic> isoform could provide better mechanistic insights into this function. Another missing component of the study is how increased activity of sensory neurons could relate to enhanced acetylcholine release at the NMJ. Enhanced sensory activity could trigger several downstream signaling cascades that can function at multiple levels of the locomotion circuit. This study illustrates the role of glutamatergic signaling in sensory neurons conveying information to the motor circuit. However, some recent reports have described that several sensory neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> also utilize acetylcholine as a signaling neurotransmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pereira <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>), thus increasing the complexity of this investigation. Future studies concentrating on identifying the interacting partners of CASY-1A and understanding the role of other neurotransmitters might explain some of the results obtained in this study.</p>
<p>Mammalian calsyntenins have been reported to be required for the development and functioning of both excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pettem <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Our study provides some useful insights into possible roles for mammalian calsyntenins at glutamatergic synapses. Substantial conservation of behavioral and genetic mechanisms between mammalian calsyntenins and <italic>C. elegans</italic> CASY-1A strengthens the likely existence of similar mechanisms in other systems.</p>
