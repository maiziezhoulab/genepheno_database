<article-title>The Host Shapes the Gut Microbiota via Fecal
microRNA.</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>Since their discovery in the early 90s, microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding
RNAs, have mainly been associated with posttranscriptional regulation of gene
expression on a cell-autonomous level. Recent evidence has extended this role by
adding inter-species communication to the manifold functional range. In our
latest study [Liu S, <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016, Cell Host &amp; Microbe], we
identified miRNAs in gut lumen and feces of both mice and humans. We found that
intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and Hopx+ cells were the two main sources of
fecal miRNA. Deficiency of IEC-miRNA resulted in gut dysbiosis and WT fecal
miRNA transplantation restored the gut microbiota. We investigated potential
mechanisms for this effect and found that miRNAs were able to regulate the gut
microbiome. By culturing bacteria with miRNAs, we found that host miRNAs were
able to enter bacteria, specifically regulate bacterial gene transcripts and
affect bacterial growth. Oral administration of synthetic miRNA mimics affected
specific bacteria in the gut. Our findings describe a previously unknown pathway
by which the gut microbiome is regulated by the host and raises the possibility
that miRNAs may be used therapeutically to manipulate the microbiome for the
treatment of disease.</p>

<title>Normal gut microbiota is essential for health</title>
<p>It is known that the mammal gut harbors trillions of commensal microbes, which are
host specific and are important for health. Disturbances of the microbiome have been
reported to have consequences for immune development, metabolism, and a variety of
diseases states including autoimmune diseases, autism and cancer. Thus, it is
important to understand how the microbiome is regulated and to identify strategies
to manipulate it.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Fecal miRNAs</title>
<p>Studies have shown that miRNAs can exist extracellularly in the body and might be
indicative of specific diseases. Hence, our primary research focus are extracellular
miRNAs in the circulation as biomarkers of multiple sclerosis. We then asked whether
extracellular miRNAs were present in the feces as well, and found that miRNAs were
part of the normal composition of feces both in mice and humans. We compared the
relative abundance of miRNAs in the upper level and lower level of the gut, in
germ-free mice and in antibiotic treated mice. Intriguingly, we found that the
abundance of miRNA was inversely correlated with the abundance of microbes. This
suggested that microbes might take up miRNAs and that these miRNAs might in turn
affect microbes.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>miRNA affects bacterial gene expression and bacterial growth</title>
<p>We cultured bacteria with fluorescence labeled miRNA mimics and observed that the
miRNAs entered bacteria. Specifically, they co-localized with bacterial nucleic
acids, which provide the temporal and spatial basis for bacterial gene expression
regulation. We then aligned the bacterial gene sequences to the miRNA database.
Unexpectedly, we found that all bacterial gene sequences we queried were found to
pair with different miRNAs, and these miRNAs were derived from host species
including <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and mammals
(mice and humans). To ask whether miRNAs altered bacterial gene expression, we
synthesized miRNA mimics and added them to the culture of bacteria such as
<italic>F. nucleatum</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>. We found that the
transcripts of the bacterial genes were specifically altered upon miRNA treatment
and that bacterial growth was affected by miRNA treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>miRNA shapes gut microbiota</title>
<p>We then asked whether this novel mechanism of regulation could shape the composition
of gut microbiome in the host. To address this, we first identified the primary
sources of fecal miRNAs to be intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and Hopx-expressing
cells by generating mice, with a cell-type-specific deficiency in the miRNA
processing enzyme, Dicer. Data from 16S rDNA sequencing suggested that IEC-specific
miRNA knockout (<italic>Dicer1</italic><sup>∆</sup><italic><sup>IEC</sup></italic>)
caused dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. This was accompanied by the worsening of
colitis in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) model. When we isolated the fecal miRNA
from wild-type mice and transferred them to
<italic>Dicer1</italic><sup>∆</sup><italic><sup>IEC</sup></italic> recipient
mice by gavage, the gut microbiota in the recipient mice was restored to the
wild-type phenotype and the colitis was ameliorated. Finally, we synthesized the
miRNA mimic for miR-1226 and found that it affected growth of
<italic>E.coli</italic>
<italic>in vitro</italic> and when given orally to mice also affected <italic>E.coli
in vivo.</italic></p>

<title>Conclusions and discussion</title>
<p>The gut microbiome plays an important role in health and disease. Commensals reside
in an external environment (i.e., the intestinal lumen), and they interact with the
environment and host through mechanisms that are fundamentally different from
systemic compartments. The host-microbe interaction is a two-way interaction (Figure
1) conditioned by diet, bowel peristalsis and digestive enzymes. Studies to date
have focused on how microbes affect the host through factors such as microbial
components, metabolites such as LPS, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and
polysaccharide A (PSA) (Figure 1, A). The effect of the host on microbes includes
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as RegIII-γ, defensin. These mechanisms are
largely non-specific (Figure 1, B). Secreted IgA is involved in maintaining the
microbiota, but its importance is not clear since IgA immunodeficiency had little
effect on the composition of the gut flora. Here, we have identified host miRNAs
that are able to specifically modulate the gut microbiome (Figure 1, C). Our
findings identify a novel mechanism by which one could specifically manipulate the
gut microbiome for the treatment of disease.</p>
