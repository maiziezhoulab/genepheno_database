<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par1">Since 2010, array-CGH (aCGH) has been the first-tier test in the diagnostic approach of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) or multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) of unknown origin. Its broad application led to the detection of numerous variants of uncertain clinical significance (VOUS). How to appropriately interpret aCGH results represents a challenge for the clinician.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Method</title>
<p id="Par2">We present a retrospective study on 293 patients with age range 1 month - 29 years (median 7 years) with NDD and/or MCA and/or dysmorphisms, investigated through aCGH between 2005 and 2016. The aim of the study was to analyze clinical and molecular cytogenetic data in order to identify what elements could be useful to interpret unknown or poorly described aberrations. Comparison of phenotype and cytogenetic characteristics through univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression was performed.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p id="Par3">Copy number variations (CNVs) with a frequency &lt; 1% were detected in 225 patients of the total sample, while 68 patients presented only variants with higher frequency (heterozygous deletions or amplification) and were considered to have negative aCGH. Proved pathogenic CNVs were detected in 70 patients (20.6%). Delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), prematurity, congenital heart disease, cerebral malformations and dysmorphisms correlated to reported pathogenic CNVs. Prematurity, ventricular septal defect and dysmorphisms remained significant predictors of pathogenic CNVs in the multivariate logistic model whereas abnormal EEG and limb dysmorphisms were mainly detected in the group with likely pathogenic VOUS.</p>
<p id="Par4">A flow-chart regarding the care for patients with NDD and/or MCA and/or dysmorphisms and the interpretation of aCGH has been made on the basis of the data inferred from this study and literature.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p id="Par5">Our work contributes to make the investigative process of CNVs more informative and suggests possible directions in aCGH interpretation and phenotype correlation.</p>

<sec id="Sec1">
<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par13">In the last 10–15 years, the advent of high-resolution microarray technologies has revealed that cryptic chromosomal deletions and duplications, commonly defined as copy number variations (CNVs), are at the origin of a wide variety of clinical manifestations, including neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) and dysmorphic features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par14">Over time, array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) has increased our knowledge about microdeletions and microduplications and a large number of novel syndromes have been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], through a “reverse dysmorphology” method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par15">Since 2010, aCGH has been the first-tier test in the diagnostic approach of children with unexplained developmental disorders or congenital anomalies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], with a diagnostic yield of about 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par16">The advances in molecular methodology and the broader application of aCGH led to the detection of novel pathogenic CNVs but also of numerous variants of uncertain clinical significance (VOUS).</p>
<p id="Par17">How to appropriately interpret results of aCGH represents a challenge for the clinician especially when information found in genetic databases or scientific literature is not enough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The clinical significance of CNVs has important implications on patient management and on family counseling, even in terms of reproductive health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par18">In recent years there have been several attempts to detect clinical features as predictive factors of pathogenic CNVs in patients with intellectual disability and/or multiple congenital anomalies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par19">The aim of the study was to analyze clinical and molecular cytogenetic data of a sample of 339 patients with NDD/MCA in order to identify whether and which of these elements could be useful to interpret unknown or poorly described rearrangements. We also set out to establish whether some core features (NDD, dysmorphisms, MCA, epilepsy) are more probably linked to pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants when isolated and in what possible combination.</p>
<p id="Par20">Finally, we delineated a diagnostic flow-chart based on our results that could help the clinician in aCGH interpretation and the management of patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec2">
<title>Methods</title>
<p id="Par21">We present a retrospective study on 339 patients evaluated at the Clinical Genetics Unit of Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova, AUSL-IRCCS of Reggio Emilia. Inclusion criteria were the presence of unexplained NDD and/or MCA and/or dysmorphisms. For all patients we collected individual informed consent for the present study.</p>
<p id="Par22">Patients were investigated through aCGH between 2005 and 2016, after signing the appropriate informed consent to genetic testing. Since 2012 aCGH have been systematically performed by 8x60K oligochips with a resolution of 100 Kb, whereas before 2012 the analysis was carried out by using different platforms and resolutions [Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Table S1].</p>
<p id="Par23">All data about family/clinical history and physical/dysmorphological evaluation of patients were retrospectively extracted from clinical reports. The clinical features included: family history, pre-perinatal history, neuropsychiatric evaluation, auxological parameters, minor dysmorphisms, organ malformations, neurological assessment, sensory deficits and/or anomalies of sensory organs, skeletal anomalies, joint anomalies, skin anomalies, hematologic or endocrinological diseases.</p>
<p id="Par24">Regarding CNVs, we considered the nature of the rearrangement (deletion/duplication), the presence of multiple rearrangements, the gene content (total number of genes, disease genes, protein-encoding genes) and the presence of interrupted genes.</p>
<p id="Par25">The clinical significance of CNVs was obtained from an accurate review of clinical reports, literature and genetic databases: UCSC Genome Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">http://genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>/) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], DECIPHER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], OMIM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.omim.org/">http://www.omim.org/</ext-link>), NCBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed</ext-link>/), 3D Genome browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. CNVs were grouped into pathogenic and variants of uncertain significance (VOUS). The latter were further divided into likely pathogenic and likely benign.</p>
<sec id="Sec3">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p id="Par26">Descriptive statistics were used to present the data. Distribution of continuous data was assessed by Kolomogorov-Smirnov test. Categorical data, such as phenotype characteristics or somatic problems, were presented as frequencies (%) of total number of patients tested, while continuous data (number of genes and CNV size) were presented as median with interquartile range (IQR). Comparison of phenotype characteristics between two groups with negative aCGH or CNVs and between three groups of clinical significance (pathogenic, likely pathogenic and likely benign CNVs) was done using Pearson’s chi-square test or Fisher exact test. Continuous data were compared between two groups using Mann-Whitney U test and among three groups using Kruskal-Wallis test. Post-hoc analysis was applied with Bonferroni correction for all multiple comparisons. Spearman’s correlation analysis was applied to assess association of chromosome size and the number of CNVs per chromosomes. Separate logistic regression analyses were done to assess independent predictors of positive microarray and pathogenic CNVs, respectively. Variables that showed difference at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.1 level in univariate analysis were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model and backward stepwise selection of variables was performed. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was performed to assess overall model fit. Measures of discrimination (Nagelkerke r<sup>2</sup> and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, ROC area) were calculated for all regression models.</p>
<p id="Par27">All statistical tests were two-sided and were performed at a 5% significance level. SPSS software (version 20.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the statistical analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="Sec5">
<title>Clinical data</title>
<p id="Par28">Of the total sample of 339 patients enrolled, 240 (70.8%) presented a genomic rearrangement (CNV), while 99 (29.2%) received a negative aCGH result. Within these two groups, some patients (15 and 31 respectively) subsequently received a different molecular or clinical diagnosis. Therefore, the final sample consisted of 293 patients (225 patients with CNVs and 68 control patients with negative aCGH) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Description of the total sample enrolled investigated through aCGH until 07–31-2016. Red rectangle includes the patient group (293/339) on which the statistical analysis was performed</p></caption><graphic id="MO1" xlink:href="13052_2018_467_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par29">The sample presented 169 males (57.5%) and 124 females (42.3%) with an average age at the time of the test of 7 years (range 1 month - 29 years). The majority of patients executed aCGH in the first years of life (38.5%) or at primary school age (27.6%).</p>
<p id="Par30">Neurodevelopmental disorders (such as psychomotor developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder) were observed as the main indication to perform aCGH. Psychomotor developmental delay, in particular with impairment of language (78.5%), and intellectual disability (66.4%) were the most frequently observed. 28.3% of requests concerned isolate NDD, while NDD in combination with other features (dysmorphisms, congenital malformations, epilepsy) reached 83.9%.</p>
<p id="Par31">As regards to the severity of intellectual disability, 31.1% of the patients had mild ID, 5% of subjects with severe intellectual disability had developmental delay and language impairment, 14% of subjects presented with autism spectrum disorder.</p>
<p id="Par32">Congenital heart anomalies (atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus), ocular diseases, CNS malformations (corpus callosum, hippocampus or white matter anomalies), EEGraphic abnormalities, face and hands dysmorphisms were the most reported features [Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Table S2].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec6">

<p id="Par33">Among the 225 patients with CNVs, 70 (31.1%) showed pathogenic CNVs and 155 (68.8%) carried VOUS (105 likely benign and 50 likely pathogenic).

<p id="Par47">A flow-chart (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>) regarding the care for patients with NDD and/or MCA and/or dysmorphisms has been made on the basis of the data inferred from this study and their comparison with the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our purpose is to make the investigative process of CNVs more informative and to suggest possible guide elements in aCGH interpretation. It is of primary importance because patient follow-up and reproductive counseling to families could change considerably depending on the meaning of aCGH results.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Flow-chart in patients with NDD and/or MCA and/or Dysmorphisms. The first step is the collection of appropriate family and clinical history and physical/dysmorphological evaluation. If the patient has a recognizable syndrome, we have to confirm it with specific genetic tests. Otherwise, except for other possible neurological or metabolic implications, we will proceed by considering aCGH (in case of male subjects with ID, it would be appropriate to consider the molecular survey for Fragile X syndrome). The blood draw should always be done on the trio in order to perform aCGH on parent’s sample if anomalous in the child. If aCGH detects CNVs, they will be carefully interpreted. Some CNVs can be classified as pathogenic because linked to known syndromes or to “new microdeletion/microduplication syndromes”. If CNVs are less known or poorly described they have an uncertain clinical significance (VOUS): we suggest some variables that might be useful in distinguishing likely pathogenic from likely benign CNVs (continuous box). Additionally, the presence of some phenotypic variables, as well as the analysis of non-coding regions, could be useful in classifying VOUS as likely pathogenic (dashed box) [* Phenotypic variables significant for pathogenic CNVs: developmental delay, ID, prematurity, IUGR, dysmorphisms, congenital heart disease, hypotonia, cerebral malformations; Phenotypic variables significant for likely pathogenic CNVs: abnormal EEG, hand and lower limb dysmorphisms; Independent predictive factors for pathogenic CNVs: prematurity, ventricular septal defect, dysmorphisms]. In the case of normal chromosomal pattern or likely benign CNVs, it will be necessary to re-evaluate the patient. If the clinical features are strongly suggestive of a genetic/syndromic condition further genetic investigations will be carried out. These may include targeted sequencing, exome sequencing and, in selected cases, genome sequencing. Otherwise clinical follow up should be implemented in the event that evocative elements could emerge over time recommending future genetic investigations</p></caption><graphic id="MO5" xlink:href="13052_2018_467_Fig5_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>

<p id="Par49">In the literature, the detection rate of pathogenic CNVs in these patients ranges from 5 to 20% (on average 15%), depending on the preselection of patients and on the technical characteristics of the instrument used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par50">In our study of 339 patients with NDD and/or MCA tested by aCGH, the detection rate of pathogenic CNVs was 20.6% (70/339). This result could be representative of an appropriate selection of the patients who underwent this genetic test in our clinical unit.</p>
<p id="Par51">In our sample, 55.6% (163/293) of patients presented with NDD associated with MCA and/or dysmorphisms and/or epilepsy, while 28.3% (83/293) had an isolated NDD. The residual percentage of patients had malformative, dysmorphic or neurological characteristics, isolated or in combination with each other [Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">7</xref>: Table S7]. The detection of pathogenic CNVs in case of isolated NDD was extremely low (2/293, 0.68%), while it reached 19.1% (56/293) in cases of NDD associated with other clinical elements. In particular, we found pathogenic CNVs in 8.5% (25/293) of subjects with NDD and dysmorphisms (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab4">4</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par52">In recent years, wide use of aCGH in patients with NDD and/or MCA has led to the detection of an impressive number of VOUS.</p>
<p id="Par53">The interpretation of aCGH results became a crucial topic in clinical practice, in diagnostic, prognostic and ethical terms. Thus, recently, several studies focused on identifying specific clinical or phenotype variables that could be associated with the detection of pathogenic CNVs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab5">5</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Partial review of literature on detection of phenotypic factors related to pathogenic CNVs in patients with NDD and/or MCA</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>References</th><th>N° pt</th><th>Main Phenotype</th><th>Technique</th><th>Detection rate pathogenic CNVs</th><th>Clinical variables associated to pathogenic CNVs</th><th>Independent predictors of pathogenic CNVs</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Caballero Pérez et al.

<p id="Par54">In our study, the univariate analysis detected a statistically significant association of pathogenic CNVs (vs likely pathogenic CNVs and likely benign CNVs) with different variables summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>, only partially described in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par55">Moreover, prematurity, dysmorphisms and interventricular septal defect resulted as independent predictors of pathogenic CNVs.</p>
<p id="Par56">Prematurity has not been previously reported. Premature subjects, who survive the neonatal period, are characterized by a high risk of developing NDD. In light of this data, it could be interesting to consider prematurity as a phenotypic feature within the syndromic frame caused by pathogenic CNVs.</p>
<p id="Par57">VSD, as well as congenital heart anomalies in general, have already been described as linked to pathogenic CNVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In our study, VSD assumed an independent predictive value for pathogenic CNVs. This data appears to be supported by recent literature, which reports significant CNVs in 16.9% of patients with VSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par58">Finally, dysmorphisms play an important predictive role for pathogenic CNVs and present a statistically significant association with pathogenic CNVs when considered in association with NDD.</p>
<p id="Par59">Regarding molecular cytogenetic characteristics, we found that pathogenicity is significantly correlated with the larger size of aberrations, the greater number of total/protein-coding/disease genes located within, the de novo mode of inheritance and the deletion type of variants. These elements have already been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We also detected abnormal EEG, hand dysmorphisms and lower limb dysmorphisms as more frequent variables in likely pathogenic CNVs versus likely benign CNVs plus negative aCGH. Clinically, these data may have modest impact, but comparisons between these two groups of patients had not been previously described in literature.</p>
<p id="Par60">Moreover, the presence of disrupted genes and the study of gene function compared to patient phenotype could provide important clues for the interpretation of CNVs. Likewise, the analysis of TADs appears to have a predictive value, also for the evaluation of likely benign VOUS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>) [Additional file <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">7</xref>: Table S7].</p>
<p id="Par61">We are aware that the molecular cytogenetic and phenotypic elements identified may not assume an absolute value in the interpretation of results, but they could contribute to the framework needed for the clinician in discerning between likely pathogenic and likely benign VOUS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par62">The main limit of the study is that we did not use standardized criteria in classifying patients’ CNVs (pathogenic, likely pathogenic and likely benign), because there are no specific references in the literature. The study was retrospective and patients were divided into the three categories of significance on the basis of their clinical reports. In any case, CNV interpretation has been the result of careful analysis of scientific literature, genetic database and phenotype evaluation.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="Par63">In our retrospective analysis, we observed a detection rate of pathogenic CNVs at the upper limits of what was reported in literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It could be the result of a careful selection of patients that underwent aCGH in our clinical unit.</p>
<p id="Par64">In patients with NDD, prematurity is usually considered as an environmental risk factor. In our study, the detection of prematurity as an independent predictor of pathogenic CNVs suggests that sometimes this feature can rather be considered as a main part of the underlying genetic disorder.</p>
<p id="Par65">Dysmorphisms, especially if associated with NDD, seem to have a predictive significance for pathogenic aberrations.</p>
<p id="Par66">We detected several elements related to pathogenic CNVs and some related to likely pathogenic CNVs that could be helpful in the interpretation of aCGH results, even though we acknowledge they may not assume an absolute significance in the interpretative process. This necessarily requires a combination of several factors, such as scientific literature, genetic databases, molecular cytogenetic characteristics, detailed patient anamnesis and phenotype evaluation.</p>
<p id="Par67">However, it is necessary to emphasize the importance of a meticulous description of the phenotypic features of patients with pathogenic CNVs, both to contribute to scientific sharing of data and to facilitate accurate interpretation of aCGH results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par68">The purpose of the study was to improve diagnostic accuracy, with a positive impact on patients’ clinical management, prognosis, follow-up and genetic counseling.</p>
