<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Despite considerable progress in schizophrenia genetics, most findings have been for large rare structural variants and common variants in well-imputed regions with few genes implicated from exome sequencing. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) can potentially provide a more complete enumeration of etiological genetic variation apart from the exome and regions of high linkage disequilibrium. We analyze high-coverage WGS data from 1162 Swedish schizophrenia cases and 936 ancestry-matched population controls. Our main objective is to evaluate the contribution to schizophrenia etiology from a variety of genetic variants accessible to WGS but not by previous technologies. Our results suggest that ultra-rare structural variants that affect the boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs) increase risk for schizophrenia. Alterations in TAD boundaries may lead to dysregulation of gene expression. Future mechanistic studies will be needed to determine the precise functional effects of these variants on biology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Since the first major study over 70 years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, twin, family, and adoption studies have strongly and consistently supported the existence of a genetic basis for schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Its inheritance is complex with both genetic and non-genetic contributions indicated by estimates of pedigree-heritability (60–65%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and twin-heritability (81%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> that are well under 100%. Although these genetic epidemiological results were fairly consistent, their validity was dependent on multiple assumptions and contained specific information about genetic architecture.</p>
<p id="Par4">In the past decade, genome-wide association (GWA) studies that genotyped hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in tens of thousands of cases and controls have directly evaluated the common-variant SNP-heritability of schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In the most recent study of 40,675 schizophrenia cases and 64,643 controls, the SNP-heritability of schizophrenia was 24.4% (SE 0.0091, liability scale), and 145 significant loci were identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. SNP array data can also be used to assess rare copy number variants (CNVs). In the largest study to date of 21,094 cases and 20,227 controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, eight CNVs reached genome-wide significance: CNV deletions at 1q21.1, 2p16.3 (<italic>NRXN</italic>1), 3q29, 15q13.3, and 16p11.2 (distal) and 22q11.2 plus CNV duplications at 7q11.23 and 16p11.2 (proximal). These events were uncommon and any one of these eight CNVs were present in 1.42% of cases and 0.15% of controls. There is evidence that rare coding single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertion–deletions (indels) contribute to risk in a low percentage of cases although few genes have been implicated from exome sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">Thus, after a decade of increasingly larger studies, the discovered genetic variants that confer risk for schizophrenia are primarily common variants with subtle effects on risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The interpretation of common variant findings is markedly improved via the addition of functional genomic data from brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>; nonetheless, there remains a gap between the pedigree- and twin-heritability estimates for schizophrenia and its SNP-heritability. Some argue that this gap is irrelevant as these different types of heritability are incompatible and as biological insights have always been the core goal of GWA for schizophrenia rather than accounting for twin/pedigree heritability. It is also possible that the heritability gap is informative, that SNP array and WES are missing etiologically important genetic variation. GWA genotyping directly captures 500K-1M SNPs followed by imputation to indirectly assess 7–10 M variants. This process is imprecise as some regions of the genome are not well covered, and some non-SNP types of genetic variation are missed. WES provides data on the protein-coding fraction of the genome (~3%) and will miss many regulatory features.</p>
<p id="Par6">By evaluating high-coverage WGS data on 21,620 individuals in the TOPMed study, Wainschtein et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> reported recovery of nearly all of the pedigree heritability for height and body mass index. The missing heritability was found to reside in rarer genetic variation (minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.0001–0.1) in regions of relatively low linkage disequilibrium (LD) and often outside of protein-coding portions of the genome. The fundamental reason for the missing heritability of height and body mass may merely be technical: the least expensive technologies only partly assess the genome with inexpensive SNP arrays capturing common variants in high LD regions and WES capturing much of the known protein-coding genome. The Wainschtein et al. finding is consistent with prior observations that rarer and evolutionarily younger SNPs have higher SNP-heritability for multiple complex traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par7">To capture genetic variation as comprehensively as possible, WGS is required. WGS provides nucleotide-level resolution throughout the accessible genome along with detection of most structural variants (SVs). Many types of genetic variation are discoverable by WGS without regard to local LD, and these include SNVs and indels in low LD regions, uncommon or rare regulatory variants, rare SVs missed by SNP arrays and WES due to small size or complexity, and common SVs missed by SNP arrays. The NHLBI TOPMed Program recently published high-coverage (30×) WGS data of 53,831 diverse individuals that included ~381 M SNVs and ~29 M indels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. TOPMed WGS identified 16% more variants than low-coverage WGS (6×), with essentially all new variants being rare (MAF &lt; 0.005); and 17% more coding variants than both low-coverage WGS and WES (30×). The distribution of variant sites in TOPMed WGS revealed that the vast majority of human genetic variation is rare and noncoding. There are a few published WGS studies of schizophrenia (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Of these studies, many employed family-based designs and the largest case–control WGS study had 321 schizophrenia cases and 148 controls.</p>
<p id="Par8">In this study, we analyze high-coverage WGS from 1162 schizophrenia cases and 936 ancestry-matched population controls. WGS data are generated using identical protocols at the same facility and all WGS data are jointly processed and analyzed. The schizophrenia cases also have SNP array<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and exome sequencing data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> which is compared to WGS to assess data quality. Our main objective is to evaluate the contribution to schizophrenia etiology from variants that are revealed by WGS but not by GWA and WES. To quantify phenotypic variance explained by rare variants, we estimate heritability using WGS. To identify the role of noncoding variants, we focus on empirically determined maps of sequence constraints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and functional genomic annotations generated in human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. We particularly focus on ultra-rare variants as this frequency class has a notable impact on schizophrenia risk in WES and CNV studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. We replicate key prior reported excess in schizophrenia of loss-of-function (LOF) ultra-rare sequence variants in LOF-intolerant genes. We find an increased burden in schizophrenia of ultra-rare SVs that affect the boundaries of topologically associated domains.</p>

<title>Study samples and sequencing</title>
<p id="Par10">Following quality control, we analyzed WGS on 1162 schizophrenia cases and 936 ancestry-matched population controls from Sweden (total 2098 subjects). Cases were selected to have typical Swedish ancestry, unequivocal schizophrenia case status, and without a known pathogenic CNV (e.g., 22q11 deletion). Controls were group matched to cases by ancestry. The median WGS coverage per sample was 36.62 reads per base (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). For each group, we constructed a curve for mean fraction of bases covered deeper than a specified threshold as a function of depth of coverage. The shapes of the mean curves were similar between cases and controls (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Principal components analysis confirmed the relative homogeneity of the sample (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par11">We took multiple steps to minimize chances of spurious associations with schizophrenia: (1) WGS for all subjects was performed at the same facility using identical procedures; (2) all WGS data were jointly processed; (3) variant calling was conducted jointly for all subjects; (4) all subjects were ethnic Swedes of similar empirical ancestry (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>); and (5) in association analyses, we controlled for empirically determined potential confounders to mitigate impact on spurious association signals (Methods). As discussed more fully below, we did not find evidence of inflation (e.g., for common variant case-controls tests, <italic>λ</italic><sub>GC</sub> was 1.03 and LD score regression intercept was 0.997 (SE = 0.0065), which are inconsistent with systematic biases).</p>

<title>WGS variant identification</title>
<p id="Par12">SNV/indels: We detected 33,746,530 SNVs and 4,551,507 indels across the autosomes of the 2098 cases and controls. Individual subjects had a mean of 2,358,544 SNVs (range: 2,063,297–2,513,607), and 383,929 indels (range 329,678–409,893; mean insertion size 3.09 bp and mean deletion size 3.59 bp). Of the full set of unique SNVs and indels detected in the WGS data, 45.43% of SNVs and 37.03% of indels were detected in only one individual as heterozygotes (singletons).

From theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and our calculations (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>), power is low for single-variant analysis for MAF &lt; 0.01. Collapsing methods are key approaches for rare variants and can enhance power by accumulating information across different rare variants that impact a gene/locus or a set of genes/loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. We used burden testing as the primary analytical tool to contrast cases and controls for total event counts in genomic loci of interest. Burden testing is appropriate when most variants across a set of genetic loci impact phenotype in the same direction and with similar magnitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. We estimated statistical power for burden tests and found that we had ≥80% power to detect association of URVs when the aggregated minor allele count (MAC) was 20 (i.e., aggregated MAF = 0.01) and the genotypic relative risk was ≥4.9 (assuming a type I error level of 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). As a final step in quality control and following an approach previously established in the full Swedish sample<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, we pruned samples that had an outlier total URV count mostly because of relatively higher ancestry heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> (Methods, Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>).

The total number of qualifying URVs in these samples was 8,073,782, of which 7,991,557 (98.9%) were noncoding.

<p id="Par19">Burden analysis of noncoding ultra-rare SNV/indels in constrained regions: We defined variants as putatively noncoding if they did not alter sequence content of coding regions or splice dinucleotides of GENCODE protein-coding transcripts. These noncoding variants may confer risk via a variety of mechanisms (e.g., by altering an unannotated protein-coding transcript, untranslated regions, splicing, transcription factor binding, or an epigenetic site). We evaluated burden of noncoding variants that are more likely to be deleterious by focusing on ultra-rare noncoding variants that are likely to be subject to purifying selection in a manner similar to coding URVs. We compared case/control burden of noncoding URVs across binned regions by sequence constraint for the human species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and by constraint across mammalian species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>).

We concentrated subsequent noncoding URV analyses on variants in regions that were highly constrained according to one of these two metrics (CDTS &lt; 1% or GERP ≥ 4) due to prior observation that the overlap between CDTS (conservation in the current human population) and GERP (interspecies conservation) was limited and heavily enriched for protein-coding regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par34">Heritability is the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genetic factors. Understanding the sources of missing heritability for schizophrenia – the discrepancy between pedigree-heritability of 60–65%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and common-variant SNP-heritability of 24%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> – is important for experimental designs to identify additional trait loci and possibly for subsequent precision medicine initiatives. Using WGS data for height and body mass index, Wainschtein et al. recently found WGS-heritability very close to twin/pedigree heritability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. WGS allowed them to include effects in genomic regions of low MAF and low LD, precisely the regions that are poorly captured by typical SNP arrays or imputation.</p>
<p id="Par35">Following Wainschtein et al.’s approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, we estimated schizophrenia heritability from our WGS data using 1151 cases and 911 controls (post-QC subjects and pairwise genetic relatedness &lt; 0.05), and 17,364,971 sequence variants (post-QC autosomal SNV/indels observed ≥ 3 times or MAF ≥ 0.0007). To evaluate the effect of progressive inclusion of more variants, we computed heritability in different ways by selecting WGS variants that corresponds to variant locations in HapMap3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, those imputable from 1000 G p3v5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and HRC r1.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and finally by including all WGS variants.</p>
<p id="Par36">First, we assessed common SNP-heritability in the WGS sample using the GREML single-component method implemented in GCTA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Using 1,189,077 SNPs from WGS that corresponds to the SNP locations in HapMap3, the SNP-heritability was 0.45 (standard error [SE] 0.089, liability scale assuming lifetime risk of 1%). Using 7,141,717 SNV/indels from WGS that corresponds to the variant locations imputable from 1000GP p3v5, the SNP-heritability was 0.48 (SE 0.091). These estimates are numerically greater than that estimated from SNP arrays in the full Swedish sample (5001 cases; GCTA SNP-heritability using HapMap3 data: 0.32, SE 0.03, and using 1000 Genomes data: 0.33, SE 0.03)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, presumably due to the fact that more stringent evidence of schizophrenia was used for samples selected for WGS than that in the full sample (Methods).</p>
<p id="Par37">Next, we evaluated SNP-heritability using 8,498,854 SNV/indels from WGS that corresponds to the variant locations imputable from HRC r1.1. We used the recommended GREML-LDMS method in GCTA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> because it is unbiased regardless the properties (e.g. MAF and LD) of the underlying causal variants (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">27</xref>a). The estimated SNP-heritability was 0.52 (SE 0.22).</p>
<p id="Par38">Finally, we used all sequence variants (17,364,971 as above) from WGS and the GREML-LDMS method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> to estimate WGS-heritability and partition additive genetic variance. We found the estimated WGS-heritability was 0.56 (SE 0.51). The point estimate of 0.56 is closer to pedigree-heritability (0.6–0.65, refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup><sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>), but the SE is large. For rare variants with MAF 0.0007–0.01, WGS variants in the low-LD group contributed to 0.40 of the phenotypic variance whereas variants in the high-LD group contributed to 0.01 of the variance (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">27</xref>b). In contrast, for HRC-imputable variants, 0.06 and 0.03 of the phenotypic variance was contributed by variants in the low- and high-LD groups for MAF 0.0007–0.01 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">27</xref>a). The contribution to phenotypic variance from rare variants in low-LD with nearby variants was only revealed by WGS. These variants could only be directly assayed by WGS as they are not present in SNP arrays and their imputation is not accurate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par39">In sum, the point estimates for heritability were progressively larger as we included more variants and there was a sizable contribution from rare variants with low-LD metrics that are accessible only via WGS. However, our estimates of SNP- and WGS-heritability had large standard errors. This was due to limited sample size and case-control study design (i.e. not continuous trait as height or body mass). The WGS-heritability estimate had the largest SE which was additionally due to the large number of rare variants with low MAF and low LD. The sampling variance of SNP-based heritability estimate is approximately inversely proportional to sample size and is proportional to the effective number of independent variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> Furthermore, we likely underestimated WGS-heritability, especially the contribution from rare variants with MAF &lt; 0.001: First, Wainschtein et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> was able to include WGS variants with MAF as low as 0.0001 (corresponding to MAC ≥ 3 in TOPMed data with 21K subjects), whereas in this study we were limited to a minimum MAF of 0.0007 (corresponding to MAC ≥ 3 in 2K subjects). Second, based on a simulation using AbCD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> assuming 2062 EUR individuals and 30x WGS, we have &gt;99% power to detect variants at MAF &gt; 0.001 but only &gt;53% power to detect variants for MAF 0–0.001. The lowest MAF bin (MAF 0.0007–0.001) that we were able to consider in this study likely included only half of the variants that could have been observed in a sample with 10,000 subjects.</p>
<p id="Par40">We believe it notable that, although not conclusive, our results for schizophrenia are consistent with those of Wainschtein et al. for height and body mass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. These results imply that, with larger schizophrenia samples (e.g. a sample size of &gt;33,000 is needed to obtain an SE of 0.02, refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup><sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>), WGS data may be able to fully recover the total additive genetic variance with desired precision and will allow further partitioning of the genome to finer MAF/LD groups as well as a variety of functional annotations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. The still missing heritability of schizophrenia may be only misplaced, in precisely the blind spots of SNP arrays as has been anticipated for over a decade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par41">We have generated and analyzed a collection of WGS data for a set of patients ascertained for schizophrenia that to our knowledge is the largest described in a publication. The high depth and uniformity of coverage across the genome for these case data allowed us to detect the large majority of genetic variation that are present in the genome, including SNVs, indels, CNVs, mobile element insertions, and inversions. In addition, the availability of similar WGS data from Swedish controls allowed us to systematically measure the burden of these different classes of variation in a case/control manner.</p>
<p id="Par42">Through the analysis of these data, we were able to replicate key prior reported excess in schizophrenia of LOF URVs in genes that are putatively LOF-intolerant as well as excess of rare deletions genome-wide. This means that we can be more confident that the load of such variants, while modest compared to the identified contribution of common variation to schizophrenia risk, are a subset of the total schizophrenia genetic risk architecture.</p>
<p id="Par43">Our finding that ultra-rare SVs in schizophrenia cases are enriched at TAD boundaries is not surprising. These variants seem to confer a level of relative risk comparable to protein-coding variants for which we have replicated an excess in schizophrenia. These regions have been reported as being depleted of deletions in human populations relative to the rest of the noncoding genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and clear phenotypic consequences associated with deletion of these elements have already been demonstrated in a number of other diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. TAD boundaries are critical to the formation and maintenance of chromatin structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The disruption of these boundaries has the potential to rearrange spatial orientation of regulatory elements that are needed for proper expression, as well as lead to the formation of entirely new TADs. Functional examples of such effects have already been described in mouse models for limb malformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Based on these prior observations it is unsurprising that of all noncoding loci, the burden of these SVs appears to be highest relative to controls in TAD boundaries.</p>
<p id="Par44">While our data support an excess of TAD-affecting ultra-rare SVs in schizophrenia cases relative to controls, the precise impact of these variants on gene expression and regulation has yet to be determined. Many of these SVs overlapped genes including some of the risk genes for neuropsychiatric disorders. Mechanistic studies are needed to clarify the precise genomic consequences of these TADs-affecting SVs in human brain. A possible future investigation would be to work with patient derived cells with these TADs-affecting SVs that we have identified and figure out what promoter-enhancer pairing looks like, and if there are any potential changes in gene expression. Our study has highlighted a specific hypothesis for future functional analyses. It will be critical to determine the precise functional effects of these variants on biology, which, in a manner similar to common variant risk, are likely to converge on higher order architectures of gene regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par45">We chose not to analyze rare mobile element insertions because variant calling for these variants appear to be noisy from our 30× WGS and there was a lack of external dataset or analytic approach for the need of quality control. Increased somatic L1 insertions have been recently reported in neurons of schizophrenia patients using postmortem brain tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. The detection of somatic L1 insertions required very deep WGS (e.g. 200×) and tailored analytic methods (e.g. machine learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>). For similar reasons, we also chose not to evaluate translocations and complex SVs in this study as we feel that these variants can be better detected from WGS using long-insert jumping libraries, deeper coverage, and targeted capture of breakpoints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par46">The analysis of noncoding variants from WGS data is challenging due to the sheer volume of the noncoding genome and limited methods to predict functional changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Recently the category-wise association study (CWAS) framework has been developed and applied to WGS studies of autism spectrum disorder using 7608 samples from 1902 families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The CWAS approach applies multiple annotation methods to define tens of thousands of annotation categories each of which are tested for association and accounted for multiple testing. However, there is a trade-off between false positives and false negatives. In this study we adopted the spirit of the CWAS approach and focused on empirically determined annotation methods including (1) conservations of DNA sequence that were estimated from cataloging and comparing genetic variation across human and mammalian species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, (2) multiple epigenomic annotations that were experimentally generated from human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, (3) genes and regions that were empirically associated with psychiatric disorders. This approach combined with the relative homogeneity of the Swedish sample helped improve the power to identify functional variants while controlling for false discovery rate.</p>
<p id="Par47">We failed to detect an excess of risk variation beyond a couple of specific classes of variation, and we believe that this is largely due to a lack of power. Prior data has demonstrated that power to implicate common variation with schizophrenia risk is only sufficient with a much larger case/control cohort, on the order of <italic>N</italic><sub>case/control</sub> &gt;10,000<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This also applies to implication of genomic loci based on ultra-rare variation. Cohorts larger than ours have failed to implicate burden of ultra-rare coding variants in individual genes with schizophrenia risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and implication of SVs with schizophrenia at locus level resolution required cohorts far larger than ours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Since we can assume that noncoding ultra-rare SNVs and indels will have a smaller relative risk conferred than damaging coding variants, it is clear that implication of this class of variation both across the genome and at locus level resolution will also require a far larger cohort size. Furthermore, larger samples will be necessary to ensure findings are replicable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par48">In sum, to effectively identify the subset of rare variation across the genome that confers schizophrenia risk in patients, we will need to follow the blueprint constructed for common variant GWAS. Substantial collaborative effort will be critical. WGS is expensive and generates a large quantity of sequence data that are difficult to efficiently store and analyze en masse. The financial and computational burden inherent to a case/control WGS analysis with sufficient power for discovery is too much for individual groups or institutions, and will only be feasible through collaborative work in meta-analyzing case/control WGS datasets. The WGS data we have generated are meant to be included in these future efforts.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p id="Par50">All schizophrenia cases included this study are from the Swedish Schizophrenia Study (S3). Detailed descriptions of S3 procedures are available elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and are briefly summarized here. S3 cases were identified via the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register that captures &gt;99% of all inpatient hospitalizations in Sweden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.The register is complete from 1987 and augmented by psychiatric data from 1973 to 1986. The sampling frame is thus population-based and covers all hospital-treated patients. The Hospital Discharge Register contains dates and ICD discharge diagnoses for each hospitalization, and captures the clinical diagnosis made by attending physicians. Case inclusion criteria: ≥2 hospitalizations with a discharge diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, both parents born in Scandinavia, and age ≥18 years. Case exclusion criteria: hospital register diagnosis of any medical or psychiatric disorder mitigating a confident diagnosis of schizophrenia as determined by expert review, and included removal of 3.4% of eligible cases due to the primacy of another psychiatric disorder (0.9%) or a general medical condition (0.3%) or uncertainties in the Hospital Discharge Register (e.g., contiguous admissions with brief total duration, 2.2%). The validity of this case definition of schizophrenia is strongly supported as described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Ethical committees in Sweden and in the US approved all procedures and all subjects provided written informed consent (or legal guardian consent and subject assent). We also obtained permissions from the area health board to which potential subjects were registered. Potential cases were contacted directly via an introductory letter followed by a telephone call. If they agreed, a research nurse met them at a psychiatric treatment facility or in their home, obtained written informed consent, obtained a blood sample, and conducted a brief interview about other medical conditions in a lifetime.</p>
<p id="Par51">The S3 included more than 5000 schizophrenia cases, from which we selected 1165 cases for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in the current study. Our main goal in selection was typical Swedish ancestry and clear schizophrenia caseness. Cases carrying known pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) (e.g. 22q11del, 16p11dup) were not selected as a primary question of this study is to evaluate the contribution of novel loci on schizophrenia risk. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. Specifically, our selection procedures required the following case inclusion criteria to be met: (1) have high-quality/sufficient DNA that satisfied all criteria: concentration ≥ 80 µg/ml, volume ≥ 150 µl, and purity ratio 1.7–2.2; (2) used in GWA study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>; (3) have typical Swedish ancestry defined by the first two PCs used in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>; (4) do not carry known large pathogenic CNVs and are not outliers for total number of CNVs as identified in Szatkiewicz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>; (5) have stringent evidence of schizophrenia that satisfied all criteria: &gt;8 inpatient or outpatient psychiatric treatment contacts for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, ≥30 inpatient days for schizophrenia, ≥5 redeemed prescriptions for antipsychotics, and few or no treatment contacts for bipolar disorder. Institutional Review Boards at University of North Carolina and regional ethics committee at Karolinska Insitutet (Regionala Etikprövningsnämnden, Stockholm) approved all study procedures and all subjects provided written informed consent.</p>
<p id="Par52">All control subjects included this study are from the SweGen project, a population-based high-quality genetic variant dataset for the Swedish population. One of the aims of SweGen is to enable WGS association studies for national patient cohorts studies in Sweden, by providing data on well-matched national controls selected on the basis of the genetic structure of the Swedish population. Detailed description of the SweGen subjects are available elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> and are briefly summarized here. SweGen project included a total 1000 individuals, of which 942 individuals were selected from The Swedish Twin Registry (STR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> and 58 from The Northern Swedish Population Health Study (NSPHS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Both STR and NSPHS are population-based collections and were approved by local ethics committees. STR is a national registry of Swedish born twins established in the 1960s and, at present, holds information on 85,000 twin pairs. In total, 11,000 individuals from the STR (one per monozygous twin pairs) participated in TwinGene and had existing SNP array genotyping. The Twingene study is a nation-wide and population-based study of Swedish born twins agreeing to participate. The TwinGene sample collection represents the Swedish geographic population density distribution. Based on principal component analysis (PCA), 942 unrelated individuals were selected from TwinGene participants for whole-genome sequencing, mirroring the density distribution. All participants gave their written informed consent and the TwinGene study was approved by the regional ethics committee (Regionala Etikprövningsnämnden, Stockholm, dnr 2007-644-31, dnr 2014/521-32). NSPHS is a health survey in the northern Swedish country of Norrbotten. Based on PCA, 58 individuals were selected from NSPHS. The NSPHS study was approved by the local ethics committee at the University of Uppsala (Regionala Etikprövningsnämnden, Uppsala, 2005:325 and 2016-03-09). All participants gave their written informed consent to the study including the examination of environmental and genetic causes of disease in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Given the selected 1000 subjects that constitutes SweGen, a PCA using genotypes from high-density SNP arrays was performed and confirmed that the SweGen control cohort captured the diversity in the country. Furthermore, since STR and NSPHS are already established national sample collections that do not reflect recent migration patterns, the SweGen control cohort is likely to reflect the genetic structure of Swedish individuals that have been present in Sweden for at least one generation.</p>
<p id="Par53">From the SweGen subjects, we selected the 942 STR/TwinGene individuals as controls in this study because of their matched ancestry with selected schizophrenia cases. Phenotype data was not allowed in the SweGen project in order to make a less restrictive access policy possible. Consequently, we were unable to screen for the presence of individuals with schizophrenia. However, we estimate that at most 1 control individual may carry a schizophrenia diagnosis (given the estimated schizophrenia prevalence of 0.0009 in the full STR/TwinGene project of 11,000 individuals). Misclassification of a single control subject will not likely affect the results or the power of the study. DNA for the STR/TwinGene individuals was extracted from blood.</p>
<p id="Par54">All S3 subjects, including those in this WGS study, had GWA SNP array genotyping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and exome sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. DNA was extracted from peripheral venous blood for all subjects. GWAS array genotyping was done in six batches at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard using Affymetrix 5.0 (3.9%), Affymetrix 6.0 (38.6%), and Illumina OmniExpress (57.4%). Exome sequencing was done at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in twelve separate waves. The first wave used Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon Kit and Illumina GAII. Other waves used a newer version Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon v.2 Kit and Illumina HiSeq 2000 and HiSeq 2500 instruments. Paired-end reads of 76 bp were used across all waves.

<title>Whole-genome sequencing and data processing</title>
<p id="Par55">Library preparation and sequencing was performed by the National Genomics Infrastructure platform in Sweden. All cases and controls were processed using identical library preparation and sequencing protocols at two facilities. WGS libraries were prepared from ~1 μg DNA using Illumina TruSeq PCR-free DNA sample preparation kits targeting an insert size of 350 bp. Library preparation was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The protocols were automated using an Agilent NGS workstation and Beckman Coulter Biomek FXp. WGS clustering was done using cBot, and paired-end sequencing with 150 bp read length was performed on Illumina HiSeqX (HiSeq Control Software 3.3.39/RTA 2.7.1) with v2.5 sequencing chemistry.</p>

<p id="Par56">For alignment, the workflow engine Piper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> (v1.4.0) was used to perform pre-processing and variant discovery, coordinated using the National Genomics Infrastructure pipeline framework. Following the GATK guidelines, raw reads were aligned to the GRCh37 human reference genome (human_g1k_v37.fasta) using bwa mem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> (v0.7.12). The resulting alignments (.BAM) were sorted and indexed using SAMtools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> (v0.1.19). Alignment quality control statistics were gathered using qualimap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> (v2.2).

<p id="Par57">For quality control of aligned sequence reads, we ran FastQC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> on the BAM-files in order to understand sequencing quality and to identify outlier samples which might be subject to contamination. We analyzed a number of sequencing QC metrics (e.g., adapter content, per base N nucleotide content, per base sequence content, per base sequence quality, per sequence GC content, per sequence quality scores, sequence duplication level, and sequence length distribution). We analyzed a number of sequence coverage QC metrics produced by SAMtools flagstat (e.g., sequencing depth, percentage of mapped reads, percentage of properly paired reads, percentage of singletons, percentage of duplicates, and percentage of paired end reads with one mate mapped to a different chromosome). Finally, we checked uniformness of read coverage using BEDTools genomecov<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, based on which we required that samples with good coverage have ≥80% of bases be covered at least 20× for confident variant calling.

<title>Variant discovery and genotyping - SNV and indels</title>
<p id="Par59">We processed all case and control BAM files together and performed joint genotyping of SNVs and indels across all samples using GATK (v3.3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par60">The raw alignments were then processed following GATK best practices with GATK (v3.3). Alignments were realigned around indels using GATK RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner, duplicate marked using Picard MarkDuplicates (v1.120), and base quality scores were recalibrated using GATK BaseRecalibrator. Finally, gVCF files were created for each sample using the GATK HaplotypeCaller (v3.3). Reference files from the GATK v2.8 resource bundle were used throughout. All these steps were coordinated using Piper (v1.4.0).</p>
<p id="Par61">Joint genotyping was conducted on all cases and controls as recommended by GATK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Due to the large number of samples, 22 batches of 100 samples were merged into 22 separate gVCF files using GATK CombineGVCFs. The 22 individual gVCF files were split by chromosome and further combined with CombineGVCFs. As a result, a single gvcf file was obtained which was used as input for GATK GenotypeGVCF. Subsequently, SNVs and indels were extracted from the resulting gVCF files. To further select high-quality genetic variants, GATK VQSR filtering was executed on SNPs and indels separately using GATK VariantRecalibrator and ApplyRecalibration walkers.

The SNV VQSR model was trained using SNP sites from HapMap3.3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) sites found to be polymorphic on Illumina Omni 2.5 M SNP arrays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>, 1000GP Phase 1 high-confidence SNPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, and dbSNP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> (v138). A 99.6% sensitivity threshold was applied to filter variants resulting in a Ti/Tv ratio of 2.001. The indel VQSR model was trained using high-confidence indel sites from<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>, 1000GP and dbSNP (v138) and a 99.0% sensitivity threshold was used. The sensitivity thresholds were determined empirically by comparing to WES data in the same samples to optimize sensitivity and specificity of variant detection. We kept only the ‘PASS’ variants based on results of VQSR.</p>
<p id="Par63">Variant calling on sex chromosomes was performed separately from the autosomes. GATK Haplotype Caller walker was executed with ploidy = 1 flag on male samples except for PAR regions which were done with ploidy = 2. CombineGVCFs and GenotypeGVCFs were performed by analogy with the processing of the autosomes, see above. VQSR filtering was performed with the sensitivity thresholds inferred from the autosomes. To assess the robustness of the callset, we evaluated hard filters in comparison to VQSR filter. We constructed histograms of 16 variant quality metrics reported by GATK GenotypeGVCFs, manually selected reasonable thresholds for good quality variants, and performed hard filtering according to the selected thresholds. We found that these two filtering strategies, VQSR and hard filtering, gave nearly identical results confirming robustness of the final variant call set.</p>

<p id="Par66">We used Delly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> (v0.7.7) with default parameters to detect and genotype three types of SV call sets: deletions, tandem duplications, and inversions that are between 500 bp and 500 Mb. We ran the default protocol for germline DNA and high-coverage sequencing. Specifically, for each type of SV, we (1) discover SV sites per sample using paired-end mapping signature and split-read refinement; (2) merge SV sites into a unified site list following strategies used by 1000GP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> (i.e., for deletions and duplications: 70% reciprocal overlap and a max. breakpoint offset of 250 bp; for inversions: 90% reciprocal overlap and a max. breakpoint offset of 50 bp); (3) genotype the unified SV sites in all samples; (4) merge all genotyped samples to get a single VCF; and (5) apply the default germline SV filters to identify confident SVs (i.e., min. fractional ALT support = 0.2, min.

Finally, we kept only high-confident genotypes that passed the per-sample genotype filter (i.e., FORMAT/FT = PASS), and had additional support from read-depth-based copy number estimates (i.e., FORMAT/CN &lt; 2 for deletions, CN &gt; 2 for duplications, and CN = 2 for inversion genotypes).</p>

<title>Evaluation of variant detection</title>
<p id="Par68">For SNV/indels, we used variant calls from exome sequencing to evaluate genotype accuracy from WGS. We focused on the autosomes and estimated genotype accuracy by calculating the concordance rate between WGS-based genotypes and those obtained from exome sequencing across variants that overlapped between the two technologies. We calculated the overall concordance rate as well as concordance rates when WES-based genotypes are homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous non-reference. In all calculations, only genotypes with sequencing depth ≥ 10 and GQ ≥ 20 were included in the comparison. Python code “concordance.py” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jinszatkiewicz/swsczwgs">https://github.com/jinszatkiewicz/swsczwgs</ext-link>) was used for this analysis.</p>
<p id="Par69">For deletions and duplications, we evaluated concordance using prior data from GWA SNP array or exome sequencing. Previously GWA genotyping arrays detected large and rare deletions and duplications genome-wide and WES detected rare exonic deletions and duplications in the same samples. We compared the concordance between WGS-based genotypes with those based on either GWAS array or exome sequencing across overlapping variants. Any overlapping variants must have ≥50% reciprocal overlap and occur in the same individual. We calculated the overall concordance rate as well as concordance rates when genotypes from the GWA array or exome sequencing are heterozygous and homozygous non-reference. Variant overlap was performed using BEDTools (v2.28.0).</p>

<p id="Par79">For brain epigenomics annotations, we relied on empirically generated annotations that have shown to be important to gene regulation in the brain. Epigenomic data are restricted to the autosomes. First, we used the open chromatin regions obtained from ATAC-seq on adult prefrontal cortex brain samples as reported in Bryois et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. ATAC-seq was performed on adult prefrontal cortex brain samples from 135 individuals with schizophrenia and 137 controls. A total of 118,152 high-confidence ATAC-seq peaks were identified. Second, we used the “easy-HiC” readouts obtained from adult temporal cortex as described in Giusti-Rodríguez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. “Easy Hi–C” was applied to six postmortem samples (<italic>N</italic> = 3 adult temporal cortex and <italic>N</italic> = 3 fetal cerebra) and 1.323 billion high-confidence cis-contacts were used for analyses. Three major read-outs were generated including frequently interacting regions (FIREs), chromatin interactions (a.k.a. Hi–C loops), and topologically associating domains (TADs). FIREs were defined as 40-kb genomic bins with significantly more Hi–C interactions (FIRE score <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Chromatin interactions were defined as intra-chromosomal chromatin interactions between 10 kb bins that were &gt;20 kb apart (i.e., not contiguous) and ≤2 Mb apart. FIREs are a small subset of all chromatin interactions, which have considerably more three-dimensional contacts. Chromatin interactions have a strong tendency to occur within TADs (discrete megabase-scale regions with less frequent interactions outside the regions). TAD boundaries are defined in 40 kb bins.

<title>Burden of ultra-rare SNV/Indels</title>
<p id="Par100">Given that the large majority of ultra-rare SNVs and indels (URVs) are not assumed to confer risk in schizophrenia cases, we first tested the null that the total rate of these variants is not a significant predictor of schizophrenia status. Before outlier pruning, with 1162 cases and 936 controls, we fitted a simple logistic regression model with case/control status as the dependent variable and count per sample of URVs as the predictor variable. We found that cases had a higher mean URV count (4456 vs. 4289, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002, two-sided), and that this was primarily driven by the presence of a portion of samples with unusually high URV counts. The URV outlier samples may be biasing the analysis of URVs even though they were not a concern for the analysis of common variants and SV, and will need to be removed. Following an approach previously established in the full Swedish sample<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, we pruned samples that had an outlier total URV count, here defined as &gt;6000 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). The outlier samples appeared to have relatively higher ancestry heterogeneity (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>) similar to the previous finding from the full Swedish sample in Genovese et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. After outlier pruning, we had 1104 cases and 921 controls and there was no evidence for a difference in mean URV count between cases and controls after this pruning step was carried out (4262 vs 4249, <italic>P</italic> = 0.4225, one-sided assuming higher burden in cases).</p>
<p id="Par101">Burden testing was done using VCFscreen (v0.1) and R (v3.2.2). All tests of URV burden in cases relative to controls were carried out using a logistic regression model framework that has been utilized in prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Specifically, the dependent outcome variable in logistic regression is phenotype (schizophrenia = 1, control = 0). The primary predictor is the count per sample of URVs that are specific to target region annotation, whether coding or noncoding. And, based on empirical evaluation, we included three covariate variables in logistic regression: mean_coverage, PC2 (the only PC of the 20 PCs determined from common SNPs which predicted sample case/control status at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), and total URV count per sample. We carried out one-sided statistical tests assuming increased burden of URV in cases. Logistic regression models were implemented by the glm function in R (v3.2.2). Odds ratios were computed to measure the increase in the likelihood of having disease per unit increase in URV burden. Empirical <italic>P</italic>-values were derived by 10,000 permutations by swapping phenotype labels.</p>

<sec id="Sec25">
<title>Burden of ultra-rare SVs</title>
<p id="Par102">Analysis was done using PLINK (v1.07) and R (v3.2.2). All tests of ultra-rare variant burden in cases relative to controls were carried out using a logistic regression framework that has been established in prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Analysis was done for each type of variants separately. In order to ensure the robustness of the analysis, we first empirically evaluated variables that could potential confound association results. We fit a multiple linear regression model, where dependent/outcome variable was the genome-wide total number of ultra-rare SVs, and the independent/predictor variables were sex, mean sequence coverage, and the first three principal components derived from common SNP genotypes. Only the first principal component (PC1) showed significant association with genome-wide burden of ultra-rare SVs. To control its potential confounding effect, we included PC1 as covariate in all tests of burdens of ultra-rare SVs.</p>
<p id="Par103">For genome-wide burden tests, we fit the following logistic regression model: <italic>y</italic> ~ covariate + global, where <italic>y</italic> is the outcome phenotype variable (schizophrenia = 1, control = 0), covariate is the empirically determined covariate variable (i.e. PC1), and global is the genome-wide total number of ultra-rare SVs. For burden tests in target regions, we fit the following logistic regression model for each target region: <italic>y</italic> ~ covariate + global + target_region, where target_region is the count per sample of ultra-rare SVs that are specific to the target region annotation. Variables global and target_region are computed based on input variants (i.e. coding, noncoding, or combined coding and noncoding). We carried out one-sided statistical tests assuming increased burden of ultra-rare SVs in cases. Logistic regression models were implemented by the glm function in R (v3.2.2). Odds ratios were computed to measure the increase in the likelihood of having disease per unit increase in the burden of ultra-rare SVs. Empirical <italic>P</italic> values were derived by 10,000 permutations by swapping phenotype labels.</p>

<title>Single-variant association analysis</title>
<p id="Par104">Analysis was done using PLINK (v1.9). Following the general guideline for logistic regression, we used a MAF cutoff of 0.01 to ensure that there were at least 10 events in the less frequent category. Post-QC variants that had MAF &gt; 0.01 were subject for single-variant association analysis. Established variant filters were used to ensure all variants had missing rate per variant &lt; 0.02, missing rate per variant difference in cases and controls &lt; 0.02 (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.005), and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium FDR &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> (controls) or &lt;1 × 10<sup>−10</sup> (cases).</p>
<p id="Par105">To empirically determine confounding factors, we fit logistic regression models where the dependent outcome variable is phenotype (case/control status) and the independent predictor variables are sex and the first 20 PCs determined from common SNPs. Only PC2 showed significant association with phenotype. Therefore, we included PC2 as covariate for the analysis of autosomal variants, and included PC2 and sex as covariates for the analysis of chromosome X.</p>
<p id="Par106">A logistic regression model with additive genetic model (Plink –logistic) with empirically determined covariates was used to estimate association between single variants and schizophrenia. Statistical tests were two-sided. The established threshold of 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup> was used to identify genome-wide significance. Following association, we used IGV to inspect read alignments underlying each putative variant that exceeded the genome-wide significance threshold. False positives that had no IGV support were excluded. Manhattan plots were constructed using R (v3.2.2).</p>
<p id="Par107">Analysis was done separately for SNV/indels, deletions, duplications, inversions, ALU, SVA, and LINE1. For SNV/indels, deletions, duplications, and inversions, we filtered variants as described above. For ALU, LINE1, and SVA, we additionally restricted our attention to the most reliable variants by selecting variants with a quality score of 5 (best). For ALU, MAF was set to be &gt;0.05 and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium threshold to FDR &lt; 0.05 for both cases and controls.</p>

<title>Heritability estimation</title>
<p id="Par108">Following Wainschtein et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, we started with the initial set of QC-passing subjects and post-QC SNV/indels and additionally required that each variant observed at least three times in our dataset (i.e. MAF starts at 0.0007). Next we further removed one of each pair of individuals with estimated genetic relatedness &gt;0.05. These procedures resulted in 1151 cases and 911 controls and 17,364,971 sequence variants to be used for narrow-sense heritability estimation. HapMap3 SNPs were downloaded from the HapMap ftp site. To identify imputable variants from Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and 1000 Genomes Project Consortium (1000GP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, we used previously imputed data obtained by using SNP genotypes of the schizophrenia subjects from Illumina OmniExpress array genotyping and imputing the array genotype data to the HRC.r1.1 or the 1000GP p3v5 reference panel using EAGLE2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup> (v2.0.5). On the HRC imputation variants, we excluded variants with Imputation Score Info &lt;0.8, individual missing rate &gt;0.05, genotype missing rate &gt;0.05, MAF &lt; 0.0001 and <italic>P</italic>-value &lt;1e-06 of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test. On the 1000GP imputation variants, we excluded variants with Imputation Score Info &lt;0.8, and allele frequencies &lt;0.005 or allele frequencies &gt;0.995 based on previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par109">Heritability analysis was done using GCTA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> (v1.26.0, v1.92.3beta). We assumed lifetime risk of schizophrenia of 1%. We calculated principal components from 1,189,077 HapMap3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> SNPs selected from the WGS data and included the first 10 PCs (calculated from the same set of HapMap3 SNPs) for the analyses conducted using GCTA’s GREML-LDMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. To test the robustness of the estimates, we repeated the analysis while correcting for the first 4 PCs, and for the first 12 PCs and found the results were similar.</p>
<p id="Par110">With the GREML-LDMS approach, a total of 14 MAF and LD bins were considered and the same set of bins were used for both the imputed-SNPs and for the WGS sequence variants. Specifically, we split the variants into seven different bins based on MAF (0.0007–0.0001, 0.001–0.01, 0.01–0.1, 0.1–0.2, 0.2–0.3, 0.3–0.4, 0.4–0.5) and for each bin of variants, computed SNP-based LD scores with the following parameters: –ld-score-region 200, -ld-wind 10000, ld-rsq-cutoff 0. For a given bin of variants defined by MAF, we defined low LD as &lt; median LD score, and high LD as ≥median LD score. For each bin subsetted on MAF (and further split by LD), we used GCTA to produce a genetic relationship matrix (GRM) from the set of genotypes. We then used the REML function (via the Fisher scoring algorithm, as implemented in GCTA via –reml-alg 1) to conduct a GREML-LDMS analysis.</p>
