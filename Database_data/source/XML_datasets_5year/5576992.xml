<p>Evidence from animal studies suggests that stress-induced increases in Nrf2-regulated antioxidant gene expression, a critical mechanism of cellular protection, declines with aging. This study examined whether this also occurs in humans. We measured the basal and inducible levels of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells from subjects of young adult (21–29 years) and older (60–69 years) non-smokers, and explored factors affecting expresion. The basal expression of three representative Nrf2-regulated genes, the catalytic and modulator subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLC and GCLM, respectively), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), was higher in cells from the older donors compared with cells from the young adult donors. Upon exposure to the Nrf2 activator, sulforaphane (SF), the expression of these antioxidant genes was increased in cells from both the young adults and the older donors; however, the induction by SF in older donor cells was significantly less than that seen in young adult cells. In addition, the activation of an EpRE-driven reporter by SF was lower in cells from older donors compared to cells from young adults. The basal expression of Nrf2 protein was also lower in cells from older donors than cells from young adults. Furthermore, we found that the basal expression of both Bach1 and c-Myc, two Nrf2 suppressors, was higher in cells from older adults than from young adult donors. In summary, our data suggest that, as in other species, basal expression of Nrf2-regulated genes increases with aging, while inducibility declines with aging. The increased expression of Nrf2 suppressors such as Bach1 and c-Myc may contribute to the impaired inducibility of the Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes with aging in human bronchial epithelial cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Antioxidant enzymes play an important role in protecting cells against oxidative stress, including the apparent increase of oxidative stress in aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">[30]</xref>. Activation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling provides a critical mechanism to counteract oxidative stress through its ability to increase the expression of genes containing the electrophile response element (EpRE, also called the antioxidant response element or ARE) in the promoter region. EpRE sequences can be found in many genes, but only some of them function in transcriptional activation through Nrf2 binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">[34]</xref>. Nevertheless, Nrf2 signaling is involved in the regulation of many antioxidant/detoxifying genes, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">[29]</xref> and both subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLC and GCLM) which catalyzes the first step in glutathione synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">[6]</xref>, and is a key factor in for minimizing oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Sulforaphane (SF), an isocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables, is one of the most potent naturally-occurring inducers of phase II enzymes and is widely acknowledged to provide chemo-preventive benefits in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">[36]</xref>. In a clinical trial, SF was found to improve the behavior of young men with autism spectrum disorder compared to placebo recipients due to its ability to up-regulate genes that protect aerobic cells against oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">[24]</xref>. Whether SF treatment functions differently in aging humans than in young adults has not been reported, previously. Our previous studies showed that the inducibility of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant enzymes was already markedly depressed at middle age in the lungs, liver and cerebellum of mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">[35]</xref>, and that the loss of inducibility correlated with increased expression of the Nrf2 inhibitors, Bach1 and c-Myc. Bach1 is a classic suppressor of EpRE-mediated gene expression, as it competes with Nrf2 for binding to the same EpRE <italic>cis</italic>-element in several genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">[20]</xref>. An observed increase in Bach1 in aged mice may explain, in part, the loss of inducibility of some Nrf2-regulated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">[35]</xref>. Thus, it was important to investigate the potential change of the Nrf2-Bach1 dynamic relationship with age in humans. The oncogene product, c-Myc also interferes with Nrf2 signaling and its target gene expression, but by a different mechanism than reported for Bach1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">[11]</xref>. Regulation of the EpRE/Nrf2 signaling pathway by c-Myc appears to be through both interaction with the EpRE binding complex and increased degradation of Nrf2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although many have observed a decline in Nrf2 signaling with aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">[32]</xref>, most of the investigations were based on animal models, and it remained unclear if this phenotypic aging alteration also occurred in humans. Using primary human bronchial epithelial cells from donors of various ages, we investigated the expression of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes and the induction of these genes and Nrf2 signaling by SF, and explored the underlying mechanism of the changes with age.</p>

<title>Demographics and characteristics of HBE cell donors</title>
<p>A limitation of this study was the availability of primary purified HBE cells. We originally selected cells from only male non-smokers, who were free of lung disease. These came from two groups: three young adult males (28/29) and three older (WHO definition) (67/69) samples. This represented similar age groups to our previous studies with mice in which we compared young adult (6-month old) and older (21-month old) mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">[35]</xref>. Within each of the two groups, variation of baseline and induction among the individuals were small. But, as groups of 3 seemed small, we purchased additional samples from the same company (Lonza) and other two vials of cells from young adults from a different company (Lifeline Cell Technology) as described in Methods. Because only one sample from a non-smoker over age 60 was available, that sample was added even though it was from a female donor. For statistical analyses of phase II mRNA, we grouped the five young adults (21–29) and compared them with the group of four older donors (60–69). Due to a lack of material however, we compared proteins from only the three 28–29 and three 67–69 year-old donors.</p>

<title>Variation of the basal expression of Nrf2-regulated genes with aging</title>
<p>We first determined the basal mRNA levels of these three representative Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes in HBE cells. Heme oxygenase 1 was also measured, but found to have very low expression in the HBE cells. The basal mRNA levels of <italic>NQO1, GCLC, and GCLM</italic> in cells from the older donors were significantly higher than those from the young adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>). This finding paralleled results that we published previously for mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">[35]</xref>. Mean levels of <italic>GCLC, GCLM</italic> and <italic>NQO1</italic> were not changed significantly by inclusion of data from cells of the 60-year-old female (p &lt; 0.05 for all comparisons). Basal expression of the above-mentioned phase II genes in cells of the entire age range (13–69) is presented in the supplemental materials. Cells from adolescents exhibited comparatively higher basal <italic>GCLC</italic> and <italic>NQO1</italic> gene expression than those in young adult cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>s). As lungs are still developing during adolescence, we have not included these two samples in the comparisons. Similarly, while results with the one 57-year-old donor were similar to those from older cells, they were also excluded from the comparisons.<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Variation of basal mRNA levels of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes (<italic>GCLC, GCLM</italic> and <italic>NQO1</italic>) between HBE cells from young adults (age 21–29) and older donors (age 60–69).

<title>SF induction of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes</title>
<p>To determine the effect of aging on the inducibility of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes, HBE cells were treated with sulforaphane (SF), a potent Nrf2 activator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">[27]</xref>. Upon treatment, the mRNA level of all three representative genes regulated by Nrf2 was significantly increased in HBE cells from all individuals; however, the induction was significantly greater in cells from young adults compared to that from older donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>), indicating an age-dependent decline of the inducibility of these Nrf2-regulated genes with aging. This also resembled what was reported by us for chronic exposure to nanoparticles in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">[35]</xref>. The mean ± S.E for the SF induction of <italic>GCLM, GCLC</italic> and <italic>NQO1</italic> in cells from older donors, including the age 60 female, were 2.99 ± 0.50, 3.08 ± 0.49 and 3.47 ± 0.40 times higher than untreated cells, respectively. Excluding the sample from the 60-year old female resulted in values of 3.08 ± 0.28, 2.98 ± 0.61 and 3.47 ± 0.46 for <italic>GCLM</italic>, <italic>GCLC</italic> and <italic>NQO1,</italic> respectively. The p values were less than 0.05 for all comparisons. Phase II gene induction following SF treatment in cells of the entire age range (13–69) is presented in the supplement materials. As mentioned above, we excluded samples from outside the young adult and older donors in our analyses.<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Induction of Nrf2-regulated genes by sulforaphane (SF) in cells from young adults (age 21–29) and older donors (age 60–69).

<title>Changes in nuclear protein levels of Nrf2 and its suppressors with aging</title>
<p>To explore the underlying mechanism of age-related decline in the induction of Nrf2-regulated genes, we determined the activation of Nrf2 signaling and the nuclear protein levels of its suppressors Bach1 and c-Myc in HBE cells from young adults and older donors. Similar to what we observed at the mRNA level, basal nuclear protein levels of both Bach 1 and c-Myc were greater in cells from the older donors versus young adults. Exposure to SF for 1 h did not significantly increase nuclear Bach1 levels in cells from either older donors or young adults, while nuclear c-Myc showed a significant increase in cells from both age groups. However, no significant difference was observed between older donors and young adults in the increase of nuclear c-Myc following SF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0015">Fig. 3</xref>B).</p>
<p>Activation of Nrf2 in response to oxidative stress or chemical inducers results in its translocation to the nucleus and this is commonly used as an indicator of the activation of Nrf2 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">[7]</xref>. Basal nuclear Nrf2 protein levels in cells from young adults were 1.34 times as high as in cells from the older donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Fig. 5</xref>B). Representative western blots from each individual are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Fig. 5</xref>A. Upon SF exposure, there was a significant increase in nuclear Nrf2 protein levels in cells from both age groups; however, Nrf2 nuclear translocation after SF exposure was higher in cells from young adults compared with older donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Fig. 5</xref>B). Basal nuclear Bach1 protein levels in cells from older donors were 1.5 times higher than in cells from young adult donors. An increase in Bach1 protein expression was observed in the older donor cells after SF treatment but not in the cells from young adult donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Fig. 5</xref>C). Basal nuclear c-Myc protein was also higher in the cells from older donors and significantly increased in cells of both older donors and young adults after SF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Fig. 5</xref>D). However, the difference in induction of c-Myc upon SF stimulation was not significant. These results were consistent with the changes in basal and induced Bach1 and c-Myc with age at the mRNA level.<fig id="f0025"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Aging effect on the basal and SF-activated nuclear protein expression of Nrf2 and its suppressors.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cumulative oxidative damage to macromolecules has been postulated as a mechanism responsible for the aging-related phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">[5]</xref>. A major mechanism in cellular defense against oxidative/electrophilic stress is activation of the Nrf2/EpRE signaling pathway, which controls the expression of genes that are involved in detoxification and elimination of reactive oxidants and electrophilic agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">[16]</xref>. Using HBE cells from human donors of different ages, we demonstrated here that although the basal expression of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes was higher in the older donor cells, the induction of these genes and EpRE-driven reporter declined with aging, suggesting an impaired Nrf2 signaling in the elderly. The mechanism underlying this decline may involve Bach1 and c-Myc, two Nrf2 suppressors, as the basal expression of both was significantly higher in the older donor cells than in cells from young adults. Furthermore, SF inducible expression of Bach1 was almost three-fold higher in cells from older donors than from their younger counterparts.</p>
<p>The basal expression of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes was higher in the HBE cells from the older human donors compared to that from young adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>). This is consistent with a previous study where we found that the basal levels of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant enzymes in middle-aged mice were elevated compared to that in young animals while the inducibility of these genes was significantly depressed or absent in the middle-aged mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">[35]</xref>. Evidence from others also has demonstrated an increase in the basal level of Nrf2-regulated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">[8]</xref>. It remains unclear whether this occurs at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. As the basal nuclear Nrf2 protein level was lower in the older donor cells compared to the young adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Fig. 5</xref>B), it seems unlikely that Nrf2 alone was responsible for the higher basal expression of these genes. Previous studies reported that both Nrf2 and AP1 were potentially involved in the induction of GCL genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">[9]</xref>. At the transcriptional level, these antioxidant genes could also be regulated through EpRE binding transcription factors other than Nrf2, such as Nrf1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">[17]</xref>, c-Jun and other AP-1 family proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">[1]</xref>, and small Maf proteins, or through cis-elements other than EpRE, such as AP-1 cis-element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">[13]</xref>. Since only limited information is available about the expression of other transcription factors and/or cis-element activity with aging, their involvement in the change of the basal gene expression remains to be determined. Nonetheless, the increased basal expression of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes might be mediated by signaling molecules other than Nrf2.</p>
<p>The current study demonstrates that both Nrf2 signaling, and induction of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes, are impaired in primary HBE cells from older human donors, as evidenced by the significant decrease in gene induction and EpRE-driven reporter activation upon SF exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0020">Fig. 4</xref> respectively). To our knowledge, this is the first evidence based on human primary cells showing aging-related decline of Nrf2 signaling. These data confirmed previous studies based on animals including mice, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> flies, and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> worms, that Nrf2 (orthologue) signaling is disrupted during aging and leads to a decreased endogenous antioxidant response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">[25]</xref>. Nrf2 signaling could be regulated at multiple levels and involve various competitors and regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">[32]</xref>. Here we found that c-Myc and Bach1, two Nrf2 suppressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">[11]</xref>, were increased in the older donor HBE cells at basal level compared to that from young adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0015">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Fig. 5</xref>). An increase in c-Myc could result in faster Nrf2 turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">[11]</xref> and decrease the levels of Nrf2 in the nucleus, as observed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0025">Fig. 5</xref>). On the other hand, Bach1, as an Nrf2 competitor binding to EpRE <italic>cis</italic>-element, could further decrease Nrf2/EpRE activity and induction of genes upon exposure to SF or other oxidative stressors. It is possible that other regulators could also underlie the aging-related decline in Nrf2 signaling. The roles of Bach1 and c-Myc induction during the activation of Nrf2 are not fully elucidated. Previous data suggested that Bach1 was not increased by stimuli in tissues of 6 month old mice, but was induced in 21 month old mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">[35]</xref>. Our results suggest that treatment with SF was able to induce a similar c-Myc accumulation in both young adult and older cells.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found that although the basal expression of the Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes was increased in the HBE cells from older human donors, the inducibility of these genes was impaired compared to that seen in HBE from young adult donors. We also showed that the increased nuclear level of both c-Myc and Bach1 in the cells of older donors might be involved in the aging-related decline in Nrf2 signaling, especially since Bach1 actually exhibited greater inducibility with donor age.</p>
<p>The induction of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes is considered a major adaptive response to endogenous and exogenous toxicants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">[15]</xref>, and is clearly a major component of overall adaptive homeostasis capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">[37]</xref>. Adaptive Homeostasis. Molecular Aspects of Medicine 49, 1–7). The depressed induction of Nrf2 and Nrf2-regulated genes in older cells may underlie the increased susceptibility of the elderly to oxidative stress. The higher basal level of antioxidant enzymes and Nrf2 suppressing genes indicates that older people may establish a new, and higher, steady state level of antioxidant enzyme expression that improves basal capacity to cope with oxidation but is then less able to further increase antioxidant enzymes in response to stress. Our findings also suggest that therapeutic approaches based on activating Nrf2 may not be as effective in older individuals as in young adults because of increased activities of the Nrf2 suppressors Bach1 and c-Myc. Therefore, suppression of Bach1 and c-Myc may be a more effective method for future treatments specifically aimed at older individuals.</p>
