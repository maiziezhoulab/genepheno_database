<abstract>
<p>Comparative effectiveness research (CER) in genomic medicine (GM) measures the
clinical utility of using genomic information to guide clinical care in comparison to
appropriate alternatives. We summarized findings of high-quality systematic reviews
that compared the analytic and clinical validity and clinical utility of GM tests. We
focused on clinical utility findings to summarize CER-derived evidence about GM and
identify evidence gaps and future research needs. We abstracted key elements of study
design, GM interventions, results, and study quality ratings from 21 systematic
reviews published in 2010 through 2015. More than half (<italic>N</italic> = 13) of the
reviews were of cancer-related tests. All reviews identified potentially important
clinical applications of the GM interventions, but most had significant
methodological weaknesses that largely precluded any conclusions about clinical
utility. Twelve reviews discussed the importance of patient-centered outcomes,
although few described evidence about the impact of genomic medicine on these
outcomes. In summary, we found a very limited body of evidence about the effect of
using genomic tests on health outcomes and many evidence gaps for CER to address.</p>

<body>
<p>Genomic medicine (GM) uses information about a person’s genome to improve his or
her health. Growing interest in GM coincides with heightened recognition of the need for
better-quality evidence to support informed decisions. Therefore, the widespread
adoption of GM into patient care will require high<italic>-</italic>quality evidence that it
improves patient outcomes when compared with conventional care. A third trend, which may
influence the research in genomic medicine, is the inclusion of study outcomes that
patients say are of greatest concern to them.</p>
<p>This focus on patient-relevant outcomes is the hallmark of comparative effectiveness
research (CER). The purpose of CER is to improve the evidence base for making decisions
that are relevant to patients and other stakeholders. CER encompasses the synthesis of
existing evidence and the generation of new evidence that compares alternative
approaches to the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a health condition. In the
context of genetic tests, CER is applicable both in the analysis of individual studies
and when conducting systematic reviews of a body of evidence. Specifically, after
establishing the analytic validity (reliability in clinical laboratory practice) and
clinical validity (diagnostic or prognostic accuracy) of a test, CER is the approach for
determining how the use of the test impacts health outcomes compared with an appropriate
alternative (no testing or a comparison test).</p>
<p>The purpose of this review is to identify opportunities for CER to contribute to making
the application of GM to patient care more evidence-based and more patient-centered.
Previous studies have proposed a conceptual framework or focused on specific topics such
as cancer tumor profiling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup>
We summarize the findings of systematic reviews of CER of specific GM interventions
(“structured review”) and use expert assessment of these findings to help
identify evidence gaps (“landscape analysis”). Structured literature reviews
map the literature landscape by identifying what evidence is available and assessing the
findings with respect to gaps in the evidence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup>
whereas landscape analysis provides an overview of a topic by combining a structured
literature review with expert input.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup></p>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We abstracted and then summarized information from each included systematic review
(<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref></bold>). A technical working group (TWG)
with GM expertise (the members are listed in the <bold>Supplementary Materials</bold>
online) reviewed this information and suggested ways to portray the current landscape
of GM. Our research questions were as follows: <list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>1. What is the evidence from systematic reviews of CER of GM?<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>a. What tests, testing indications, comparators, and outcomes have been
studied?</p></list-item><list-item><p>b. What is the impact of GM on patient outcomes (clinical utility)?</p></list-item><list-item><p>c. Did the systematic reviews use standard methods to evaluate the quality
of the studies and what did they conclude?</p></list-item><list-item><p>d. What did the reviews say about the potential clinical role of the GM
interventions?</p></list-item><list-item><p>e. Did any studies use patient-reported outcomes (e.g., impact on
activities of daily living)?</p></list-item><list-item><p>f. Did the reviews identify gaps in the evidence about patient outcomes?
What CER might address those gaps?</p></list-item></list><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>2. When taking into account both the evidence from the systematic reviews
and expert assessments, what is the current state of CER of GM and its
future?</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list>

<sec>
<title>Structured review</title>
<p>We systematically identified, selected, and appraised systematic reviews conducted
by technology-assessment groups (TAGs), which we defined as organizations that
assess health technologies to support clinical practice guidelines or insurance
coverage decisions. We limited ourselves to systematic reviews because they have
several desirable characteristics. Most importantly for assessing the quality of
the body of evidence (our key objective), they use widely accepted
quality-assessment instruments that incorporate measures of the components of
study quality. They also choose topics that are important to the public at large.
For example, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association Technology Evaluation Center
(BCBSA TEC; now called BCBSA Evidence Street) performs systematic reviews for
its independent Medical Advisory Panel, and other organizations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> use its reports, and the Agency for Health
Care Research and Quality (AHRQ) uses public input to inform the choice of topics
for systematic reviews. We focused on systematic reviews because they are
comprehensive by design, bias-free in their conduct, and collectively summarize a
vast body of individual studies.</p>
<p>We describe our approach to identifying systematic reviews in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref></bold> and the <bold>Supplementary Materials</bold>
online. We first developed a list of potential TAGs based on our review of the
literature and confirmed this list with the TWG. Using inclusion criteria, we
narrowed this to 13 key TAGs (<bold>Supplementary Materials</bold> online). We searched
TAG websites using the key words “personalized medicine,”
“precision medicine,” or “genomic testing” and by
reviewing report titles. We included a systematic review if it summarized multiple
studies of CER that addressed GM tests (as of December 2015). We limited our
search to reviews from the past 5 years, which is an empirically derived interval
after which a systematic review is considered outdated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>We found relevant systematic reviews by BCBSA TEC (9 reviews), AHRQ (10 reviews),
and the Cochrane Collaboration (2 reviews). Only two CER reviews were older than 5
years. All 21 performed at least a Medline search, and five performed a gray
literature search. All had prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. In all
the AHRQ and Cochrane reviews, two individuals independently extracted data from
individual studies. Fourteen systematic reviews described the standards used to
rate the risk of bias (<bold>Supplementary Materials</bold> online).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Data abstraction</title>
<p>We abstracted variables chosen to reflect study objectives and approaches used to
prioritize topics for CER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> and TWG
input (<bold>Supplementary Materials</bold> online). We coded reviews using the test(s)
included in the review as the unit of analysis, not each individual study within
the review. We categorized the reviews according to clinical testing indications
(e.g., cancer tumor profiling tests). Four authors (K.P., P.D., H.S., and M.D.)
summarized each review. One author (H.S.) assessed the quality of the methods used
in individual studies within reviews by describing the instruments used to assess
quality and recording the overall quality ratings of the evidence (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref></bold>). We assessed whether our conclusions were
likely to have been different if we had reviewed individual studies versus TAGs
using two approaches. First, we determined whether the TWG reviewed all key
conclusions and noted any outdated findings. Second, we compared conclusions from
an included TAG review of sequencing tests for prenatal screening to recent
systematic reviews not included in our study because they were not TAG
reviews<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> as well as to key
individual studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> We found that these conclusions were similar and would
not have substantively changed the findings of our study.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Synthesis of the body of evidence</title>
<p>We first obtained background information by conducting semistructured interviews
with each TWG member and four other experts, including one patient advocate
(<bold>Supplementary Materials</bold> online). Later, we asked TWG members to
identify related GM tests that had not been subjected to CER and important changes
in the evidence since the last study included in the 21 reviews. TWG members also
commented on the CER questions. Responses reflected the individual TWG
member’s opinion, not a formal process of priority setting.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref></bold> lists the 21 reviews along with their
stated objectives and their evidence quality ratings (details in <bold>Supplementary
Materials</bold> online). Every review found methodological shortcomings and little
or no evidence about the impact of GM on patient outcomes. Cancer-related tests
predominated (tumor profiling <italic>n</italic> = 9; germ-line testing <italic>n</italic> = 4),
whereas the other eight reviews were divided among five topics. Twelve reviews
discussed the importance of patient-centered outcomes, although most noted the
limited direct evidence about these outcomes. Two reviews focused on delivery of
genomic information to patients (communication of risk information and approaches to
risk assessment). Most reviews (81%) explicitly identified comparators, which
included no testing, other genomic tests, nongenomic tests, clinical criteria, and
phenotype-based risk scores.</p>

when compared to clinical predictors (clinical validity). No study directly

Onco<italic>type</italic>DX results did affect treatment decision making.</p></list-item><list-item><p>• A 2013 review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> of

unmatched therapy, whereas two had no controls.</p></list-item><list-item><p>• Studies should measure whether genomic tests lead to better clinical
outcomes than alternative prognostic methods during different stages of

</p>
<p><italic>Landscape analysis.</italic> The evidence base for using genomic tests to
individualize cancer care is small. Good-quality evidence shows an effect on
treatment choice in one test–cancer combination (Onco<italic>type</italic>DX for
recurrence of early-stage breast cancer). Furthermore, the MINDACT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> and TAILORx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> studies showed that the Mammaprint and
Onco<italic>type</italic>DX GEP panels predicted which early-stage breast cancer patients
with low risk scores may be managed with endocrine therapy and avoid
chemotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> The outcomes of
these large trials involving breast cancer have been overall survival,
disease-free survival, and survival without distant metastases. However, the
RxPONDER trial (evaluation of Onco<italic>type</italic>DX in node-positive patients) did
involve patient advocates in the design of the study and includes quality of life
and other patient-reported outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although GEP tests can estimate prognosis (clinical validity), CER should assess
its effect on clinical outcomes (clinical utility). CER could also focus on
colorectal, lung, skin, and hematologic cancers, for which tests have been
developed and could be useful.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> The one
review that assessed multiple molecular markers to target treatment found no
high-quality evidence and highlighted the methodological complexities of designing
unbiased studies to measure clinical utility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup></p>

</p>
<p><italic>Landscape analysis.</italic> Chronic conditions have a high health burden and
impact family members. Testing could potentially be useful for a large number of
chronic conditions, but our selection of reviews addressed only neurodevelopmental
delays in children (two reviews). Tests for familial
hypercholesterolemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> offer other
opportunities for CER studies of the incremental benefits and harms of genomic
testing. Because genes related to chronic diseases typically have low penetrance
and high heterogeneity, assessing the impact of genomic testing on health outcomes
will most likely require very large populations, suggesting the need for disease
registries. Although the protracted course of chronic disease implies the need for
long follow-up, the effect of genomic testing could lead relatively quickly to
interventions that affect short-term patient-centered outcomes.</p>

<title>Pharmacogenetic testing</title>
<p><italic>Clinical context.</italic> The metabolism of some drugs (conversion to an active
form or an inactive form) is under genetic control. Mutations in the genes for
enzymes that metabolize drugs may lead to too much or too little active drug when
physicians prescribe standard doses. A pharmacogenetic test aims to detect a
genetic basis for differences in the response to a drug.</p>
<p><italic>Review topics.</italic> Review topics include testing for CYP2C19 genetic variants
to guide antiplatelet therapy in coronary artery disease (clopidogrel) and testing
for CYP2D6 genetic variants to guide tamoxifen therapy for women at high risk for
primary breast cancer or recurrence.</p>

</p>
<p><italic>Landscape analysis.</italic> The two reviews identified only one small trial that
measured the impact of pharmacogenetic testing on clinical outcomes. Since the
completion of the systematic review, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
and Mayo Clinic have been sponsoring a large pragmatic trial (TAILOR-PCI) to
evaluate use of CYP2C19 genotyping to guide the choice between clopidogrel and
ticagrelor. The purpose of this study was to determine whether using
pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing to guide anti-platelet therapy improves
cardiovascular outcomes following coronary stent placement in patients with
impaired activation of clopidogrel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup>
There are many other opportunities to conduct CER studies of PGx tests because
nearly 200 drugs contain pharmacogenetic information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> For example, three high-quality trials published in 2013
showed that, overall, a clinical algorithm was a better approach than PGx testing
for dosing either warfarin or acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon and achieving
desired states of anticoagulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> PGx testing
might impact several conditions (e.g., infectious disease, mental health
conditions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup>
Further opportunities for CER include comparing PGx testing before starting
treatment versus prescribing without testing. This strategy involves having access
to PGx data at the point of care and requires access to clinical decision support
but overcomes many of the logistical hurdles that have limited clinical
integration of PGx testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup></p>

<title>Prenatal screening</title>
<p><italic>Clinical context.</italic> Aneuploidies (an abnormal number of autosomal or sex
chromosomes) often lead to developmental abnormalities, the best known of which is
Down syndrome (trisomy 21). Until recently, noninvasive tests for aneuploidies
were not specific enough to act upon and therefore required tissue sampling for
confirmatory karyotyping. Sequencing DNA from maternal serum can detect fragments
of fetal DNA, which are present as early as 8–10 weeks of gestation.</p>
<p><italic>Review topics.</italic> Review topics include sequencing-based tests for fetal
Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and other aneuploidies.</p>

13.</p></list-item><list-item><p>• No studies measured patient-centered outcomes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>• Future studies should compare all potential screening strategies and

</p>
<p><italic>Landscape analysis.</italic> Prenatal screening for fetal chromosomal
abnormalities is considered the standard of care in the United States for women at
high risk. Because of its very high specificity, cell-free DNA screening is a
strong alternative to testing for maternal serum markers and fetal ultrasound and
should result in fewer invasive procedures to perform karyotyping. CER studies
could compare parent preferences for further testing after learning the results of
DNA testing versus conventional noninvasive testing, explore ethical questions,
and study patient, family, and system effects of expanding prenatal testing to
average-risk populations.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Population screening for risk assessment</title>
<p><italic>Clinical context.</italic> DNA-based tests can detect genes that increase the risk
of diseases like breast cancer, lung cancer, or diabetes. In some cases, detecting
such genes could lead to preventive measures (e.g., bilateral mastectomy for
carriers of <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations, which increases the risk of breast cancer) or
changes in risky behaviors.</p>
<p><italic>Review topics.</italic> Review topics include effects of communicating DNA-based
risk estimates on risk-reducing behaviors.</p>
<p>
<italic>Review conclusions (<italic>N</italic> = 1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup></italic>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>• Larger and better-quality randomized, control trials should examine
patient-centered outcomes, including behavior and unintended adverse
effects. Sample sizes should be large enough to detect small effects.</p></list-item><list-item><p>• Poor-quality evidence suggests that communicating genetic disease
risk has little or no impact on smoking or physical exercise.</p></list-item><list-item><p>• No studies had a low risk of bias or compared genomic test and
conventional risk factor counseling versus counseling alone.</p></list-item></list>
</p>
<p><italic>Landscape analysis.</italic> Although risky behaviors are a major health threat,
current evidence does not support claims that DNA-based risk assessments motivate
behavior change. The key unanswered question is the added effect of genomic risk
information on clinical outcomes when combined with and compared to conventional
testing, family history, clinical risk factors, and treatment. Such studies
require a comparison group that receives conventional care but no genomic testing.
Several randomized trials involved in the only systematic review that focused on
provision of genetic information to reduce risk behaviors (e.g., smoking, diet,
physical activity) did meet this study design criterion but were of low quality.
The best approach to assessing the impact of genomic testing on risky behaviors
such as cigarette smoking may be to study screening for mutations in highly
penetrant genes in patients with a target condition for which effective
interventions exist. Such studies should examine whether genomic information has
an incremental impact on behavior and outcomes by using carefully designed
comparators.</p>

<title>Whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing and testing for rare
diseases</title>
<p><italic>Clinical context.</italic> Disorders that present with multiple anomalies, often
early in life, suggest a mutation in a single gene. These disorders can be
difficult to diagnose because of their rarity, nonspecific phenotype, and lack of
a well-defined pathway to a diagnosis. Establishing a genetic cause can lead to
specific treatment and to establishing the carrier status of family members.</p>

</p>
<p><italic>Landscape analysis.</italic> Opportunities for CER studies may increase as the
indications for whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
expands. Testing only to diagnose a suspected rare disease will have a small
public health impact due to low prevalence and lack of treatments. Evidence of
clinical utility is lacking for the broader use of WES and WGS beyond diagnosis of
rare diseases. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines on
the return of secondary findings from WES and WGS list some potentially important
tests for CER studies such as detection of genetic familial
hypercholesterolemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup></p>

<sec>
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In summary, we found a very limited body of evidence about the effect of using
genomic tests on health outcomes and many evidence gaps for CER to address. Like the
systematic reviews, we defined clinical utility as improved health outcomes triggered
by a test result and mediated by changes in patient behavior and clinical decisions.
We also found a lack of evidence for effects on intermediate outcomes (e.g., avoiding
unnecessary care, improving access to services, or providing prognostic or predictive
information), which negates efforts to build a chain of evidence from test results
through these intermediate outcomes to altered clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>Key implications of our findings for research and policy are presented here.</p>
<sec>
<title>Address important questions</title>
<p>Two important decisions relevant to CER involve whether to perform a test and what
to do with patients at intermediate risk or with uncertain test results. The first
decision addresses the question “Is the test result likely to change the
treatment plan suggested by my clinical assessment?” A CER study design
might compare health-related outcomes after the clinical assessment alone with
outcomes after performing the assessment plus a GM test. The second decision is in
regard to what to do in ambiguous situations. A study design might randomly assign
patients with intermediate-risk test results to receive either low-intensity
treatment or high-intensity treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Diversify the evidence base</title>
<p>Most of the reviews focused on cancer; however, many oncology-specific GM
tests known to have promising evidence supporting their use in clinical practice
were not included in the reviews because of either their scope or their timing. In
addition to oncology, active areas of research in neurology, psychiatry,
cardiology, and rare disorders suggest opportunities for future studies and
evidence syntheses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup> The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention’s Office of Public Health Genomics categorize
genetic tests in three tiers according to whether they have a base of synthesized
evidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> The agency’s
list of tests categorized as “Tier 2” would be attractive targets for
future CER studies because they are mentioned in clinical practice guidelines or
Food and Drug Administration labeling, but the supporting evidence is insufficient
to guide clinical use. Finally, even the best studies focused on how test results
affected decision-making by clinicians rather than by patients. Missing are
high-quality studies comparing the effect of different models for communicating
DNA-based disease risk estimates on <italic>patient</italic> motivation to take
appropriate actions.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Use established methods to improve the evidence base</title>
<p>We found only a few randomized trials designed to assess the impact of GM testing
on patient outcomes. However, observational studies (cohort,
retrospective-prospective, single arm) and use of indirect evidence (modeling) can
also compare clinical utility, albeit with less certain results. Studies to
establish analytic and clinical validity should precede studies to measure
clinical utility to ensure that study participants are exposed to accurate and
reliable tests that could change patient care. Many of the included tests had good
evidence regarding analytical validity but lacked a chain of evidence leading from
test results to clinical outcomes. Several publications have provided
methodological guidance for studying genomic tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup> GM has some characteristics that may require more
complex analyses than other types of interventions (e.g., analyzing the impact of
inherited mutations on family members), although conventional study designs can
still be used. Using established methods could reduce concerns that GM is subject
to higher evidence standards than other interventions.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Include outcomes that matter to patients</title>
<p>For genomic tests to become routine practice, using them should favorably impact
outcomes that matter to patients. To determine whether GM is fulfilling its
promise, patient-centered CER should compare GM tests plus non-GM risk assessment
versus non-GM risk assessment alone, other GM tests, or both. Research team
leaders should use real-world settings and seek advice from patients about which
outcomes matter most.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Use consistent and unbiased study methods</title>
<p>In the future, the evidence for individualized patient care will increasingly come
from statistically reliable subgroup analyses derived from patient-level
meta-analyses. These meta-analyses require many large, high-quality studies. Some
evidence gaps in the systematic reviews were due to poor-quality research that
could not support any conclusions. Moreover, the studies used diverse study
designs, tests, study populations, and outcome measures, which would make it
difficult to draw conclusions from a pooled study population. To raise the
standard of evidence, GM researchers should cooperate to establish study quality
standards.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Keep pace with technology changes</title>
<p>As GM evolves beyond single-gene tests, CER studies must keep pace. Only two of
our systematic reviews covered multigene tests, WES, and WGS. Multigene tests are
complex and evolving. A recent National Academy of Medicine report noted the
obstacles and recommended several approaches to address them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup> Tumor-agnostic, biomarker-driven clinical
trials such as NCI-MATCH, SWOG’s LUNG-MAP, and the American Society of
Clinical Oncology’s TAPUR are evidence of progress. Recent publications
about WES in rare diseases, cancer, and complex disorders suggest the need to
address current evidence gaps about personal and clinical utility
soon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our review suggests opportunities to close important evidence gaps about using
genomic tests; however, additional methods-development work is needed.
Methodological topics that need ongoing stakeholder-informed dialogue include the
following.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Patient preferences</title>
<p>The purpose of CER is to design and conduct studies that meet the information
needs of patients, clinicians, and policymakers facing decisions. Engaging these
stakeholders as partners in all phases of the research process should ensure that
future CER meets their information needs. Meaningful engagement of patients in GM
CER will require attention to numeracy and genetic literacy and the willingness to
engage in shared decision-making about performing genomic tests and their
interpretation. For example, noninvasive prenatal screening tests for fetal
chromosomal abnormalities (i.e., trisomy 21, 18, and 13) have become standard
clinical practice on the basis of their clinical validity and private insurer
coverage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> However, questions
remain about whether clinicians and patients fully understand the risks and
benefits of using these tests, which also detect sex chromosome aneuploidies and
microdeletions, as compared to alternative screening methods that do not detect
them. Also, we lack research about how patients and clinicians make decisions
after positive test results and about between-partner concordance about pregnancy
termination decisions in patient subgroups stratified by maternal risk, race,
ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref></sup> Another issue is that outcomes of WES and WGS
may lead to gains in well-being that go beyond the impact on morbidity and
mortality (e.g., reassurance or providing a diagnosis for an untreatable
condition).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> GM tests may also
harm. CER questions to address might include whether WES tests increase personal
well-being beyond conventional testing and genetic counseling and under what
circumstances. The answers to these questions might inform the debate about
whether to consider personal utility when developing practice guidelines and
coverage policies.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Behavior change strategies</title>
<p>Changing risky behaviors is difficult, and the motivation to change is part of the
problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> Of particular relevance
to common, chronic conditions is whether current risk assessment approaches such
as obtaining family histories are sufficient or whether taking the next step and
performing genetic testing lead to better health outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> In the field of cardiovascular disease, CER
questions involve the following: the net benefits to patients, families, and
society from adding genetic information on cardiovascular disease to conventional
risk assessment approaches, such as family risk history and clinical risk scores,
and whether providing genetic information in addition to information about
smoking, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia leads to adopting a healthier
lifestyle or more comprehensive preventive therapy and, ultimately, better cardiac
outcomes. Trials to date have shown little or no effect on health-risk
behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Value</title>
<p>With decreasing costs of next-generation sequencing, proponents of multigene
panels have argued that it is more efficient to test for multiple mutations
simultaneously rather than to conduct multiple single-gene tests. High-quality
evidence is lacking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref></sup> Advocates for
using multigene panels for tumor profiling argue that future treatment advances
depend on an understanding of tumor biology gained through tumor biomarker panels,
not conventional classifications based on tumor histology, grade, and
stage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref></sup> Key questions include the
optimal gene panel size, how to select treatments based on presumed driver
mutations, and the role of tumor genome heterogeneity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref></sup> CER could address the key question regarding how often
patients are matched to potential treatments using large, tumor-agnostic multigene
panels and the clinical outcomes versus tumor-specific single-gene testing and
clinical factors alone.</p>
<p>Our study had limitations. We examined systematic reviews rather than individual
CER studies, and we selected systematic reviews commissioned or conducted by TAGs.
Thus, our results do not represent the entire universe of CER studies of GM. This
strategy did mean that experienced teams of systematic reviewers performed the
included reviews using standardized definitions of study quality, which was
important to one of our principal goals: to form credible judgment regarding the
quality of CER for GM. Although the TWG found the conclusions of the reviews to be
representative of the broader literature, we did not systematically search for
recent articles on these topics. Although we included a range of TAGs in our
search, 2 of them (AHRQ and BCBSA TEC) produced all but 2 of the 21 included
systematic reviews and therefore provide a predominately United
States–focused perspective. Finally, to address our study objectives, we had
to categorize and summarize across disparate reviews and augment the review
findings with expert opinions. Therefore, readers should not consider our results
definitive. Still, the included systematic reviews cover most of the spectrum of
clinical topics addressed by GM. Future research should examine the
cost-effectiveness and budget impact and how evidence can be aligned with the
current use of tests in the best way possible.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings can inform decisions about where to focus future
research and policy initiatives. Over the next few decades, patients, clinicians,
and policymakers will be asking whether the added information provided by GM leads
to better health outcomes than using conventional clinical information, such as
family history and non-GM tests. CER is the research design for answering these
questions.</p>
