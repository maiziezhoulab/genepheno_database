<abstract>
<p>Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by growth of benign tumors (hamartomas) in multiple organs, especially the kidneys, brain, heart, lungs, and skin. Tuberous sclerosis complex is usually caused by a mutation in either the <italic>tuberous sclerosis complex 1</italic> or <italic>tuberous sclerosis complex 2</italic> gene, resulting in constitutive activation of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. Currently, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors are recommended in adult patients with tuberous sclerosis complex for the treatment of asymptomatic, growing renal angiomyolipoma that are &gt;3 cm in diameter and pediatric or adult patients with brain lesions (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma) that either are growing or are not amenable to surgical resection. Clinical evidence suggests that systemic administration of a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor may provide concurrent improvements in multiple lesions and symptoms of tuberous sclerosis complex. With the major paradigm shift in consensus guidelines toward screening at diagnosis and ongoing monitoring and with the recent availability of an effective oral treatment, it is important that nephrologists have a thorough understanding of our role in the management of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. Because the various manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex typically emerge at different periods during patients’ lifetimes, patients will need to be followed throughout their lives. Unlike brain and cardiac lesions, renal lesions are more likely to emerge as patients age and can grow at any time. Considerations regarding long-term medication administration for the potential control of multiple tuberous sclerosis complex manifestations will need to be addressed; these include the most appropriate starting dose, appropriate doses for tumor shrinkage versus prevention of regrowth, and management of adverse events. Best practices and potential obstacles for nephrologists treating patients with tuberous sclerosis complex who have multiple manifestations are considered.</p>
