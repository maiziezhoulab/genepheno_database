<abstract>
<p>Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a fatal congenital heart disease in which the left side of the heart is underdeveloped, impairing the systemic circulation. Underdeveloped left ventricle exerts biomechanical stress on the right ventricle that can progress into heart failure. Genome-wide transcriptome changes have been identified at early stages in the right ventricle (RV) of infants with HLHS, although the molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the RNA binding protein Rbfox2, which is mutated in HLHS patients, is a contributor to transcriptome changes in HLHS patient RVs. Our results indicate that majority of transcripts differentially expressed in HLHS patient hearts have validated Rbfox2 binding sites. We show that Rbfox2 regulates mRNA levels of targets with 3’UTR binding sites contributing to aberrant gene expression in HLHS patients. Strikingly, the Rbfox2 nonsense mutation identified in HLHS patients truncates the protein, impairs its subcellular distribution and adversely affects its function in RNA metabolism. Overall, our findings uncover a novel role for Rbfox2 in controlling transcriptome in HLHS.</p>

<body>
<p>Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is one of the least understood, fatal congenital heart diseases that affects 1 in 4,344 newborns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Infants with HLHS suffer from varying degrees of hypoplasia of the left ventricle (LV), left atrium (LA), and ascending aorta, closing or narrowing of mitral, and aortic valves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. HLHS patients need three stages of surgery or cardiac transplantation to reestablish the systemic circulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Even post-surgery, patients are at high risk to develop right ventricle (RV) failure and/or abnormal heart rhythm due to hypoxic conditions, pressure and volume overload<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Mechanisms leading to the progression of RV overload into RV failure are largely unknown. Aberrant alternative splicing (AS) patterns and mRNA levels have been identified in HLHS RVs obtained at early stages during Stage 1 Norwood surgery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Identification of early changes in HLHS RV will help better understand the progression of RV overload into heart failure and also help determine novel biomarkers for RV failure in HLHS patients.</p>
<p>Although genome-wide gene expression changes were identified in HLHS patient RVs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, the molecular events responsible for aberrant transcriptome in HLHS patients are unclear. Therefore, there is a pressing need to determine such mechanisms to better understand HLHS RV pathogenesis and identify novel targets for potential therapy options.</p>
<p>The RNA binding protein Rbfox2 has been recently identified as a major risk allele for HLHS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In a large cohort of congenital heart disease patients, three <italic>de novo</italic> detrimental Rbfox2 mutations significantly associated with HLHS phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Rbfox2 belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins with affinity for (U)GCAUG rich sequences, which are highly conserved among vertebrates in both sequence and position<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Rbfox2 binding targets were identified in mouse and human ES cells and 293T cells using cross-linking immunoprecipitation followed by RNA-sequencing (CLIP-seq) analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Rbfox2 controls alternative splicing (AS) events critical for the survival of ES cells, differentiation of pluripotent stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and during epithelial-mesenchymal transition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Conditional deletion of Rbfox2 in the cerebellum leads to AS and developmental defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Knockdown of both Rbfox2 and its paralog Rbfox1 in zebrafish lowers heart rate and causes myofibrillar disarray<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Downregulation of Rbfox2 is associated with pressure overload induced heart failure in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Our results indicate that Rbfox2 is also involved in diabetic heart disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>; suggesting an important role for Rbfox2 in human heart diseases.</p>
<p>In this study, we provide evidence that Rbfox2 has a role in HLHS pathogenesis. We demonstrate that HLHS patient specific mutation in Rbfox2 induces a dramatic change in Rbfox2 protein subcellular localization and affects its function in RNA splicing. In the future, our findings may allow identification of innovative therapy strategies such as the use of modified oligos or small molecules to restore Rbfox2 function in patients with HLHS.</p>

<title>Rbfox2 undergoes changes in HLHS patients’ right ventricles</title>
<p>To determine regulators that account for abnormal gene expression in HLHS patient RVs, we focused on the RNA binding protein Rbfox2, because it was identified as a major risk allele for HLHS using a large cohort of congenital heart disease patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Rbfox2 mutations were significantly associated with HLHS among other congenital heart defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. HLHS specific Rbfox2 mutations (splice site, nonsense and frameshift) are predicted to either target Rbfox2 mRNA for degradation (data not shown) or truncate the protein removing a portion of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Splice site mutation is expected to cause inclusion of ~1.6 kb intron 10 and likely degradation of Rbfox2 mRNA by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Frameshift mutation is also predicted to introduce a stop codon immediately after the mutation potentially leading to NMD. Nonsense Rbfox2 mutation is expected to remove a small portion of the CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Notably, the CTD of Rbfox2 is necessary for interactions of Rbfox2 with several RNA binding proteins and spliceosome component U1C and localization to the nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p>
<p>We first checked Rbfox2 mRNA levels in HLHS patient hearts by real time qRT-PCR using gene specific primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). No change in mRNA levels of Rbfox2 was identified in HLHS patient hearts in comparison to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). To investigate if there are any changes in protein levels, we analyzed protein lysates from human HLHS patient and control hearts by Western blot (WB) using commercially available Rbfox2 antibody. A striking ~3KDa change in MW of Rbfox2 protein was observed in HLHS patient hearts in comparison to control hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). We also tested whether Rbfox1, a family member of Rbfox2, is affected in HLHS patient hearts. Rbfox1 is expressed and dynamically regulated in developing postnatal hearts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Rbfox1 protein was modestly downregulated (1.5 fold change) in HLHS patient hearts without a change in its MW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). To further investigate the change in MW of Rbfox2, we assessed Rbfox2 protein pattern on 2-dimensional (2D) gels followed by WB. 2D/WB analysis of Rbfox2 indicates that not only the MW but also the isoelectric point (pI) of Rbfox2 was altered in HLHS patient hearts. Control human heart lysates displayed three Rbfox2 specific spots with a pI of ~6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, bottom panel). These spots were barely detectable in HLHS hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, top panel). Strikingly, four spots with lower molecular weight and more basic pI (pH ~7 to 8) were predominant in HLHS patient heart lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>, top panel; marked with arrows). Proteins can become basic pI when they lose post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. We have shown that Rbfox2 is regulated in a PKC-dependent manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Thus, we tested whether PKCα/β is altered in HLHS patients that could explain changes in Rbfox2 protein levels. There was no obvious change in PKCα/β protein levels or activation status in HLHS patient hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and data not shown). These results suggest that changes in Rbfox2 in HLHS patient hearts are independent of PKCα/β.</p>
<p>Since Rbfox2 has several spliced variants including a dominant negative (DN) isoform that has a lower molecular weight due to the exclusion of exon 6, which encodes a large portion of the RNA recognition domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, we tested whether the lower migrating isoform of Rbfox2 protein is the DN isoform. DN Rbfox2 expression was determined by qRT-PCR in HLHS patient hearts using primers to detect exon 6 inclusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1e</xref> shows that there was no difference in Rbfox2 DN expression level in HLHS patients versus control hearts indicating that the low MW isoform present in HLHS patients is not the DN isoform of Rbfox2.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Subcellular distribution of Rbfox2 protein is altered in HLHS patient right ventricles</title>
<p>Since Rbfox2 HLHS specific nonsense mutation is expected to truncate the protein potentially affecting its nuclear localization, we checked Rbfox2 subcellular distribution in HLHS patient RVs. Neonatal patient hearts with Tetratology of Fallot (TOF) were used as controls for evaluating HLHS specific changes independent of hemodynamic effects on systemic RV dysfunction. Rat newborn and adult, mouse embryonic and human adult hearts were also used as additional controls for determining Rbfox2 localization because of the difficulty in obtaining heart biopsy samples from healthy infants. DAPI/TO-PRO-3 was used to mark the nucleus and cardiac troponin I to mark cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Using frozen heart sections, we found that Rbfox2 was localized both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes in control RVs obtained from infants with TOF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, top panel). In contrast, Rbfox2 was predominantly cytoplasmic in punctate bodies with barely detectable levels in the nucleus of cardiomyocytes in HLHS patient RVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, lower panel). Rbfox2 was localized to both nucleus and cytoplasm in rat (newborn and adult), mouse (embryonic) and human (adult) hearts but more prominently in the nucleus of rat newborn and adult hearts and embryonic mouse hearts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). These results combined with our observation on WB and 2D/WB indicate that Rbfox2 protein displayed a lower MW and localized predominantly in the cytoplasm of HLHS patient RVs in contrast to the pattern in control RVs.</p>
<p>To test the effect of HLHS specific mutations on Rbfox2 expression, localization and function, we generated a nonsense mutant of GFP-tagged Rbfox2 based on the mutations identified in HLHS patients. We expressed either wild type (WT) or HLHS specific nonsense mutant of GFP-Rbfox2 in COS M6 cells. WT Rbfox2 was mostly nuclear whereas HLHS specific Rbfox2 nonsense mutant was predominantly cytoplasmic in punctate bodies around the nuclear envelope resembling its pattern seen in HLHS patient hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>
<italic>vs</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2a</xref>). HLHS specific nonsense Rbfox2 mutant displayed a lower MW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>) as predicted based on the mutation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Nonsense mutant of Rbfox2, which lacks a portion of the CTD that has a nuclear localization signal and binding sites for splicing regulators, was unable to control alternative splicing of its target <italic>Ank2</italic> as efficiently as WT Rbfox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In summary, HLHS patient specific nonsense mutation affects the subcellular localization of Rbfox2 impacting its nuclear function in RNA splicing.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>A significant number of transcripts altered in HLHS patient hearts are Rbfox2 targets</title>
<p>Because Rbfox2 protein was mostly cytoplasmic in HLHS patient RVs, we tested whether transcripts differentially expressed in HLHS RVs are Rbfox2 targets. We used HLHS patient exon array data to extract genomic locations for differentially expressed transcripts in HLHS patient hearts. Using the available HLHS patient exon array data, we extracted sequences for differentially expressed genes in HLHS patient hearts. These sequences were mapped to the human genome to access Rbfox2 CLIP-binding density information<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Rbfox2 CLIP-seq analysis was performed in human ESCs and Rbfox2 binding clusters were found to be statistically significant in 85% of the binding sites identified when compared to the rest of the genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Our analysis of 1348 transcripts (623 genes) that are differentially expressed in HLHS patients revealed that 69.4% of the transcripts contain statistically significant Rbfox2 CLIP-peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We used genes that are not significantly affected in HLHS patients as controls for this analysis. Consistent with its function in AS regulation, 934 transcripts exhibited significant Rbfox2-CLIP clusters in intronic and/or exonic regions of the differentially expressed transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Rbfox2 binding sites were mostly enriched in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of 38.8% of the total transcripts analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). When genes with Rbfox2 binding sites were categorized based on their biological function using DAVID server (whole genome was used as a background control), the top statistically significant groups were RNA/protein metabolic processes and cell cycle in agreement with the previous findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that a large portion of transcripts modulated in HLHS patients are previously identified Rbfox2 targets that have important roles in cell cycle and RNA/protein metabolism.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Rbfox2 controls mRNA levels that are affected in HLHS patients’ right ventricles</title>
<p>To validate transcriptome changes, we used HLHS patient RV biopsy samples obtained at early stages during Stage 1 surgery. HLHS patients LVs, which are severely underdeveloped and undergone decompensation, were excluded for our analyses. Using RNA from RV heart biopsy samples, we validated mRNA levels of 5 genes (<italic>Pnn, Spcs1, Ddx39, Mcm7, Phkb</italic>) that were identified as the top changers in HLHS patient RV transcriptome analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Functions of these genes are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Importantly, all 5 mRNAs displayed Rbfox2 binding sites in their 3′UTRs. For real time RT-PCR analysis, 3 different internal controls with similar results were obtained, so the results from one of the internal controls (DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB1 (<italic>Polr2a</italic>)) were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>. <italic>Pnn, Spcs1, Ddx39, Mcm7</italic> and <italic>Phkb</italic> mRNAs were downregulated in HLHS patient RVs when compared to control RVs obtained from Tetralogy of Fallot patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, black bar <italic>vs</italic> white bar). To determine if Rbfox2 regulates mRNA levels of putative targets altered in HLHS, we ectopically expressed Flag tagged wild type Rbfox2 (Rbfox2<sup>WT</sup>) or RNA binding deficient mutant (Rbfox2<sup>DD</sup>). We chose COS M6 cells for this study, as endogenous Rbfox2 levels are very low in COS M6 cells and should not interfere with the overexpressed Rbfox2 proteins. Expression of Flag-Rbfox2<sup>WT</sup> increased mRNA levels of <italic>Pnn</italic>, <italic>Phkb</italic>, and <italic>Spcs1</italic> significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>; white <italic>vs</italic> black bars). Expression of the RNA binding deficient mutant of Rbfox2 (Rbfox2<sup>DD</sup>) did not affect mRNA levels of <italic>Pnn, Phkb</italic> and <italic>Spcs1</italic> demonstrating that Rbfox2 binding ability is necessary to regulate mRNA levels of these putative targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>; white <italic>vs</italic> gray bars). <italic>Ddx39</italic> mRNA levels were undetectable in these cells. <italic>Mcm7</italic> mRNA levels were unaffected in Rbfox2 expressing cells suggesting that change in <italic>Mcm7</italic> mRNA levels in HLHS patients are independent of Rbfox2 (data not shown). Rbfox2<sup>DD</sup> was generated by mutating 2 critical phenylalanine residues in the RNA recognition motif essential for RNA binding activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Rbfox2<sup>WT</sup> and Rbfox2<sup>DD</sup> mutant proteins were expressed at similar levels in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Importantly, Flag-Rbfox2<sup>WT</sup> protein was not only nuclear but also cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>) consistent with an increase in mRNA levels of its putative targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Cytoplasmic fractions were free from nuclear contamination as hnRNPC was only present in the nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). These findings indicate that Rbfox2 controls mRNA levels of targets with 3′UTR binding sites and RNA-binding activity of Rbfox2 is necessary for regulation of mRNA levels. Overall, we find that Rbfox2 protein localization and function is disrupted in HLHS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>HLHS is one of the most complex and challenging congenital heart diseases. In HLHS patients, the left side of the heart cannot support blood flow to the organs due to severe hypoplasia. Without surgical intervention and/or cardiac transplantation, HLHS can be fatal within the first hours or days after birth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Post-surgery, the RV takes over the LV function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Pressure and volume overload on the RV can lead to heart failure and arrhythmias at post-natal stages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Mutations in certain genes are identified in HLHS patient tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, yet underlying genetic, molecular and cellular events responsible for HLHS RV pathogenesis are not well understood. Detrimental Rbfox2 mutations have been identified and significantly associated with HLHS phenotype in a recent large human genetic study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Our studies show that Rbfox2 nonsense mutation identified in HLHS patients alters proper localization of Rbfox2 in the cell and adversely affects its role in RNA metabolism contributing to early transcriptome changes in HLHS patients. Here, we show that 936 differentially expressed transcripts identified in the RV of infants with HLHS have Rbfox2 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that Rbfox2 that is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm in HLHS patient hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Rbfox2 has many isoforms generated through alternative promoter usage and AS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, especially a dominant negative isoform that lacks RNA binding activity and possesses inhibitory splicing activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Our findings demonstrate that Rbfox2 isoform expressed in HLHS is not the dominant negative version with inhibitory splicing function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). We find that Rbfox2 has a different pI in HLHS patient hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). We show that HLHS specific nonsense mutation truncates Rbfox2 protein at the CTD modulating its cellular distribution and function similar to its pattern observed in HLHS patient RVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,d</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results provide new insights into HLHS pathogenesis by identifying Rbfox2 as a contributor to gene expression changes in the RV of HLHS patients. By integrating Rbfox2 CLIP-sequencing and HLHS patient transcriptome data, we determined Rbfox2 binding sites on 69% of 1348 transcripts that undergo changes in HLHS patient RVs and 38.8% of these transcripts have binding sites within 3′UTRs. We found that Rbfox2 regulated genes have functions in cell cycle and macromolecular metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). We tested mRNA levels of five putative Rbfox2 targets with Rbfox2 binding sites in their 3′UTRs because they were altered the most in HLHS patient RVs. These target genes are implicated in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, processes thought to be dysregulated in HLHS. <italic>Pnn</italic> encodes for pinin protein that plays a crucial role in small intestinal development by influencing epithelial cell differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. <italic>Phkb</italic> encodes for glycogen phosphorylase kinase that is important for glycogen breakdown and cell growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Ddx39 is an RNA helicase that regulates the switch between cellular proliferation and differentiation in Xenopus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. MCM7 is important for DNA replication and cell growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. These findings suggest that Rbfox2 contributes to cardiac transcriptome changes in HLHS patients by affecting mRNA levels of genes involved in cell cycle and metabolism.</p>
<p>While Rbfox2 function in AS is well-characterized, its function in other aspects of mRNA metabolism is largely unknown. Our results reveal a new role for Rbfox2 in controlling mRNA levels in the heart. In support of our findings, Rbfox1, one of the Rbfox family members, has recently been found to regulate mRNA stability and translation in the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Our data show that there is only modest downregulation of Rbfox1 protein in HLHS patient RVs. In summary, our results demonstrate that Rbfox2 nonsense mutation identified in HLHS patients alters its localization and function contributing to aberrant transcriptome changes of its targets in HLHS patients.</p>

<title>Rbfox2 CLIP cluster identification on transcripts altered in HLHS patients</title>
<p>Genomic sequences for 1348 probe locations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> were extracted using the online Galaxy ‘Fetch sequence’ tool with the criterion that the sequence length is between 20 nt and 2.5 kb. Each genomic location was extended by 500 nt upstream and downstream before mapping Rbfox2 CLIP-clusters obtained from human ESC cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Each of the sequences were further analyzed and categorized based on statistically significant CLIP-clusters present in exon, intron and UTR regions of RNAs.</p>
