<abstract>
<p>Glucocerebrosidase <italic>(GBA1</italic>) gene mutations increase the risk of Parkinson disease (PD). While the cellular mechanisms associating <italic>GBA1</italic> mutations and PD are unknown, loss of the glucocerebrosidase enzyme (GCase) activity, inhibition of autophagy and increased α-synuclein levels have been implicated. Here we show that autophagy lysosomal reformation (ALR) is compromised in cells lacking functional GCase. ALR is a cellular process controlled by mTOR which regenerates functional lysosomes from autolysosomes formed during macroautophagy. A decrease in phopho-S6K levels, a marker of mTOR activity, was observed in models of GCase deficiency, including primary mouse neurons and the PD patient derived fibroblasts with <italic>GBA1</italic> mutations, suggesting that ALR is compromised. Importantly Rab7, a GTPase crucial for endosome-lysosome trafficking and ALR, accumulated in GCase deficient cells, supporting the notion that lysosomal recycling is impaired. Recombinant GCase treatment reversed ALR inhibition and lysosomal dysfunction. Moreover, ALR dysfunction was accompanied by impairment of macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy, increased levels of total and phosphorylated (S129) monomeric α-synuclein, evidence of amyloid oligomers and increased α-synuclein release. Concurrently, we found increased cholesterol and altered glucosylceramide homeostasis which could compromise ALR. We propose that GCase deficiency in PD inhibits lysosomal recycling. Consequently neurons are unable to maintain the pool of mature and functional lysosomes required for the autophagic clearance of α-synuclein, leading to the accumulation and spread of pathogenic α-synuclein species in the brain. Since GCase deficiency and lysosomal dysfunction occur with ageing and sporadic PD pathology, the decrease in lysosomal reformation may be a common feature in PD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gaucher disease (GD), the most common lysosomal disease, is caused by homozygous mutations in the <italic>glucocerebrosidase 1 (GBA1)</italic> gene which encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase). GCase is responsible for the conversion of glucosylceramide to glucose and ceramide in the lysosome. Deficiency in GCase activity leads to accumulation of its substrate in the lysosome and compromised lysosomal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>The pathology of Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by loss of substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons with the formation of α-synuclein-rich Lewy bodies in surviving neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B3">3</xref>). A subset of GD patients and <italic>GBA1</italic> mutation carriers are at high risk of developing PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B4">4–7</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>GBA1</italic> gene are numerically the most important genetic risk factor for developing PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B8">8</xref>). The patients with PD with <italic>GBA1</italic> mutations have similar clinical features and pathology to sporadic PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B9">9</xref>), except there is an earlier age of onset (about 5 years) and increased cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B8">8–10</xref>). The biochemical link between <italic>GBA1</italic> mutations and PD was established with the identification of GCase deficiency in PD brains positive for these mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B11">11</xref>). This deficiency was most pronounced in the substantia nigra and other midbrain areas, sites of the greatest pathology in PD. Of particular importance was the demonstration that there was evidence of significant GCase deficiency in sporadic PD brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B11">11–13</xref>) suggesting loss of enzyme activity is central to PD pathogenesis. Loss of GCase activity has been shown to promote α-synuclein accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B14">14–17</xref>) and mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B19">19</xref>). However, the mechanism by which GCase deficiency leads to α-synuclein accumulation is still unclear.</p>
<p>GCase deficiency and the subsequent accumulation of its substrate affect lipid metabolism and trafficking, decreases lysosomal degradation capacity and impairs autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B5">5</xref>). The autophagy – lysosomal pathway (ALP) is important in the clearance of α-synuclein and the impairment of both macroautophagy and chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA) have been linked to PD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B20">20–23</xref>).</p>
<p>Since lysosomes are the primary degradative compartment of the cell, their biogenesis and recycling are vital for cellular function. Lysosome biogenesis requires the endosomal system to direct newly synthesized lysosomal proteins to the lysosome. Lysosomal targeted substrates pass through different endosomal intermediaries to reach their final destination. Endosomes mature from early endosomes (Rab5 positive) to late endosomes (Rab7 positive) which then fuse with the lysosome, delivering the cargo. This process is important for delivery of essential proteins for lysosomal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B24">24</xref>). Recently Yu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B25">25</xref>) described lysosomal reformation following autophagy termination; this pathway is used to recycle autolysosomes in order to maintain the cellular pool of dense and functional lysosomes. After the degradation of the autolysosomal products by autophagy, mTOR is reactivated leading to the attenuation of autophagy and to the formation of proto-lysosomal tubules and vesicles that are ultimately excluded from the autolysosomes and mature into functional lysosomes, in a process dependent of Rab7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B25">25</xref>). This process, termed autophagy lysosome reformation (ALR), was found to be inhibited in fibroblasts derived from patients with the lysosomal storage disorders Scheie syndrome and Fabry disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationship between loss of GCase activity in the lysosome and PD is not yet fully understood. Here we describe for the first time the importance of GCase in lysosomal reformation. We show that GCase deficient cells exhibit altered lysosomal recycling, and propose that the accumulation of defective lysosomes contributes to autophagy impairment and accumulation of α-synuclein.</p>

<title>GCase deficiency affects lysosomal recycling in <italic>Gba1</italic> knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and in patient derived fibroblasts with <italic>GBA1</italic> mutations</title>
<p><italic>Gba1</italic> wild-type (WT), heterozygote (HET) and knockout (KO) MEFs were generated from <italic>Gba1</italic> transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B26">26</xref>). As expected <italic>Gba1</italic> HET cells had significantly decreased GCase activity (27% decrease, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05), compared to WT, while <italic>Gba1</italic> KO presented minimal activity (3% residual activity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F1">Figure 1A</xref>) . The activities or expression of other lysosomal proteins were also affected. β-hexosaminidase was unaffected in <italic>Gba1</italic> KO but was significantly decreased (20%, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05) in <italic>Gba1</italic> HET cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F1">Figure 1B</xref>). β-galactosidase activity was increased in both <italic>Gba1</italic> HET (72%, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.005) and <italic>Gba1</italic> KO cells (75%, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Mature cathepsin D protein levels (∼ 28 kDa) were increased in both <italic>Gba1</italic> HET (88%, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05) and KO (53%, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.01) compared to <italic>Gba1</italic> WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F1">Figure 1D</xref>). No changes were detected in cathepsin D mRNA levels (<italic>Gba1</italic> WT, 0.067 ± 0.03; <italic>Gba1</italic> KO, 0.060 ± 0.03; <italic>Gba1</italic> HET, 0.049 ± 0.02). LAMP1 protein levels were unaffected in <italic>Gba1</italic> HET and <italic>Gba1</italic> KO MEFs compared to <italic>Gba1</italic> WT (<italic>Gba1</italic> HET 116.3 ± 10.4%, <italic>Gba1</italic> KO 127.2 ± 50.6%). Lipidomic analysis revealed an accumulation of several glucosylceramide species in <italic>Gba1</italic> KO and <italic>Gba1</italic> HET cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddw185/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. SI 1</ext-link>).

</p>
<p>The lysosomal dysfunction detected could be related to the accumulation of dysfunctional lysosomes due to impaired lysosomal recycling via ALR. The recycling process is regulated by activation of mTOR, and is measured via phosphorylation of its substrate p70S6Kinase (phopho-S6K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>We analyzed ALR in the <italic>Gba1</italic> deficient MEFs. Under basal conditions (CTR), <italic>Gba1</italic> KO and <italic>Gba1</italic> HET displayed decreased levels of phopho-S6K compared to <italic>Gba1</italic> WT (respectively 47%, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.01, and 50%, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Similar to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B25">25</xref>), starvation for 2 h inhibited mTOR resulting in undetectable levels of phospho-S6K (data not shown). After being fed with fresh complete media and incubated for 1h (recovery), phopho-S6K was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F2">Figure 2A</xref>), with once again less in GCase deficient cells compared to WT. When cells recovered for an extra hour (2h starvation followed by 2h recovery) phospho-S6K/S6K levels were similar to initial CTR conditions (<italic>Gba1</italic> WT, 1.12 ± 0.20; <italic>Gba1</italic> KO, 0.76 ± 0.12; <italic>Gba1</italic> HET, 0.65 ± 0.11).

The percentage of recovery was similar between all cell lines (40-50% increase compared with basal) however the levels of phopho-S6K were consistently lower in <italic>Gba1</italic> KO and <italic>Gba1</italic> HET cells.

</p>
<p>Analysis of phopho-S6K levels in a human patient-derived fibroblasts with homozygous and heterozygotic <italic>GBA1</italic> mutations, confirmed that <italic>GBA1</italic> deficient human fibroblasts had significantly reduced phopho-S6K levels under basal conditions (55% decrease in GBA deficient cells, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F2">Figure 2B</xref>) similar to <italic>Gba1</italic> deficient MEFs.</p>
<p>To verify that decreased phopho-S6K was due to lack of GCase activity we treated <italic>Gba1</italic> WT, KO and HET MEFs with imiglucerase (Cerezyme) which is used for therapeutic enzyme replacement of GCase in GD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B2">2</xref>). Cerezyme (CER) treatment significantly increased GCase activity in <italic>Gba1</italic> KO and HET cells (<italic>Gba1</italic> WT 11.63 ± 1.69 nmol/h/mg; <italic>Gba1</italic> WT + CER 13.10 ± 2.37; <italic>Gba1</italic> KO 0.83 ± 0.18; <italic>Gba1</italic> KO + CER 3.04 ± 0.07 <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001; <italic>Gba1</italic> HET 9.31 ± 0.77; <italic>Gba1</italic> HET + CER 11.2 ± 0.22; <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05 (<italic>n =</italic> 3)). Cerezyme treatment significantly increased phospho-S6K levels in <italic>Gba1</italic> WT (34%, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05), <italic>Gba1</italic> KO (34%, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05) and <italic>Gba1</italic> HET (72%, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F2">Figure 2C</xref>), corroborating the direct relation between the loss of GCase activity and the decreased mTOR activity.</p>
<p>Alterations in lysosomal pH can lead to the changes in lysosomal function and in the lysosomal reformation process. The amount of acidic/functional lysosomes in the <italic>Gba1</italic> deficient cells was analysed using the Lyso ID probe. A significant decrease in acidic vesicles in both <italic>Gba1</italic> KO (67% ± 20.99, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.01) and <italic>Gba1</italic> HET (40.9% ± 13.57, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001) was detected, when compared to <italic>Gba1</italic> WT MEF. This was not accompanied by alteration in lysosomal morphology or localization (data not shown). Treatment with Cerezyme resulted in a tendency to increase the acidic vesicles in the case of <italic>Gba1</italic> WT and <italic>Gba1</italic> KO (110% ± 16.96 and 82% ± 29.39) and <italic>Gba1</italic> HET (77% ± 20.93, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.01) suggesting that GCase deficiency may be responsible for the lysosomal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F2">Figure 2D and E</xref>).</p>
<p>ALR impairment could be a consequence of the decreased lysosomal acidification, thus, we treated <italic>Gba1</italic> WT, KO and HET with 100nM of bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1) for 2h, which inhibits vacuolar H <sup>+</sup> ATPase (V-ATPase) and increases lysosomal pH. Upon treatment with Baf A1, <italic>Gba1</italic> WT cells had a trend to decrease phopho-S6K levels whereas, in both <italic>Gba1</italic> HET and <italic>Gba1</italic> KO cells Baf A1 treatment significantly decreased phospho-S6K, when compared to untreated controls (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddw183/-/DC1">Fig. SI 2A</ext-link>). This suggests that lysosomal reformulation is affected by the alkalization of lysosomes.</p>

<title>Rab 7 accumulates on lysosomes in GCase deficient cells</title>
<p>The small GTP binding protein Rab7 has an important role in the maturation of endosomes and in the recycling of lysosomes by ALR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B27">27</xref>). Rab7 levels were significantly increased in <italic>Gba1</italic> KO MEFs (38%, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Rab7 mRNA levels were unchanged (<italic>Gba1</italic> WT, 0.06 ± 0.02; <italic>Gba1</italic> KO, 0.06 ± 0.01; <italic>Gba1</italic> HET, 0.04 ± 0.01). We analysed whether Rab7 was accumulating on the lysosomes of GCase deficient cells by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Rab7 staining was more punctate in GCase deficient cells, and appeared to have a greater perinuclear localisation. The co-localisation between Rab7 and cathepsin D in <italic>Gba1</italic> KO and HET cells was increased compared to <italic>Gba1</italic> WT cells (<italic>Gba1</italic> KO 161% ± 22.66; <italic>Gba1</italic> HET 126% ± 11.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F3">Figure 3B</xref>) suggesting slower lysosomal maturation/recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B28">28</xref>). Increased cholesterol is a marker of immature/dysfunctional lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B28">28</xref>). Total cholesterol levels in <italic>Gba1</italic> HET and KO cells were significantly increased (50%, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05 and 79%, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.01, respectively), compared to <italic>Gba1</italic> WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F3">Figure 3C</xref>).

<p>Lipidomic analysis also indicated that the cholesterol esters 15:1, 22:6 and 24:1 were significantly increased in <italic>Gba1</italic> KO cells by 4.8-fold (<italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001), 2.3-fold (<italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.01), and 3.8-fold (<italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.01), respectively, when compared to <italic>Gba1</italic> WT cells.

<p>To analyse whether decreasing cholesterol levels in <italic>Gba1</italic> HET and KO restored ALR, we treated cells with Lovastatin (10μM for 48h), an HMG-CoA reductase enzyme inhibitor known to inhibit cholesterol production.

This was the maximal dose and time before cell morphology and proliferation became affected.

<title>Impairment of protein degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy in GCase deficient MEFs</title>
<p>Impaired autophagy has also been linked to GCase deficiency, therefore we measured macroautophagy flux. LC3B-II protein level was analyzed in <italic>Gba1</italic> WT, KO and HET MEFs. There were no significant changes in LC3B-II protein levels under basal conditions in <italic>Gba1</italic> deficient cells compared to WT. Treatment with Baf A1 increased LC3B-II protein by a similar amount in all three cell lines, suggesting that there is not a significant effect on macroautophagy flux on these cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddw185/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. SI 3A</ext-link>). Despite this finding, ATG16L, an essential protein for autophagy initiation, was significantly decreased in <italic>Gba1</italic> KO (49%, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001) and <italic>Gba1</italic> HET (23%, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001) compared to <italic>Gba1</italic> WT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddw185/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. SI 3B</ext-link>). mRNA levels of ATG16L were unchanged (<italic>Gba1</italic> WT, 3.24E-3 ± 3.80E-4; <italic>Gba1</italic> HET, 2.87E-3 ± 2.63E-4; <italic>Gba1</italic> KO, 3.36E-3 ± 1.23E-3). Immunofluorescence analysis showed that upon starvation ATG16L staining became more punctate and the number of puncta increased in <italic>Gba1</italic> HET and <italic>Gba1</italic> KO cells compared to <italic>Gba1</italic> WT.

These results may suggest a subtle dysregulation of macroautophagy.</p>
<p>We also assessed CMA activity. By measuring the turnover of the well-characterized CMA substrate, GAPDH, following protein synthesis inhibition with cycloheximide (CHX) for 24h, we detected that GAPDH protein levels were significantly decreased by 49.6% in <italic>Gba1</italic> WT MEF following CHX treatment, whereas GAPDH protein levels in <italic>Gba1</italic> HET and <italic>Gba1</italic> KO MEF were similar to non-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F3">Figure 3D</xref>, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001). This suggests that in <italic>Gba1</italic> KO and HET, degradation via CMA is compromised. The protein levels of two key mediators of CMA, hsc70 and Lamp2a, were unchanged when compared to <italic>Gba1</italic> WT (Hsc70: <italic>Gba1</italic> HET, 108% ± 28.50; <italic>Gba1</italic> KO, 103% ± 27.70; Lamp2a: <italic>Gba1</italic> HET, 73% ± 15.00; <italic>Gba1</italic> KO, 78% ± 27.50).</p>

<title>Knockdown of GCase in SH-SY5Y cells affects lysosomal content and lysosomal recycling</title>
<p>To assess ALR and the turnover of α-synuclein we knocked-down (KD) GCase by siRNA in parental SH-SY5Y cells and SH-SY5Y over expressing human α-synuclein. GCase protein expression was decreased by 56 ± 6% following 10 days of KD with <italic>GBA1</italic> siRNA, when compared to cells treated with scrambled siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F4">Figure 4A</xref>). This resulted in a significant 70% decrease in GCase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The activities of the lysosomal enzymes β-hexosaminidase and β-galactosidase and the protein expression levels of mature cathepsin D protein and LAMP1 were all significantly increased in <italic>GBA1</italic> KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F4">Figure 4B–D</xref>).

To confirm that this was due to GCase deficiency, S6K phosphorylation was assessed in SH-SY5Y treated with the GCase inhibitor conduritol-β-epoxide (CBE; 10 μM). This concentration of CBE inhibited GCase activity by 92.0 ± 0.0% after 10 days of treatment (replenished every 3 days). Phospho-S6K was significantly decreased by 37% under basal (CTR) conditions in CBE-treated cells, and did not recover as much as untreated cells (SH-SY5Y) once starvation-induced autophagy had been removed for 1 h (REC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F5">Figure 5B</xref>).

<title>Impaired lysosomal recycling and α-synuclein accumulation in GCase deficient neurons</title>
<p>We treated WT neurons with CBE and analysed phopho-S6K levels to detect defects in the ALR in GCase deficient cortical neurons.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report that the inhibition of autophagy following GCase deficiency is due to loss of lysosomal biogenesis via ALR and the maturation of endosomes. These events occurred in several cellular models of heterozygous and homozygous GCase deficiency suggesting that this is a mechanism by which pathogenic α-synuclein species could accumulate in PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ddw185-F9">Figure 9</xref>).
<fig id="ddw185-F9" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Loss of lysosomal GCase causes impairment of ALR and maturation of endosomes, perhaps due to changes in lipids and/or cholesterol. Over time this leads to a decrease in the functional pool of lysosomes in the cell impairing autophagy and resulting in the cellular accumulation of α-synuclein and increased release of α-synuclein contributing to PD pathology.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ddw185f9"></graphic></fig>
</p>
<p>ALR is a vital process for the cell to restore its pool of functional lysosomes. This process is initiated upon attenuation of autophagy due to reactivation of mTOR, which was measured by the increased phosphorylation of S6K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B25">25</xref>). In all cases of GCase deficiency, phospho-S6K was decreased suggesting mTOR was less active in these cells. Upon starvation followed by recovery, phospho-S6K levels in GCase deficient cells remained lower than in controls. Therefore over time, repeated cycles of autophagy followed by ALR are going to result in less functional lysosomes in GCase deficient cells as evidenced by the decreased number of acidified lysosomes and expression and activity of other lysosomal enzymes. Neurons differentiated from iPSC with homozygote or heterozygote <italic>GBA1</italic> mutations have shown lysosomal dysfunction and impaired autophagy, with lysosomal cell content either increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B29">29</xref>) or decreasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B30">30</xref>). Notably, we report that ALR impairment and loss of acidic lysosomes could be reversed by treating cells with recombinant GCase (Cerezyme).</p>
<p>The GTPase Rab7 has an important role in endosome-lysosome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B31">31</xref>) and is also required to dissociate from autolysosomes for ALR to proceed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B25">25</xref>). In GCase deficient cells, we detected both an accumulation of Rab7 and increased co-localization with cathepsin D suggesting Rab7 does not dissociate from the autolysosomes as quickly as in control cells. Inhibition of ALR has been shown to increase Rab7 protein levels and have increased association with autolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B32">32</xref>). Furthermore, these same changes in Rab7 and the accumulation of cholesterol in late endosomes have also been associated with impaired maturation of lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B33">33</xref>). Dysregulation of Rab7 has been linked with mutations in the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (<italic>LRRK2</italic>) gene, which cause autosomal dominant PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B34">34–36</xref>), suggesting that impaired maturation of lysosomes and ALR could be a common mechanism in PD pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Specific lipids have been implicated in the maturation of endosomes and ALR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B33">33</xref>). Increased cholesterol also impairs the maturation of late endosomes to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B37">37</xref>). Therefore, changes in glucosylceramide or other lipid and sterol species as a result of GCase deficiency may contribute to the decrease in lysosomal maturation and ALR. ALR inhibition has also been reported to occur in fibroblasts with saposin c deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B38">38</xref>). Saposin c is a cofactor for GCase and saposin c deficiency in these cells resulted in accumulation of glucosylceramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B38">38</xref>). Inhibition of GCase with CBE, or administration of exogenous glucosylceramide, increases cholesterol, inhibits endosomal degradation and alkalizes endosomes/lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B39">39</xref>). Corroborating our data, two studies showed cholesterol accumulation in patient derived skin fibroblasts bearing GCase mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B41">41</xref>).</p>
<p>As cholesterol accumulated in our models we studied whether decreasing cholesterol levels, using Lovastatin, a drug widely used to treat hypercholesterolaemia, would restore ALR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B42">42</xref>). We did not detect a restoration of ALR in <italic>Gba1</italic> KO and HET cells when cholesterol levels were lowered, although the maximum non-toxic dose of Lovastatin was unable to restore levels back to normal. Statins such as Lovastatin have wide range of effects in the cells, not only decreasing cholesterol levels but affecting other pathways including activation of AKT in neurons. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B43">43</xref>). AKT is known to be upstream of mTOR. While total cellular cholesterol levels are reduced by Lovastatin, we cannot exclude the possibility that cholesterol is still increased in endosomes and lysosomes. Therefore, we do not exclude the possible importance of cholesterol/lipid dysregulation in ALR impairment following GCase deficiency.</p>
<p>Substantial evidence suggests a role for autophagy impairment and lysosomal depletion in PD and ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B20">20</xref>). This not only results in increased intracellular α-synuclein levels, but also increased release and transmission of α-synuclein to other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B45">45</xref>). Our neuronal GCase deficiency models exhibited inhibition of macroautophagy, increased intracellular total and phosphorylated (S129) monomeric α-synuclein levels and release of α-synuclein, co-incident with impaired ALR. In line with our findings, a recent report showed increased release of α-synuclein in iPSC-derived dopamine neurons from the patients with PD with heterozygous <italic>GBA1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B29">29</xref>). The amount of α-synuclein in condition media was a small fraction compared to intracellular levels (&lt; 1%). We measured release in to media for 72 h, so it is likely that some α-synuclein had been degraded or taken back up by neurons during this time.</p>
<p>A proportion of CBE-treated neurons (4 out of 7 cultures) were also positive for amyloid-like deposits. The antibody cannot distinguish whether these oligomers contain α-synuclein or other amyloidgenic proteins such as β-amyloid or huntingtin. Since phospho Ser129 α-synuclein, which is typically found in α-synuclein aggregates, is also increased in these cells, and α-synuclein aggregates have previously been reported in other GCase deficient models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B19">19</xref>), it is likely that these amyloid deposits contain α-synuclein. However, further work is required to identify the composition of these putative oligomers.</p>
<p>We did not find impairment in macroautophagy flux in our <italic>Gba1</italic> mutant MEFs. In previous studies no evidence of macroautophagy inhibition was found in GD fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B46">46</xref>). However, macroautophagy has been shown to be impaired in mixed cultures of neurons and astrocytes from the same mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>Loss of ALR appeared to be similar in our heterozygote or homozygote <italic>GBA1</italic> models. Autophagy inhibition and α-synuclein accumulation have previously been reported to be similar in iPSC-derived neurons from GD patients and the patients with PD with heterozygous <italic>GBA1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B15">15</xref>). Genetic studies also support these observations, as both GD and heterozygotic <italic>GBA1</italic> gene carriers present a similar risk of developing PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ddw185-B47">47</xref>).</p>
<p>We propose that loss of functional lysosomal GCase leads to impairment of lysosomal recycling and endosome maturation, possibly due to alterations in lipid and/or cholesterol homeostasis. Over time, repeated cycles of autophagy followed by impaired ALR cause a decrease in the pool of functional lysosomes and thus autophagy deficiency, diminishing the cellular quality control mechanisms which results in α-synuclein accumulation and increased α-synuclein release, contributing to PD pathology. Since recombinant GCase can reverse ALR impairment, we anticipate that strategies to restore GCase activity in the brains of both sporadic patients with PD and those with <italic>GBA1</italic> mutations will improve autophagy lysosomal pathway, preventing the accumulation of α-synuclein and spread of pathology.</p>

<title>Measurement of α-synuclein by ELISA</title>
<p>Neurons were cultured in poly-ornithine-coated 12-well plates for 14 days. Neurons were treated with 10 μM CBE on days 4, 9 and 11. Conditioned media were removed from the neurons on day 14 and debris/floating cells removed by centrifugation. Neurons were harvested with trypsinisation and cell pellets and their respective conditioned media frozen. Total cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer and protein content calculated using a BCA protein assay kit (ThermoScientific). The amount of intracellular α-synuclein and α-synuclein released in to the media was measured by ELISA (Sensolyte; AnaSpec) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The data were expressed as pg α-synuclein/mg protein from at least three separate wells per prep.

<title>Lipidomic analysis</title>
<p>Cellular lipids were extracted in methanol/chloroform (2:1, v/v). The lipids were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using a Thermo Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK), equipped with a heated electrospray ionization probe and coupled to a Thermo Accela 1250 UHPLC system. The samples were analyzed in positive and negative ion modes over m/z 200-2000. Injections (1 µl) were made onto a Thermo Hypersil Gold C18 column (1.9 μm; 2.1 mm × 100 mm). Mobile phase A consisted of water containing 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Mobile phase B consisted of 90:10 isopropanol/acetonitrile containing 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The initial conditions for the analysis were 65%A/35%B. The percentage of mobile phase B was increased to 100% over 10 min and held for 7 min before re-equilibration with the starting conditions for 4 min. The LC-MS data were processed with Progenesis QI software v2.0 (Non-Linear Dynamics, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) and searched against LIPID MAPS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lipidmaps.org/">www.lipidmaps.org/</ext-link>) and the Human Metabolome Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hmdb.ca/">http://www.hmdb.ca/</ext-link>) for identification.
