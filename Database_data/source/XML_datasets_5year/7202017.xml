<abstract>
<p>Analysis of patient-derived DNA samples has identified hundreds of variants that are likely involved in neuropsychiatric diseases such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). While these studies couple behavioral phenotypes to individual genotypes, the number and diversity of candidate genes implicated in these disorders highlights the fact that the mechanistic underpinnings of these disorders are largely unknown. Here, we describe a RNAi-based screening platform that uses <italic>C. elegans</italic> to screen candidate neuropsychiatric risk genes (NRGs) for roles in controlling dendritic arborization. To benchmark this approach, we queried published lists of NRGs whose variants in ASD and SCZ are predicted to result in complete or partial loss of gene function. We found that a significant fraction (&gt;16%) of these candidate NRGs are essential for dendritic development. Furthermore, these gene sets are enriched for dendritic arbor phenotypes (&gt;14 fold) when compared to control RNAi datasets of over 500 human orthologs. The diversity of PVD structural abnormalities observed in these assays suggests that the functions of diverse NRGs (encoding transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, molecular chaperones and cytoskeleton-related proteins) converge to regulate neuronal morphology and that individual NRGs may play distinct roles in dendritic branching. We also demonstrate that the experimental value of this platform by providing additional insights into the molecular frameworks of candidate NRGs. Specifically, we show that ANK2/<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00006780?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925">UNC-44</ext-link> function is directly integrated with known regulators of dendritic arborization and suggest that altering the dosage of ARID1B/<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00002717?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925">LET-526</ext-link> expression during development affects neuronal morphology without diminishing aspects of cell fate specification.</p>

<p>Neuropsychiatric disorders are a group of complex and heterogeneous mental diseases that greatly contribute to human morbidity, mortality, and long-term disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCarroll <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Insel and Landis 2013</xref>). The genetic architecture of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar depression, and autism has been refractive to linkage and candidate-gene association studies to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCarroll <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). However, recent advances in genomic technologies have paved the way for higher-resolution studies that have identified specific genomic regions or candidate genes that may play key roles in the etiology of these syndromes. Significant progress has been made using these methods, which include common-variant association studies (CVAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ripke <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schizophrenia Psychiatric Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) Consortium 2011</xref>), studies of copy number variation (CNV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krumm <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>), and exome sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iossifov <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fromer <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCarthy <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Purcell <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Still, it has been challenging to functionally validate these candidate neuropsychiatric risk genes (NRGs), or model how mutations in these genes impact pathology. This limitation is in striking contrast to other complex diseases, such as cancer or heart disease, where model organism-based studies have played pivotal roles in gene discovery and validation pipelines, and, ultimately, the development of highly effective therapeutics.</p>
<p>While both ASD and SCZ are complex diseases that manifest at distinct behavioral levels, evidence suggests that neuronal morphology is often altered in patients suffering from these diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Penzes <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). Disruption of neuronal morphology has inherent implications for both functional changes at individual synapses as well as alteration of circuit level connectivity. ASD has been linked to local hyper-connectivity between neurons with a wholesale decrease in long-range neural connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hutsler and Zhang 2010</xref>). SCZ is associated with a reduction in both short- and long-range neuronal connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glantz and Lewis 2000</xref>). The basic genes and genetic mechanisms that establish overall neuronal morphology and dendritic arborization are highly conserved in animals. Therefore, it is likely that some of the genes implicated in ASD and SCZ can be modeled in simpler, more genetically tractable organisms. Indeed, many current mouse models of these diseases can recapitulate some of these features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Isshiki <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flores <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Falk <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Specifically, both NRG knock out models (both in mouse and patient derived-iPSCs) and lesion models (toxin injection) result in specific and similar cyto-architectural abnormalities indicating that structural defects, at both anatomical and cellular levels, impact disease pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourgeron 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flores-Alcantar <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Falk <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sekar <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mei <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). Screening the newly identified NRGs is an important next step in understanding the etiology of neuropsychiatric disease. Given the sheer number of candidate ASD and SCZ genes identified via high-throughput sequencing strategies, dissecting individual candidate NRG function in either mouse models or patient derived-iPSCs remains a daunting task.</p>
<p>Because of its inherent simplicity, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system is an outstanding model for <italic>in-vivo</italic> functional studies of neuron activity and neuronal development. Its nervous system, which contains 302 neurons, has been fully mapped and is invariant between animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">White <italic>et al.</italic> 1986</xref>). Notably, the neurons derived from the posterior V lineage (PVD), sensory neurons that responds to harsh mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Way and Chalfie 1989</xref>) and cold temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chatzigeorgiou <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), exhibit highly elaborate dendritic arborization patterns, forming a web-like pattern over the majority of the animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albeg <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oren-Suissa <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smith <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tsalik <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yassin <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). The stage-specific development of PVD dendrites generates the sequential and orthogonal growth patterns of primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary dendrites, giving rise to repeated “menorah” structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A-C</xref>). This size and complexity of PVD neurons are ideal for studying the mechanisms that underlie the establishment of cell type-specific dendritic arborization patterns. Forward genetic studies of this model have identified a number of conserved genes and mechanisms that regulate dendritic architecture, suggesting that this platform can be used to identify and integrate additional genes that function in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Díaz-Balzac <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salzberg <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wei <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Indeed, mRNA sequencing and protein expression data in human and mouse suggest that a number of ASD and SCZ NRGs are highly conserved, are neuronally expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoischen <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krystal and State 2014</xref>), and that defective synaptic and/or dendritic morphology has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Copf 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kulkarni and Firestein 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We sought to develop a model to functionally assess the roles of NRGs in developmentally-regulated dendritic arborization by using RNAi against the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs of candidate NRGs in a strain expressing a cytoplasmically localized GFP reporter expressed exclusively in PVD neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). To benchmark this strategy, we selected predicted candidate NRGs via a literature-based search of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iossifov <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>) and SCZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fromer <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guipponi <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gulsuner <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCarthy <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>) exome sequencing studies focused on identifying <italic>de novo</italic> variants. We specifically selected candidate NRGs whose mutations were predicted to be largely gene inactivating (Table S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iossifov <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fromer <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guipponi <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gulsuner <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCarthy <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>) because our RNAi-mediated depletion strategy leads to a partial to strong loss of protein function of target genes. This analysis resulted in 27 ASD and 40 SCZ candidate genes with a single gene shared in both diseases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref> and Tables S2 and S3). Of these 66 non-overlapping ASD- and SCZ-associated NRGs, 41 (62%) were identified as having ≥ 1 <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sonnhammer and Östlund 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">O’Brien <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shaye and Greenwald 2011</xref>). In total, 43 <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs were depleted via RNAi and, on average, &gt;50 F1 animals per gene were scored for PVD developmental phenotypes. RNAi depletion of 7 (&gt;17%, n = 7/41) candidate NRG orthologs elicited penetrant phenotypes that altered dendritic morphology (6 orthologs with &gt;20% of F1 animals affected) or PVD cell fate specification (1 NRG ortholog) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1E</xref> and Tables S2 and S3).</p>
<p>We calculated the enrichment of PVD morphological phenotypes in the NRG sets using two approaches. A previous study employed a similar RNAi-based strategy to query the role of 2298 <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes located on chromosome IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>) identified 5 genes of 2298 (5/2298, <italic>i.e.</italic>, 0.22% of genes) as well as 6 other candidate genes located at other genomic loci that affect neuronal morphology. As compared the 5 of 2298 genes from chromosome IV that exhibit PVD morphology phenotypes when depleted by RNAi, our hit rate of 14.63% (n = 6/41) represents a &gt;65-fold enrichment over the hit rate from unbiased large-scale RNAi screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). However, only a subset of the 2298 genes on Chromosome IV have unambiguous human orthologs. Therefore, as a second metric, we calculated the number of one-to-one human orthologs that are present on <italic>C. elegans</italic> chromosome IV. A minimum of 506 direct orthologous gene pairs exist on the chromosome. Using this conservative metric, our NRG set is enriched &gt;14-fold for phenotypes associated with altered neuronal morphology as compared to random human orthologs on chromosome IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Depletion of NRG orthologs elicits a variety of distinct PVD phenotypes</title>
<p>PVD architecture is determined by multiple genetic components that converge to regulate the formation of the complex dendritic arbors. Studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> indicate that mutations in critical genes can lead to an array of phenotypes including loss of dendritic self-avoidance, cell fate alterations, and dendritic hyper- and hypobranching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). A majority of genes identified through these forward genetic strategies encode structural components (expressed in PVD or cells that directly interact with PVD neurons) that function as membrane-bound, cell surface receptors and/or proteins that mediate interactions between these components and cytoskeletal structures in PVD neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Inberg <italic>et al.</italic> 2019</xref>).

<p>In addition to dendritic arborization phenotypes, we also identified a single NRG ortholog, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00004077?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>pop-1</italic></ext-link><italic>/</italic>TCF7L2 (encoding a high mobility group (HMG) box-containing transcription factor that functions in the Wnt signaling pathway), whose RNAi knockdown results in a PVD cell specification defect.

<title>Depletion of NRG orthologs in an RNAi hypersensitive background reveals additional genes related to NRGs that disrupt dendritic arborization</title>
<p>Previous work has shown that RNAi knockdown of neuronally-expressed genes inefficient in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, suggesting that RNAi in wild-type genetic backgrounds may underestimate the roles of particular genes in neuronal function and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schmitz <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Therefore, we complemented our RNAi experiments in wild-type animals with those done in a well-characterized RNAi hypersensitive genetic background (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00045274?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>nre-1</italic></ext-link><italic>(</italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBVar00087841?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>hd20</italic></ext-link><italic>) lin15b(</italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBVar00087856?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>hd126</italic></ext-link><italic>))</italic> to address three additional questions. First, we determined if using the enhanced efficiency of RNAi in these strains could increase the penetrance or expressivity of the PVD dendritic morphology phenotypes of candidate NRGs. Indeed, depletion of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00006780?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>unc-44</italic></ext-link> (<italic>ANK2)</italic> in RNAi hypersensitive animals results in an increase in both the penetrance and expressivity of PVD RNAi phenotypes as compared to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>)(Supplemental Figure S2). In addition, we find that depletion of two candidate NRG orthologs, <italic>daf-21</italic>/HSP90AA1 and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00002005?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>hsp-1</italic></ext-link>/HSPA8, leads to a more severe embryonic lethal (Emb) phenotype in the enhanced RNAi background, rather than altering dendritic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and Table S4). The more severe developmental phenotype demonstrates the utility of using both wild-type and RNAi hypersensitive strains for NRG ortholog screening. Importantly, while the enhanced RNAi strain can reveal additional phenotypes associated with NRGs, it does not capture morphological phenotypes of all genetic mutants that have been implicated in dendritic guidance (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00001580?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>gex-3</italic></ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zou <italic>et al.</italic> 2018</xref>).</p>

<p>Protein-protein interaction networks and additional systems-level/computational organization of NRGs have led to a variety of models for how the disruption of NRG networks may alter neuronal function. For instance, the NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor) and ARC (Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) complexes (assembled through boot-strapping two-hybrid, protein-protein interaction assays) have been implicated in SCZ with the assumption that mutations in these genes would alter specific protein-protein associations involved in synaptic communication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glessner <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fromer <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Malhotra <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). While PVD neurons are not thought to be post-synaptic to other neurons and not predicted to express NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brockie <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albeg <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>), we employed the RNAi hypersensitive strain to functionally probe additional orthologous genes implicated in NMDAR and ARC networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) for roles in controlling dendritic arborization. Through this approach, we found that the orthologs of two additional neuro-psychiatric-associated risk genes, <italic>YWHAZ</italic> (a 14-3-3 family protein implicated in cytoplasmic signaling) and <italic>GIT1</italic> (encoding a GTPase-activating protein from the ADP ribosylation factor family and likely functions as a scaffold in cytoplasmic vesicle trafficking), are required for proper PVD dendritic arborization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, C and D</xref>). <italic>YWHAZ</italic> and <italic>GIT1</italic> are represented by three <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00003920?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>par-5</italic></ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00001502?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>ftt-2</italic></ext-link>, <italic>and </italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00008805?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>git-1</italic></ext-link>, respectively. RNAi knockdown of each results in hyper-branching in the hypodermal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These phenotypes were substantially less penetrant when depleted in the wild-type RNAi background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and suggest that the ubiquitously expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>) encoding downstream components of the NMDAR and ARC complexes also contribute to the production of normal neuron morphology.</p>
<p>Third, we used the hypersensitive strain to determine if knocking down candidate NRGs altered other aspects of neuronal development in addition to dendritic structures. For NRG candidates where RNAi does not lead to embryonic lethality (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00006780?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>unc-44</italic></ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00001502?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>ftt-2</italic></ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00008805?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>git-1</italic></ext-link>), we monitored the architecture of DA/DB cholinergic motor neurons that born embryonically and by the end of the L1 stage, extend axon commissures circumferentially from the ventral nerve chord to the dorsal nerve chord (Supplemental Figure S3A). RNAi treatment failed to reveal any significant DA/DB architectural phenotypes using RNAi conditions identical to those that elicit severe PVD branching phenotypes in F1 animals (Supplemental Figure S3B). These results are generally consistent with previous studies indicating that most genes required for normal axon migration do not play a significant role in PVD arborization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schmitz <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). To determine if additional NRGs may also play roles axon guidance, we depleted candidate NRGs using post-embryonic RNAi feeding and monitored the ventral axon extension phenotypes of HSN neurons. During the late L4 stage, HSNs extend a single axon projection toward the ventral nerve chord (VNC). During this process, the HSN neuron forms synapses with vulval muscles and the VC4 and VC5 motor neurons before further extending to the far anterior nerve ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">White <italic>et al.</italic> 1986</xref>). When we examined the HSN axon extension phenotypes in animals subjected to post-embryonic RNAi of the ten NRGs that disrupt PVD morphology.

<title>Normal dendritic architecture is sensitive to changes in LET-526(ARID1B) gene dosage during development</title>
<p>ASD and SCZ risk genes are unique among other genetic etiologies: the causative, loss-of-function mutations typically affect only one of the two copies of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iossifov <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fromer <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guipponi <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gulsuner <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). Furthermore, a large fraction of the ASD- and SCZ-associated variants occur in what are generally considered essential genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blake <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). There are multiple possible mechanisms for how these behavioral and/or neuronal phenotypes could arise. For example, allele-specific gene expression in neurons could generate mosaic animals composed of cells that either express or do not express the wild-type, functional version of the gene. ASD or SCZ phenotypes would, in this case, emerge at a systems level as the integration of defective neurons within an otherwise normal circuit with altered behavioral outcomes. Alternatively, these complex ASD and SCZ behavioral phenotypes may simply result from the cell type-specific haploinsufficiency of specific risk genes. In this scenario, one functional version of an NRG would be sufficient for most somatic cell types to be phenotypically wild-type, but more complex cell types (<italic>e.g.</italic>, neurons) may exhibit a more profound disruption in function at reduced gene dosage.</p>
<p>To address this question using our <italic>C. elegans</italic> PVD model, we took advantage of an experimental system where expression levels of virtually any target protein can be modulated at the post-translational level by an exogenously added ligand. The <italic><underline>A</underline></italic>uxin <italic><underline>I</underline></italic>nducible <italic><underline>D</underline></italic>egradation (AID) system is a novel three-component system in which the proteins harboring a small (44aa) epitope (added via CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing) can be targeted for degradation by ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. The specificity of this system is provided by a mRuby-tagged, heterologously-expressed E3-ubiquitin conjugating enzyme from <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, <italic>TIR1</italic>::<italic>mRuby</italic>. Interactions between TIR1 and its targets are regulated in an allosteric manner through the binding of auxin to TIR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dharmasiri <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). This strategy enables the titration of target gene dosage during <italic>C. elegans</italic> development as the specific turnover of the target protein in auxin conditions is both rapid and dosage sensitive across all <italic>C. elegans</italic> tissues including neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattacharya <italic>et al.</italic> 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>We chose to evaluate the AID system in our PVD assay by modulating the expression of broadly-expressed chromatin modifier, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00002717?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925">LET-526</ext-link>, during larval development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Uhlén <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Celen <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>).

At all conditions assayed, animals were viable and developed to adulthood. At 1µM auxin concentrations, developmental pace was slower compared to the no auxin control animals or wild-type animals grown on auxin media. At 53.5 hr after initiation, only 60% of auxin-treated <italic>let-526</italic>::<italic>degron</italic> animals had reached adulthood in auxin conditions, while 100% of non-auxin treated <italic>let-526</italic>::<italic>degron</italic> animals were fertile adults. At low concentrations of auxin (0.25 to 0.50 µm), a minor fraction of animals (∼15%) exhibit defects in vulva morphology and 2 of 30 animals (∼7%) exhibited an ectopic PVD neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These phenotypes increased slightly when animals were exposed to higher auxin concentrations. In contrast to these mild developmental defects, PVD morphology was highly sensitive to even low amounts of auxin in the growth medium. At concentrations of auxin as low as 0.5µM, 80% of PVD neurons in young adult animals failed to extend anteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Elevating auxin concentrations in growth medium did not increase the penetrance of the early termination phenotypes suggesting that dendritic extension is fully compromised at lower concentrations. The early termination defects were also accompanied by other neuronal architectural defects including hyperbranching of arbors in the hypodermal region as well as a lack of self-avoidance of terminal dendrites. These secondary phenotypes increased when animals were raised in high concentrations of auxin (0.75µM to 1µM). This suggests that, like haploinsufficiency in mouse cell models, the establishment of normal dendritic morphology may be highly sensitive to a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00002717?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925">LET-526</ext-link>/ARID1B expression levels and that a reduction of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00002717?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925">LET-526</ext-link> expression during larval development can have differential effects in distinct tissues, specifically impairing neuronal development and architecture while leaving the development of most other somatic cells intact.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Genome and exome sequencing are currently the first step in identifying genetic variants associated with ASD and SCZ. However, the utility of this genomics-level data are limited by the lack of available <italic>in vivo</italic> models to integrate the function of NRGs into molecular and/or systems-level frameworks. In this manuscript, we outline a simple system that can be used to triage NRGs and assign roles in controlling neuronal morphology. This PVD neuron assay is a highly suitable, first pass approach for probing NRG function <italic>in vivo</italic>. This experimental platform is rapid, enabling high content screening of tens to hundreds of candidate genes using an inexpensive technology (RNAi through bacterial ingestion) and minimal experimental equipment (compound microscope) in days to weeks. It provides a platform for determining the importance of a particular NRG in neuronal development, while providing an opportunity to assess a range of highly classifiable neuron morphological phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This diversity of architectural defects suggests that many candidate NRGs (and their proposed molecular functions in transcription, chromatin remodeling, protein folding, and cytoskeletal activity) may act at distinct phases or processes during normal dendrite development. Importantly, the model is also quantitative, providing the ability to gauge differences in the penetrance and expressivity of structural defects.</p>
<p>A major feature of the PVD dendritic arbor model is that the genetic tractability of <italic>C. elegans</italic> readily enables the integration of individual NRGs with other genes that function during normal neurogenesis. Specifically, we demonstrated that <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00006780?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>unc-44</italic></ext-link> (ANK2) functions with the conserved receptor complex (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00004732?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925">SAX-7</ext-link>/<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00012184?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925">MNR-1</ext-link>/<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00019407?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925">LECT-2</ext-link>/<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00011345?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925">DMA-1</ext-link>) that mediates interactions between multiple cell types (neuronal and hypodermal) to control dendritic branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Interactions between distinct cell types are difficult to recapitulate using <italic>in vitro</italic> models of isolated, cultured neurons. This limitation is absent from our <italic>in vivo</italic> system. This is an especially important connection as mutations and deletions in L1CAM, a structural ortholog of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00004732?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925">SAX-7</ext-link>, have already been implicated in dendritic arborization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patzke <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>), mutations in L1CAM-associated pathway components have already been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>) and the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs of ANK2 and L1CAM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00006780?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>unc-44</italic></ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00004732?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>sax-7</italic></ext-link>, respectively) directly and functionally interact in other aspects of neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). Although not addressed in this manuscript, the inherent genetic tractability of our system will also enable genetic studies between NRGs though co-depletion of target genes or combining engineered genetic mutants with RNAi. This system can also directly complement purely computational approaches aimed at organizing NRGs into functional classes. Through our characterization of the NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor) and ARC (Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) complexes, we have demonstrated that, in addition to their potential roles in controlling post-synaptic activity of specific neurons, several of the genes within these pathways are also required for normal dendritic branching. Understanding how distinct NRGs function together through epistasis experiments and tests of genetic redundancy and synergy within these pathways will greatly improve our understanding of the complex genetic landscape in ASD and SCZ.</p>
<p>One intriguing finding from this study is the observation that a vast majority of NRGs that exhibit neuronal morphology phenotypes in our assay are essential for normal development and ubiquitously expressed in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals (Supplemental Figure S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blake <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). This is especially interesting given that each <italic>de novo</italic> NRG candidate tested in our assay harbor a lesion in only a single copy of the gene in patient samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iossifov <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fromer <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guipponi <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gulsuner <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCarthy <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>), suggesting haploinsufficiency of individual NRGs results in ASD and SCZ phenotypes. Importantly, eliciting partial loss-of-function phenotypes, a common feature of RNAi experiments, has been instrumental in characterizing aspects of gene function. For example, modulating gene dosage of essential cytoskeletal components via RNAi reveals a range of specific cellular phenotypes during early development whose penetrance and expressivity correlate with the level of actin depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Velarde <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). Similarly, the distinct neuronal defects elicited by depletion of individual NRGs via RNAi may indicate that neurons are particularly sensitive to alterations in the expression levels of genes that function in normal, essential facets of cellular physiology. Given the unique functions of neurons, they may place higher demands on diverse cellular systems, including the control of morphological development on physical scales that exceed those of virtually any other cell type (centimeters to meters as compared to micrometers for other somatic cells) and the integration of these features at greater than 1000 sites per cell. Therefore, aspects of transcription (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00013075?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>Y51A2D.7</italic></ext-link>/INTS5, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00001502?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>ftt-2</italic></ext-link>/YWHAZ, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00003920?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>par-5</italic></ext-link>/YWHAZ, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00004077?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>pop-1</italic></ext-link>/TCF7L2), chromatin modification (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00011729?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>set-16</italic></ext-link>/MLL2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00002717?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>let-526</italic></ext-link>/ARID1B), protein folding (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00002005?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>hsp-1</italic></ext-link>/HSPA8 and <italic>daf-21</italic>/HSP90AA1), and cytoskeletal structure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00008805?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>git-1</italic></ext-link>/GIT1 and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/bioentitylink/WB:WBGene00006780?doi=10.1534/g3.119.400925"><italic>unc-44</italic></ext-link>/ANK2) may need to be optimal to establish the architectures of highly-branched dendritic arbors and axon extensions during development. Further work will be necessary to fully characterize the significance of the fine-grained phenotypes observed using RNAi due to the possibility that some are the result and are dependent on partial knock-downs of the targeted gene.</p>
<p>Finally, we also describe how our system can directly address some of the more complex genetic features of NRG function through the ability to directly control the expression of candidate NRGs during <italic>C. elegans</italic> development. Specifically, we employed a novel, ligand-dependent degradation system to query how alterations in gene dosage compromise normal neuronal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). While the AID system would be an impractical alternative to RNAi for primary screening (due to the necessity to genetically engineer each candidate gene with the AID-tag), it will likely prove to be a powerful approach to complement RNAi for further characterization. This system will likely be especially important to define the cell type(s) in which a particular NRG functions as <italic>in vivo</italic> dendritic arborization is modulated by other cell-cell interactions. This would be accomplished by expressing the TIR1 E3 ligase from cell type-specific promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). An important feature of the TIR1/AID system is that it leads to the rapid destruction of its target genes. Therefore, this system can also be used to determine the temporal requirements of an NRG in controlling dendritic arborization, which will distinguish between NRGs that function during the development of neuronal architectures from those that function in maintenance and stability of dendritic structures. Candidates that function in maintenance and stabilization of dendritic arbors, as opposed to those that are required throughout development, may be attractive candidates for therapeutic intervention.</p>
