<abstract>
<p>Motor control and learning impairments are common complications in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Abnormal cerebellar development during critical phases may disrupt these motor functions and lead to autistic motor dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanisms behind these impairments are not clear. Here, we utilized BTBR <italic>T<sup>+</sup> Itpr<sup>tf</sup></italic>/J (BTBR) mice, an animal model of autism, to investigate the involvement of abnormal cerebellar development in motor performance. We found BTBR mice exhibited severe dystonia-like behavior and motor coordination or motor learning impairments. The onset of these abnormal movements coincided with the increased proliferation of granule neurons and enhanced foliation, and Purkinje cells displayed morphological hypotrophy with increased dendritic spine formation but suppressed maturation. The migration of granule neurons seemed unaffected. Transcriptional analyses confirmed the differential expression of genes involved in abnormal neurogenesis and revealed <italic>TRPC</italic> as a critical regulator in proliferation and synaptic formation. Taken together, these findings indicate that abnormal cerebellar development is closely related to dystonia-like behavior and motor dysfunction of BTBR mice and that <italic>TRPC</italic> may be a novel risk gene for ASD that may participate in the pathological process of autistic movement disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent defects in social communication and interaction and restricted, repetitive, inflexible behaviors and interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Lord et al., 2018</xref>). It is commonly diagnosed in early childhood, and the prevalence of ASD has increased dramatically throughout the last decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Constantino and Charman, 2016</xref>). The interaction of genetic and environmental factors was recently hypothesized to contribute to the pathogenesis of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Ecker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Richards et al., 2015</xref>), but the etiology of the disorder remains far from clear.</p>
<p>In addition to the core symptoms, autistic subjects frequently present with complex motor impairments, such as ataxia, dystonia, and akinesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Cook, 2016</xref>). Notably, a systematic research on the prevalence of movement disorders in ASD associated with specific genetic syndromes revealed 43.6–100% for ataxia and 25.0–48.3% for tremor, with additional reports for dystonia and rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bell et al., 2019</xref>). Several clinicians have proposed that these atypical movement impairments are a predictor for ASD, because these impairments often appear prior to the classical behaviors of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Robledo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Uljarevic et al., 2017</xref>). Motor disturbances may underlie some of the behavioral core features in autism. The contribution of movements to social cognition and cascade effects on social communication in individuals with autism have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Cook, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Baranek et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, therapeutic medicines for motor dysfunction, such as methylphenidate and atomoxetine, have improved social interaction deficits and recognition memory impairment in ASD subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hara et al., 2016</xref>). It is quite essential and meaningful to illuminate the relationship between autism and motor dysfunctions to provide comprehensive and precise treatment. Several hypotheses have been raised, but more evidence is needed, and the shared underlying mechanisms with autism should be further examined.</p>
<p>Several brain regions have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ASD, but cerebellar abnormalities are the most reproducibly studied in this disorder. Neuropathological studies showed lower Purkinje cell (PC) numbers, missed or ectopic neurons of deeper cerebellar nuclei (DCN), cortical thickness alterations, foliation dysplasia and migration impairments in the cerebellar cortex of individuals with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Amaral et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Wegiel et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Blatt, 2012</xref>). Indeed, cerebellar lesions are associated with increased rates of autistic behavior, and recent evidence has suggested more to be involved, like suppressed social function, restrictive or repetitive behaviors, and motor impairment symptoms such as ataxia, dystonia and tremor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Jaber, 2017</xref>). It was recently proposed that early perinatal alterations of the cerebellum are involved in ASD pathogenesis, which is supported by the finding that autism genes are frequently involved in the aberrant cerebellar development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Menashe et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The cerebellum is characterized by a typical laminated structure consisting of a molecular layer (ML), a Purkinje cell layer (PCL) and an inner granule layer (IGL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). During cerebellar development, billions of granule neurons are produced in the external granule layer (EGL) and then descend and migrate to destinations in the IGL, leaving “T-shaped” parallel fibers that are arranged in parallel along the cerebellar folia axis and synapse on the dendritic arbors of PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Altman and Bayer, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hampson and Blatt, 2015</xref>). The PC axons further travel to the DCN and project more broadly. As the sole efferent neurons in the cerebellum, Purkinje neurons regulate all of the information transfer and are responsible for cerebellar function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Martinez et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, the loss of cerebellar PCs is one of the most consistent findings in postmortem studies of autistic cerebella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Fatemi et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, a further raised question is what extended morphological aberrations of the cerebellum concomitantly occur in specific motor impairment.</p>
<p>The BTBR T<sup>+</sup> Itpr3<sup>tf</sup>/J (BTBR) inbred strain shows a robust behavioral phenotype that mimic core symptoms of ASD patients and exhibits striking anatomical features in the cerebellum. We investigated the contribution of abnormal cerebellar development to movement disorders in BTBR mice, with the control of C57BL/6J strain (commonly used as wild-type, WT). The present study revealed distinct dystonia-like behaviors and motor learning impairments in BTBR mice that began in early postnatal days. Concomitant with the progression of behavioral impairment, a hyperplastic cerebellum with enhanced foliation was identified due to the abnormally increased proliferation of granule cell precursors (GCPs). Moreover, in the cerebellum of BTBR mice, the morphology of Purkinje neurons was altered and exhibited hypotrophy and disturbed spine formation. Evidence from RNA sequencing indicated that the nervous system development was negatively regulated, and the transient receptor potential canonical channel (<italic>TRPC</italic>) family including <italic>TRPC6</italic>, <italic>TRPC3</italic> and <italic>TRPC4</italic> played a key role in the signal regulation of the abnormal neurogenesis. Together, these findings suggest that abnormal cerebellar development, which may be regulated by <italic>TRPC</italic>, was involved in the pathological progression from movement disorders to autism.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="S2.SS1">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>BTBR mice were originally obtained from Jackson Laboratory (BTBR <italic>T</italic><sup>+</sup>
<italic>Itpr</italic>3<italic><sup>tf</sup></italic>/J; stock number 002282) and maintained in our mouse colony at the Army Medical University. C57BL/6J mice (WT) were used as controls and provided by the Army Medical University. Only male mice were used in the experiments. After weaning at 3 weeks, mice were group-housed with 4–6 mice per cage under a controlled environment (22 ± 2°C, 45 ± 10% humidity, 12 h light/dark cycle) with free access to water and food. The Army Medical University approved all experiments, which were performed according to the accepted standards of animal care. Efforts were made to reduce animal suffering.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS2">
<title>Behavioral Assays</title>
<p>Mice were examined periodically using the tail suspension test and grid hang test from early postnatal (P) days to 5 months. Other behavioral assessments, such as horizontal ladder rung walking, rotarod and open field tests, were initiated at 8 weeks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS3">
<title>Tail Suspension Test</title>
<p>Mice were suspended by their tails for 60 s. The activity of the mice was recorded by a camera to observe the presence of dystonia-like behaviors, as references described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Pappas et al., 2015</xref>), including hyperflexion, trunk twisting, hyperextension, and forelimb or hindlimbs clasping. These phenotypes were recorded from P3 to P150.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS4">
<title>Grid Hang Test</title>
<p>Motor coordination and strength were detected by putting the mice on a 30 × 50 cm wire grid with 0.5 cm<sup>2</sup> openings. The grid was inverted after the mouse grabbed the grid with its fore- and hindlimbs, and the latency to fall off was recorded. Movement on the grid and the paw placement of the mice were observed during the test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS5">
<title>Horizontal Ladder Rung Walking Test</title>
<p>Skilled fore- and hindlimb coordination and fine motor function were assessed by the horizontal ladder rung walking test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Metz and Whishaw, 2002</xref>). To subtly test coordination, the difficulty of the task was divided into two patterns: pattern A used a regular rung arrangement with 2 cm intervals, and pattern B used an irregular rung pattern with randomly spaced rungs at intervals from 1 to 3 cm. Mice were put on one side of the ladder (30 cm above the ground) and allowed to freely cross it. The whole crossing process was filmed with a high-definition video camcorder (Logitech C930e), and behaviors were analyzed. The total limb falls and time to cross the ladder were recorded to assess motor function. Five trials were performed on each mouse, and the average value was calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS6">
<title>Accelerating Rotarod Test</title>
<p>Motor coordination and motor learning were detected using the accelerating rotarod test. Mice were habituated to stay on the stationary drum for 3 min 1 day in advance and habituated was repeated every day for 1 min just before the session. Once stabilized, mice were put on an accelerating rod (3 cm diameter, 14 cm above the pedestal), and the speed was set to 5 rpm with a uniform acceleration to 40 rpm in 5 min. The latency of mouse falling from the rotating rod was calculated. Five trials were performed on each mouse per day for 5 consecutive days to assess motor learning in each group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS7">
<title>Open Field Locomotion Test</title>
<p>Mice were put in an open field to assess locomotor activity. The apparatus was a square plexiglass cage (40 × 40 × 30 cm) illuminated at ∼200 lux. As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Cai et al., 2017</xref>), square grid lines were predefined by a computer that divided the open field chamber into a central zone and periphery. Mice were placed in the center of the apparatus, and locomotion was traced for 30 min using Ethovision 11.0 software (Noldus). The total distance in all zones and the center zone were calculated to assess the activity of mice. The apparatus was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS8">
<title>Histology and Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Adult mice were completely anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Neonatal mice received BrdU injection (50 mg/kg i.p.) and then were decapitated 2 h later, and the needed tissues were dissected. Dissected cerebella were postfixed in 4% PFA for 48 h and dehydrated in a 50–100% gradient alcohol series. Tissues were soaked twice in trichloromethane for 20 min and covered twice with melted paraffin for 30 min. Cerebella were paraffin-embedded, and then sagittal sections (5 μm) were collected. All sections used in each mouse were taken from the same medial lateral position on the cerebellum to allow comparisons and five sections per mouse were used for each staining. Paraffin sections were performed dewaxing and antigen retrieval before used. For hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, sections were incubated in hematoxylin (ZLI-9610, ZSJQ-Bio, China) for 10 min, washed in running water, differentiated by 75% hydrochloric acid in alcohol for 1 min, washed in running water when the nucleus was black to blue, incubated in eosin (ZLI-9612, ZSJQ-Bio, China) for 10 s, dehydrated in 95% alcohol for 1 min, and mounted in DPX (06522, Sigma, United States). For immunohistochemical staining, sections were processed by washing in 0.3% Triton-X/PBS, blocking in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (37°C, 2 h), and incubation with the following primary antibodies (room temperature (RT), overnight): (1) mouse anti-5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (1:500, BD PharmingenTM, United States); (2) rabbit anti-Ki67 (1:1000, Thermo, United States); (3) rabbit anti-neuronal nuclei (NeuN) (1:200, Abcam, United States); rabbit anti-s100β (1:500, CST, United States); rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:500, Dako, Japan); and mouse anti-calbindin (CB) (1:1000, Swant, Switzerland). After washing in 0.01 M PBS for 30 min, sections were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies (RT, 3 h in darkness): Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch, United States); and cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch, United States). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1:10000, Sigma-Aldrich, United States) was used to counterstain the nuclei in all sections. After air drying, sections were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Lab, United States). Sections for Nissl staining were incubated in a cresyl violet solution containing acetic acid (C0117, ZSJQ-Bio, China) (37°C, 30 min), dehydrated in 95% alcohol for 1 min, and mounted in DPX (06522, Sigma, United States). The stained sections were observed under 5X or 20X objective lens using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) with a Zeiss Axiovision 4.0 system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS9">
<title>Golgi Staining</title>
<p>Mice were decapitated immediately at P14, and brains were dissected. Cerebella were rinsed and processed for Golgi staining with the FD Rapid Golgi Stain Kit (PK401A, FD Neurotechnologies, United States) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sagittal sections (80 μm) were generated and mounted in DPX after drying. Slides were observed under 20X or 100X oil objective lens using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. Sholl analysis was executed using the matched Zeiss Axiovision 4.0 system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS10">
<title>Western Blot</title>
<p>P14 BTBR and WT mice were decapitated, and their cerebella were dissected in ice-cold PBS. The total protein was extracted immediately, and protein concentrations were measured using a Bicinchoninic Acid Kit (Beyotime, China) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>). The total protein (20 μg) of each sample was separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (80 V, 100 min) and then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (220 mA, 60 min). The membranes were washed in 1% Tween-20/Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (TBS-T), blocked in 5% BSA/TBS-T (RT, 2 h), and incubated with a primary antibodies (4°C, 12 h) (1) mouse anti-CB (1:2000, Swant, Switzerland) and (2) mouse anti-GAPDH (1:2000, Cell Cwbio, China), followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody IgG (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, United States). Bands were visualized using the chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce, United States) under a Gel-Pro analyzer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, United States). Band intensity was quantified in Image Lab (Bio-Rad Laboratories, United States), and calbindin protein was normalized to GAPDH.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS11">
<title>Quantification</title>
<p>Comparable middle sagittal sections were selected for assessments. Cerebella sagittal area (mm<sup>2</sup>) and perimeter (mm) were defined as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref> and calculated with a Zeiss Axiovision 4.0 system. Lobes separated clearly by fissures were calculated as the lobe number. BrdU- and Ki67-positive granule cell precursors were counted only in the EGL and the density was calculated as total BrdU or Ki67 cells in the EGL/EGL area, and proportion of BrdU-positive cell in the EGL was calculated as BrdU-positive cells/DAPI-stained nuclei in a high-power field of the EGL (218 μm length) in lobe IV/V. Bergmann soma in the PCL and fibers in the ML were counted under a 20X objective lens along the lobe axis (450 μm length), and the densities were calculated. Purkinje neuron density and soma size were counted in each lobe along a 500 μm-length axis in the middle of each lobe. Among these cells, 10 Purkinje neurons were randomly selected, and their soma areas were measured by a Zeiss Axiovision 4.0 system.</p>
<p>For Golgi staining quantification, the outer terminals of the Purkinje dendritic branches were orderly linked, and the formative closed region was defined as the PC dendritic area. Primary dendrite length was measured as the primary dendrite of each Purkinje neuron from the soma up to the end at the surface of the ML. Sholl analysis was performed, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Piochon et al., 2014</xref>). Purkinje neuron branches were incised by concentric circles with 5.5 μm radius steps from the soma, and intersections in each circle were counted. Dendrite spine density and classification were assessed referring to Risher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Risher et al., 2014</xref>). At least a 10 μm-length branch was calculated for the spine. Ten cells per mouse and 10 branches per cell were detected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS12">
<title>RNA-seq Analyses</title>
<p>The whole cerebella of BTBR and WT mice were collected at P14 for the mRNA sequencing assay. This experiment was performed by Novogene (Beijing, China). Libraries were generated using the NEBNext<sup>®</sup> UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina<sup>®</sup> (NEB, United States) according to standard Illumina protocols. After clustering was performed in the cBot Cluster Generation System, the libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq platform with a 125 bp/150 bp paired-end reads strategy. The original image data were subjected to quality control, and reads containing adapter, poly-N and low-quality reads were removed from the raw data. Clean data of high quality were used for the downstream analyses. The reads were aligned to the reference genome (10 mm) using the split read aligner TopHat v2.0.12 and Bowtie v2.2.3, and HTSeq v0.6.1 was used to estimate the abundances of mapped genes. Expected number of Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript sequence per Million base pairs sequenced (FPKM) of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and reads count and used as the evaluation index of gene expression levels. For differential expression gene (DEG) analysis, the DESeq R package (1.18.0) was used to perform routine statistics with a model based on negative binomial distribution. <italic>P</italic>-values &lt; 0.05 were deemed significant. Next, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment pathway analysis of DEGs was conducted using the GOseq R package, which adjusts the gene length bias based on Wallenius hyper-distribution. GO pathways with <italic>P</italic>-values &lt; 0.05 defined a significant enrichment of the DEGs. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of the DEGs screened out by GO enrichment were performed in the STRING database<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote1">1</xref></sup>. Further analysis was performed in Cytoscape_v3.7.2 software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS13">
<title>Real-Time Quantitative PCR</title>
<p>Cerebella were collected at P14, and total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, United States) and reverse transcribed to cDNA, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time PCR for target genes was performed with a SYBR Green kit (Takara Company, Japan) and the CFX Connect<sup>TM</sup> Real-time system (Bio-Rad, United States). Primers are listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table</xref>. Expression of mRNA was detected via the ΔΔ cycle threshold-based algorithm relative to an internal control gene (GAPDH). Each sample was run in triplicate, and 6 mice from each group were used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS14">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>

<title>BTBR Mice Exhibited Infancy-Onset Dystonia-Like Behaviors and Motor Impairments</title>
<p>Movement disorders are widely reported in combination with autism in individuals. We found BTBR mice exhibited severe dystonia-like movements during tail suspension, when mice try to keep an upright body posture. The most prominent dystonic symptom was hyperflexion of one or both hyperkinetic hindlimbs during tail suspension. Hindlimb clasping or fore- and hindlimb clasping, hyperextension, and severe trunk twisting were also observed in conjunction with myodystonia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). BTBR mice exhibited dystonia-like behaviors as early as the tenth day (P10) (<italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup> = 3.902, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), and nearly 100% of BTBR mice developed such behaviors beginning at P14 (<italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup> = 21.505, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). This behavior persisted to adulthood and remained stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A,B</xref>). Physiological hypermyotonia was observed in WT mice between P7 and P30, but it disappeared after P30. In addition, BTBR mice also developed a defect in the ability to hang from a wire grid [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>F</italic>(1,258) = 343.614, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001] that in some cases because of abnormal hindlimb clasping or twisting. Fine motor skill was assessed using regularly and irregularly spaced horizontal ladders at 8 weeks of age. Mice ran across the horizontal ladder in two patterns, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>. BTBR mice exhibited increased limb falls in both the regular (<italic>U</italic> = 26.000, P &lt; 0.05) and irregular (<italic>U</italic> = 8.500, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) patterns, which suggests a deficit in fine motor skill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, the time spent crossing the ladder was decreased in BTBR mice compared to WT controls (Pattern A: <italic>U</italic> = 9.000, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; Pattern B: <italic>T</italic><sub>20</sub> = 6.686, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>), mainly because of the increased activity. BTBR mice were also significantly hyperactive in the open field, as indicated by the increased distance in all zones (<italic>T</italic><sub>16</sub> = 2.719, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and the central zone (<italic>T</italic><sub>16</sub> = 2.504, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1I,J</xref>). Motor skill learning was assessed by means of the consecutive rotarod learning test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). Both BTBR and WT mice learned the task, and the time on the rod gradually increased [WT: <italic>F</italic>(4,44) = 21.867, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; BTBR: <italic>F</italic>(4,28) = 15.306, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001]. However, learning was significantly slower in the BTBR mice [<italic>F</italic>(1,72) = 28.232, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). Notably, the BTBR mice showed abnormal behaviors, similar as inattention, when they were put on the rod, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>. Instead of concentrating on the motor learning, the BTBR mice explored and ignored the unstable rotating rod under their feet. It may be an important factor for the impaired learning process. In summary, BTBR mice exhibited infancy-onset dystonia-like behaviors accompanied by severe deficits in motor coordination and motor learning in addition to autistic behavior.</p>

<title>BTBR Mice Displayed Hyperplastic Cerebella With Increased Foliation</title>
<p>In the adult BTBR mice, the overall structure of the cerebellum was abnormal, with an obviously larger area (<italic>T</italic><sub>11</sub> = 7.727, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and more lobules (<italic>T</italic><sub>11</sub> = 6.826, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A,D</xref>). By dividing the area into three lamellas, the ML, GCL and white matter (WM), we found that the enlarged portion was mainly in the ML (<italic>T</italic><sub>11</sub> = 4.383, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and GCL (<italic>T</italic><sub>11</sub> = 8.880, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The thickness of the ML was not altered in BTBR mice (data not shown), and its increased area might have resulted from an elongated perimeter. Therefore, the enlargement of the cerebella may be due to the extension of the GCL. Another noticeable change was observed that more foliation appeared in BTBR cerebella than the WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). To determine when BTBR mice firstly exhibited enhanced foliation, paraffin sections of the cerebella with HE staining were detected sequentially during the first two postnatal weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). The initial stages of cerebellar patterning, including cardinal fissure formation, were normal in BTBR mice until P3, but the average sagittal cerebellar area increased significantly (<italic>T</italic><sub>9</sub> = 2.447, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared to WT controls. The average sagittal cerebellar section perimeter was elongated concomitantly (<italic>T</italic><sub>9</sub> = 4.378, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), which indicates that the cerebellar surface area was increased. Thus, cortical expansion and increased cross-sectional area preceded supernumerary folia in BTBR mice.</p>
<p>BTBR mice firstly exhibited increased foliation at P7, with multiple lobules that were not present in controls (<italic>T</italic><sub>10</sub> = 20.125, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2F,G</xref>).

At P14, when foliation patterns are established, BTBR midsagittal sections were larger (<italic>T</italic><sub>9</sub> = 6.739, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>), had a longer perimeter (<italic>T</italic><sub>9</sub> = 10.639, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>), and were considerably more foliated than controls (<italic>T</italic><sub>9</sub> = 22.160, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2F,G</xref>).</p>

<title>BTBR Cerebella Displayed Increased GCP Proliferation in the EGL Without Alteration in the Migration of Granule Neurons</title>
<p>The foliation pattern divided by fissures of different lengths is a representative morphology of cerebella. The formation is orchestrated by multicellular anchoring centers in which granule cells are the initiating factors and provide the driving physical force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Sudarov and Joyner, 2007</xref>). During cerebella development, GCPs in the EGL proliferate and differentiate into granule cells, then gradually mature during migration through the ML to destinations in the IGL. BrdU was used to label the newborn GCPs in the EGL of P3 cerebella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,A<sub><bold>1</bold></sub>,B,B<sub><bold>1</bold></sub></xref>). Co-staining of nuclei with DAPI revealed that the EGL was much thicker in BTBR cerebella compared to WT (<italic>T</italic><sub>9</sub> = 3.218, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A</xref><sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">,B<sub>2</sub>,C</xref>). Simultaneously, the density of BrdU-positive GCPs in the EGL was increased significantly (<italic>T</italic><sub>9</sub> = 3.869, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A<sub><bold>3</bold></sub>,B<sub><bold>3</bold></sub>,D</xref>). The total GCPs (<italic>T</italic><sub>9</sub> = 3.944, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>) and proportion (<italic>T</italic><sub>9</sub> = 4.899, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>) were also increased in BTBR mice. To confirm this result, another marker, Ki67, which is actively expressed during mitosis and degrades soon after caryomitosis, was used. Consistently, the Ki67-positive GCPs in the EGL were multiplied in BTBR mice compared to WT mice (<italic>T</italic><sub>9</sub> = 7.827, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3G–I</xref>) at P3.

<p>Defect in migration of GCs might lead to increased EGL thickness in BTBR mice. We observed that most of the differentiated granule neurons labeled with NeuN staining were located in the IGL in WT mice at P7, with few ectopic neurons in the EGL or ML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, no ectopic mature granule neuron was found in BTBR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Notably, the EGL thickness was comparable between the two groups (<italic>T</italic><sub>10</sub> = 0.856, <italic>P</italic> = 0.412) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), which indicates that the overproduced granule neurons in BTBR mice migrated efficiently. It was further confirmed that migrating granule neurons identified by slim nuclei in the ML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Yang et al., 2013</xref>) were increased in BTBR mice (<italic>T</italic><sub>10</sub> = 5.716, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S2E</xref>), but the proportion or migrating rate was comparable between groups (<italic>T</italic><sub>10</sub> = 0.679, <italic>P</italic> = 0.073) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S2F</xref>). Bergmann glia play a vital role in granule neuron migration. The soma and fibers of Bergmann glia were clearly stained with S100β and GFAP in each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4D–H</xref>). No aberrations were found in Bergmann glia between groups, neither soma (<italic>T</italic><sub>10</sub> = 0.303, <italic>P</italic> = 0.768) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>) nor fibers (<italic>T</italic><sub>10</sub> = 0.770, <italic>P</italic> = 0.459) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J</xref>). Furthermore, Nissl staining of 3-month old cerebella revealed conspicuous gross morphological changes in BTBR mice, but the neuron density was similar in the ML between groups (data not shown). The boundary of the IGL was well-defined with no stranded cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4K–N</xref>), which indicates that the migration of granule neurons was accomplished, in terms of results.</p>

The Purkinje neurons were labeled with the specific marker of calbindin (CB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A–D,A’–D’</xref>). At P14, Purkinje neurons were arranged in a monolayer, and the bushy dendrites grew into the ML.

However, spine density of PCs in BTBR cerebella was significantly increased (<italic>T</italic><sub>6</sub> = 5.793, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) compared to WT controls, with a close array in dendritic branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6A’<sub><bold>1</bold></sub>-B’<sub><bold>2</bold></sub>,H</xref>). The Dendritic spines exhibit a transformed morphology during their development and maturation, which reflects different synaptic function at different stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Nimchinsky et al., 2002</xref>). The spines are classified into three subtypes, thin, stubby and mushroom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>), and the maturation of the spines was generally assessed. The proportion of the immature long, thin subtype was significantly increased (<italic>T</italic><sub>6</sub> = 6.147, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) in BTBR mice compared to WT mice, and the transitional stubby subtype (<italic>T</italic><sub>6</sub> = 2.617, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and mature wide-headed mushroom spines (<italic>T</italic><sub>6</sub> = 7.738, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6A’<sub><bold>1</bold></sub>-B’<sub><bold>2</bold></sub>,I</xref>). These results demonstrate that the dendrite spine formation of PCs was strongly promoted but the mature process was retarded in BTBR mice.</p>

<title><italic>TRPC</italic> Genes Were Involved in the Impaired Cerebellar Development in BTBR Mice</title>
<p>To examine the underlying mechanism of the abnormal cerebellar development in BTBR mice, we performed RNA- seq in whole cerebella tissue of WT and BTBR mice at P14. We identified 3992 differentially expressed genes (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in BTBR mice, with 1858 upregulated and 2134 downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). For functional annotation, the GO term enrichment of differentially expressed genes was analyzed in biological processes. The top-ranking pathways were primarily involved in central nervous system development, neurogenesis, differentiation, cell development and morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>), which are highly consistent with the abnormal development of the cerebella in BTBR mice. The pathway of negative regulation of nervous system development was noticeable, which are prominently listed and comprehensive in cerebellar development. After further screening using protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>), the critical genes were identified, and significantly increased <italic>TRPC6</italic> was a highly suspicious candidate in BTBR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). <italic>TRPC6</italic> is especially expressed during cerebellar development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Huang et al., 2007</xref>), and it regulates neurogenesis and synaptic formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). PPI networks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>) indicated the direct interaction of <italic>TRPC6</italic> to the changed allele, <italic>Itpr3</italic>, of BTBR mice, suggesting its critical role. The expression was verified using RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). We simultaneously detected <italic>CAMK IV</italic> gene expression, which acts downstream of <italic>TRPC6</italic>, and found that it was upregulated as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). <italic>TRPC3</italic> and <italic>4</italic> were also detected and exhibited decreased and increased expression, respectively, consistent with the RNA-seq results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). Therefore, the RNA-seq suggests that dysregulated <italic>TRPC</italic> expression might contribute to the impaired cerebellar development and might result in more serious disorders over time.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We demonstrated that BTBR mice exhibited severe infancy-onset dystonia-like behaviors with significant impairments in motor coordination and motor learning, which were also observed in patients with ASD. These motor dysfunctions were highly linked to the abnormal development of the cerebellum. The emerging of dystonia-like behavior in BTBR mice coincided with an increasing proliferation of GCPs, which gave rise to enlargement of the EGL in cerebella and enhanced foliation. Besides, Purkinje neurons in BTBR mice were found to have somatic hypotrophy, with increased dendritic spine formation but suppressed spine maturation. <italic>TRPC</italic> was suggested to be responsible for the impaired neurodevelopment and further motor dysfunction. Our observations demonstrated that disturbed cerebellar neurogenesis occurred during the comorbidities of ASD and movement disorders, and attention should be paid to the key role played by <italic>TRPC</italic> protein family for further study and future approaches of therapy.</p>
<p>Motor dysfunction represents a heterogeneous array of non-diagnostic symptoms in ASD. In this study, we identified dystonia-like behavior, such as hyperflexion, clasping and twisting, eliciting by tail suspension in BTBR mice. The abnormal hindlimb clasping or twisting in BTBR mice also caused a defect to hang from a wire grid. Additionally, impaired fine motor skills in ASD patients are highly linked with social symptomatology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">LeBarton and Iverson, 2013</xref>). In agreement with these findings, we report here that BTBR mice exhibited skilled walking pattern deficits using the regularly and irregularly spaced horizontal ladder test. The rotarod task is often regarded as a test of cerebellar coordination and motor ability. WT mice showed better performance on the rotarod task across the consecutive learning test, while BTBR mice exhibited slower learning which might due to the inattention.</p>
<p>Postmortem and functional imaging studies widely identified the cerebellum as one of the most important brain regions associated with motor deficits in ASD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hampson and Blatt, 2015</xref>). The onset of motor deficits in BTBR mice coincided with the critical period of cerebellar development, suggesting abnormalities in the cerebellum as the neural substrate of motor impairments. Haijie Yang reported an increase in cerebellar foliation and larger gross brain volume of BTBR mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). In agreement with this finding, we found that increased cerebellar size and IGL area were obvious compared to the WT mice, with microscopic enhanced foliation. The phenotype was meaningful, for that folia in the cerebellum serve as a broad platform for organizing cerebellar circuits and be critical in sensory-motor tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Sudarov and Joyner, 2007</xref>). Welker suggested it as the fundamental unit of sensorimotor integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Welker, 1990</xref>), and disturbed foliation was involved in defects of motor coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Le Roy-Duflos, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). Inward accumulation of proliferated GCPs is a pivotal driving force in the cerebellar foliation, and the existing mouse model of disturbed foliation demonstrated an aberrant proliferation of GCPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Corrales et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Wefers et al., 2017</xref>). The present study detected increased GCP proliferation and IGL expansion in the BTBR mouse cerebellum. Impaired radial migration was also observed in rodents with increased foliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hosaka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Ryan et al., 2017</xref>), and a dramatic increase in foliation was credited with a prolonged period of migration of GCPs in human cerebella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Sillitoe and Joyner, 2007</xref>). However, Bergmann glia guided migration was not altered in BTBR mice from early postnatal days to adulthood. Thus, the extra lobes of cerebella in BTBR mice are likely arose from over-produced GCPs.</p>
<p>Other reports suggest that PCs also participate in cerebellar foliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Altman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Sudarov and Joyner, 2007</xref>). PCs anchor the outline of the cortex via axonal projections to the underlying WM at positions that define the base of the fissures. Cerebella of BTBR mouse displayed hypotrophic Purkinje neurons at an early developmental period. The abnormal development of granule cells could ultimately regulate the growth of PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Salinas et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Shimada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Sadakata et al., 2004</xref>), and we inferred that the disrupted patterning of Purkinje cells may be secondary to abnormal GC development. We cannot ignore the fact that PCs are the sole efferent neurons in cerebellum which connect to the outer brain and participate in more complicated neural activity. Abnormal PC development determined the dysfunction of cerebella. Parallel fibers extended by granule neurons in the EGL traveled up and stretched to both sides, being parallel to the pial surface in the ML to connect the Purkinje dendrite. Considering the multiplying granule neurons and invariable even decreased PCs, superabundant incoming of information to an individual PC was predictable. Moreover, the synaptic structure identified by dendritic spines in Purkinje neurons was significantly affected because much more spines existed in a lower matured proportion. Synapses were likely overproduced, but the maturation was suppressed. Immature spines commonly aid in the initiation of synaptic contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Dunaevsky et al., 1999</xref>), and mature spines containing an abundance of neurotransmitter receptors are truly to support synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Matsuzaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Nimchinsky et al., 2002</xref>). Abnormal spine formation and maturation would impact the neural circuit and disturb the allomeric function of the brain. Additionally, increasing afferent signal to PCs would inevitably break the physiological balance in transduction, which indicates the critical role played by disturbed information transfer in cerebellar dysfunction.</p>
<p><italic>TRPC</italic> is a non-selective cation channel that dominantly modulates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry pathway and the release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Dietrich and Gudermann, 2007</xref>). <italic>TRPC3</italic>, <italic>4</italic> and <italic>6</italic> belong to the <italic>TRPC</italic> protein family are particularly expressed in cerebella during the first 6 weeks after birth, at the critical neurogenesis period of the cerebellum, to regulate cerebellar development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Huang et al., 2007</xref>).<italic>TRPC3</italic> expression reflects development of the Purkinje cells and <italic>TRPC4</italic> expression is restricted to granule neurons and their precursor. <italic>TRPC6</italic> plays an essential role in G2/M phase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Shi et al., 2009</xref>), and inhibition or activation of <italic>TRPC6</italic> expression suppresses or accelerates cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Cai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Shi et al., 2009</xref>), respectively. Moreover, <italic>TRPC6</italic> participates in the development of dendritic spines and regulates the formation of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>), and inhibition of <italic>TRPC6</italic> reduces dendritic arborization and spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Tai et al., 2008</xref>). The results of RNA-seq analysis indicated that <italic>TRPC</italic> family might be an important regulator involved in the abnormality of cerebellar development of BTBR mice. Moreover, other studies suggest the relationship between <italic>TRPC</italic> and ASD. Wei Li found that <italic>TRPC</italic> signaling was impaired in hippocampal neurons of Mecp2 mutant mice, another ASD mouse model, which led to activity-dependent <italic>BDNF</italic> release disturbances that further accounted for sensory and motor abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Later, Griesi-Oliveira K demonstrated a reduction or haploinsufficiency of the <italic>TRPC6</italic> gene in ASD individuals, which led to impaired neuronal development, morphology, and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Griesi-Oliveira et al., 2015</xref>). These findings imply <italic>TRPC</italic> genes could be novel predisposing genes for ASD to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology mechanism.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We demonstrated that abnormal neurogenesis of cerebella in BTBR mice primarily affected foliation and disturbed synaptic formation, which possibly lead to dystonia-like behavior and motor dysfunction. The <italic>TRPC</italic> family was highly indicated as responsible for the impaired cerebellar development and as a novel predisposing gene for ASD. Therefore, <italic>TRPC</italic> should receive more attention and be further explored to elucidate the pathological process of ASD and possible novel treatments.</p>
