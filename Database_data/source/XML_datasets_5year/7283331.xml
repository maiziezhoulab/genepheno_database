<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Accumulating evidence suggests that gestational exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may interfere with normal brain development and predispose for later dysfunctions. The current study focuses on the exposure impact of mixtures of EDCs that better mimics the real-life situation. We herein describe a mixture of phthalates, pesticides and bisphenol A (mixture N1) detected in pregnant women of the SELMA cohort and associated with language delay in their children. To study the long-term impact of developmental exposure to N1 on brain physiology and behavior we administered this mixture to mice throughout gestation at doses 0×, 0.5×, 10×, 100× and 500× the geometric mean of SELMA mothers’ concentrations, and examined their offspring in adulthood. Mixture N1 exposure increased active coping during swimming stress in both sexes, increased locomotion and reduced social interaction in male progeny. The expression of corticosterone receptors, their regulator <italic>Fkbp5</italic>, corticotropin releasing hormone and its receptor, oxytocin and its receptor, estrogen receptor beta, serotonin receptors (<italic>Htr1a, Htr2a</italic>) and glutamate receptor subunit <italic>Grin2b</italic>, were modified in the limbic system of adult animals, in a region-specific, sexually-dimorphic and experience-dependent manner. Principal component analysis revealed gene clusters associated with the observed behavioral responses, mostly related to the stress axis. This integration of epidemiology-based data with an experimental model increases the evidence that prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures impacts later life brain functions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can interfere with the physiological actions of hormones, resulting in abnormal endocrine functioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Developing organisms are more susceptible to EDCs due to their immature detoxifying systems and the crucial organizational role of hormones in the development of many organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The developing nervous system is significantly impacted by different categories of EDCs including phthalates, phenols and pesticides that disrupt the normal pattern of hormonal actions and neurotransmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In humans, early exposures to these chemicals have been associated with childhood hyperactivity and are considered possible contributors to the emergence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Likewise, in animal studies exposures during development to phthalates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, pesticides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> or bisphenol A (BPA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> can impair hormonal and neurotransmission homeostasis, locomotor activity, emotionality and cognitive function, leading to lifelong or even transgenerational dysfunctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">To date, the list of identified EDCs includes approximately 1000 different chemicals, to which humans and wildlife are exposed through a variety of sources including plastics, pesticides, personal care products, and flame retardants. The prevalence of EDCs in the environment and inside the organisms, as well as the plethora of affected hormonal systems have placed these chemicals in the list of worldwide health challenges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, while most studies test one chemical at the time, in real life organisms are exposed to many EDCs simultaneously. In mixtures, EDCs might have additive, synergistic or opposing effects, as shown by previous studies examining the impact of single EDCs and their mixtures. While a number of studies have addressed mixture effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, sparse evidence has been reported for the effects of EDC mixtures on the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Accordingly, in order to appropriately address the mixture issue in chemical risk assessment, more information are needed on the impact of chemical mixtures following exposure protocols mimicking real-life human conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">By combining epidemiology data from the Swedish Environmental, Longitudinal, Mother and child, Asthma and allergy (SELMA) pregnancy cohort study with advanced biostatistics, Bornehag <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. defined a number of EDC mixtures that were associated with adverse outcomes in metabolism and growth, sexual development and neurodevelopment of the prenatally exposed children. In the frame of the EDC-MixRisk Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://edcmixrisk.ki.se/">https://edcmixrisk.ki.se/</ext-link>), these mixtures were then tested in animal and cellular models by keeping exposure rates comparable to the human situation. The results obtained so far show substantial similarity of the affected health outcomes between humans and experimental models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The first neurodevelopment-associated mixture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> has been tested in several experimental systems that did not include an <italic>in vivo</italic> mammalian model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. This mixture has been expanded with the inclusion of additional potentially-harmful chemicals based on further analysis of the SELMA study data to constitute mixture N1.</p>
<p id="Par5">In the present study, we describe a refined neurodevelopment-associated mixture, mixture N1, whose components were detected in urine and serum of pregnant women from the SELMA study and were associated with language delay in their 2.5-years old children. The human exposure to mixture N1 was simulated in mice and the long-term effects of mixture exposure were examined in adult offspring at the behavioral and gene expression level. We thus exposed pregnant mice at doses of mixture N1 representing 0×, 0.5×, 10×, 100× and 500× the geometric mean of the levels measured in the SELMA mothers. A battery of behavioral assays was selected to assess anxiety, sociability, learning and stress coping of the adult male and female offspring, as these behaviors comprise a broad phenotype and are frequently targeted by several EDCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Based on the behavioral outcomes we then chose a number of relevant genes and examined their expression in areas of the limbic system known to be involved in the aforementioned behaviors. From the plethora of potentially implicated genes we favoured genes related to the Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) axis function since it interferes with the aforementioned behaviors and because we<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> have previously shown that it is impacted by early-life exposures to EDCs, such as BPA, a chemical included in mixture N1. Specifically, <italic>Nr3c1</italic> and <italic>Nr3c2</italic> genes encode for corticosterone receptors (GR and MR) two key mediators of HPA axis activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> in interaction with CRH and its receptor CRHR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. GRs are negatively regulated by FKBP5 that in turn is a common target of EDCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Emotionality and stress coping strategy is also fine-tuned by the serotonin receptors HTR1a and 2a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, while the glutamate receptor subunit GRIN2b is implicated in EDC-mediated neurotoxicity and neurodevelopmental disorders in children including language, motor and learning deficits, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Oxytocin and its receptor are regulators of anxiety-related behaviors and sociability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, while the expression of many of the abovementioned molecules is controlled by estrogen receptor beta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Due to the plasticity of the limbic system to new experiences, the mixture effect on gene expression was examined in matched siblings a) under basal conditions and b) following the behavioral tests, in order to further investigate the potential impact of <italic>in utero</italic> exposure to mixture N1 on the new-experience-induced brain plasticity. Furthermore, both sexes were included in our study in order to detect any sex-specific effects of mixture N1 exposure on behavior and brain gene expression.</p>

<title>In utero exposure to mixture N1 modified the expression of behavior-relevant genes</title>
<p id="Par8">Based on the behavioral outcomes, we investigated whether the <italic>in utero</italic> treatment modified the expression levels of genes related to these behaviors in the brain of adult offspring, compared to DMSO-treated mice. The effect of mixture N1 on gene expression was analyzed in adult siblings that were either not subjected to any behavioral testing (referred to as Basal animals) or exposed to behavioral testing and sacrificed 30 min from the swimming stress onset (further on referred as Beh. tested animals) vs. the respective DMSO offspring (Basal or Beh. tested). The inclusion of these two conditions (Basal vs. Behavioral testing) aimed to test whether a later life experience (the behavioral examination in adulthood) impacts on gene expression differently upon developmental exposure to mixture N1.</p>
<p id="Par9">In the hypothalamus, the expression of all genes studied (<italic>Nr3c1, Crh, Fkbp5, Oxt, Esr2</italic>) was modified by mixture N1 mostly in male offspring (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>).

In contrast, under both basal and behavioral testing conditions, increased mRNA levels were detected for <italic>Crh</italic> (F<sub>4,58</sub> = 4.645, P = 0.003) in 100× group (p = 0.011), <italic>Oxt</italic> (F<sub>4,58</sub> = 9.720, P &lt; 0.001) in 100×(p &lt; 0.001) and 500×(p = 0.001) groups and for <italic>Esr2</italic> (F<sub>4,58</sub> = 9.066, P &lt; 0.001) in 100× group (p &lt; 0.001).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par18">Previous epidemiological and experimental evidence have associated perinatal exposure to individual EDCs, such as BPA and phthalates, with neurodevelopmental modifications that may impact later life brain function and behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However a limited number of experimental studies have so far examined the impact of mixtures of EDCs on the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Another gap in the current literature is the absence of experimental studies simulating the conditions of human gestational exposure to mixtures of EDCs that have been previously associated with a particular neurodevelopmental dysfunction in children. To address this issue, we have used a mixture of EDCs or suspected EDCs that are associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children (language delay)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> to study its long term neurobehavioral effects following gestational exposure in mice. Although the language delay cannot be modeled in animals, <italic>in utero</italic> exposure of mice to mixture N1 significantly modified their behavior and brain transcriptional activity in adulthood. The mixture-induced changes, detected at 0.5×− 500× of the SELMA pregnant women exposure levels, appear sexually dimorphic, brain area specific and some of them are modified by adult life experiences.</p>
<p id="Par19">The male offspring phenotype is reminiscent of hyperactivity as deduced from the increased struggling during forced swimming stress and the increased locomotion in the open field. Hyperactivity has also been reported in children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and rodents exposed to bisphenol A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, as well as in rat pups exposed to a mixture of flame retardants and phthalates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Notably, hyperactivity is a trait often seen in animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders including ADHD, schizophrenia and ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. In addition, reduced social interaction was observed in male offspring exposed to the N1 mixture. This phenotype could be attributed either to reduced interest for other con-specifics or to social phobia and withdrawal. Aberrant social behavior has been also reported in rats chronically exposed to phthalates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> and the emergence of ASD in humans has been linked to early life exposure to phthalates or other anthropogenic environmental toxicants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par20">Gene expression changes measured in the male offspring exposed to mixture N1 indicate a hyperactive stress response system and are consistent with their behavioral phenotype. Specifically, the increased <italic>Crh</italic> and the reduced <italic>Nr3c1</italic> levels in the hypothalamus suggest a heightened stimulation of the HPA axis and a reduced negative feedback, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. <italic>Crh</italic> overexpression in mice leads to increased active coping behavior in the forced swimming paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, whereas hypothalamic <italic>Crh</italic> depletion has anxiolytic effects in the open field test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The offspring hyperactivity is further primed following the behavioral testing experience as indicated by the higher levels of hypothalamic <italic>Fkbp5</italic>, encoding a negative regulator of GR activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. The increased HPA axis activity detected in male offspring may also lead to social phobia and reduced social interaction of these animals. The increased oxytocin expression detected in the hypothalamus of mixture-exposed males does not necessarily connect with the social interaction deficit of these offspring. The enhancing role of oxytocin in social behavior has been documented particularly regarding hippocampal circuits for memory retention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> and this role is facilitated by estrogen receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. However, other hormones, such as vasopressin, and neurotransmitters at different brain areas seem to have a role in sociability of rodents. In support of this, oxytocin-KO male mice exhibit altered hippocampal gene expression and a higher social interaction score than their wild type counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Considering the heightened HPA stimulation of the mixture N1male offspring, the increased levels of oxytocin detected in their hypothalamus could represent a compensatory mechanism towards resilience, based on the reciprocal interplay between oxytocin and CRH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Notably, sexually dimorphic effects on the expression of hypothalamic oxytocin and estrogen receptors have been also reported following gestational BPA exposure in rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par21">The hippocampus is a limbic area that regulates the stress axis as well as learning and memory processes. The ratio of the two types of corticosterone receptors GR and MR in this area fine-tunes the different phases of the corticolimbic stress response with MRs having a critical contribution in optimizing coping strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. GR gene expression is prone to various developmental insults including EDCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The detected imbalance of <italic>Nr3c1</italic>/<italic>Nr3c2</italic> expression ratio in male offspring exposed to mixture N1 suggests a disturbed GR/MR control over the limbic‐cortical stress pathways and a compromised stress response. The modified ratio of the serotonin receptors <italic>Htr1a</italic> and <italic>2a</italic> in favor of the <italic>Htr2a</italic> that is associated with the adoption of an active coping style<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> could further support the exaggerated active behavioral response of these animals. The similarity in the pattern of male gene expression in the hippocampus and amygdala (reduced <italic>Nr3c2</italic> and <italic>Htr1a</italic> expression) suggests a concerted action of these two limbic structures in the observed behavioral phenotypes. On the other hand, gene expression modifications towards resilience were also detected in male offspring, such as the increased levels of <italic>Oxt</italic> in the hypothalamus to compensate the increased <italic>Crh</italic> levels and the reduced levels of <italic>Crhr1</italic> in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex and thus lower anxiogenic stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par22">In contrast to males, female offspring exposed to mixture N1 exhibited no alterations in the expression of the analyzed genes in the hypothalamus or the hippocampus, a finding compatible with the milder behavioral alterations detected in these animals. However, the increased amygdalar <italic>Nr3c1</italic> expression and the increased <italic>Nr3c1/ Nr3c2</italic> ratio in both the hippocampus and amygdala, could explain the detected alterations in the stress coping of these animals. On the other hand, the increased expression of <italic>Oxtr</italic> in the amygdala may have conferred to the alleviation of anxiety-related impact on female locomotion and sociability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> in which no significant changes were detected vs. DMSO-treated animals. Notably, in female amygdala, the increased expression of <italic>Nr3c1</italic> as well as that of the serotonin receptors <italic>Htr1a</italic> and <italic>2a</italic> were detected only as a result of the behavioral testing, suggesting the presence of long term effects of gestational exposure to mixture N1 that are manifested only following exposure to challenges/stressors in adulthood.</p>
<p id="Par23"><italic>Grin2b</italic> expression has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> and epigenetic modifications on its gene have been detected following BPA exposures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. The prefrontal cortex is continuously integrating information processed by the HPA axis and the limbic system to adjust executive functions and to maintain behavioral homeostasis. In this area, mixture N1 exposure decreased the expression of <italic>Htr2a</italic> and <italic>Grin2b</italic> in both sexes under basal conditions. Interestingly, the mixture-induced reduction in the levels of <italic>Htr2a</italic> and <italic>Grin2b</italic> in the prefrontal cortex was not detected in the Beh. tested animals due to an increase in the mixture-treated groups not found in the DMSO group. This observation further implies the presence of long term effects of gestational exposure to mixture N1 that are manifested only following challenges later in life.</p>
<p id="Par24">The developing adrenal gland is a target tissue for many EDCs, including phthalates and BPA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. In the present study, gestational exposure to mixture N1 impacted adrenal physiology of the offspring in terms of adrenal weight, steroidogenic enzymes and ACTH receptors. Yet, no significant effect of the mixture was detected on serum corticosterone or ACTH levels, both under basal conditions and at 30 min from stress onset. However, a stressor-induced change in stress hormone levels in mixture-exposed offspring cannot be excluded based on the one time-point measurements following stress exposure, and a more detailed investigation is required, which was beyond the scope of the present study. Accumulating evidence suggests that the effects of individual EDCs can differ from the ones they have as part of a mixture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Accordingly, no direct comparisons can be made on the toxicity-relevant doses of individual chemical disruptors and their combination. The fact that our results on adrenal weight are in agreement with those found in developmentally BPA exposed rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, whereas the ones on steroidogenic enzymes and corticosterone levels are not similar to those reported for BPA exposures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, further support the differential impact of individual chemicals compared to mixtures.</p>
<p id="Par25">In the present study we examined the behavioral phenotype of mice developmentally exposed to mixture N1 using an array of behavioral tests and we also determined the expression of a handful of genes known to influence these behaviors. Given that behavioral responses are regulated by a plethora of genes expressed in different brain areas, we applied Principal component analysis (PCA) to reveal gene clusters associated with the observed behavioral outcomes. Correlations implicated mostly the receptors for glucocorticoids, corticotropin and serotonin. These molecules are important regulators of the stress response and emotionality, which further supports that the identified correlations are biologically relevant. Yet, we cannot exclude the important role of other genes not examined in this study or a potential impact of EDCs on the maternal behavior of exposed dams, which could affect both behavior and stress related gene expression in their offspring;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> factors that obviously worth further survey.</p>
<p id="Par26">Interestingly, PCA indicated that in the two sexes different sets of genes and hormones were correlated with active coping in FSS. This implies that, although prenatal EDC exposure leads to similar alterations in the FSS behavior in the two sexes (increased struggling behavior), the underlying biochemical/molecular pathways are diverse. This finding corroborates the view that effects of EDC exposure should be assessed in both females and males, as the implicated cellular pathways might be dissimilar. Overall the present study provides evidence that a human health-relevant mixture of EDCs can lead to long term alterations in mice behavior by modifying gene expression in their brains. Given the increasing concern regarding the long term health consequences stemming from early-life exposures to anthropogenic toxicants, the integrated use of epidemiology and experimental biology tools may be helpful to identify the implicated molecular events and improve the risk assessment strategies.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p id="Par27">SELMA is a pregnancy cohort conducted in Sweden. All research was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines/regulations. All activities in SELMA meet Swedish national law and ethics requirements regarding recruitment of participants (children and families), collection of human samples, health examination, collection of data by the use of interviews, questionnaires, registers, etc., biobanking of human samples and analyses of biosamples, storing of data in a database, and principles for publications and reports. Participation in the SELMA study was strictly voluntary and informed consent was obtained from all the participants involved. The recruitment procedure and consent forms have been approved by the ethics board of Uppsala, Sweden (DNR 2007/062 and DNR 2015/177). SELMA is collecting and storing sensitive data in a database. All data/information and samples in the database is coded (bar-code) according to Swedish law and European GDPR 2016/679.</p>
<p id="Par28">To establish Mixture N1, we used data for the levels of 54 chemicals with known or suspected EDC action (compounds or metabolites) in urine and serum from 2,354 women in the SELMA study at median pregnancy week 10; 41 of these compounds were identified above level of quantification (LOQ) in at least 50% of the mothers. For the neurodevelopmental tests performed in children at 2.5 years of age, data were assessed from a standardized nurse examination in combination with parentally completed questionnaires (N = 1,113)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. By the use of weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression, we identified among the selected 41 chemicals, those associated with language delay in children at 2.5 years of age (chemicals of concern).We then estimated the daily intake (DI) of identified urinary chemicals of concern by the use of data from 2,300 pregnant women, the plasma concentrations from the DI estimates, and finally the geometric means of both urinary and serum of these chemicals to establish the mixing proportions. In the final step we established a real mixture (Mixture N1) to be tested in the animal model.</p>
<p id="Par29">Phthalates’ active monoesters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> were used to prepare the mixture for mice. The chemicals were purchased from the following sources: Bisphenol A (BPA; 99%), Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; 99.9%), Monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP; 98%), 3-Phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA; 98%), and Trichloropyridinol (TCP; 99%)were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Monoethyl phthalate (MEP; 98%)and mono-iso-decyl phthalate (MiDP; 98%) were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, ON, Canada).Mono-(2-propylheptyl)-phthalate(MPHP, 99%) were synthesized by Novandi Chemistry AB, Södertälje, Sweden. Monobutyl phthalate (MBP; 95%) was purchased from TCI, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd (Japan). pp’DDE was synthesized in house by Åke Bergman from DDT. For MIX N1, 1 M solutions in DMSO were prepared of each of the chemicals: BPA, MEP, MBP, BBzP, MIDP, MPHP, 3-PBA, and TCP. A 50/50 mixture of MIDP and MPHP was used.

The range of litter sizes and the sex composition per treatment group were as follows: DMSO 7-10 pups (25 males, 21 females), 0.5 × 7–12 pups (31 m, 26 f), 10 × 6–10 pups (26 m, 22 f), 100 × 7–10 pups (27 m, 23 f), 500 × 5–11 pups (30 m, 25 f). The sex ratio did not differ among groups F<sub>4,29</sub> = 0.030, P = 0.998). In order to behaviorally characterize the offspring in adulthood (PND90), one - three animals per sex and litter from each exposure group were randomly selected to undergo behavioral testing and the rest to remain undisturbed (Basal animals). The number of animals assigned for the behavioral tests per treatment group and sex (m, f), were as follows: DMSO 14 m,12 f; 0.5×10 m, 12 f; 10×12 m 12 f; 100×10 m, 13 f; 500 × 12 m, 11 f. All Behaviorally tested animals were subjected to the same battery of behavioral tasks in an order taking into account a. the compatibility of tests (e.g. open field can serve as an accommodation phase for social interaction) and b. the degree of stressfulness of the task i.e. forced swimming stress being the last one employed. Behavioral tests were conducted, over a period of eight days in the following order: elevated plus maze (day 1), open field (day 2), social interaction (days 3 and 4), novel object location (day 5). The tested animals were then left undisturbed for the next two days (days 6 and 7) and then (day 8) were subjected to forced swimming stress (FSS).The animals were sacrificed 30 min from the FSS onset, in order to investigate their hormonal response to an acute stress. Littermates not behaviorally tested (Basal) were sacrificed along with those Behaviorally tested. Euthanasia was conducted between 9.00 to 12.00 am under isoflurane anesthesia. Trunk blood was collected for hormone level determination. The pituitary and the brain were rapidly removed from the scull and the relevant brain areas (hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala and prefrontal cortex) were isolated on a frozen surface, snap-frozen in dry ice-cooled isopentane and transferred to −80<sup>0</sup>C until use. The adrenals were placed in pre-weighted vials and immediately frozen. The estrous phase of females was recorded by macroscopic observation during the behavioral tests in order to minimize animal stress and by vaginal smears at sacrifice.</p>

<title>Behavioral tests</title>
<p id="Par34">All behavioral tests were performed during the light period between 9.00 to 12.00 am in order to avoid “ceiling”-effects in behaviors such as mobility since mice show increased activity during the dark phase of the diurnal cycle, as well as to be able to compare our results with those in the literature and establish a trustworthy base-line for the DMSO-treated group. Behaviors were recorded using an Everio GZ-MS110 Memory Camera (<italic>JVC</italic>) and the recorded videos were analyzed by three different observers, blind to the treatment of each subject.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec12">
<title>Elevated plus maze</title>
<p id="Par35">The test was conducted according to Segklia <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. The number of entries and the time spent (sec) in either the open or the enclosed arms was counted. The time spent in the open arms is indicative of the level of anxiety of the mouse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec13">
<title>Open field test</title>
<p id="Par36">The test was conducted in a square Plexiglas box (40 × 40 × 40 cm); the mouse was gently placed in the center of the arena and left to move freely for 5 min to capture the critical components of general exploratory locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. The total locomotion of the subjects was evaluated by using the Ethovision XT-7 software (NOLDUS). The time spent in the center and in the periphery of the arena, indicating reduced or increased anxiety levels, respectively, were also measured. In addition, the frequency and duration of unsupported rearings (standing on the hind legs without any support) that is negatively related to anxiety was also recorded manually.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec14">
<title>The social interaction test</title>
<p id="Par37">The test was conducted in the same open square box used for the open field. The box was separated into two “chambers” of equal dimensions (40 × 20 × 30 cm) connected with a smaller corridor. In each chamber a mesh-wire cage was placed near the wall opposite to the corridor (5 cm distance between the wall and the cage) in equal distance from the other two walls. Habituation was performed for 5 min in the set-up and 24 h later, an unknown mouse of the same sex as the tested animal was placed in one of the cages (counterbalanced between cohorts) and the test animal was placed again in the corridor of the set-up and left to explore the set-up for five minutes. The time spent in close proximity to the unknown con-specific as well as the time spent in close proximity to the empty cage have been determined. Animals not exploring the two cages for at least 10 sec have been excluded from any further analysis (3 males and 2 females, distributed in various dose-groups). A Discrimination Index was calculated according to the following formula: Time spent in close proximity to the cage with the unknown con-specific/Total time spent in close proximity to either cage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec15">
<title>The novel object location (NOL) test</title>
<p id="Par38">The test was conducted in the same square box used for the open field test (40 × 40 × 40 cm) according to Denninger <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>.The time each mouse spent exploring each one of the two objects, the one in its original position and the one in a new position was recorded and the Discrimination Index was calculated according to the following formula: Time spent exploring the object in new position/Total time spent exploring both objects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec16">
<title>Forced swimming stress (FSS)</title>
<p id="Par39">Each mouse was subjected for 10 min to inescapable swimming in a glass beaker (24 cm in height; 15 cm in diameter) containing tap water (24 °C) to a depth of 17 cm. The duration of the following behaviors was measured: struggling (climbing towards the walls, having the body mostly in a vertical position and rippling the water with the front legs), swimming (moving more than one leg, with the body mostly in horizontal position) and floating (staying immobile or moving only one leg in order to remain at the surface).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec17">
<title>Analysis of gene expression</title>
<p id="Par40">The procedure was conducted as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The samples from same-sex siblings that belonged to the same treatment group were pooled prior to mRNA extractions. The number of samples used for qPCR were as follows: In males, DMSO: 7 Basal/7 Beh. T, 0.5×: 7/4–6, 10×: 5–6/6, 100×: 5–6/6, 500×: 5–6/6–7. In females, DMSO: 5 Basal/7–8 Beh. T, 0.5×: 7/6, 10×: 5/5–6, 100×: 6–7/6–7, 500×: 6–7/7. Primers for the analyzed genes were either designed using publicly available software or selected from the PrimerBank database (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S8</xref>). Relative gene expression was calculated using the raw Ct data and <italic>β-actin</italic> as reference gene; an additional reference gene (G<italic>apdh</italic>) has been evaluated but the variability of its expression levels was greater than that of <italic>β-actin</italic>. For each gene analyzed, within each qPCR plate we included certain samples derived from DMSO exposed animals (Basal and Beh. tested), which served as internal controls in order to normalize gene expression data across qPCR runs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec18">
<title>Hormonal determinations</title>
<p id="Par41">The collected trunk blood samples from both Basal animals and animals following FSS were centrifuged at 5,000 g for 10 min and the serum was kept at −80 °C until use. Serum corticosterone levels were determined using the MP Biomedicals LLC (USA) RIA kit for small rodents (sensitivity 1.25 ng/ml, intra-assay variation 4.4%, inter assay variation 6.5%), according to the directions of the manufacturer. Serum ACTH levels were determined by a mouse ACTH-specific ELISA kit (Elabscience Biotechnology Inc. USA; sensitivity 9.38 pg/ml, detection range 15.63–1000 pg/ml, coefficient of variation &lt;10%), following the kit protocol.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec19">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p id="Par42">Behavioral data have been analyzed by generalized linear models (GLM), with the dose of N1 (treatment), sex and treatment × sex as predictor factors and the treatment (litter) as a build nested predictor factor. In the case of statistically significant dose effects, Bonferroni <italic>post hoc</italic> tests were used to determine specific group differences. For the analyses of qPCR and hormonal data, the data or samples from same-sex siblings that belonged to the same treatment group were pooled, so that the litter was the unit in the statistics. Normality tests and outliers were explored via SPSS 22.0. Three-way ANOVA for the effect of exposure to mixture N1, of behavioral testing and of sex was used, followed, when appropriate, by Dunnett’s post hoc test for the effect of mixture exposure compared to DMSO exposure. Females were classified as having ‘high estrogen levels’ (late methestrus and proestrus) or ‘low estrogen levels’ for the rest of the menstrual cycle phases and the effect of estrogen levels was included as a covariate. Significance was accepted for P values &lt; 0.05.</p>
<p id="Par43">Principal component analyses (PCA) were performed A. over the levels of struggling behavior in FSS and the gene expression and hormonal levels following FSS (Beh. tested animals) and B. over levels of mobility in the open field or social interaction (which have preceded FSS by some days) and the gene expression levels following FSS of those genes not affected by the exposure to behavioral testing, as we could not know when the observed alterations in the rest of the genes have appeared i.e. if they have preceded or not open field testing or social interaction. For these analyses, behavioral scores of siblings have been averaged. For the PCA the Direct Oblimean rotation method has been used with the maximum number of iterations for convergence set at 100 and the threshold cut-off for coefficient set at 0.4.</p>
