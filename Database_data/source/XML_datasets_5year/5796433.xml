<p id="P1">Viral infection during pregnancy is correlated with increased frequency of
neurodevelopmental disorders. This phenomenon has been studied in mice prenatally
subjected to maternal immune activation (MIA). We previously showed that maternal T
helper 17 (Th17) cells promote the development of cortical and behavioral abnormalities
in MIA-affected offspring. Here, we show that cortical abnormalities are preferentially
localized to a region encompassing the dysgranular zone of the primary somatosensory
cortex (S1DZ). Moreover, activation of pyramidal neurons in this cortical region was
sufficient to induce MIA-associated behavioral phenotypes in wild-type animals, while
reduction in neural activity rescued the behavioral abnormalities in MIA-affected
offspring. Furthermore, sociability and repetitive behavioral phenotypes could be
selectively modulated according to the efferent targets of S1DZ. Our work identifies a
cortical region primarily, if not exclusively, centered on the S1DZ as the major node of
a neural network that mediates behavioral abnormalities observed in offspring exposed to
maternal inflammation.</p>
<p id="P2">In humans, viral infection during pregnancy has been correlated with increased
frequency of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.
This phenomenon has been modeled in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. We previously
reported that the offspring from pregnant dams injected with polyinosinic:polycytidylic
acid (poly(I:C)), which mimics viral infection, on embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) exhibit
behavioral abnormalities including abnormal communication, increased repetitive
behaviors, and deficits in sociability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In parallel to the behavioral abnormalities, we also observed that
MIA-affected offspring display patches of disorganized cortical cytoarchitecture during
embryonic development as well as in adulthood. The cortical phenotype was manifested as
a loss of the cortical layer-specific markers special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2
(SATB2) and T-brain-1 (TBR1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.
Development of both MIA-associated behavioral phenotypes (MIA behaviors) and cortical
patches were prevented by knocking out a key transcriptional regulator of Th17 cells,
retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma t (RORγt), in
maternal T-cells, or by inhibiting the activity of their effector cytokine IL-17a in
pregnant dams<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. These observations
suggested that the maternal Th17 cell/IL-17a pathway is crucial for inducing MIA
behaviors and for generating cortical patches in the offspring. However, whether the
cortical phenotype is the underlying cause of the behavioral abnormalities in MIA
offspring remained undetermined.</p>
<sec id="S1">
<title>Characterization of cortical patches</title>
<p id="P3">We first wished to determine the distribution of cortical patches in the
brains of adult MIA offspring by matching the locations of cortical regions that
lack expression of SATB2 or TBR1 to those in a reference mouse brain atlas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Cortical patches found in individual animals often
retained similar mediolateral (ML) and dorsoventral (DV) coordinates through serial
coronal sections, suggesting that many form a single continuous patch extending
along the AP axis, rather than forming a series of independent patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Although cortical patches
were detected at multiple locations throughout the cortex, they were prevalently
observed in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) at the anteroposterior (AP) level
~0.5 mm posterior to the Bregma (AP=−0.5 mm) (90 %
of animals, N=10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>), as well as in the
secondary motor cortex (M2) and other cortical regions, including the temporal
association area (TeA) (80% and 40% of animals, respectively,
N=10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). Cortical patches were also most
predominantly present in S1 with respect to both their number and sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>), and often present in S1
unilaterally (60% of animals, N=10). Furthermore, registration of
cortical patches in individual MIA animals onto the same reference plane near
~AP −0.5mm revealed that the cortical patches most consistently
centered on S1DZ, a region of the primary somatosensory cortex that is
morphologically characterized by the absence of a discernible 4th cortical layer and
implicated in muscle- and joint-related functions (56% of animals,
N=50) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 1c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Based on
these results, we decided to carry out further analysis on S1 patches near
~AP−0.5 mm.</p>
<p id="P4">Deficits in interneuron function or dys-regulation of neural activity in the
somatosensory pathway have been previously associated with both genetic and
environmental mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. On a similar note, we found that S1 cortical patches of MIA
offspring display a specific loss of PV expression, which marks a class of
interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. This deficit in PV expression could reflect
either the loss of PV protein expression or the loss of neurons marked by PV. We
observed no significant differences in the expression of the neuron-specific marker
NeuN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> or of the
vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> which is expressed in interneurons derived from the caudal
ganglionic eminence, between PBS control and MIA offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 1d, e</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended
Data Fig. 3a,b</xref>). To test whether the decrease in the number of
PV<sup>+</sup> neurons results in a diminished inhibitory drive onto S1
pyramidal neurons, we used whole-cell patch clamp recordings to measure the
miniature Inhibitory Post-Synaptic Currents (mIPSCs) in S1 pyramidal neurons of PBS
or MIA offspring. We indeed observed a reduction in frequency, but not amplitude, of
mIPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 3c–h</xref>)
paralleled by an increase in the number of S1 neurons that express c-Fos, a marker
of neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 1f, g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig. 3i, j</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Cortical patches are predictive of MIA behaviors</title>
<p id="P5">In order to determine whether the development of MIA-associated behaviors and
the appearance of cortical patches depend on the developmental timing at which MIA
is induced, we injected poly(I:C) into pregnant dams at embryonic stages E12.5,
E15.5, or E18.5, and assessed their offspring for MIA-associated behavioral
phenotypes. We first examined the offspring’s ability to communicate by
measuring the ultrasonic vocalization (USV) made by pups upon separation from their
mothers at postnatal day 9 (P9). As previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, pups from pregnant dams injected with
poly(I:C) at E12.5 (MIA offspring) emitted more USV calls than pups from
PBS-injected dams (PBS offspring). However, such an increase was not observed in the
offspring from dams injected with poly(I:C) either at E15.5 or E18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 4d–g</xref>). We also examined
repetitive behaviors using the marble-burying assay, natural inclination towards
social targets with the sociability assay as well as anxiety-related behaviors by
measuring the time spent by adult MIA offspring at the center of an open field
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 4a–c</xref>). For all
behaviors, we observed deficits in the offspring when exposed to prenatal MIA at
E12.5. Again, the offspring’s behaviors from mothers injected with poly(I:C)
either at E15.5 or E18.5 were indistinguishable from those from PBS-injected mothers
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 4h–n</xref>), except
for a reduction observed in the center time during the open field assay for
offspring exposed to MIA at E15.5. Importantly, chamber preference during
habituation and the total interaction time during the sociability assay and the
total distance traveled during the sociability and open field assays were similar
between the different treatment groups suggesting that differences in activity or
arousal levels cannot explain the observed behavioral differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 4i, k, l, n</xref>). Our data strongly
indicate that all behavioral abnormalities emerge from a discrete developmental
stage, allowing us to examine whether the presence of cortical patches is predictive
of MIA behavioral phenotypes. Indeed we observed cortical patches in the S1 in
79% of offspring from dams injected with poly(I:C), but not PBS, at E12.5.
Yet, cortical patches were seen only in 13% or none of the offspring when
poly(I:C) was administered at E15.5 or E18.5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 2a</xref>). Thus, maternal-inflammation induced at E15.5 and
E18.5, unlike at E12.5, was ineffective in generating cortical patches and also
failed to produce behavioral abnormalities in MIA offspring. Furthermore, the size
of the S1 cortical patches correlated with the severity of behavioral phenotypes:
the cortical patch sizes ranged between 0 (absence of the cortical patch) and 1
mm<sup>2</sup> and were positively correlated with the marble burying index,
while negatively correlated with both sociability and time spent in the center of an
open field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 2b–d</xref>). The total
distance traveled during the sociability assay was not affected by patch size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 2e</xref>). The size of cortical patches found
outside of S1 also did not correlate with the severity of behavioral abnormalities
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Extended Data Fig. 4o–q</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">The accompanying paper by Kim et al. demonstrates that a single species of
bacteria – segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) – present in C57BL/6
animals bred by Taconic Biosciences, but not in those from Jackson Laboratory, is
required in mothers to induce behavioral abnormalities in MIA offspring (Kim et al.,
accompanying paper). All animals used in this study were also from mouse colonies
carrying SFB. In accordance with our observation above, we found that the size of
cortical patches in MIA offspring from SFB-present (SFB<sup>+</sup>) dams
was highly correlated with the severity of the offspring’s behavioral
phenotypes, but not with the total distance traveled during the behavioral assay
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 2f–i</xref>). On the other hand,
offspring from SFB-absent (SFB<sup>−</sup>), MIA-exposed mothers did not
exhibit S1 cortical patches.</p>
<p id="P7">Lastly, we previously showed that recombinant IL-17a injected into the
ventricles of the developing brain requires intact IL-17a receptor subunit A
(IL-17Ra) expression in the fetus to induce MIA-associated phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. We also previously noted that
IL-17Ra expression is upregulated in the cortical plate upon MIA. This induction is
mostly restricted to ankyrin-3 (Ank3)<sup>+</sup> and
NeuN<sup>+</sup> postmitotic neurons, but not paired box 6
(Pax6)<sup>+</sup> neuronal progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In line
with this observation, knocking-out IL-17Ra in offspring using a Cre driver line
specific for the nervous system – Nestin-Cre<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> – prevented the development of S1
cortical patches and the associated phenotypes; loss of SATB2 and PV expression or
increase in the number of c-Fos<sup>+</sup> neurons was not observed in
these animals. As expected, brain-specific abrogation of IL-17Ra in offspring also
rescued MIA-induced behavioral abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended
Data Fig. 5b–j</xref>). Together, these data collectively show that the
presence of cortical patches is highly predictive of MIA-induced behaviors. They
further suggest that timing of inflammation, composition of maternal gut bacteria as
well as IL-17Ra expression in the fetal brain dictate the severity of MIA-induced
behavioral phenotypes in the offspring by contributing to the formation of S1
cortical patches.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Increasing neural activity in the S1DZ region drives MIA behaviors</title>
<p id="P8">Our characterization of cortical patches indicated that an increase in the
overall neural activity within S1 could be a major factor driving abnormal
behavioral phenotypes in MIA offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 1f,
g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Extended Data Fig.
3c–j</xref>). Indeed, previous studies suggested that deficits in
interneuron development and subsequent perturbations of excitation/inhibition (E/I)
balance could be the underlying cause(s) of neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. We thus asked if increasing neural activity in S1 could
recapitulate MIA-induced behaviors in WT adult animals. We virally expressed either
Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (EYFP), channelrhodopsin (ChR2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, or halorhodopsin (NpHR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> using the neuron-specific
promoter, human Synapsin 1 (hSyn1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 3c</xref>
and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). Both the virus and
the optical fibers were bilaterally targeted to a region centered on S1DZ (S1DZ
region), where cortical patches were most consistently observed in MIA animals
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 3a</xref>). Animals were subsequently
subjected to the behavioral assays described above, while receiving optical
stimulation at 3-minutes intervals (a 3 minute-‘On’ session followed
by a 3 minute-‘Off’ session or vice versa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 3b</xref>). Increasing neural activity with ChR2 in
wild-type (WT) offspring resulted in enhanced marble burying behaviors, impaired
sociability without any effects on total interaction time, and reduced time spent at
the center of an open field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 3d–h</xref>
and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). On the other hand,
photostimulation of EYFP-expressing neurons in the control group failed to induce
any MIA-associated behaviors. Furthermore, reducing neural activity in S1 using NpHR
did not generate behavioral abnormalities, with the exception of a slight, yet
significant, increase in marble burying behavior compared to the EYFP-expressing
control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 3e</xref>). This effect is likely
due to non-specific inhibition of different types of neurons in the photostimulated
region. Therefore, to specifically isolate the contribution of only excitatory
glutamatergic neurons, we used a Cre-dependent strategy to express opsins under the
control of the vesicular Glutamate Transporter 2 promoter (vGluT2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 3i</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Increasing activity of vGluT2<sup>+</sup> neurons
using ChR2 recapitulated all three MIA-associated behaviors, while photostimulation
in NpHR- or EYFP-expressing animals failed to induce these behavioral abnormalities
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig 3j–n</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 7a–f</xref>). We also selectively modulated
neural activity in PV<sup>+</sup> neurons by virally driving Cre-dependent
opsin expression in PV-Cre animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig.
3o</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Inhibiting
the activity of the PV<sup>+</sup> neuronal population with NpHR mimicked
the decrease in the number of PV<sup>+</sup> neurons observed in the
MIA-cortical patches and recapitulated all three MIA-associated behavioral
phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 3p–t</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 7g–l</xref>). On the other
hand, photostimulation of EYFP- or ChR2-expressing animals did not produce any
observable deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 3q–t</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">We next examined whether the ability to drive these MIA behaviors is a
general feature of S1 or is specific to the S1DZ region
(~AP=−0.5), where we predominantly observed cortical
patches. We targeted ChR2 and optical implants into four additional anterior and
posterior regions of S1, while keeping the ML coordinates consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 8a–c</xref>).
Photostimulation of these off-target regions did not elicit MIA phenotypes in the
marble burying or sociability assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data
Fig. 8d–f</xref>). The same manipulation carried out medially in the
forelimb region (S1FL) or laterally in the barrel field of primary somatosensory
cortex (S1BF) also failed to induce any behavioral abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 8g–l</xref>). Lastly, since
cortical patches are often observed only in one hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>), we asked if unilateral manipulation
of neural activity in the S1DZ region is sufficient to produce MIA behavioral
phenotypes. Targeting ChR2 and optical implants to either hemisphere unilaterally
increased the number of c-Fos<sup>+</sup> neurons both in ipsilateral as
well as contralateral S1 and was capable of driving MIA behaviors similarly to the
bilateral stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that MIA-like behaviors can be
recapitulated in WT animals either through the activation of excitatory neurons or
the inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> inhibitory neurons and that this feature is
primarily localized to the cortical region centered on the S1DZ.</p>
</sec>

<title>Reducing neural activity in the S1DZ region rescues MIA behaviors</title>
<p id="P10">We next asked whether reduction of neural activity in the S1DZ region of MIA
offspring is sufficient to correct the observed behavioral abnormalities.
Photostimulation of NpHR-expressing animals decreased the number of
c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cortical neurons when compared to those in
photostimulated EYFP-expressing MIA animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">Fig.
4a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 10a</xref>).
This inhibition of neural activity was sufficient to suppress enhanced marble
burying, restore sociability, and increase the time spent in the center of the open
field to levels observed in control PBS animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">Fig.
4c–f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig.
10</xref>). Photostimulation of EYFP- or ChR2-expressing animals did not rescue
any behavioral deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">Fig. 4c–f</xref>).
Thus, the foregoing data demonstrate that acute reduction in neural activity in the
S1DZ region is sufficient to rescue behavioral abnormalities in MIA offspring
prenatally exposed to maternal inflammation.</p>

<title>Distinct populations of S1DZ neurons selectively modulate MIA behaviors</title>
<p id="P11">To gain insight into the downstream neural circuits involved in eliciting
MIA-associated behaviors, we next examined the efferent targets of the S1DZ. We
injected an anterogradely-labeling adeno-associated virus (AAV) driving EYFP into
the S1DZ and an AAV driving mCherry into either the S1FL or S1BF. These tracing
studies revealed that the S1DZ exhibits largely distinct efferent targets compared
to the S1FL and S1BF regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Fig. 5a, b</xref> and
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 11</xref>). The S1DZ
selectively sends axons to a sub-region of M2, striatum as well as TeA. To test the
role of these distinct downstream regions in eliciting MIA-behaviors, we injected
retrogradely transported rabies virus (RV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> expressing EYFP, Chronos (excitatory opsin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> or ArchT (inhibitory
opsin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> into the TeA to
retrogradely label S1DZ neurons in WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Fig.
5c, d</xref>). Photostimulation of Chronos-positive, TeA-projecting neurons in
the S1DZ generated sociability deficits without affecting total interaction time,
but failed to induce increased marble burying phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Fig. 5e–g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 12a–f</xref>). Photostimulation of EYFP- or
ArchT-expressing neurons did not produce any behavioral deficits. Thus, in otherwise
WT animals, increasing the neural activity of the neurons in the S1DZ that project
to the TeA recapitulated MIA-associated sociability deficits, but not the repetitive
marble burying phenotypes. Conversely, in MIA animals, decreasing the neural
activity of this S1DZ neuronal population with ArchT restored normal sociability,
but failed to suppress the enhanced marble burying phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Fig. 5e–g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 12a–f</xref>). We also manipulated the activity of
the striatum-projecting S1DZ neurons and found that this population, when activated
using Chronos, induced enhanced marble-burying phenotype in WT animals without
modulating sociability. On the other hand, decreased neural activity in this
population suppressed the enhanced marble burying behavior without correcting
sociability deficits in MIA offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Fig.
5k–m</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig.
12g–l</xref>). The TeA- or striatum-projecting S1DZ populations equally
modulated the amount of time spent in the center of an arena in the open field assay
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Fig. 5h, n</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 12</xref>). These data suggest that the neurons in
S1DZ region projecting to the TeA or striatum selectively modulate interactions with
social targets and repetitive behaviors, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P12">Identifying neural circuits and components that modulate behaviors
aberrantly manifested in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders is critical for
developing therapeutic approaches. One challenge to achieving this goal is the
paucity of animal models in which discrete brain areas are known to mediate
disorder-associated behavioral symptoms. Here we identified a restricted brain
region centered on S1DZ as a component of the neural circuit that mediates
MIA-induced behavioral abnormalities. S1DZ has been implicated in proprioceptive
functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. It will be crucial to elucidate
the nature of the afferent information to the S1DZ region and how this information
is differentially processed in the downstream targets of healthy and diseased
brains. Our data indicate that IL-17Ra expression in the fetal brain is necessary to
mediate the MIA effects. The cell type impacted by IL-17Ra activation upon MIA, and
mechanisms by which the receptor activation induces cortical patches in S1 need to
be identified in the future. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the main
efferent targets of the S1DZ, such as the TeA and M2, are also locations in which
cortical patches are frequently found in MIA offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data
Fig. 1b, d</xref>). This observation suggests that cortical patch formation in
MIA offspring may be intricately linked to concerted neural activity among the
connected brain regions. While similar cortical patches were observed in prefrontal
and temporal cortical tissues of children with autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, it will be informative to examine whether
cortical patches are also found in S1 of human patients with neurodevelopmental
disorders. Of note, we cannot rule out a possibility that general MIA-induced
behavioral abnormalities are driven by heightened anxiety. It also should be noted
that in some MIA animals, cortical patches were only observed outside of S1 (12
% of animals, n=50), suggesting that S1DZ region might be one of the
nodes within a larger network that controls MIA-impacted behaviors. This MIA mouse
model with discrete, functionally-relevant perturbations in the S1DZ region, might
provide access to a network that modulates behaviors across different mouse models
of neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

left and right chambers of a 3-chamber arena
(50cm×35cm×30cm), which the experimental mice freely

Immediately after, the mice were confined to the center chamber, while a
social object (unfamiliar C57BL/6 male mouse) and an inanimate object
(Rubber object of a similar size as the social object) were placed
alternatingly into either the left or right object-containment cage.
Barriers to the adjacent chambers were removed, and the mice were allowed to
explore the 3-chamber arena for 10 min. Approach behavior was defined as
interaction time (i.e. sniffing, approach) with targets in each chamber
(within 2 cm). Sessions were video-recorded and object approach behavior and

<p id="P36">Cell types within the cortical patches of the S1 were characterized by
staining brain slices from PBS and MIA offspring for PV, VIP or NeuN in
conjunction with SATB2 or TBR1. The cortical region of interest (width:
300μm), centered on a cortical patch in MIA offspring or the
corresponding area in PBS offspring, was divided into 10 equal laminar blocks
(bin) representing different depths of the cortex. Individual marker positive
cells (SATB2, PV, VIP, or NeuN) were quantified manually. VIP staining was
observed both in cells bodies as well as in processes; only the former was
included in counts. Experimenter was blind to the treatment groups.</p>

from behavioral experiments and quantification of individual marker-positive
cells were tested using One-way, Two-way, or Two-way repeated measures ANOVAs
followed by Tukey post-hoc tests, or unpaired two-tailed t-test. The correlation
between behavioral severity and cortical patch size was tested using Linear
regression. The distribution of cortical patches was tested using Kruskal-Wallis
test followed by Dunn post-hoc test. Sample sizes were chosen with adequate
power based on the literature as well as our previous studies, in general
without using statistical methods to predetermine sample size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Animals were randomized into
different groups with approximately comparable numbers of animals in each group
whenever possible. No samples or data points were arbitrarily excluded from
statistical analysis. Key experiments, including the location of cortical
patches, anterograde tracing experiments, and behavioral experiments with
optical modulation, were all independently repeated with similar observations.
