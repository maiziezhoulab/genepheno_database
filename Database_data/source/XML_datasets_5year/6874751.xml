<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="P4">Understanding how neurotransmission is orchestrated remains to be one of the greatest challenges in neuroscience. This elaborate process requires precise spatial organization of signal transduction components across numerous synaptic structures varying in their architecture <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Fundamental to synaptic organization is the matching of presynaptic release machinery for a wide-array of neurotransmitters with cognate postsynaptic receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The complexity of synaptic connectivity in neurotransmission is further exacerbated by the need to achieve temporal coordination of signal transmission across individual synapses and throughout the neural circuitry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Accumulating evidence increasingly implicates impairments in synaptic connectivity and neurotransmitter communication as major factors contributing to neuropsychiatric disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, yet our understanding of trans-synaptic coordination of signaling and its contribution to synaptic organization remains in its infancy.</p>
<p id="P5">G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest family of neurotransmitter receptors with critical roles in neuromodulation of synaptic function and plasticity, amongst others <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Approximately 90% of ~800 receptors are expressed throughout the brain and have been heavily implicated in the manifestation and treatment of a myriad of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. These receptors transduce extracellular stimuli, such as neurotransmitter release, into selective intracellular signaling cascades via ligand-induced conformational changes and subsequent recruitment and activation of heterotrimeric G proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. By controlling levels of second messenger accumulation, such as calcium or cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), discretely localized GPCRs modulate both neuronal excitability in postsynaptic terminals and homeostatic control of presynaptic neurotransmitter release <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. This spatial localization and compartmentalization of GPCR signaling is integral for cell-to-cell communication in polarized cells, and disruption of this specified localization is associated with disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Accordingly, GPCRs remain to be one of the most common pharmaceutical targets for the treatment and prevention of disease, thereby necessitating a thorough understanding of GPCR function and pharmacology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">Synaptic adhesion molecules (SAMs) are now well recognized as central mediators of synaptic development, and disruption of these proteins are increasingly correlated with susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. SAMs are characterized by the ability to form extracellular interactions across the synaptic cleft to modulate synaptic connectivity, differentiation, plasticity and/or function of distinct synaptic junctions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Although their mechanism of action has largely focused on the formation of trans-synaptic structure, our understanding of SAMs is complicated by the emergence of roles in the modulation of cell signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. However, the extent of this modulation is unknown and mechanistic examples are scarce. Members of this expansive superfamily of proteins encode extracellular regions with a wide diversity of protein-protein interaction domains, suggesting their engagement in diverse extracellular interactions. Yet, besides several canonical examples, the web of trans-synaptic interactions involving SAMs remains to be defined. Furthermore, the characterization of expression patterns, subcellular localization and functionality of many putative SAMs are completely unexplored.</p>
<p id="P7">There have been increasing reports that some GPCRs engage in extracellular interactions with SAMs, both <italic>in cis</italic> and <italic>in trans;</italic> yet the role of this dimension in GPCR function is poorly understood. The primary example involves the ectodomain of adhesion GPCRs latrophilins (LPHNs), which directly interact with contactin-6 <italic>in cis</italic>, as well as teneurin-2/4, fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein (FLRT) 2/3, and neurexin1–3 <italic>in trans</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Recently, we and others found that group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) interact trans-synaptically with extracellular leucine-rich repeat and fibronectin type III domain-containing 1 (ELFN1) in both retina and the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Within the brain, group III mGluRs function as autoreceptors located in the presynaptic terminal to limit the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate via the activation of inhibitory Gα<sub>i/o</sub> proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. This group of mGluRs are expressed throughout the brain and have been implicated in the manifestation and/or treatment of a variety of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, neuropathic pain, anxiety, depression, autism, and epilepsy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. In addition to ELFN1, leucine rich repeat, Ig-like and transmembrane domains 1 (LRIT1) has been shown to form extracellular interactions with mGluR6 in retinal synapses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>: setting the precedent that group III mGluR biology may be prerequisite on extracellular interactions with SAMs.</p>
<p id="P8">Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel SAM widely expressed at central synapses: ELFN2, also known as phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 29 (PPP1R29). We demonstrate that ELFN2 is a postsynaptic protein that selectively engages in trans-synaptic complex formation with presynaptic group III mGluRs. We further discover that binding to ELFN2 <italic>in trans</italic> promotes membrane targeting and alters key pharmacological properties of group III mGluRs, thereby illustrating the role of this SAM as an endogenous allosteric modulator and critical cofactor of group III mGluR function. In alignment, ablation of ELFN2 in mice leads to prominent yet selective reduction in the expression of all group III mGluRs in the brain and dysregulated glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Consequently, <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice feature multiple neuropsychiatric phenotypes alleviated by pharmacological enhancement of group III mGluR function. On the basis of these findings, we propose that ELFN2 is an integral component of group III mGluR function with essential roles in both organizing and tuning glutamatergic neurotransmission in the brain.</p>

<title>ELFN2 is a postsynaptic density protein with wide expression in the brain and selective interaction with group III mGluRs <italic>in trans</italic></title>
<p id="P9">Given the precedent-setting role of ELFN1 as a trans-synaptic binding partner of group III mGluRs, we explored whether related proteins may function in a similar capacity. Phylogenetic analysis identified PPP1R29, also known by gene name ELFN2, as the closest paralog of ELFN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) within a sub-group of SAMs with similar domain topology including other GPCR-interacting members such as FLRTs and LRITs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Sequence alignment supported common extracellular domain architecture and identified both regions of sequence homology and distinctions between ELFN1 and ELFN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We next probed whether ELFN2 can similarly interact with mGluRs <italic>in tran</italic>s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) and confirmed that immunoprecipitated ELFN2 expressed in one cell population was able to pull down members of group III mGluRs: mGluR7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), mGluR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>), and mGluR8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>) expressed in separate cell populations, with efficiency comparable to ELFN1. This interaction was selective as ELFN2 was unable to bind to mGluRs from group I or II: mGluR5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>) and mGluR2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>), respectively.</p>
<p id="P10">We next studied ELFN2 expression and distribution throughout the brain. Using fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, <italic>Elfn2</italic> mRNA was readily detectable in many brain regions with particularly dense signals in the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Interestingly, the pattern of <italic>Elfn2</italic> mRNA expression differed from that of <italic>Elfn1</italic> across brain regions. In agreement with previous findings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> we found that <italic>Elfn1</italic> exhibited restricted expression in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Elfn2</italic> was more broadly expressed and found in both <italic>Elfn1</italic>-positive and negative neurons in the CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>). This differential cellular expression pattern of <italic>Elfn1</italic> and <italic>Elfn2</italic> was further observed in other regions: CA3, dentate gyrus, amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2A</xref>). Notably, <italic>Elfn2</italic> appears to be present in most glutamatergic neurons, suggestive of a role in excitatory signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2B</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">To support these observations at the protein level, we performed microdissection of various brain regions followed by Western blotting for ELFN2. In agreement with mRNA data, we detected ELFN2 bands in every region we tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>) and quantification similarly demonstrated enrichment in medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>). To determine compartment targeting of ELFN2 in the brain, we performed subcellular fractionation followed by Western blotting. We found that ELFN2 was prominently present in synaptosomal preparations with high enrichment in the postsynaptic density fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>). This pattern was similar to the distribution of postsynaptic density marker postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) and consistent with the ability of ELFN2 to form trans-synaptic complexes with group III mGluRs typically located at presynaptic terminals. Selectivity of ELFN2 fractionation was confirmed with reference to distribution of general membrane associated protein Gβ1, which was present in various membranous compartments but notably absent from postsynaptic density fractions, and cytosolic marker GAPDH excluded from membrane compartments including the postsynaptic density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>). Taken together, these findings establish ELFN2 as a novel postsynaptic protein abundantly expressed in the brain and capable of binding to group III mGluRs <italic>in trans</italic>.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Binding to ELFN2 <italic>in trans</italic> promotes membrane localization and alters pharmacological properties of group III mGluRs</title>
<p id="P12">Identification of ELFN2 binding to group III mGluRs prompted us to investigate functional implications of this interaction. To address this, we utilized a transcellular GPCR signaling platform that permits probing influence of non-cell autonomous effects on receptor trafficking and cell signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. In this approach, the effects of ELFN2 expressed in one cellular population were monitored by studying mGluR trafficking and signaling in another cellular population by either biochemical techniques or optical biosensors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">D</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">H</xref>). First, we assessed the overall effects of ELFN2 on group III mGluR membrane localization by surface biotinylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We found that co-culturing mGluR4-expressing cells with cells expressing ELFN2 significantly increased mGluR4 content on the membrane as compared to control where the same mGluR4-expressing cell population was co-cultured with cells not expressing ELFN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref>). These results suggest that ELFN2 acts <italic>in trans</italic> to localize and increase content of mGluR4 on the plasma membrane.</p>
<p id="P13">Next, we investigated the function of ELFN2 on mGluR-mediated inhibition of secondary messenger cAMP production using luminescence-based cAMP sensor by the same co-culturing strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">E</xref>). We found that co-culturing mGluR4 expressing cells with cells expressing ELFN2, but not control cells, substantially altered glutamate responses. Specifically, the presence of ELFN2 reduced the maximal efficacy (E<sub>max</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">F</xref>) and increased the half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">G</xref>) for glutamate for mGluR4-mediated cAMP inhibition. This effect was specific as co-culturing the same ELFN2-expressing cells with cells containing mGluR2 that can not bind ELFN2 revealed no effect on E<sub>max</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3A</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">B</xref>) or EC<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3A</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">C</xref>) of cAMP inhibition in response to glutamate application.</p>
<p id="P14">To investigate the mechanistic basis of ELFN2-induced effects on secondary messenger signaling, we next directly monitored kinetics of G protein activation using real-time BRET-based assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. We found that co-culturing with ELFN2-expressing cells significantly reduced maximal amplitudes of Gα<sub>o</sub> activation by mGluR4 E<sub>max</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">J</xref>) as well as its activation rate (1/τ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">K</xref>), resulting in substantial reduction in mGluR4 signaling capacity as reflected by the changes in the activation constant (E<sub>max</sub>/τ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2L</xref>). Importantly, we observed no ELFN2 influence on the G protein activation mediated by mGluR2 which does not bind ELFN2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3D</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">G</xref>), confirming specificity of the effects. Thus, we conclude that transcellular interactions with ELFN2 both promote the membrane localization of group III mGluRs and provide allosteric modulation by directly regulating receptor activation state and subsequent G protein coupling.</p>

<title>Loss of ELFN2 leads to brain-wide downregulation of group III mGluRs and augments excitatory synaptic transmission</title>
<p id="P15">To study the function of ELFN2 in the central nervous system <italic>in vivo,</italic> we utilized a knockout mouse where the coding sequence for the entire ELFN2 contained within exon 2 was replaced with a β-galactosidase (β-gal) reporter cassette while preserving the endogenous translational initiation codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Immunohistochemistry on coronal brain slices from these <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice revealed widespread β-gal expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>) that replicated the pattern observed for <italic>Elfn2</italic> mRNA detected by the <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Western blotting of whole brain lysate revealed complete elimination of ELFN2 protein in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), further validating the specificity of the antibody. <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice did not exhibit overt morphological or neuroanatomical abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">D</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">E</xref>).</p>
<p id="P16">Since we identified ELFN2 to be a prominent component of the postsynaptic density, we next studied the impact of its elimination on the expression of synaptic proteins compared to wildtype mice (WT). Western blotting of total brain lysates revealed no significant alterations in postsynaptic density scaffold PSD-95 or key presynaptic protein synaptophysin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Similarly, we observed no changes in the expression of ionotropic synaptic receptors, including excitatory glutamate receptors (GluA1, NMDAR<sub>1</sub>, NMDAR<sub>2B</sub>) and inhibitory GABA receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R<sub>α1</sub>). Strikingly, we observed marked down-regulation of all brain Group III mGluRs that ELFN2 associates with including mGluR4, mGluR7, and mGluR8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). This effect was selective as we did not detect changes in the expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors from other groups including mGluR5 and mGluR2. Notably, this downregulation was not observed at the RNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>) indicating post-translational level of the regulation. Together with the effects on promoting receptor expression at the surface in reconstituted system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref>), these observations suggest that trans-synaptic association with ELFN2 has an additional, crucial role in stabilizing group III mGluRs, thereby dictating their expression levels in the brain.</p>
<p id="P17">To determine the impact of ELFN2 loss on glutamatergic synaptic transmission <italic>in vivo</italic>, we focused on the canonical excitatory synapse between CA3 and CA1 where ELFN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2</xref>) and group III mGluRs are highly expressed, predominantly mGluR7 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. In this synapse, glutamate release is inhibited by group III mGluR autoreceptors and the reduction in their function has been observed to augment excitatory synaptic transmission and impair synaptic plasticity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. To probe synaptic transmission, we stimulated glutamate release from Schaffer collaterals of CA3 while recording field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) from the stratum radiatum of CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>). We observed a striking increase in both amplitudes and slopes of fEPSPs across a range of stimulation intensities in <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice relative to wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">J</xref>). Analysis of fiber volley amplitude versus stimulus intensity showed no difference between wildtype and <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3K</xref>), indicating unaltered synaptic architecture. Normalizing fEPSP responses to respective fiber volleys further emphasized the significant increase in fEPSP responses to glutamate release in <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3L</xref>). These data reveal the inhibitory role of ELFN2 in constraining glutamatergic synaptic transmission likely related to promoting the expression of the group III mGluR presynaptic autoreceptors via trans-synaptic interactions, thereby modulating glutamate release.</p>

<title>ELFN2 ablation precipitates a complex array of neuropsychiatric manifestations</title>
<p id="P18">Given the essential role of ELFN2 in maintaining expression of group III mGluRs and subsequently modulating excitatory signaling in the nervous system, we hypothesized that ELFN2 loss may provide predisposition for neuropsychiatric manifestations predicted as a consequence of unconstrained glutamatergic signaling. To test this possibility, we studied susceptibility of mice to seizures. Indeed, we found that <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice exhibited a prominent epileptogenic phenotype, where exposure to auditory, as well as combined auditory and olfactory, cues resulted in the induction of seizures: a behavior not observed in wild type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">B</xref>). To test our hypothesis more directly, we studied the impact of shifting the excitation/inhibition balance towards excitatory neurotransmission by pharmacological blockade of GABA transmission. In this paradigm, we again observed an increased sensitivity of <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice to bicuculline-induced seizures as compared to their WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">D</xref>). Low levels of GABA<sub>A</sub> blockade (2 mg/kg bicuculline) had no effect on WT animals, while inducing noticeable seizing in <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">D</xref>). This increase in seizure susceptibility and severity of <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice was further evident at higher levels of inhibitory signaling blockade as indicated by increased seizure scores and number of episodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">D</xref>). Notably, throughout all trials no WT mouse died (score 4), whereas the majority of <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice could not recover from seizures at higher bicuculline doses.</p>
<p id="P19">As dysregulation in glutamatergic signaling is commonly associated with a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases with epileptic comorbidities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, we tested <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice in a broad panel of behavioral assays. Examination of animal behavior in the open field test showed that <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice were markedly hyperactive as compared to their WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Our quantitative analysis revealed increases in total distance travelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">F</xref>) as well as average speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>), consistent with the knockout mice spending more time ambulating and less time immobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>) throughout the entire duration of examination. However, ELFN2 elimination did not impact habituation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I</xref>) or freezing behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>).</p>
<p id="P20">Despite increased number of center crossings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4J</xref>), the open field test further revealed that the <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice spent significantly less time in the center and more time wall-hugging (thigmotaxis) compared to WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4K</xref>) suggestive of an anxiety-like phenotype. Furthermore, this behavior was accompanied by increased stereotypic, repetitive behaviors including grooming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4L</xref>) and rotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4M</xref>), which serve as another hallmark of increased anxiety and compulsivity. To extend these observations, we further tested the mice in the elevated plus maze task which showed <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice indeed spent significantly less time in the open arms in comparison to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4N</xref>), preferring to remain within the closed arms indicative of their anxiety-related behavior. These observations were further confirmed in the marble-burying test where <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice buried significantly more marbles than the wildtype counterparts, confirmative of their anxiety- and compulsivity-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4O</xref>). Because these traits are frequently associated with deficits in sociability, we next tested <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice in a three-chamber social interaction test. In contrast to WT mice which spent the most time exploring the novel mouse chamber, <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice spent more time in the empty chamber suggestive of social aversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4P</xref>). These observations were confirmed in the social novelty paradigm where a novel mouse was introduced in addition to the familiar mouse from the previous trial. Again, in stark contrast to WT mice which spent more time exploring the novel mouse chamber, <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice spent comparably less time with both familiar and novel mice: choosing instead to reside in the uninhabited center chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4Q</xref>). Overall, we conclude that loss of ELFN2 results in a complex phenotype encompassing many traits and comorbidities of common neuropsychiatric disorders consistent with dysregulated excitatory glutamatergic signaling.</p>

<title>Allosteric augmentation of group III mGluRs rescues neuropsychiatric manifestations in <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice</title>
<p id="P21">To determine if the neuropsychiatric manifestations observed in <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice were brought about by the loss of mGluR control of glutamatergic signaling, we tested the effects of augmenting group III mGluR using a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) in an attempt to functionally compensate for their downregulation. In the open field test, administration of group III mGluR PAM VU0155041 significantly reduced hyperactivity in <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice with no effect on wildtype controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">B</xref>). Similarly, VU0155041 reduced both the mobile time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>) and number of center crossings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>), and increased the immobile time of <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice, while having no effect on wildtype controls or on freezing behaviour of both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Thus, group III mGluR augmentation was able to completely rescue hyperactive phenotype of the <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mouse.</p>
<p id="P22">This group III mGluR-dependent rescue was further observed in behavioral tests of anxiety and/or compulsivity, as VU0155041 increased the time spent in the center of the open field test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>) and decreased the number of rotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>) and time spent grooming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>) in <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice, with no effect on wildtype controls. Finally, we tested the effects of PAM on seizure susceptibility in <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice. Although VU0155041 had no significant effect on the seizure score exhibited by wildtype or <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice, it was able to reduce the number of episodes observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5I</xref>) and the average length of each episode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5J</xref>) in <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice, with no effect on wildtype mice. As a control, all behaviors were tested on successive days with saline and we confirmed VU0155041 effects were not a consequence of habituation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Fig. S4</xref>). Therefore, it appears that ablation of ELFN2 and subsequent downregulation of group III mGluR autoreceptors underlie much of the complex neuropsychiatric phenotypes observed in <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P23">In the current study, we have identified a novel set of GPCR transcomplexes involving all members of group III mGluRs with a previously uncharacterized member of the LRR family: ELFN2. We determined that ELFN2 is an abundant postsynaptic protein with a wide expression pattern throughout the brain and particular enrichment in the cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. Prior to this study, our knowledge on ELFN2 was extremely scarce. It was reported that ELFN2 was of similar sequence to ELFN1 with mRNA expressed in the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>; however, the expression and function of the ELFN2 protein remained completely unknown. More recently, ELFN2 has been suggested to exhibit oncogenic properties in cancer cells; however, the mechanism of action remains unclear <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P24">We report ELFN2 functions as a novel extracellular scaffold of group III mGluRs <italic>in trans</italic>, joining a growing list of transcellular GPCR interactions with synaptic adhesion molecules. The majority of known examples involve members of the adhesion GPCR family latrophillins (LPHNs) which bind to cell adhesion-like proteins teneurin-2/4, FLRT2/3, or neurexin1–3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. With the novel example presented in this study, it now appears that group III mGluRs, and perhaps other Group C GPCRs like GABA<sub>B</sub>R <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> and GPR158/179 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, may have adhesion GPCR-like properties capable of utilizing their large extracellular domains to form trans-synaptic structural complexes with multiple synaptic adhesion molecules.</p>
<p id="P25">Importantly, the current study lends crucial evidence to the emerging concept that transcellular interactions of GPCRs can critically shape their function and pharmacological properties <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>: a hypothesis that had been untested prior to the combined use of co-culture approaches, widely used for studying adhesion molecules, and discretely-expressed optical biosensors for studying transcellular effects on GPCR signaling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that postsynaptic protein ELFN2 sets the expression of presynaptic group III mGluRs to modulate glutamatergic signaling, suggesting that these interactions stabilize receptors across the synapse and thus are integral to the organization of the mGluR signaling system in the nervous system. This offers a new layer of complexity that needs to be considered in the design of pharmacological interventions targeting these receptors as well as for furthering our understanding of synaptic development and the neurobiology of GPCRs.</p>
<p id="P26">The majority of group III mGluRs in the brain act as glutamatergic autoreceptors ensuring homeostatic control over excitatory neurotransmission and have been implicated in the manifestation and/or treatment of a wide-array of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including ADHD, anxiety, autism, and epilepsy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. Notably, <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice exhibit augmented glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus, consistent with the loss of glutamatergic autoreceptors. Mice lacking ELFN2 also display a complex phenotype involving hyperactivity, anxiety- and compulsivity-like behaviors, impaired sociability, and a pronounced susceptibility to the generation of seizures. This behavioral phenotype is consistent with the dysregulation of group III mGluRs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup> and we demonstrate these behaviors can be rescued by group III mGluR-specific pharmacological intervention: suggesting ELFN2 acts as an integral complement to group III mGluR biology. A recent study has similarly suggested paralogous ELFN1 constitutively recruits presynaptic mGluR7 to modulate presynaptic release probabilities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, and ELFN1 knockout mice exhibit both hyperactivity and seizures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. The unique observations of anxiety, compulsivity, and social deficits in <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice may be attributable to the wider expression pattern of ELFN2 within the limbic circuitry or a selective functional delineation between the two paralogs. Nevertheless, evidence presented in the current manuscript demonstrates non-redundant ELFN2 contributions acting in ELFN1-negative cell populations throughout the brain thus contributing to regulation of additional neurocircuits. Thus, it is tempting to suggest that dysfunction in ELFN2 could serve as an underlying cause of orphan neuropsychiatric diseases featuring anxiety, hyperactivity in combination with epilepsy, and social deficits and perhaps should be evaluated as a candidate gene in the diagnosis of such disorders.</p>
<p id="P27">It is intriguing to think that ELFN2 function in the brain may not be restricted to controlling group III mGluRs. Indeed, a recent study in cancer cells identified aurora kinase A (AurkA) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) as intracellular binding-partners of ELFN2 and demonstrated that ELFN2 was capable of regulating AurkA phosphorylation and AurkA/eIF2α expression levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Given connection between eIF2α and neurological/neuropsychiatric disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>, it is foreseeable that this signaling mechanism may further contribute to the phenotypes seen in <italic>Elfn2</italic> KO mice. Although group III mGluRs have been implicated in a variety of cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>, it is unclear whether this transcomplex is unique or complimentary to the recently suggested role of ELFN2 in oncogenesis.</p>
<p id="P28">We propose that ELFN2 functions as a ubiquitous postsynaptic adhesion molecule for group III mGluRs essential for stabilizing protein expression on the membrane and, in turn, selectively endowing unique synaptic properties via the modulation of receptor pharmacology. We suggest this interaction is integral for tuning glutamatergic signaling and maintaining appropriate autoreceptor function for glutamate release, thereby maintaining homeostatic control and buffering excitability. Our results show that stabilizing mGluR expression at the membrane is a primary function of ELFN2 for controlling brain signaling. Its additional effects as a negative allosteric modulator of group III mGluR pharmacology might be involved in preventing overactivation and receptor downregulation, or fine-tuning autoreceptor glutamate sensitivity once the optimal synaptic localization and accessibility to glutamate has been achieved. In ELFN2’s absence, this feedback mechanism on glutamatergic signaling is perturbed allowing for overexcitation commonly associated with hyperactivity and seizure susceptibility. Therefore, this novel GPCR transcomplex may prove relevant in the design of therapeutic strategies for multiple neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases with relevance to group III mGluRs or glutamatergic signaling as a whole. Furthermore, we provide an early example of the general mechanisms for extracellular modulation of GPCRs <italic>in trans</italic> that may be applied to the emerging discoveries of trans-synaptic GPCR complexes, thereby filling a void in our understanding of GPCR biology and synaptic development.</p>

<title>Extracellular Field Potential Recordings</title>
<p id="P45">Mice between 4 and 8 weeks old of both genders were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. The brain was quickly removed and rested for 30 seconds in ice-cold oxygenated NMDG cutting solution containing (in mM): 93 NMDG, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 30 NaHCO3, 20 HEPES, 25 glucose, 2 thiourea, 5 Na-ascorbate, 3 Na-pyruvate, 0.5 CaCl2·, 10 MgCl2, (adjusted to 7.2–7.4 pH with HCl). Hippocampal coronal slices (300 μm thick) were cut on a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica) mounted on a porous membrane and incubated for 30 min at 34° C in oxygenated ACSF containing the following (in mM): 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 18 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose, then allowed to recover for at least 1 hour at room temperature before recording. For recordings, slices were transferred to a submerged recording chamber where they were continuously perfused at ~2 ml/min with oxygenated ACSF. Synaptic responses were evoked using a concentric bipolar electrode placed in the Schaffer collateral fiber bundles. Extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) were recorded using a borosilicate glass electrode filled with ACSF (3–4 MΩ) placed in the stratum radiatum of CA1. Input-output curves were generated for each slice with increasing stimulations delivered at 0.05 Hz and the slope of the fEPSP responses was measured. Acquisition was done using Clampex 10.5, MultiClamp 700B amplifier and Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices, CA).</p>

<title>Social Interaction Test</title>
<p id="P49">Animals (n=14–15 males per group, 3–6 months old) were placed into 3-chamber apparatus. Each chamber (30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm) contained dividing walls with an open middle section to allow for access. Both outer chambers contained wired cups. Mice were given free access to apparatus for 5 minutes (absent of other mice) to habituate and confirm initial unbiased preference. To test for sociability, mice were placed into middle chamber of apparatus with one outer chamber containing one mouse confined in wire cup and the other chamber containing an empty wired cup. For social novelty preference, mice were again placed into middle chamber with outer chambers containing familiar mouse and other containing novel mouse confined in wired cups. Mice were given ten minutes to explore all chambers in both tests. Time spent in each chamber was recorded automatically via software (Logitech C920 HD Pro; Logitech International S.A., Newark, CA USA) and plotted as such.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p id="P54">Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.02 software. Because of the identical signaling cell populations in each biological replicate of the transcellular GPCR signaling/trafficking platform and the parallel experimental design, a two-tailed, paired t-tests (related samples t tests) was most appropriate and therefore utilized for these analyses. For the transcellular GPCR signaling platform E<sub>max</sub> and activation constant, data were expressed as percentage of the mean of all controls. RNA analyses utilized a two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test. fEPSP and fiber volley measurements utilized a two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test, with exception of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3L</xref> which utilized linear regression analyses to determine significant difference between the slopes of each dataset. Longitudinal open field measurements utilized a two-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni test. In the three chambered social interaction tests, comparisons between chamber times within individual mice utilized two-tailed, paired t-tests as previously recommended <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>. Additional statistics provided comparing between genotypes utilized two-tailed, unpaired t-tests. Rescue experiments utilized a repeated measures two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test. All other data analyses utilized two-tailed, unpaired t-tests, with exception to data that failed normality tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref> 0–2mg/kg) which utilized the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. All data were subjected to standard normality tests and variances were compared to justify the statistical test used. Minimum sample size was determined using power analyses. Statistical significance was expressed as * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001, and **** p&lt;0.0001. All data points provided are biological replicates and represent n.
