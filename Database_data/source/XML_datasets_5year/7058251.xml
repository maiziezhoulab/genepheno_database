<abstract>
<p>Importance of the neuroendocrine brain for health and happiness has become clear since the 1960s. Foundations laid 100 years ago culminated in Geoffrey W Harris’s model of control by the brain of secretion of anterior and posterior pituitary gland hormones through, respectively, releasing factors secreted into the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal system, and directly from axon terminals into the systemic circulation. Confirmation, expansion and deepening of knowledge and understanding have followed increasingly sophisticated technology. This allowed chemical characterisation of the posterior pituitary hormones, oxytocin and vasopressin, the releasing factors, their receptors and genes, location of the neurosecretory neurons in the hypothalamus, and how their activity is controlled, including by neural and hormonal feedback, and how hormone rhythms are generated. Wider roles of these neurons and their peptides in the brain are now recognised: in reproductive and social behaviours, emotions and appetite. Plasticity and epigenetic programming of neuroendocrine systems have emerged as important features.</p>

<title>What neuroendocrinology is: overview of neuroendocrine organisation and mechanisms now</title>
<p>Neuroendocrinology was initially just about studying the control by the brain, via the hypothalamus, of the secretion of hormones by the posterior pituitary gland (oxytocin, vasopressin), and by the anterior pituitary gland (adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH); the gonadotropins – follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH); growth hormone; prolactin; thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)), the adrenal medulla (adrenaline) and the pineal gland (melatonin). The neuroendocrine brain comprises discrete sets of hypothalamic neurons, and their rich neural inputs, that either project to the posterior pituitary (oxytocin and vasopressin neurons) or the median eminence (releasing factor neurons) where their axon terminals abut blood capillaries. The former secrete into the systemic circulation (so these magnocellular neurons have large cell bodies owing to their necessary large capacity for peptide synthesis and secretion) and the latter into the primary capillaries of the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal vessel system (these neurons are small, parvocellular, reflecting need for production of less stored peptide) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2398212818812014">Figure 1</xref>). Geoffrey Harris first proposed and demonstrated the key and essential importance and function of this portal system in the regulation by the brain of the stimulation or inhibition of secretion by specific types of anterior pituitary cells into the systemic circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2398212818812014">Harris, 1955</xref>). This proposal was supported by contemporaneous studies with neuropharmacology, electrical stimulation and anterior pituitary transplantation, showing important roles of the hypothalamus in controlling gonadal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2398212818812014">Everett and Sawyer, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-2398212818812014">Markee et al., 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-2398212818812014">Nikitovitch-Winer and Everett, 1957</xref>); the demonstration of hypophysiotropic areas of the hypothalamus by using anterior pituitary implants and selective micro-surgical de-afferentation within the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-2398212818812014">Szentágothai et al., 1968</xref>); and finding that extracts of the hypothalamus had actions expected of the proposed releasing factors, and that these were peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2398212818812014">Guillemin and Rosenberg, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-2398212818812014">McCann, 1962</xref>). This set the scene for precise characterisation of hypothalamic releasing factors, beginning in the 1970s.</p>

<p>Neurosecretory neurons in the hypothalamus. (a) Location of oxytocin and vasopressin neurons. Main: one side of a coronal section of a rat brain. PVN: paraventricular nucleus; SON: supraoptic nucleus; V3: third ventricle; OC: optic chiasm. Oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin (VP) neurons are identified by fluorescent immunocytochemistry: oxytocin neurons are red and vasopressin neurons are green (top inset); both types of neuron are in the PVN and SON. The SON comprises only magnocellular neurons, projecting to the posterior pituitary gland. In the PVN, most magnocellular OXT and VP neurons are grouped laterally; the medial PVN contains mostly parvocellular neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2398212818812014">Figure 1b</xref>). Inset bottom: electron microscopy photomicrograph of dendrites in the ventral SON (dashed oval outline/white arrow) showing secretory granules (red arrow) and an exocytotic profile (yellow arrow). (b) Distribution of neurosecretory neurons in the paraventricular nucleus. The PVN contains multiple types of peptidergic neurons, predominantly neuroendocrine neurons projecting to the posterior pituitary (magnocellular, mne in key) or to the median eminence, secreting into the primary capillaries of the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal system (parvocellular, pne in key) and identified by axonal terminal uptake and retrograde transport of intravenously injected fast blue (from the median eminence or posterior pituitary respectively). Each coloured dot represents the cell body of different peptidergic types of neurosecretory neuron, identified by simultaneous multiple immunocytochemistry; numbers of each type in this plane of section are in the key. Key: TRH: thyrotropin releasing hormone, SS: somatostatin, TH: tyrosine hydroxylase (i.e. dopaminergic – prolactin inhibiting factor (PIF), most are in the arcuate nucleus); CRH: corticotropin releasing hormone; VP: vasopressin; OXT: oxytocin; GRH: growth hormone releasing hormone (none in this plane, most are adjacent to the arcuate nucleus in the ventral hypothalamus). The PVN also contains non-neuroendocrine (i.e. centrally projecting) neurons of each of these types, especially CRH, OXT, SS and TRH neurons. 26A: section level in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-2398212818812014">Simmons and Swanson (2009)</xref>.</p>

<p>In this epoch, the amino acid sequences and genes for the anterior pituitary hormones were established, which included showing that ACTH is produced from a precursor, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), which contains β-endorphin and α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH; processed from ACTH) and other active peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-2398212818812014">Lowry, 2016</xref>), and importantly is expressed in the neuroendocrine brain.</p>
<sec id="section2-2398212818812014">
<title>Scope of neuroendocrinology</title>
<p>This embraces major body functions – reproduction, growth and metabolism, water and electrolyte balance, diurnal and seasonal rhythms and resilience to stress. Control by the brain has three elements – receiving external environmental signals, in all sensory modalities, and then organising neuroendocrine responses appropriate to meet challenges (stressors), to accommodate opportunities (to eat, drink, reproduce) and to harmonise with the natural day and seasons on planet earth; processing internal signals to maintain or restore homeostasis through neuroendocrine adjustments (osmoregulation, balancing energy supply and use, or coping with infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2398212818812014">Kentner and Pittman, 2010</xref>)); detecting hormonal signals from peripheral endocrine glands the brain regulates that mainly act as negative (but some can be positive) feedback signals which automatically adjust the neuroendocrine output from the brain to keep the output from the controlled endocrine gland within set limits. Feedback may be on the anterior pituitary as well as on neurons in the brain.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2398212818812014">
<title>Boosting feedback signals</title>
<p>The neuroendocrine brain is not a passive receiver of peripheral endocrine signals: considering steroid and thyroid hormones, the brain has enzyme mechanisms for amplifying or transforming these signals. Thyroxine (T4), the classical thyroid hormone, is activated by partial deiodination to triiodothyronine (T3) in target tissues, and the brain also expresses the deiodinase enzymes; their expression is regulated by T3 as a way of enhancing the feedback signal. Enzymes that interconvert sex steroid hormones are expressed in the brain and are important in the early developing male brain by converting testosterone to 17β-estradiol, which is the form that induces masculinisation and defeminisation of key control networks. The brain can convert progesterone, and other steroids, to forms (e.g. allopregnanolone) that are neuroactive – acting on neuronal membranes to alter electrical excitability. Glucocorticoids (cortisol in humans, corticosterone in laboratory rodents) are metabolised and inactivated in the periphery, by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11β-HSD 2): the brain is among tissues that can reactivate the metabolite, via action of 11β-HSD 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2398212818812014">Harris et al., 2001</xref>), which has been shown to have implications for understanding stress effects on the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-2398212818812014">Sarabdjitsingh et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2398212818812014">
<title>Importance</title>
<p>Disordered regulation of neuroendocrine systems, owing to problems within the brain, or damage to the pituitary or a peripheral endocrine gland, or an endocrine tumour over-secreting a hormone, can have serious life-threatening consequences. Indeed, such conditions have provided impetus for investigating neuroendocrine systems, and in turn such understanding is key to diagnosis and treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2398212818812014">
<title>Rhythms</title>
<p>A feature of neuroendocrine systems is that they generate rhythms, related to external rhythms of day and night or season, or to induce ovulatory cycles in females, or as a consequence of the intrinsic behaviour of neuroendocrine neurons, or as an emergent feature of feedback mechanisms. An early finding after gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) was characterised was that GnRH secretion into portal blood is pulsatile and surges at the critical period for stimulation of ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-2398212818812014">Sarkar et al., 1976</xref>). Secretion of hormones in pulses evidently avoids target desensitisation and permits effects to be efficiently achieved through transient peak levels of hormone. While neuroendocrine neurons generate rhythms via the patterning of their electrophysiological activity, feedback from rhythmic activity in target gland activity can complicate the rhythmicity generated by mechanisms in the brain.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2398212818812014">
<title>Wider and wider</title>
<p>But neuroendocrinology is about more than all this. Beyond central actions of hormones that are produced peripherally to regulate secretion of these hormones, hormone actions on the brain include triggering behaviours and emotions (mood and desires) that are complementary to other actions of the hormone. Examples are the central actions of sex steroids necessary for sex behaviour in adulthood and in determining gender during critical periods in early life; actions of glucocorticoids secreted during stress on the hippocampus that aid memory, but may also be deleterious, and also anxiogenic actions on the amygdala that can be interpreted as evoking coping responses. Now included are the actions of several peptides from adipose tissue, the gastro-intestinal tract and pancreas, and immune cells, which signal aspects of metabolic state and affect appetite and neuroendocrine systems that regulate metabolism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-2398212818812014">
<title>Central actions of hormones</title>
<p>As for the target cells of peripheral hormones, actions in the brain and anterior pituitary are mediated by specific hormone receptors. The lipophilic properties of steroid hormones mean they readily cross the blood-brain barrier, and there are transporters for thyroid hormones; then they enter cells, bind to a specific cytoplasmic receptor (these are essentially transcription factors), enter the nucleus and modify (stimulate or repress) expression of specific genes, eliciting the specific hormone action on the cells, including neuroendocrine neurons. Faster steroid hormone actions on electrical excitability of neurons can be through receptors expressed on the cell membrane. Peptide hormones act via specific membrane 7-transmembrane (7-TM) receptors, typically coupled to G-protein (GPCR) and an adenylyl cyclase, cAMP, pathway, or via a specific single transmembrane cytokine family receptor and the JAK-STAT pathway.</p>
<p>Unlike steroid hormones, most peptide hormones cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, so their actions may be via circumventricular organs, which have fenestrated capillaries, hence some blood-borne peptides can act here (e.g. angiotensin, relaxin, interleukin-1β, ghrelin) if there are adjacent neurons expressing the appropriate receptors; for some other peptides (e.g. leptin, prolactin), there are also selective transport mechanisms in the choroid plexus that enable entry into the CSF. For yet others, their actions can be at the site of peripheral release, on receptors on afferent nerve terminals (e.g. cholecystokinin (CCK) and vagus nerve), or indirect through excitation of a peripheral target which in turn excites afferent innervation (e.g. oxytocin and myometrial contractions); clearly, such peripheral actions must act via central projections of the afferent neural pathway, which may be via brainstem monoaminergic and/or peptidergic systems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-2398212818812014">
<title>Change means change</title>
<p>In general, every component of neuroendocrine systems can be a site of plasticity that affects activity and responsiveness; changes may involve refinements of circuitry in the neural networks in which neuroendocrine neurons are embedded. Plasticity may be part of a normal step at different stages of life (e.g. puberty, pregnancy) or be a consequence of a dangerous disturbance of homeostasis (stress) and its costly correction (allostasis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-2398212818812014">McEwen and Wingfield, 2003</xref>). This encompasses up- and down-regulation of receptor effectiveness, which may be due to ligand-induced desensitisation or altered expression; such plasticity is important in understanding normal and abnormal physiology. The specific signalling molecules that neuroendocrine neurons produce impart their secretory phenotype, but for a particular phenotype, this can change qualitatively and quantitatively in typical ways as a result of physiological state. Epigenetic mechanisms (DNA methylation, histone acetylation) may underlie such plasticity.</p>

<title>Neurosecretion</title>
<p>The seed for neuroendocrinology was sown at the beginning of the last century with the discovery that the posterior pituitary gland, a midline ventral down-growth from the brain, contains active substances that stimulate uterine contractions and release of milk from the lactating mammary gland, and increase blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2398212818812014">Dale, 1906</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-2398212818812014">Ott and Scott, 1910</xref>), and excretion of concentrated urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2398212818812014">Farini, 1913</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2398212818812014">Heller, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-2398212818812014">van der Velden, 1913</xref>). These activities were assigned to presence in the posterior pituitary of two hormones – oxytocin (acting on myometrium and mammary gland to cause ejection of fetus(es) and milk, respectively) and vasopressin (causes vasoconstriction, increasing blood pressure), also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH). There was initial confusion about presence in the posterior pituitary of diuretic as well as antidiuretic activities but the prime importance of ADH was resolved by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr151-2398212818812014">Verney (1946a)</xref>, who also demonstrated the role of osmoreceptors in the brain, supplied by the internal carotid arteries, that mediate stimulation of ADH secretion by increased blood osmolality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-2398212818812014">Verney, 1946b</xref>).</p>
<p>It took 50 years from the initial discoveries to confirm that oxytocic and vasopressor/antidiuretic activities are exerted by two distinct hormones in the posterior pituitary, through ground-breaking sequencing of the two peptides, each with nine amino acids, synthesising them, and confirming their distinctive biological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2398212818812014">du Vigneaud et al., 1954a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2398212818812014">1954b</xref>): oxytocin was the first peptide hormone to be synthesised.</p>
<p>Comparative anatomical, histological and electron microscopy studies showed that the posterior pituitary is innervated by axons of neurons in the supraoptic nuclei (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus and that these relatively large, magnocellular, neurons contain abundant protein synthesising machinery and membrane bound granules like other secretory cells, including neurons in invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-2398212818812014">Scharrer and Scharrer, 1945</xref>). Hence, these neurons were designated as neurosecretory and deduced to produce oxytocin and vasopressin in their cell bodies and then to transport these hormones in their axons to the posterior pituitary and when electrically excited secrete the peptides by exocytosis from the thousands of axon terminals into fenestrated capillaries in the gland, thus entering the systemic circulation.</p>

<sec id="section11-2398212818812014">
<title>Oxytocin and vasopressin neurons</title>
<p>The magnocellular oxytocin and vasopressin neurons, found in the PVN and SON, are regarded as exemplar neuroendocrine cells with properties that other neurosecretory neurons should be expected to match (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2398212818812014">Figure 2</xref>): their cell bodies are in the hypothalamus; the neurons have excitatory and inhibitory synapses on their dendrites and soma, and appropriate specific receptors; the neurons produce and secrete peptides that mediate their functions (except that tubero-infundibular dopaminergic neurons use dopamine); their axon terminals are on fenestrated capillaries (in the posterior pituitary for magnocellular neurons; in the median eminence for releasing factors/ hormones); secretion is stimulated by arrival of action potentials that increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the terminals, triggering exocytosis; frequency and pattern of action potentials generated in the cell bodies determine amount and pattern of peptide released; pre-terminal modulation of stimulus-secretion coupling is likely.</p>

<p>Features of a magnocellular oxytocin neuron (MCN): a model peptidergic neuron. Oxytocin is synthesised in the cell body, as a higher molecular weight precursor, translated from the mRNA transcribed from the <italic>OXT</italic> gene; precursor peptides are processed to oxytocin-neurophysin and packaged into secretory granules in the Golgi apparatus; secretory granules are moved by axonal transport to the axon terminals; some are transported into dendrites; precursor is processed further during transport; the axon terminals are on fenestrated capillaries in the posterior pituitary (some axon swellings release into portal capillaries in the median eminence, like releasing factors – oxytocin can stimulate prolactin secretion); a few magnocellular oxytocin neuron axons (dashed) project centrally (e.g. to amygdala). Secretion is via exocytosis, stimulated by action potentials (APs) that increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry; frequency and pattern of action potentials generated in the cell bodies determine amount and pattern of peptide released; stimulus-secretion coupling can be modulated by pre-terminal action of κ-opioid peptide. Under most conditions, oxytocin neurons fire APs irregularly but during parturition or suckling they fire in brief high-frequency bursts, co-ordinated among the oxytocin neurons, resulting in secretion of a pulse of oxytocin after each burst. Major excitatory inputs use noradrenaline (NA) or glutamate (GLU); major inhibitory input is via GABA; allopregnanolone (AP; progesterone neurosteroid metabolite) potentiates GABA action via GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors; more than 20 neuropeptides have excitatory or inhibitory (e.g. opioid) actions on magnocellular oxytocin neurons. Dendritic secretion of oxytocin drives bursts – auto-stimulating endocannabinoid (CB) release, which presynaptically modulates inputs (GLU); placental leucine aminopeptidase (PLAP) from oxytocin dendrites limits local oxytocin action; ATP/adenosine (Ad) and nitric oxide (NO) from dendrites also have local inhibitory actions.</p>

<title>The hypothalamus and adenohypophysis</title>
<p>Harris’s hypothesis about how secretions of the adenohypophysis (anterior pituitary gland) are controlled by the brain through the secretion by specific neurons in the hypothalamus of releasing factors into the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal system has been amply confirmed by many studies since. Confirmation came especially from the first chemical characterisation of releasing factors/hormones (for TSH – TRH, and for FSH and LH – LHRH/GnRH) by Roger Guillemin and Andrew Schally, who used extracts of hundreds of thousands of sheep and porcine hypothalami from slaughterhouses to achieve this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2398212818812014">Amoss et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2398212818812014">Burgus et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-2398212818812014">Schally et al., 1971</xref>).

<title>Hormone characterisation</title>
<p>A basic hypothesis is that there can be a releasing hormone (RH or factor RF) and a release inhibiting factor (RIF or RIH) for each anterior pituitary hormone, with appropriate specific receptors on the respective anterior pituitary trophic cells. Most of these are produced by parvocellular neurons in the PVN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2398212818812014">Figure 1b</xref>). Specific membrane receptors have been identified for each RH or RIH, but to date, only GH is clearly regulated by both a GHIH (somatostatin 14/28 a.a.) and by a GHRH (44 a.a. peptide); for ACTH/Corticotropin, CRH (a 41 a.a. peptide) and vasopressin (9 a.a.) stimulate ACTH secretion; LH and FSH (gonadotropins, Gn) are stimulated by the same peptide (GnRH = LHRH, decapeptide), and a proposed LHRIF (RF-amide related peptide-3, RFRP-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2398212818812014">Clarke et al., 2016</xref>), has not yet been fully validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2398212818812014">George et al., 2017b</xref>); for TSH, TRH tripeptide (the first releasing factor to be characterised) stimulates secretion; prolactin secretion is inhibited by dopamine (acting as a PIF) and can be stimulated by oxytocin or prolactin releasing peptide (PrRP, 31 a.a. peptide; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2398212818812014">Hinuma et al., 1998</xref>), though PIF is predominant, and it is now clear that PrRP primarily functions within the brain, including in the context of energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2398212818812014">Dodd and Luckman, 2013</xref>). For ACTH, gonadotropins and TSH the target gland hormones (steroids and thyroxine) act as inhibitory regulators.</p>
<p>An important finding was the discovery that continuous treatment with GnRH down-regulates the GnRH receptor on gonadotrophs, removing the drive to sex steroid secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr169-2398212818812014">Zilberstein et al., 1983</xref>): so GnRH agonist analogues are important in treatment of androgen-dependent cancer, and precocious puberty.</p>

<p>As both oxytocin and vasopressin have a cysteine-cysteine ring, in vivo synthesis of the oxytocin and vasopressin precursor peptides and axonal transport and storage could be studied by local injection of S<sup>35</sup>-labelled cysteine, or other radio-labelled constituent amino acids, into the PVN or SON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2398212818812014">Brownstein et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2398212818812014">Cross et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-2398212818812014">Sachs and Takabatake, 1964</xref>). Availability of specific antibodies has enabled key questions about synthesis and distribution of the peptide neurohormones, at the cellular and sub-cellular level, with the techniques of immunocyto/histo-chemistry with light and electron microscopy, and at the brain region level with western blotting. Isolation of the mRNAs and sequencing of the genes encoding the posterior pituitary peptides and the releasing hormones and their receptors provided tools to identify with ISH the anatomical distribution of expression in the brain and anterior pituitary, and to investigate dynamics of changes with functional demand and the mechanisms regulating expression of the genes.</p>

<title>Tanycytes</title>
<p>Recent careful morphological and gene expression studies have indicated that the morphologically striking tanycytes lining the base of the third ventricle have a critical role in mediating negative feedback action of thyroid hormone on hypophysiotropic TRH neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2398212818812014">Fekete and Lechan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2398212818812014">Figure 3</xref>). They have long processes extending to the median eminence, arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus (DMN) or ventromedial nucleus (VMN); one group projects to the pars tuberalis of the pituitary. Tanycytes express thyroid hormone receptors, and TRH degrading enzyme, which is up-regulated by thyroid hormone, acting like a metabolic fire extinguisher, limiting TRH stimulation of TSH secretion and hence thyroid hormone secretion as part of negative feedback. They also have TSH receptors and TSH, from nearby pars tuberalis thyrotrophs, stimulates type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) expression, hence increasing local tri-iodothyronine (T3) concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2398212818812014">Bolborea et al., 2015</xref>).

<p>Tanycytes and thyroid hormone feedback to TRH neurons. Tanycytes (which stain for vimentin, green) line the base of the third ventricle (3V; shown here in a transverse section diagram), in 4 groups (α1 and 2, β1 and 2) sending processes into the hypothalamus, including the arcuate nucleus; β1 tanycytes project to the median eminence (ME) as far as the pars tuberalis. In the external ME zone, tanycyte processes are in close contact (small dashed oval) with pro-thyroid stimulating hormone releasing hormone (TRH) – immunopositive axon terminals (deep pink) abutting primary capillaries of the hypothalamic-pituitary portal vessel system, into which TRH diffuses after release from the axon terminals. The cell bodies of the TRH neurons are in the parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (pPVN), and receive several types of neural input. The large dashed oval details feedback interactions between tanycytes and TRH neurons: tanycytes are glucosensitive and have membrane transporters for thyroid hormone (T3 and T4, asterisks), and express type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) which converts T4 to T3 (active form of thyroid hormone), which is delivered to TRH neurons, either via CSF or retrograde axonal transport; tanycytes have cell surface pyroglutamyl peptidase II (PPII; red stars), inducible by T3, which degrades released TRH, attenuating the effects of stimulation of TRH neurons.</p>

<title>Hormone measurements</title>
<p>Measurements of activity of neuroendocrine systems were initially based on assessing outputs – changes in activity of anterior or posterior pituitary hormone targets, and careful, tedious bio-assays of hormone concentrations in peripheral blood, based on the physiological responses of target tissues, in vitro or in vivo, using international standard extracts or synthetic peptides to calibrate assays. Chemical measurements were developed to measure steroids and monoamines. In 1960, development of a radioimmunoassay method was announced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-2398212818812014">Yalow and Berson, 1960</xref>), which revolutionised measurement of specific peptide and steroid hormones. Refinement of the principle and commercial development has led to numerous types of assays based on the high affinity and specificity of antibodies for complex chemical moieties; though specificity is an issue, especially if measurements are attempted on un-extracted samples. The sensitivity and reproducibility of immunoassays meant that serial measurements in small samples of biological fluids became possible, providing information about dynamics of neuroendocrine responses. However, a limitation is that while hormones from the posterior and anterior pituitary and peripheral endocrine glands (including the gastro-intestinal tract, adipose tissue and immune cells) are present in the circulation at concentrations high enough for their actions and hence for immunoassay, hypothalamic releasing factors are at detectable concentrations only in the few µl of hypothalamic-hypophysial portal blood. Hence, surgical techniques were developed to sample portal blood to measure RH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2398212818812014">Clarke and Cummins, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-2398212818812014">Sarkar et al., 1976</xref>), complemented by in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-2398212818812014">Loxley et al., 1993</xref>).</p>

<title>Paradigm shift: peptide actions in the brain</title>
<p>The techniques for identifying neuropeptide production revealed that in addition to neurosecretory neurons projecting to the posterior pituitary and the median eminence, these or other neurons projecting within the brain produce and release the same peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2398212818812014">Hökfelt et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2398212818812014">Landgraf and Neumann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-2398212818812014">Swanson and Sawchenko, 1980</xref>). Importantly, specific receptors for these neuropeptides were concurrently found in the brain. Thus, the known repertoire of neurotransmitters in the brain was vastly increased when neuropeptides were included. A working concept about the functions of these peptides in the brain is that they have actions in eliciting emotions and behaviours that are coherent with their neuroendocrine functions (e.g. oxytocin is essential for milk transfer and promotes maternal behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-2398212818812014">Pedersen and Prange, 1979</xref>); CRH drives anterior pituitary-adrenocortical stress responses and is anxiogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2398212818812014">Bale and Vale, 2004</xref>); gut and metabolic peptides alter appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2398212818812014">Field et al., 2010</xref>).

Functional tests showed a phasic pattern is typical of vasopressin neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2398212818812014">Dreifuss et al., 1976</xref>); during suckling the type firing irregularly dramatically and synchronously discharged brief high-frequency bursts with a milk ejection following each burst, so these neurons were characterised as oxytocinergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-2398212818812014">Wakerley and Lincoln, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2398212818812014">Figure 2</xref>). As the secretion of many hormones is rhythmic, the burst firing of oxytocin neurons provides a paradigm to explain neuroendocrine rhythms in general at the level of RH neurons. However, such neuronal rhythms have been difficult to show directly, but have been inferred from measuring rhythms in RH concentrations in portal blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-2398212818812014">Sarkar et al., 1976</xref>). Detailed in vitro study of the mechanisms of secretion of posterior pituitary hormones showed that action potentials cause Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, triggering exocytosis, visualised with electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2398212818812014">Douglas and Poisner, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-2398212818812014">Morris and Pow, 1988</xref>). Importantly, the rate of peptide release disproportionately increases as action potential frequency increases, indicating a mechanism at the axon terminals for facilitating secretion of a pulse of peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2398212818812014">Leng et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-2398212818812014">Shaw et al., 1984</xref>). Furthermore, in contrast, pre-terminal inhibition by endogenous opioid (revealed by the antagonist naloxone), and exogenous opiates, was shown, but this is a site of plasticity as the opioid inhibition of oxytocin secretion is lifted by the end of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2398212818812014">Douglas et al., 1993</xref>).

In the anterior pituitary, ultradian glucocorticoid peaks are followed by transient waves of GR briefly binding to regulatory elements of specific genes, with transient increases in gene expression, and production of quanta of newly synthesised mRNA; some genes (e.g. <italic>POMC</italic> in the anterior pituitary) are inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2398212818812014">George et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-2398212818812014">Stavreva et al., 2009</xref>). In the hippocampus, GR activation/deactivation follows the ultradian glucocorticoid cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-2398212818812014">Lightman et al., 2008</xref>), but in the prefrontal cortex an ultradian glucocorticoid pulse has longer-lasting effects on gene expression than in the anterior pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2398212818812014">George et al., 2017a</xref>). Evidently, for some genes, in some brain regions, but not for others, the effects of ultradian peaks of glucocorticoid on gene expression are smoothed. There are implications here for other steroid feedback mechanisms: for instance, those involved in regulation of ovarian cycles.</p>

<p>Amazingly, studies on the SCN hub showed that after microsurgical isolation of the SCN in situ and in hypothalamic slices in vitro SCN neurons maintain circadian rhythms in their electrophysiological activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2398212818812014">Green and Gillette, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2398212818812014">Inouye and Kawamura, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-2398212818812014">Weaver, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, SCN transplants substantially restore rhythm if transplanted into animals with SCN lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2398212818812014">Lehman et al., 1987</xref>): hence the SCN was deduced to be the primary circadian pacemaker and to contain an intrinsic clock mechanism. Moreover, the SCN neurons, together with the pineal, respectively, synchronise the clocks now known to be widely distributed in cells in the brain and body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2398212818812014">Buijs et al., 2016</xref>), profoundly influencing metabolism, and seasonal rhythms related to reproduction.</p>
<p>Individual SCN neurons have independent electrophysiological rhythms, with more frequent action potentials during the day, but need the company of other SCN neurons to optimise rhythmicity. Greater activity during the day is related to reduced membrane potential, with hyperpolarisation at night reducing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2398212818812014">Figure 4(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2398212818812014">b</xref>)). The SCN contains several neuronal phenotypes that express neuropeptides (notably, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) in neurons in the core of the SCN, which receives retinal input; vasopressin neurons in the shell, which is more strongly rhythmic and projects into the brain), and GABA and clock genes, showing circadian variation in expression and necessary for clock function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2398212818812014">Evans, 2016</xref>).

<p>Suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) circadian electrical and molecular clocks. (a), (b) Circadian rhythm in electrical activity. SCN neurons are more active electrically during the circadian day than the night. (a) The resting membrane potential (RMP) is more depolarised during the day (UP state), slowly increasing and then decreasing during the day, and vice versa during the night. During the day, the RMP changes reflect reduced activity of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels; at night, K<sup>+</sup> channels open and the neurons are hyperpolarised (DOWN state). (b) UP state: Some neurons discharge action potentials (AP) at 4–6 spikes/s (b1), others with a high RMP show waves of depolarisation (b2), glutamate from light-activated retinal ganglion cells provides excitatory drive, and activates <italic>per1</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2398212818812014">Figure 4c</xref>); DOWN state: action potentials are produced at a lower rate, 0.1–3 spikes/s (b3). (c) Diagram of the core molecular components of the molecular clock. The core clock comprises transcriptional/post-translational feedback loops (TTFL) regulating expression of clock genes and proteins that take 24 h to complete a cycle. Clock and Bmal1 proteins (1), transcription factors, peak at the start of the circadian day, and act on E-boxes (2) to enhance expression of target genes, including the <italic>period</italic> (<italic>per1/ 2</italic>) and <italic>cryptochrome</italic> (<italic>cry</italic>) genes (3), translation of their mRNAs (4) leads to increased cytoplasmic levels of Per and Cry proteins by the end of the day (5), which enter the nucleus and auto-repress <italic>per</italic> and <italic>cry</italic> gene expression by interfering with Clock and Bmal1 actions at E-boxes (6; pink crosses <italic>X</italic>). Consequently, Per and Cry protein production stops, and remaining Per and Cry are degraded.

<title>Clock genes</title>
<p>Studies of the molecular genetic basis of circadian rhythms in Drosophila uncovered a group of genes that interact as a molecular clockwork to generate cellular and behavioural rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-2398212818812014">Reddy et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-2398212818812014">Sehgal et al., 1995</xref>), and homologous genes were found in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-2398212818812014">Shin et al., 1985</xref>).

<p>These interactions slowly develop each day: in the morning Clock/Bmal1 activates <italic>per</italic> and <italic>cry</italic>, so their transcripts accumulate, followed by their proteins, which oppose Clock/Bmal1 actions and Per/Cry production falls, and these proteins are degraded.

<p>Identified immunocytochemically, GnRH neurons were shown to have a distinctive developmental origin – born in the olfactory placode, they migrate into the preoptic area, guided by multiple chemical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-2398212818812014">Schwanzel-Fukuda and Pfaff, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr159-2398212818812014">Wierman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-2398212818812014">Wray et al., 1989</xref>). Here they are quite scattered; each is bipolar, with a rostral and a caudal dendrite, the latter up to 1 mm long and projecting to the median eminence where its axonal-like terminals abut the primary capillaries of the portal system. These dendrites have synaptic boutons all along their length, and the spike initiation site on the caudal process is unusually far (150 µm) from the cell body: the hybrid caudal process has thus been described as a dendron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2398212818812014">Herde et al., 2013</xref>). Evidently, this feature of GnRH neurons gives huge potential for preterminal modulation of GnRH release, in which the entwinement of dendrons is likely important. Understanding how these neurons function to release ca. hourly GnRH pulses, and consequently trigger hourly LH pulses is not yet clear; individually they discharge brief intermittent bursts of action potentials. The co-ordinated burst-firing oxytocin neuron model may give clues, though GnRH neurons are older in evolution (preceding lactation) than oxytocin neurons (notwithstanding oxytocin neuron precursors in egg-layers).</p>

<title>Kisspeptin neurons</title>
<p>A now predominant idea that non-GnRH neurons are involved in GnRH rhythms followed the discovery in 2003 that hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (i.e. no puberty, infertility of central origin) in men and women is associated with a loss of function mutation in GPR54 (now called KISS1R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2398212818812014">de Roux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-2398212818812014">Seminara et al., 2003</xref>). The ligand for this receptor is a 54 a.a. RF (arginine-phenylalanine) amide related peptide (RFRP), metastatin/kisspeptin, which like its gene <italic>KISS1</italic> was already known in cancer biology. KISS1R is expressed by GnRH neurons, kisspeptin strongly stimulates GnRH neuron electrical activity and GnRH secretion, and is produced by kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus, and in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) in the preoptic area: close to the GnRH neurons and their dendrons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2398212818812014">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<p>Micronet linking kisspeptin and gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Kisspeptin (Kiss 1) networks in the basal hypothalamus (arcuate nucleus, ARH) and anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), and synaptic connections with GnRH neurons in the preoptic area were studied with optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, molecular pharmacology and single cell RT-PCR. Para-horizontal or coronal brain slices were used, from female mice, transgenically modified to express channelrhodopsin 2 (dark brown cells, ChR2; activated by blue light to cause depolarisation) and fluorescent protein markers. Arcuate nucleus kisspeptin (KNDY) neurons co-express dynorphin (Dyn; κ-opioid peptide) and neurokinin B (NKB). (1) High frequency photostimulation of Kiss 1 neurons (yellow stars: action potential bursts) excites adjacent and (2) contralateral Kiss 1 neurons, involving modulation by Dyn (inhibitory) and NKB (excitatory); hence KNDY neurons can be excited in a coordinated manner. (3) Kisspeptin released in the median eminence (ME) may promote GnRH release by acting on the long processes (dendrons) of GnRH neurons. (4) Arcuate KNDY neurons project to the AVPV Kiss 1 neurons; (5) when the KNDY neurons are stimulated in turn they excite Kiss 1 neurons via glutamate (Glu) release. (6) Trans-synaptic excitation of Kiss1 neurons projecting to GnRH neurons releases kisspeptin to excite GnRH neurons projecting to the median eminence (ME). GnRH released into the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal vessels will stimulate LH and FSH release by the anterior pituitary. The network described may operate as the ‘GnRH pulse generator’ and might explain pre-ovulatory surges of GnRH and LH.</p>

Subsequently, the JAK2/STAT3-linked leptin receptor (ObRb) was characterised (via analysis of obese db/db mice, discovered in 1966, which have a defective leptin receptor gene, so are leptin insensitive), and shown to be expressed in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-2398212818812014">Schwartz et al., 1996</xref>).

<title>Paradigm shift</title>
<p>These findings necessitated building endocrine activity of adipose tissue into a neuroendocrine model of appetite and metabolic regulation. Producing this model has involved applying the full weight of a range of contemporary technology and collaborative effort. Leptin enters the brain via the choroid plexus and basal hypothalamus, by-passing the blood-brain barrier, and acts on leptin receptors (ObRb) expressed on neurons in the hypothalamic network and beyond. This still developing model describes complex neural networks with hubs and nodes containing several types of neuropeptide neuron in the arcuate nucleus, VMH, LatH, parvocellular (p) PVN and nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-2398212818812014">Schwartz et al. (2000)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-2398212818812014">Figure 6</xref>). By virtue of the connections of the network neurons and actions of neuropeptide produced these are considered as orexigenic or anorectic, so the principle has emerged that appetite (measured as feeding) is suppressed by inhibition of the former and/or excitation of the latter, and appetite is increased by respective stimulation or inhibition of orexigenic and anorectic neurons. It is clear that leptin is but one circulating peptide that acts on the arcuate nucleus hub: insulin (signalling adequate energy) acts in the same direction as leptin; by contrast, circulating ghrelin (signalling an empty stomach) activates orexigenic neurons.</p>

<title>Arcuate nucleus – further peptide complexity</title>
<p>The arcuate nucleus orexigenic and anorectic neurons each produce one or more peptides and project to other nodes or hubs (notably the pPVN and LatH), the NTS and to each other: in the arcuate nucleus, a GABA connection from orexigenic (neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide, NPY/AgRP) to anorectic (POMC/cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript [CART]) neurons tonically favours appetite. Conversely, leptin activates POMC/CART neurons and inhibits NPY/AgRP neurons, which removes the GABA tone. NPY acts rapidly via Y1/Y5 receptors; actions of AgRP are slower, but prolonged; α-MSH is the active peptide released by arcuate POMC neurons, acting on melanocortin-4 (MC4) receptors (e.g. in the PVN and LatH), and AgRP opposes α-MSH actions directly, acting as an MC4R reverse agonist. Other candidate anorectic neuro-peptides have weighed in, for example, PrRP (from the NTS). Oxytocin has central anorectic actions, evidently via the VMN, and in vivo, α-MSH inhibits electrical activity of magnocellular oxytocin neurons, but stimulates dendritic release of oxytocin, hence indicating a possible anorectic mechanism for α-MSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-2398212818812014">Sabatier et al., 2003</xref>). These oxytocin neurons are activated by a noradrenergic input from the A2 noradrenergic neurons in the NTS, which is stimulated by circulating CCK and secretin (indicators of a recent feed), acting via vagal afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr150-2398212818812014">Velmurugan et al., 2010</xref>); hence, centrally released oxytocin may contribute to satiety after a meal, as indicated by studies on oxytocin knockout mice.</p>

This combination of techniques has been used to show in mice the wide penetration of arcuate nucleus AgRP projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-2398212818812014">Sternson and Atasoy, 2014</xref>), to reveal a strong stimulatory connection from PVN TRH and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) neurons to arcuate nucleus AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2398212818812014">Krashes et al., 2014</xref>; this is intriguing as TRH and PACAP have contrasting central anorectic actions), and that CCK-producing neurons in the NTS, which are activated by feeding, project to MC4R positive (α-MSH sensitive) neurons in the pPVN and excite some of these appetite-suppressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2398212818812014">D’Agostino et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<p>Thyroid hormone is a major regulator of metabolic rate and the TRH neurons in the pPVN are an intrinsic component of the network regulating appetite and metabolism. TRH neurons receive input from leptin sensitive arcuate nucleus components of the network such that they are stimulated by leptin acting via α-MSH/CART projections and inhibited via NPY/AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-2398212818812014">Figure 6</xref>).

<title>Reproductive behaviour and gonadal control: perinatal masculinisation and defeminisation</title>
<p>The potential for central neuroendocrine mechanisms to organise the cyclical secretion of gonadotropins for ovulation and to perform respective sexual behaviour is present in both genetically male and female developing brains. The organisational/activational concept of sexual differentiation of the brain arose from series of experiments begun in the 1950s showing that the central mechanisms organising sex-specific behaviours in males undergo defeminisation and masculinisation as a result of fetal testosterone secretion and action late in gestation and just after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-2398212818812014">McCarthy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-2398212818812014">Phoenix et al., 1959</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-2398212818812014">Figure 7</xref>).

<p>Sexual differentiation of the brain: epigenetic programming of organisation by 17β-estradiol. Above: During a critical period in late gestation and early post-partum, testosterone from the perinatal testes is converted into 17β-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) by aromatase expressed in genetic males in the nascent sexually differentiated hubs in the neuroendocrine brain. E<sub>2</sub> binds to intracellular estrogen receptor α (ERα), a transcription factor, which enters neuronal nuclei, binds to DNA at specific sites and engages a transcription complex, which includes histone acetyl transferases (HATs), enabling access to DNA, and CREB-binding protein (CBP). DNA methyl transferase-3 (DNMT3) methylates cytosine in DNA at selected CpG islands, repressing gene expression, and importantly activated ERα evidently interferes with DNMT3 action in female neonates, reducing DNA methylation, which is essential for masculinisation and defeminisation of the brain in males. Below: Typical male sexual behaviour (black rat) is illustrated as the outcome in a genetically female neonate given E<sub>2</sub> treatment and then when adult treated with testosterone to activate the masculinised and defeminised brain; testosterone does not have this effect in normal females.</p>

<title>Key role for 17β-estradiol</title>
<p>Testosterone acts after conversion to 17β-estradiol by aromatase expressed during the critical period in development in the brain target regions, in particular the medial preoptic area (mPOA), important for male sex behaviour, and the VMN, important for female sex behaviour. The effects of perinatal estrogen (i.e. in males) include, via estrogen receptors, the prevention of apoptosis in the sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN, in the mPOA), increasing number of spines on mPOA neuron dendrites, loss of cells in the AVPV, in particular GABAergic and dopaminergic neurons (consistent with lack of support in males for the gonadotropin surge pattern stimulated by positive estrogen feedback for ovulation as in females), and defeminisation of the VMN, ablating female reproductive behaviour. Multiple mechanisms mediate these effects of estrogen, for example, prostaglandin E2 mediates estrogen action on mPOA dendrites, indirectly via glutamate and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-2398212818812014">McCarthy, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Epigenetics</title>
<p>It has been anticipated that the programming effects of 17β-estradiol derived from testosterone in the perinatal male brain would include epigenetic changes. There is evidence for epigenetic marks, DNA methylation at CpG sites (generally indicating gene repression) by DNA methyl transferases (DNMT). Female neonates have higher DNMT activity in the POA than males, with periods of expression in development essential for feminisation. Methylation can be dynamic with multiple mechanisms for demethylation, which is essential for masculinisation: the critical period for masculinisation is closed by DNA methylation, but can be kept open by treatment with a DNMT inhibitor. Histone de-acetylation (increasing gene expression) is involved in masculinisation, affecting multiple genes, so inhibition of de-acetylation impairs masculinisation of reproductive behaviour, but it is not clear which genes are critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-2398212818812014">McCarthy and Nugent, 2013</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section55-2398212818812014">
<title>Steroid milieu</title>
<p>Pregnancy involves massive changes in physiology and exposure of the brain to increased circulating concentrations of several hormones, from the ovaries, fetus and placenta, which elicit multiple changes in neuroendocrine mechanisms essential for the pregnancy and subsequent motherhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2398212818812014">Brunton and Russell, 2015</xref>). Progesterone is produced in large amounts in pregnancy and importantly, this can be converted by sequential actions of 5α-reductase and 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) in the brain into allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid allosteric enhancer at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section56-2398212818812014">
<title>Neuroendocrine hyporesponsiveness to stress</title>
<p>Among the neuroendocrine changes uncovered around the start of the 21st century is attenuation of HPA axis responses to stress, which is considered to give some protection to fetuses from adverse programming by glucocorticoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2398212818812014">Johnstone et al., 2000</xref>). This attenuation is seen in responses to physical and emotional stressors (e.g. interleukin-1β, IL-1β injection, as an infection mimic; aggression from a con-specific – social stress). Without pregnancy, IL-1β activates a noradrenergic pathway from the NTS to the CRH neurons in the pPVN, but in late pregnancy while IL-1β activates Fos in the NTS, it does not increase noradrenaline release or CRH mRNA expression in the PVN, and ACTH and corticosterone secretion are barely increased.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section57-2398212818812014">
<title>Allopregnanolone-opioid mechanism</title>
<p>Activation in pregnant rats of an endogenous opioid mechanism (PENK-A mRNA expression in the NTS is increased) is involved in reducing HPA axis stress responses as the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, given before IL-1β, restores noradrenaline release and HPA axis responses. In turn, the opioid mechanism is activated by the high levels of allopregnanolone, locally produced in the NTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2398212818812014">Brunton et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-2398212818812014">Figure 8</xref>). HPA axis responses to stress return after parturition, but are reduced by the suckling stimulus in lactation. Whether the changes in NTS noradrenergic neurons in pregnancy involve temporary allopregnanolone-induced epigenetic changes is not known. The same allopregnanolone-induced opioid mechanism is also responsible for attenuated magnocellular oxytocin neuron responses to IL-1β in late pregnancy, which is seen as a mechanism preventing premature birth.</p>

<p>Neurosteroid and opioid suppression of pPVN CRH neuron activity in pregnancy. In late pregnancy, hyporesponsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis to stressors is explained by reduced activation of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the medial parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (mpPVN). Without pregnancy, intravenous interleukin-1β (IL-1β) strongly activates the HPA axis, acting via A2 noradrenergic neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) that project to the pPVN, releasing noradrenaline (NA) to excite CRH neurons via α1 receptors. In late pregnancy, NA release in the PVN, CRH neuron responses (marked by increased CRH mRNA expression) to IL-1β, and consequently ACTH and corticosteroid responses, are all suppressed. There are two connected mechanisms: (1) Naloxone given before IL-1β reverses the changes, indicating activation of an endogenous opioid (EOP) mechanism in pregnancy; pro-enkephalin-A (PENK-A) and μ-opioid receptor (MOR) mRNA expression in the NTS is increased in pregnancy, providing a mechanism to explain presynaptically inhibited NA release in the PVN. (2) Allopregnanolone (AP) levels in the brain increase in pregnancy, as a result of conversion from high progesterone levels by 5α-reductase (5αR) and 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3αHSD); 5αR and 3αHSD mRNA expression and activity in the NTS is increased, indicating AP synthesis here. AP is an allosteric modifier of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (prolonging open time for Cl<sup>-</sup> entry), a possible action in pregnancy on CRH neurons, while blocking 5αR with finasteride reverses the EOP inhibition of the HPA axis, indicating that AP induces this EOP inhibition in pregnancy.</p>

These distinct differences are evaluated in experiments testing preference for a familiar versus an unfamiliar con-specific. As activation of oxytocin release in the mother’s brain after giving birth had been shown to be important in ensuring the rapid onset of maternal behaviour (in rats and sheep; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2398212818812014">Kendrick et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-2398212818812014">Pedersen and Prange 1979</xref>), supposing a role for oxytocin in establishing social relationships was a logical step. Studies in the 1990s showed roles for oxytocin and vasopressin in the brain in social memory and recognition in several species.

Approaches used include testing effects of administering oxytocin, measuring circulating oxytocin concentrations and molecular genetics.</p>

<title>Oxytocin administration</title>
<p>The aim of such studies has been to seek effects of exogenous oxytocin on various behavioural measures related to a social challenge, to test hypotheses about oxytocin actions in the brain. Many such studies have used intranasal spray administration of oxytocin solution, in the expectation that the oxytocin will enter the brain. There is no firm evidence that it does; on the contrary, the blood-brain barrier prevents such entry, and oxytocin is not known to have actions on any circumventricular organ. Intranasal administration of oxytocin as an aerosol, but not by spray, to rhesus macaques increases CSF oxytocin concentration, but the efficiency of ‘transfer’ was extremely low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2398212818812014">Leng and Ludwig, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-2398212818812014">Modi et al., 2014</xref>); in one human study, an increase in oxytocin concentration in CSF was claimed at 75 min after intranasal oxytocin (<italic>n</italic> = 3), but with only one placebo control participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-2398212818812014">Striepens et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, any changes in behaviour after intranasal oxytocin, at least by spray, are likely to be a consequence of peripheral effects following entry into blood; if so, these should be blocked by a peptide oxytocin antagonist, as this will not enter the brain, but evidently this has not yet been tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2398212818812014">Leng and Russell, 2016</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section69-2398212818812014">
<title>Measuring circulating oxytocin</title>
<p>There are two problems. First is a presumption that concentration of oxytocin in blood indicates oxytocin release in the brain: it will reflect the activity of magnocellular oxytocin neurons (of which only a few might be centrally projecting), but not parvocellular centrally projecting oxytocin neurons. Conversely, as magnocellular oxytocin neurons can be induced to release oxytocin from dendrites without excitation of secretion from the posterior pituitary, lack of increase in circulating oxytocin does not mean lack of central release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-2398212818812014">Sabatier et al., 2003</xref>). Second is that some of the assays used require extraction of peptide, and in many studies this has not been done, giving falsely very high (e.g. 60-fold vs. extracted) readings, as surveyed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2398212818812014">Brown et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2398212818812014">Leng and Ludwig, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-2398212818812014">Leng and Sabatier, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-2398212818812014">McCullough et al., 2013</xref>). Some studies report measurements of salivary oxytocin concentrations; however, it is not clear how this peptide can enter saliva, and if it does, how any changes in rate of saliva secretion are accounted for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2398212818812014">Jong et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>Molecular genetics: Epigenetic studies</title>
<p>An initial study combining use of post mortem brain tissue and blood cell analyses found that blood lymphocytes and temporal cortex samples from ASD cases showed increased methylation of CpG islands in <italic>OXTR</italic> regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2398212818812014">Gregory et al., 2009</xref>); the origin of the hypermethylation is not known. However, studies in rats have shown that offspring reared by mothers showing low levels of licking and grooming (low LG) had less <italic>OXTR</italic> methylation in blood but not in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2398212818812014">Beery et al., 2016</xref>); hence, measurement of epigenetic changes in blood or buccal cells does not reliably reflect changes in the brain. Moreover, <italic>OXTR</italic> methylation in blood cells changes acutely with stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-2398212818812014">Unternaehrer et al., 2012</xref>). For these reasons, such studies on the important issue of impact of <italic>OXTR</italic> methylation in the brain have to be regarded with caution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section71-2398212818812014">
<title>Genetic variations</title>
<p>Meta-analysis of studies of genetic variations in the <italic>OXTR</italic> gene indicates an association of the gene with ASD, and in particular implicates four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); the functional consequences of the SNPs are not known. Further studies are needed to address several limitations of the datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-2398212818812014">LoParo and Waldman, 2015</xref>). Perhaps, CRISPR/Cas gene editing in model animals, that is, the laboratory rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2398212818812014">Meek et al., 2017</xref>), will allow elucidation of the impact of minor changes in a target gene on neuroendocrine function and complex behaviour.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Overall, human studies on the translation of studies of central oxytocin functions in animal models have been embarked on, and inferences often drawn on a background of inadequate information or critical appreciation of neuroendocrine mechanisms, despite the extensive basic biomedical literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2398212818812014">Grinevich et al., 2016</xref>). Nonetheless, there is more potential in this area for contributions to social neuroscience, especially in understanding aberrant social functioning, from deep basic neuroendocrine studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2398212818812014">Insel, 2010</xref>).</p>
