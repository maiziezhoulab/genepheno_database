<abstract>
<p>Accumulating evidence indicates that paternal age correlates with disease risk in children. De novo gain-of-function mutations in the FGF-RAS-MAPK signaling pathway are known to cause a subset of genetic diseases associated with advanced paternal age, such as Apert syndrome, achondroplasia, Noonan syndrome, and Costello syndrome. It has been hypothesized that adult spermatogonial stem cells with pathogenic mutations are clonally expanded over time and propagate the mutations to offspring. However, no model system exists to interrogate mammalian germline stem cell competition in vivo. In this study, we created a lineage tracing system, which enabled undifferentiated spermatogonia with endogenous expression of <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>, a known pathogenic gain-of-function mutation in RAS-MAPK signaling, to compete with their wild-type counterparts in the mouse testis. Over a year of fate analysis, neither <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>-positive germ cells nor sperm exhibited a significant expansion compared to wild-type neighbors. Short-term stem cell capacity as measured by transplantation analysis was also comparable between wild-type and mutant groups. Furthermore, although constitutively active HRAS was detectable in the mutant cell lines, they did not exhibit a proliferative advantage or an enhanced response to agonist-evoked pERK signaling. These in vivo and in vitro results suggest that mouse spermatogonial stem cells are functionally resistant to a heterozygous <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> mutation in the endogenous locus and that mechanisms could exist to prevent such harmful mutations from being expanded and transmitted to the next generation.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Recent research has found that advanced paternal age is associated with increased risk in children to develop a subset of congenital anomalies, such as Apert syndrome, achondroplasia, Noonan syndrome, and Costello syndrome. The causative genetic errors (mutations) in these disorders have been identified to originate from the fathers’ testicles and their numbers increase with fathers’ age. It has been hypothesized that the germline stem cells that continuously self-renew and differentiate to supply sperm (referred as spermatogonial stem cells [SSCs]) carry these mutations and have the ability to expand preferentially as compared to normal SSCs with advancing age of the father, thereby increasing the likelihood of transmission of mutant sperm to the next generation. To test this hypothesis, we created a mouse model, in which a mutation known to enhance cell proliferation is induced in a subset of SSCs, and these cells compete with the neighboring normal (i.e., wild-type) stem cells. However, surprisingly, the germline cell population carrying the mutation in the testis was stable over a year of observation, suggesting that mechanisms could exist to prevent such harmful mutations from being expanded and transmitted to the next generation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In order to propagate genetic information to the next generation with high fidelity, germline cells must maintain a low mutation rate. Nevertheless, maternal germline cells (human oocytes) are well known to transmit abnormal chromosomes to offspring, especially in advanced maternal age (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref001">1</xref>]). Surprisingly, recent high-throughput genome analyses have revealed that men contribute a much higher number of mutations, specifically de novo single nucleotide mutations, to their children than do women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref004">4</xref>]. Most strikingly, the risk of certain genetic disorders increases with advancing age of the father at the time conception of the child, referred to as the paternal age effect (PAE). This phenomenon could be explained by the unique biology of paternal germline stem cells. The latter are termed spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), and, once established in the post-natal period, continue to self-renew and differentiate to supply sperm in mammals throughout adult life. This continuous self-renewal and long-term survival of SSCs may underlie the increase in mutation burden with paternal age, due to a cumulative increase in copy errors or other DNA lesions, despite the fact that the baseline germline mutation rate is thought to be lower than that of somatic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref005">5</xref>]. Although the natural history of mutations in the aging testis is poorly understood, pathogenic variants are occasionally transmitted to offspring, resulting in a wide range of disorders. Among these, de novo gain-of-function mutations in the growth factor receptor-RAS signaling pathway are classically known to cause so-called PAE disorders, such as Apert syndrome, achondroplasia, Noonan syndrome, and Costello syndrome (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref006">6</xref>]).</p>
<p>Direct quantification of such mutations in the sperm and testes of healthy men of different ages has revealed an age-dependent increase in the mutation burden, in a manner that exceeds what would be expected from cumulative copy errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref009">9</xref>]. Moreover, in human testes, Ras pathway-associated mutations have been reported to occur in a clustered manner, suggesting that SSCs with PAE mutations are positively selected and clonally expand in normal, otherwise healthy testes over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref012">12</xref>]. We previously showed that a gain-of-function mutation in FGFR2 that causes Apert syndrome is sufficient to confer a selective advantage to murine SSCs in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref013">13</xref>]. However, no model system has been developed to interrogate mammalian SSC competition in vivo. Furthermore, no cell biological or molecular mechanisms have been described to explain this phenomenon. Although clonal expansion of stem cells with oncogenic mutations has been observed in the mouse intestinal crypt model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref015">15</xref>], it is not clear whether the same holds true for SSCs in the adult mouse testis. To test this long-standing hypothesis for SSC competition, we sought to establish an inducible mosaic model in which a hyperactive form of <italic>Hras</italic> could be induced within the endogenous locus in a subset of SSCs so that their long-term fate could be followed.</p>
<p>The undifferentiated spermatogonia (A<sub>undiff</sub>) represent a population of cells in the mammalian testes that is defined by morphology and function. Along with somewhat more committed cells, the A<sub>undiff</sub> pool contains long-term self-renewing SSCs. Morphologically, the A<sub>undiff</sub> in rodents comprises A<sub>s</sub> (single), A<sub>pr</sub> (pair), and A<sub>al</sub> (aligned) cells, which are remarkably interconvertible, with significant migratory capacity and cell fate plasticity when subject to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref017">17</xref>]. Those cells reside along the basement membrane in the seminiferous tubules and are heterogeneous with respect to expression of genetic markers. Hara et al. (2014) first employed a cre driver controlled by the endogenous promoter of <italic>Gfra1</italic>, one of the robustly expressed markers for A<sub>undiff</sub> and demonstrated that the labeled population marked by <italic>Gfra1-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> comprised the long-term stem cell fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref016">16</xref>]. Therefore, in our current study, we chose the same <italic>Gfra1</italic> cre driver to create a novel germline mosaic model.</p>
<p>HRAS, a member of the RAS oncogene superfamily, is a monomeric GTPase and relays signals from receptor tyrosine kinases to the cell interior. It serves as a molecular switch for a MAP kinase signaling module in which HRAS is “on” when GTP is bound and “off” when GDP is bound (as reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref018">18</xref>]). The <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> mutation encodes a hyperactive form of HRAS protein that is locked in a GTP-bound state and cannot hydrolyze its bound GTP to GDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref020">20</xref>]. <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> is a rare mutation found in patients with Costello syndrome, whereas the <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12S</italic></sup> mutation comprises the majority of probands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref021">21</xref>], and it has been demonstrated that the <italic>Hras</italic> mutation burden in sperm from healthy donors increases according to donors’ age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref009">9</xref>]. In mice, heterozygous <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> mice phenocopy human Costello syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref022">22</xref>]. It was observed that overexpression of <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> using transgenes in cultured mouse SSCs caused tumor development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref023">23</xref>]. However, the effect of one copy of hyperactive Hras expression on paternal SSCs in vivo, simulating the putative earliest events in the human gain-of-function mutation disorder, has never been addressed.</p>
<p>In order to understand how a hyperactive HRAS affects long-term paternal stem cell fate, we induced <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> at the endogenous locus in A<sub>undiff</sub> in a mosaic manner. We found that <italic>Gfra1-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> successfully drives mosaic <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> activation in the adult germline in vivo. This model system allowed us to track mutated cell fate for prolonged chase periods in a quantitative manner. Surprisingly, the mutated SSC fraction persisted stably without significant expansion, suggesting that robust mechanisms exist to protect the SSC pool from harmful expansion of mutated cells and prevent transmission of deleterious alleles.</p>

<title>Mosaic induction of endogenous <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> alleles in the undifferentiated spermatogonial pool</title>
<p>Whereas cultured SSCs are reported to express <italic>Hras</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref023">23</xref>], the abundance of <italic>Hras</italic> transcripts in the A<sub>undiff</sub> spermatogonia <italic>in vivo</italic> has not been reported. Therefore, we evaluated <italic>Hras</italic> expression <italic>in vivo</italic> in A<sub>undiff</sub>, as a surrogate for SSCs. To isolate the A<sub>undiff</sub> population by flow sorting, we stained dissociated testicular cells with an anti-MCAM antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Although MCAM-based sorting has been previously shown to enrich the A<sub>undiff</sub> population, MCAM is also expressed in somatic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref025">25</xref>]. To avoid somatic cell contamination in FACS experiments, we first obtained tdTomato-labeled germ line cells using <italic>Gfra1-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>; <italic>tdTom</italic><sup><italic>fl/-</italic></sup> mice, in which tamoxifen induces tdTomato efficiently in the A<sub>undiff</sub> and their progeny but not in testicular somatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g001">Fig 1G</xref>, iWT). Three months after tamoxifen induction, tdTomato+ cells that had high, medium, low, or absent (negative) expression of MCAM were isolated by FACS and analyzed for <italic>Hras</italic> by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). <italic>Hras</italic> transcripts were found throughout the different germ cell populations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>A. Schematic showing workflow for collection of the A<sub>undiff</sub> population from dissociated testicular cells of genetically engineered mice with induced germ cell-restricted tdTomato expression with or without the <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> allele. After 3–4 months of tamoxifen administration to <italic>Gfra1-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>; <italic>tdTom</italic><sup><italic>fl/-</italic></sup> (WT) mice, testes were dissociated, and the tdTomato+ cells were sorted based on MCAM expression levels (high, medium, dim, and negative). B. Flow cytometry analysis of dissociated testicular cells from induced WT mice. After exclusion of doublet and dead (DAPI+) cells, tdTomato+ gated cells (top) were sorted to obtain MCAM high, medium, dim, and negative populations (bottom). C. <italic>Gfra1</italic> and <italic>Hras</italic> transcripts in different germ line populations of the wild-type testis. Using tamoxifen-induced <italic>Gfra1-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>; <italic>tdTom</italic><sup><italic>fl/-</italic></sup> animals (n = 3), the tdTomato+ population which contains only germline cells) was sorted into MCAM-high, medium, dim, and negative populations. The MCAM-high population yielded elevated <italic>Gfra1</italic> mRNA (left graph), indicating that this population is enriched for undifferentiated spermatogonia (A<sub>undiff</sub>). The level of <italic>Hras</italic> transcript (relative to <italic>Actb</italic>) was similar among these four different germline populations. Inset: the final qPCR products were run on agarose gel and shown on the top. D. Strategy to induce <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup> exclusively in undifferentiated spermatogonia. After tamoxifen administration, the wild-type <italic>Hras</italic> allele is excised as it is flanked by two loxP sites (black triangle). Both the wild-type <italic>Hras</italic> allele (before recombination) and the recombined <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> alleles are under the regulatory control of the endogenous <italic>Hras</italic> promoter. After tamoxifen administration, we designated the animals as induced WT (iWT) or induced FR (iFR). E. Sanger sequence trace of reverse-transcribed PCR product from tdTomato+ germ line cells in testis of iWT and iFR three months after a four-day tamoxifen regimen. Note that the mutant A peak is smaller than the C peak, indicating that not all the tdTomato+ cells were positive for <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>. F. Similar <italic>Hras</italic> mRNA levels in A<sub>undiff</sub> from iWT and iFR (n = two littermates; right and left). RT-qPCR primers were designed to recognize a common region for iWT &amp; iFR. Animals were treated with two courses of tamoxifen (one course = 4 consecutive days) over two weeks. G. Reporter expression in the undifferentiated spermatogonia after one course of tamoxifen. Top panels are whole-mount immunofluorescence using anti-GFRA1 (pseudocolored magenta). On day 6 (day 0 = first day of tamoxifen administration), tdTomato (pseudocolored green) efficiently labeled undifferentiated spermatogonia positive for GFRA1 (magenta) both in iWT and iFR (representative images from n = 2 animals for each group). A representative A <sub>single</sub> cell positive for GFRA1 is magnified from the white box. After 3 months, whole segments were occupied by tdTomato+ germline cells. Bottom panels are cross-sectioned tubules showing that tdTomato+ A<sub>undiff</sub> differentiate and produce spermatids both in iWT and iFR. Scale bars: 100 μm.</p>

<p>To induce the <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> mutation exclusively in A<sub>undiff</sub>, we employed the <italic>Gfra1-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> mouse line. A “flox-and-replace” (FR) model generated by Chen et al. (2006) was utilized to produce monoallelic <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref022">22</xref>]. In this mouse line, the endogenous <italic>Hras</italic> locus consists of 2 tandemly-arrayed <italic>Hras</italic> genes, the upstream of which is a WT allele flanked by <italic>loxP</italic> sites, such that the downstream <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> allele is silent until removal of the upstream 2.5 kb WT gene by recombination. By breeding, we generated <italic>Gfra1-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>; <italic>tdTom</italic><sup><italic>fl/-</italic></sup>; <italic>FR-Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12Vfl/-</italic></sup> mice. Tamoxifen-inducible Cre-mediated recombination of the <italic>Hras</italic> locus resulted in conversion from wild-type <italic>Hras</italic> to <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> and activation of tdTomato expression at the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g001">Fig 1D &amp; 1G</xref>). To verify the presence of the mutation in the testes, cDNA was obtained from FACS-sorted tdTomato-positive testicular cells, which consisted of pure germline cells (since the <italic>Gfra1</italic> promoter is not active in testicular somatic cells) and was amplified for sequencing. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the expected nucleotide substitution (C&gt;A) was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). From the chromatogram, not all the tdTomato-positive cells exhibited <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> three months after tamoxifen induction, indicating that wild-type and <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>-positive germline cells coexisted in a mosaic manner in the labeled germline cell population. Importantly, <italic>Hras</italic> mRNA levels of A<sub>undiff</sub> in vivo (i.e., tdTomato+/MCAM-high population in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) measured by qPCR were similar between induced WT and FR mice, validating that a physiological level of <italic>Hras</italic> expression (WT + <italic>G12V</italic>) was achieved in the induced FR (iFR) model by utilizing the endogenous locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g001">Fig 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>To measure the fractional abundance of <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>-positive cells in germline cells, two independent methods were developed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g002">Fig 2A–2F</xref>). First, Sanger sequencing-derived plots of amplified cDNA from RNA were employed to quantify the mutated nucleotide (cytosine→adenine) from sequencing traces and create a model equation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008139.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The validity of the model was confirmed by amplifying cDNA samples of RNA of known standard concentrations from WT (<italic>Hras</italic><sup>WT/WT</sup> or <italic>Hras</italic><sup>FR/WT</sup>) and Costello syndrome (<italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V/WT</italic></sup>) mice at varying ratios (0–100% Costello mRNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref>). The relationship between the <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>-positive cell fraction (<italic>x</italic>%) and the ratio of adenine/cytosine (A/C) peak heights (<italic>y</italic>) fitted the model curve (<italic>y = 1</italic>.<italic>371*x / [200-x]</italic>). In the second approach, sperm genomic DNA (gDNA) analysis was used to quantify the <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>-positive cell fraction. GDNA qPCR primers were designed to detect an <italic>SV40</italic> poly-A (PA) region exclusive to the <italic>FR-Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12Vfl</italic></sup> locus but which is lost after recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g002">Fig 2D–2F</xref>). By performing qPCR with mixed gDNA comprising heterozygotic <italic>FR-Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> (i.e., without recombination) and wild-type sperm at different known ratios, we confirmed a linear relationship between the <italic>FR-Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12Vfl</italic></sup> recombined fraction (<italic>x</italic>%) and the <italic>SV40</italic> PA allelic fraction obtained by qPCR (<italic>y</italic>%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Since the loss of <italic>SV40</italic> PA or <italic>FR</italic> means a gain of <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12</italic>V</sup>, <italic>y = 100-z</italic> was obtained, where <italic>z</italic> is the <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>-positive cell fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Using these two methods, <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>-positive cell fractions of tamoxifen-induced animals were measured. The calculated fractions from sperm gDNA qPCR correlated well with that from the Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). Furthermore, we observed a tamoxifen dose-dependent increase in the <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>-positive fraction in sperm gDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g002">Fig 2H</xref>). These results indicate not only that <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup> was successfully induced in A<sub>undiff</sub> by tamoxifen but also that <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup> A<sub>undiff</sub> can undergo differentiation and produce sperm.</p>

<p>A. Five representative chromatograms from Sanger sequencing. Costello and WT offspring RNA were mixed at varying ratios (0–100%), reverse-transcribed into cDNA, amplified by PCR, and sequenced. N≥3 mouse pairs were used for each concentration. B. Generation of a model curve for quantification of variant nucleotide. To quantify the mutated nucleotide (cytosine→adenine) from Sanger sequencing traces, a model curve (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008139.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) was proposed as <italic>y = k*x/(200-x)</italic> in which <italic>x</italic> is <italic>Hras</italic>G12+ cell fraction, <italic>y</italic> is A/C ratio, and <italic>k</italic> is a constant for PCR efficiency difference between WT and <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> templates. By using the actual A/C ratios obtained by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, we confirmed <italic>k</italic> = 1.371. C. An example of calculation for the <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>+ cell fraction: <italic>x</italic>%.

Quantification of <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>+ cell fraction using gDNA. gDNA qPCR primers were designed to amplify the red regions of SV40 polyA and the end of <italic>mtdTomato</italic> alleles respectively. Tamoxifen-inducible Cre-mediated recombination results in deletion of these regions. E. By running qPCR with mixed sperm gDNA of FR heterozygote (without recombination) and wild-type sperm at varying ratios (x-axis: 0, 25, 50, 75, 100%: n = 3 samples per each), we confirmed the linear relationship between the known FR allele+ cell fraction (<italic>x</italic>%) and SV40 polyA allelic fraction (<italic>y</italic>%) obtained by qPCR (<italic>y = x</italic>). F. Loss of SV40 PA implies a gain of <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>, indicating that the SV40 PA allelic fraction (y%) is in inverse proportion to the <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>-positive cell fraction (<italic>z</italic>), (<italic>y = 100-z</italic>).

<p>Previously, Chen et al.

In that study, <italic>FR-Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> mice were crossed with <italic>Caggs-Cre</italic> (<italic>CC</italic>) mice to obtain <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> heterozygotes, which phenotypically recapitulated Costello syndrome (driven by <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12S</italic></sup>). In the prior model, <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup> induction takes place after fertilization, rather than in the parental germ cells. On the other hand, our inducible system enabled us to test whether mosaic <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>-positive A<sub>undiff</sub> (in a context of neighboring wild-type germ cells and somatic cells) can differentiate into normal sperm and give rise to F1 offspring with Costello syndrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g003">Fig 3A</xref> right).

<title>Stability of the <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> mutation burden over time</title>
<p><italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> has been detected in human sperm of healthy donors and is allelic to <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12S</italic></sup>, the most common mutation in Costello syndrome, which increases with sperm donor age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref009">9</xref>]. Given that gain-of-function mutations in the RAS pathway mediate positive selection of human SSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref027">27</xref>] and that overexpression of an <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> cDNA is tumorigenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref023">23</xref>], we hypothesized that an increasing burden of <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> would be detectable over time following induction in the adult testis.

<p>Sperm mutation analysis serves as a more physiologically relevant readout, since human studies on mutation burden utilized sperm samples from different age individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref009">9</xref>]. Thus, to mirror the human studies, we collected sperm from different time points following tamoxifen induction. Using qPCR, we quantified the <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>-positive cell fractions in gDNA of sperm obtained from the cauda epididymis at these time points. Similar to the <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>-positive cell frequency among tdTomato-labeled germ cells, the <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>-positive sperm proportion also did not show an increase over the 11-month chase period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, right).</p>
<p>Sperm studies have demonstrated large inter-individual variance in the mutation burden in the same age cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref009">9</xref>]. Therefore, such static observations require a large sample size, which is not always readily achieved. Furthermore, the time at which mutations first appear in the human testis is unknown, nor is the mutational load at relevant loci at the time of early adulthood. An ideal study would examine sperm serially from same individuals, in order to capture a temporal change in the proportion of the variant cell population using a relatively small cohort. If selection for the <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> genotype were to occur, one would predict an increase in the same individual over time. Thus, we established a method for in vivo serial sperm sampling. We performed microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref028">28</xref>], in which sperm was withdrawn twice from a live single male from the ipsilateral testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g004">Fig 4C</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008139.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). For this study, we employed the <italic>mTmG</italic> reporter mouse line, in which membrane tdTomato expression converts to membrane GFP (mGFP) upon cre-induced recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref029">29</xref>]. We generated <italic>Gfra1-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>; <italic>mTmG</italic><sup><italic>fl/-</italic></sup>; <italic>FR-Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12Vfl/-</italic></sup> males and induced <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup> and mGFP in A<sub>undiff</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Sperm from wild-type siblings (i.e., <italic>Gfra1-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>; <italic>mTmG</italic><sup><italic>fl/-</italic></sup>) served as controls. In the control model, the recombined <italic>mTmG</italic> fraction obtained by measuring the loss of the <italic>tdTomato</italic> allele (as a reference) by qPCR should not change over time unless there is competition between tdTomato+ and GFP+ A<sub>undiff</sub>. Both the <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> and reference allelic fractions were measured by qPCR as above (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). From 4 months to 12 months, a minimal increase (~9% on average) in the <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>-positive cell fraction was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Of note, the reference alleles in the wild type did not show any increase over the same time period, suggesting that tdTomato+ and GFP+ germ cells are mutually neutral with respect to fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g004">Fig 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm whether the <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>-positive cell fraction increases, we used a different method to assess the ratios of sperm bearing mGFP vs. tdTomato, resulting from <italic>Gfra1</italic>-expressing progenitors, in which the reporter transgene either remained intact or, alternatively, underwent recombination. The mGFP+ and tdTomato+ sperm were counted at two time points, at 4 months and 12 months, and the ratio of mGFP-positive to total sperm (mGFP-positive plus tdTomato-positive) was calculated. There was a strong positive correlation between values obtained by sperm counting vs. qPCR with the r<sup>2</sup> = 0.90 (p&lt;0.0001), validating that the sperm counting method itself was as accurate as the qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Thus, if the <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>-positive sperm increase over time, we should observe an increase in the GFP+ sperm population. However, no change in the fraction of mGFP+ sperm in the mutant was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). Finally, we analyzed successive litters from tamoxifen-induced <italic>Gfra1-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>; <italic>tdTom</italic><sup><italic>fl/-</italic></sup>; <italic>FR-Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12Vfl/-</italic></sup> sires; no increase was observed in the proportion of <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V/WT</italic></sup> offspring obtained at the early phase of the study interval compared to the late phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008139.s003">S1 Table</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the population structure is relatively stable and do not support a substantial change in the ratios of controls and mutant cells within the mosaic pool.</p>

<title>Comparable stem cell activity between wild-type and <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>-positive undifferentiated spermatogonia</title>
<p>To test stem cell capacity of A<sub>undiff</sub> containing the <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> mutation, competitive SSC transplant assays developed by Kanatsu-Shinohara et al. (2010) were carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref030">30</xref>]. In general, transplantation assays serve to measure cell autonomous capacity for self-renewal, survival, and differentiation. By mixing neutral, unlabeled competitor cells with either labeled experimental or labeled control donor cells, respectively, this method is designed to force the donor cells in question to compete against unlabeled competitors and allow direct functional comparisons between the two different donor types. Following two courses of tamoxifen treatment in vivo, the FR locus recombined at high efficiency, concurrent with the <italic>Rosa26-LoxStopLox tdTomato</italic> locus, indicating that most of the A<sub>undiff</sub> were positive for <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup> and tdTomato (see next paragraph below). From the previous result above (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), this recombination ratio did not change over an extended period, suggesting that the number of initially induced <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>-positive A<sub>undiff</sub> remained stable by balancing self-renewal and differentiation for the rest of the time course. Therefore, the timing of testicular cell collection after tamoxifen (i.e., length of chase) should not affect the size of A<sub>undiff</sub> population. Based on these findings, we chose to perform the transplantation assay 2 weeks after the start of tamoxifen administration. Dissociated testicular cells from these tamoxifen-administered WT (iWT) and FR (iFR) were mixed with non-labeled wild-type competitor testicular cells from <italic>Gfra1-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> mice at a ratio of 1:1 and microinjected into busulfan-treated recipient testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). After 10 weeks, tdTomato-positive colonies were counted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Colony numbers were comparable between iWT and iFR, suggesting that the short-term cell-intrinsic capacity of stem cells of <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>-positive A<sub>undiff</sub> is not greater than that of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>Molecular signatures of <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>-positive undifferentiated spermatogonia</title>
<p>Activating mutations in oncogenes such as RAS family members are thought to produce relatively robust changes in cell phenotype and gene expression, particularly in tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref032">32</xref>]. To understand the molecular features of <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>+ A<sub>undiff</sub> in vivo, we isolated tdTomato+ and MCAM bright A<sub>undiff</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) from WT and FR mice treated with high-dose tamoxifen (i.e., two courses) for RNA-Seq three months after induction. In order to confirm that the <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>-positive A<sub>undiff</sub> fraction was sufficiently high in the mutant (MUT) group, a variant calling analysis was performed at position chr7:141192906, where the <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> (c.35G&gt;T) mutation substitutes an adenine for a cytosine. This revealed that the mutation fraction was 46–49% in the MUT group, indicating that &gt;92% of the isolated A<sub>undiff</sub> had undergone recombination and were positive for <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis detected only minimal differences between the two groups, suggesting that A<sub>undiff</sub> from WT and MUT are highly similar at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008139.s004">S2 Table</xref>). Among the few differentially expressed genes, <italic>Pax7</italic> was found to be upregulated in MUT. This result was confirmed by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). However, the remaining seven differentially expressed genes were either functionally elusive or apparently irrelevant in A<sub>undiff</sub>. To further capture any subtle differences in phenotype between WT and <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>+ A<sub>undiff</sub>, we manually curated a gene list comprising 28 stem cell marker genes and 25 differentiation marker genes based on recent studies that employed single cell RNA sequencing of mouse A<sub>undiff</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref034">34</xref>] and created a heat map for the differential expression (log<sub>2</sub> CPM) for each sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Apart from <italic>Pax7</italic>, these 52 genes, were not differentially expressed; yet, the stem cell marker genes trended toward slight down-regulation and the differentiation markers exhibited slight up-regulation in the MUT group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Despite these trends, we concluded that <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup> does not confer large transcription alterations in mutants.</p>

<title>Stable phenotype of cultured <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> SSCs</title>
<p>Cultured SSCs serve not only as a complementary model for a complex in vivo system but also enable facile manipulation of extrinsic stimuli to enhance cell phenotypes. Thus, to elaborate on the functional effects of Hras<sup>G12V</sup> in vitro, we derived SSC cell lines from different adult mouse lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Upon 4-OHT addition in vitro, WT cells activated tdTomato (iWT1) or mGFP (iWT2) and FR cells initiated expression of <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>, in addition to tdTomato (iFR1) or mGFP (iFR2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).

Since HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> protein is locked in a constitutively active conformation, we examined the amount of the functionally active form of HRAS in iFR SSC lines using a pull-down assay, in which only the active form of HRAS is recognized by the RAS-binding domain of RAF1. Active HRAS was pulled down only in the iFR but not in the iWT, demonstrating the presence of functional HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> protein in this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g007">Fig 7C</xref>).</p>

<p>We next studied changes in the growth trajectory of <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> SSCs. In normal culture conditions, iFR did not grow faster than FR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Several lines of evidence show that a fitness advantage may be more pronounced upon environmental challenge, such as growth factor deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref035">35</xref>]. We therefore examined whether <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> SSCs outcompete wild-type SSCs when cultured at an FGF2 concentration 100-fold lower than is used in normal SSC growth media. For the following experiments, FR2 and iFR2 cell lines were employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g007">Fig 7A &amp; 7E</xref>). We mixed the non-induced parental wild-type line FR2 (mtdTomato+) with iFR (mGFP+) at a 1:1 ratio and cultured them on feeder cells in FGF2 (0.01 or 10 ng/ml) for up to five passages. iFR did not replace its wild-type parental line over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). This result suggests that a low FGF2 environment does not confer a competitive advantage to <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> SSCs.</p>
<p><italic>Hras</italic> is an important mediator molecule of FGF-RAS-MAPK signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref023">23</xref>], and FGF2 has been shown to control stem cell self-renewal and possibly differentiation in SSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref037">37</xref>]. In various RASopathy models, RAS-MAPK signaling pathways are highly dysregulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref039">39</xref>]. However, it is unclear whether this holds true for SSCs harboring endogenous gain-of-function mutations seen in RASopathies. To understand how MAPK signaling is altered in <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> SSCs in response to FGF2, iWT and iFR SSC clones were stimulated with FGF2 and probed for pERK and total ERK. pERK was similarly phosphorylated in iWT and iFR in response to FGF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008139.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). However, basal level ERK phosphorylation prior to stimulation appeared to be slightly higher in iFR as compared to iWT. Lack of enhanced ERK activity in iFR following stimulation was unexpected, considering the presence of active HRAS protein in iFR cell lines. This result suggests that active HRAS at a physiological gene dosage does not augment the signal response to FGF2 in SSCs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The competitive interactions of wild-type and neighboring mutant germline stem cells in the adult human testis are thought to produce uneven transmission of pathogenic alleles to children, but a dearth of model systems has hindered progress toward understanding the details of selection. In this study, we created a stem cell competition system in the mouse germline, in which undifferentiated spermatogonia with endogenous expression of an oncogenic mutation, <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>, compete with their wild-type counterparts in the testis. We found that the <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> mutation was transmitted from the paternal germline stem cells to offspring, whereas the mutated germ cells did not exhibit a significant expansion over a year of fate analysis.</p>
<p>For in vivo genetic manipulation of the A<sub>undiff</sub>, which contain the stem cell pool, only a handful cre driver lines have been described, including Vasa-cre and Stra8-cre. These cre alleles are not only non-specific with respect to germ cell subpopulations but also are active during early gonadal development, making it difficult to study adult mouse SSCs. For these reasons, cultured SSCs have been employed for loss- or gain-of-function studies using knock-down/out or ectopic expression of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref023">23</xref>]. Hara et al. (2014) first leveraged <italic>Gfra1-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> for lineage tracing of adult A<sub>undiff</sub>; by measuring long-term self-renewal of the population, they demonstrated that genetically marked A<sub>undiff</sub> are functional stem cells that persist at homeostatic levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref016">16</xref>]. In our mouse model, therefore, we adapted <italic>Gfra1-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> to induce both a mutation and a label in the A<sub>undiff</sub> and achieved robust recombination at the target loci in A<sub>undiff</sub>. Conveniently, the size of the recombined fraction was adjustable from ~8 to almost 100% by dose of tamoxifen. This tunability makes <italic>Gfra1-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> an appropriate cre-driver to study germline mosaicism, in which only a small subset of stem cells is genetically manipulated or marked and their fate is traceable thereafter. On the other hand, with a high dose of tamoxifen, <italic>Gfra1-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> is suitable to obtain a highly enriched population of genetically manipulated germline cells in vivo. Indeed, by combining <italic>Gfra1-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> with a reporter and anti-MCAM staining, we were able to enrich an A<sub>undiff</sub> sample with 96% <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> positivity, as measured at the RNA level. Although <italic>Gfra1-creER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> seems to be best available inducible driver to genetically manipulate adult A<sub>undiff</sub>, it is notable that <italic>Gfra1</italic> is broadly expressed in the A<sub>undiff</sub> and that the <italic>Gfra1</italic>-expressing population comprises a heterogeneous subset of A<sub>undiff</sub>. It remains controversial whether <italic>Gfra1</italic>-negative stem cells exist in the A<sub>undiff</sub>.</p>
<p>Complex engineered alleles are required to model precisely the genetics of human germline disorders. In the <italic>FR-Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12Vfl/-</italic></sup> system, we sought to induce <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> without affecting total gene dosage throughout the recombination process; accordingly, similar levels of <italic>Hras</italic> transcript were observed before and after cre induction. Thus, such an approach most closely recapitulates the occurrence of human de novo mutations in male germline stem cells and the resultant germline mosaicism. Also, since this genetic model entails two tandem <italic>Hras</italic> genes, both comprising endogenous exons and introns, the final transcription product is also an endogenously spliced variant, in case any alternatively spliced SSC-specific variant exists. In our model, we found that recombination at the <italic>Rosa26</italic> reporter locus happened more efficiently than that of the <italic>FR-Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> locus. This could be explained by accessibility of the locus to cre recombinase; the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus is known for its constitutively active promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref040">40</xref>], whereas the activity of the <italic>Hras</italic> locus may be tightly regulated by transcription factors and/or chromatin remodeling.</p>
<p>Classical PAE disorders, such as Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, and other RASopathies, are caused by de novo mutations that are found only in affected children but not in the somatic DNA of either parent. Although most such mutations are derived from the paternal germline (as reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref006">6</xref>]), the process of transmission from paternal germline stem cells to the offspring has not been widely explored. A major strength of our strategy is that it allows one to interrogate the transmission of the mutated gene induced in male germline stem cells to subsequent generations. Here, we observed that the fate of <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup> stem cells resulted in <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup> offspring with neonatal mortality, consistent with Costello syndrome. This indicates that A<sub>undiff</sub> carrying <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> can differentiate into functional sperm, and the resultant Costello embryos are capable of developing to the neonatal stage. Similarly, our germline mosaic model could be applied to a variety of other de novo disorders with PAEs. Owing to technological advancements in genome sequencing, many de novo mutations that originate in the paternal germline have been implicated as drivers of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism). Yet, adult germline mosaicism as a major source of human disease is still controversial, and its natural course has not been addressed experimentally. By inducing specific autism-driving mutations in A<sub>undiff</sub> and tracking their fate, our mosaic model could be useful going forward to uncover the causal relationship between paternal age and neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
<p>A human sperm analysis revealed that healthy males carried different <italic>Hras</italic> mutations at codon 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref009">9</xref>]. Although <italic>G12S</italic> was the most prevalent mutation, <italic>G12V</italic> was also substantially elevated in the sperm and the level was weakly correlated with donor age. Thus, we sought to investigate how <italic>G12V</italic>-laden germline cells expand in our experimental model. To perform stringent lineage tracing of <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup>-positive cells, we employed multiple independent quantification methods and their outcomes were well correlated: cDNA sequencing from labeled germ cells, sperm gDNA analysis, and sperm counting. Over a year of lineage tracing, we did not observe a significant increase in the <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup> cell and sperm populations. In the serial sperm analysis, a minimal increase (~9%) was observed over the 8–9 month period, yet we did not observe an increase in the proportion of <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup> offspring from mutant sires in successive litters. Despite the fact that the <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup> is the most potent gain-of-function mutation among various HRAS proteins at codon 12, these findings indicate that the heterozygous <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> alone is not sufficient to drive SSC competition in the mouse testis.</p>
<p>There are several possible explanations for the absence of competition in our model. First, there could be fail-safe mechanisms to suppress aberrant cell signaling driven by hyperactive RAS, providing a robust system that protects stem cells from harmful consequences. Second, HRAS may not have a major role in FGF-RAS-MAPK signaling in the A<sub>undiff</sub>, which would be unexpected given previously published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref023">23</xref>]. Other members of the RAS superfamily may be critical for relaying FGF signals in the SSCs. Third, the <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> mutation may be detrimental, such that that cell turnover could be faster than usual. Fourth, induction experiments performed at extremely low starting (i.e., baseline) mutation levels (e.g., &lt;1% recombination) might reveal competitive interactions that could have been obscured in our experiments, due to as yet uncharacterized paracrine effects. Fifth, key differences could exist in the microenvironment or cellular population structure between mice and humans. Sixth, the observation period in this study (~one year) could be too short to capture long-term cell competition because of the much shorter lifespan of mice than of humans, which entails decades of continuous stem cell survival and self-renewal in the testis. Regarding these last two points, age-related changes in the stem cell niche could be necessary for <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>-mediated stem cell competition to become apparent. Finally, additional, yet unidentified genetic lesions could be required to confer enhanced competitiveness.</p>
<p>An absence of cell competition was also observed in vitro. In cultured SSCs with <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>, although a functionally active HRAS was detected, ERK activation following FGF2 stimulation was not enhanced. Chen et al. (2009) made a similar observation, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with heterozygous <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref022">22</xref>]. Only in later passaged <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> MEFs was more pERK detected than in controls. This suggests that active HRAS from one copy of <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> is not adequate to activate ERK in either cultured SSCs or MEFs, and more time may be required to gain additional gene mutational hits. Furthermore, a reduced FGF2 environment did not favor selection of the <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> cell population, indicating that HRAS may not be a major GTPase mediating FGF2 signaling in SSCs. On the other hand, when <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup> is overexpressed in cultured SSCs, increased proliferation and oncogenic transformation were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref023">23</xref>], again suggesting that the <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup> effect is dependent on gene dosage.</p>
<p>The transcriptional profile between wild-type and <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup> A<sub>undiff</sub> did not reveal a significant difference in gene expression. Interestingly, among a few differentially expressed genes, <italic>Pax7</italic> was up-regulated in iFR cells. <italic>Pax7</italic> is a transcription factor identified as a conserved marker for a particularly rare subset of A<sub>undiff</sub> in mammalian testes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1008139.ref041">41</xref>]. Although its function in self-renewal of A<sub>undiff</sub> is not well characterized, <italic>Pax7</italic> may be one of the downstream genes upregulated by MAPK signaling via HRAS in a subset of the A<sub>undiff</sub> population. Overall, the absence of large transcriptional changes in <italic>Hras</italic><sup>G12V</sup> A<sub>undiff</sub> could account for the fact that there was no obvious competitiveness or higher stem cell capacity in <italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>-positive A<sub>undiff</sub> in the transplant assays.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these results revealed a stable and tolerant system to prevent normal germline stem cells from being replaced by mutated cells. This unanticipated resistance to hyper-active <italic>Hras</italic> suggests inherent mechanisms within germline stem cells to suppress harmful mutations that would otherwise be propagated to offspring. In contrast, we anticipate that future studies will likely uncover factors that overcome such protective mechanisms, leading to aberrant clonal expansion. Given the increasing number of disorders (e.g., autism) linked to germline mosaicism and PAEs, the inducible adult mosaic model will be invaluable to understand the earliest origins of such pathogenic gene variants.</p>

<p>FACS-collected tdTomato+ cells were lysed in RLTplus buffer (Qiagen RNA mini kit) with 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and RNA was purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

<p>Schematic illustrating how sperm is aspirated from the cauda epididymis. A small skin incision is made over the caudal pole of the testis and the cauda epididymis is identified. The fascia is kept intact throughout the procedure. The cauda epididymis is retracted and gently squeezed by the curved serrated forceps. Using an insulin syringe (29-30G) loaded with a small amount of PBS, the epididymis is punctured through the fascia and the sperm are aspirated and transferred into a plate. This is repeated several times to obtain a sufficient amount of sperm. If the cauda epididymis is difficult to locate, the fascia is opened and the cauda epididymis can be punctured directly.
