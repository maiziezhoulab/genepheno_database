<p>Mutations in <italic>GPSM2</italic> cause Chudley-McCullough syndrome (CMCS), an autosomal recessive neurological disorder characterized by early-onset sensorineural deafness and brain anomalies. Here, we show that mutation of the mouse orthologue of <italic>GPSM2</italic> affects actin-rich stereocilia elongation in auditory and vestibular hair cells, causing deafness and balance defects. The G-protein subunit Gα<sub>i3</sub>, a well-documented partner of Gpsm2, participates in the elongation process, and its absence also causes hearing deficits. We show that Gpsm2 defines an ∼200 nm nanodomain at the tips of stereocilia and this localization requires the presence of Gα<sub>i3</sub>, myosin 15 and whirlin. Using single-molecule tracking, we report that loss of <italic>Gpsm2</italic> leads to decreased outgrowth and a disruption of actin dynamics in neuronal growth cones. Our results elucidate the aetiology of CMCS and highlight a new molecular role for Gpsm2/Gα<sub>i3</sub> in the regulation of actin dynamics in epithelial and neuronal tissues.</p>

<body>
<p>Chudley-McCullough syndrome (CMCS, OMIM 604213) is a rare autosomal recessive neurological disorder in humans, characterized by early and severe onset of sensorineuronal deafness and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (CC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. CMCS syndrome patients often display frontal polymicrogyria (excessive small folds in the cortex of the brain) and heterotopia. These may be associated with cerebellar dysplasia, arachnoid cysts and ventriculomegaly. Some degree of delayed mental development has been reported for some patients, as well as occasional seizures, with overall psychomotor development generally normal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The reason for this pleiotropy is not known and neither is the molecular basis of the pathology.</p>
<p>Recently, mutations in G-protein signalling modulator 2 (<italic>GPSM2</italic> in humans, also known as Leu-Gly-Asn repeat-enriched protein (<italic>LGN</italic>), mammalian Partner of inscuteable (<italic>mPins</italic>) <italic>or Gpsm2</italic> in mammals) were found to cause CMCS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Because of the well-known role for Gpsm2 in the control of spindle position during orientated division<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, it was suggested that CMCS might result from defects in asymmetric division of progenitors, both in the inner ear and the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Recently, we demonstrated that Gpsm2 and one of its binding partner, the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein G<sub>i3</sub> (Gα<sub>i3</sub> encoded by <italic>Gnai3</italic>), control the asymmetric localization of the kinocilium in developing postmitotic hair cells (HCs) of the mammalian cochlea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. These results were confirmed by another group that also reported an accumulation of both proteins at the tip of the hair bundles of the HCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p>
<p>A HC stereocilia bundle is an actin-rich organelle consisting of a specialized array of microvilli-derived structures that protrude from the apex of auditory and vestibular HCs. Mechanical deflection of the hair bundle gates mechano-sensitive ion channels in stereocilia that leads ultimately to afferent action potentials being conveyed to the central nervous system. Proper development and maintenance of stereocilia are vital for normal hearing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Mechanisms that control HC bundle length are not fully understood. During early postnatal development, actin monomers are added at the barbed (plus) end of the stereocilium, resulting in elongation from the tip<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Several proteins are known to control this process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, with one common property being their localization at the tips of stereocilia during elongation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The scaffold protein whirlin (encoded by <italic>Whrn</italic>) and myosin 15 (encoded by <italic>Myo15</italic>) are two of the best-characterized proteins among the HC bundle proteome participating in stereociliary growth. Myosin 15 interacts with whirlin and traffics it to the stereocilia tips where they colocalize with the actin-bundling and capping protein Eps8 (epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, also dependant on myosin 15 for its localization at the stereociliary tip. Defects in all three genes individually cause abnormally short stereocilia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, deafness in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and non-syndromic human deafness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we show that Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub> define an ∼200 nm domain at the tip of stereocilia, and that conditional deletion of either gene prevents stereocilia elongation, the likely cause of the early deafness and hearing deficits observed in mutant mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mutations identified in CMCS patients affect protein complexes, including a novel and functionally relevant interaction between Gpsm2 and whirlin. Using live super-resolution imaging, we show that actin dynamics are disrupted in growth cones of young hippocampal neurons from <italic>Gpsm2</italic> mutant mice, affecting neuronal outgrowth. These data support the idea of a global function for Gpsm2 in modulating actin dynamics. The versatility of Gpsm2/Gα<sub>i3</sub> roles on actin and tubulin, in proliferative and postmitotic cells, is the probable cause of pleiotropy in CMCS brain anomalies.</p>

<title>Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub> define a tip nanodomain within stereocilia</title>
<p>We evaluated the localization of Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub> during the development of stereocilia hair bundles using previously characterized specific antibodies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Gpsm2 was localized at the tip of the nascent hair bundle at embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5), the earliest phase of its formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, yellow arrows). Consistent with previous observations, the apical crescent-shaped accumulation of Gpsm2 was also present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, stars; refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). By postnatal day 7 (P7), when stereocilia are rapidly elongating, Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub> were enriched at the tips of the tallest row of inner hair cell (IHC) stereocilia, the actual sensory receptors receiving 95% of the fibres of the auditory nerve that project to the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>), but also in vestibular HCs of the ampulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). At P15, the enrichment is maintained in the tallest row, whereas we could not detect fluorescence in the middle and small rows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). At this stage, the apical crescent-shaped staining became fragmented or absent, suggesting a gradual loss of these proteins from this zone. Multicolour STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) nanoscopy was used to probe the stereocilia tip compartment and revealed that Gpsm2 was concentrated into a circular cap-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f–h</xref>), similar to what was described for myosin 15 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), above the actin core labelled with phalloidin. Multicolour STED revealed that both Gpsm2 and Eps8 domains mostly overlapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1i</xref>). To evaluate the size of the tip domain, we mechanically isolated stereocilia after immunocytochemistry, to obtain perfectly flat structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j,k</xref>). Using fluorescence intensity line-scans along individual long stereocilia labelled with Gpsm2 and Eps8 antibodies and using the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), we estimated that the tip domain extended ∼200 nm axially at the stereocilia tip (Gpsm2 FWHM=198±59 nm, <italic>n</italic>=10; Eps8 FWHM=200±63 nm, <italic>n</italic>=10). These results reveal a narrow stereocilia tip compartment of ∼200 nm where actin filament polymerization is regulated during hair bundle development.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Loss of Gpsm2 or Gα<sub>i3</sub> blocks stereocilia elongation</title>
<p>Owing to their localization at the site of actin polymerization, we hypothesized that Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub> might be molecular components required for the developmental elongation of stereocilia. To test this, we examined the cochlear sensory epithelium of conditional mutant mice generated with a Foxg1-Cre driver (hereafter, named <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKO and <italic>Gnai3</italic> cKO), during critical stages of stereocilia elongation. At P5, in early phases of elongation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses revealed an ∼40% decrease in IHC tallest stereocilia length in <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKOs (see Methods) and ∼25% decrease in <italic>Gnai3</italic> cKOs, compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a–d</xref>). There was also a statistically significant increase in the number of stereocilia per bundle in IHCs of <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKOs (by ∼25%) and <italic>Gnai3</italic> cKOs (by ∼15%), with abnormal supernumerary (more than three) rows of short stereocilia compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Omnidirectional lateral links could be seen in both <italic>Gpsm2</italic> and <italic>Gnai3</italic> cKOs (magenta arrows and insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>), similar to the phenotype reported for the myosin 15-deficient mutant mouse <italic>shaker 2</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) (<italic>sh2</italic>, <italic>Myo15</italic><sup><italic>sh2</italic></sup>). We conclude that Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub> are each required for the normal process of actin filament elongation that drives stereocilia development.</p>
<p>At P21, when elongation is completed, the average length of the tallest row of stereocilia was reduced by ∼70% and 50% compared with controls in <italic>Gpsm2</italic> and <italic>Gnai3</italic> cKOs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f–i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). The phenotype was more severe in <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKOs that have short, thick stereocilia. In <italic>Gnai3</italic> cKO, we sometimes observed normal size stereocilia among an overall shortened hair bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2h</xref>, magenta brackets), notably in the midbasal and more immature apical regions of the cochlea (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>, right panel, green arrows). In both cKOs, we observed supernumerary stereocilia per bundle, with ∼60% and 50% increase in <italic>Gpsm2</italic> and <italic>Gnai3</italic> cKOs, respectively, as compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2j</xref>). These phenotypes are similar to those reported for <italic>Myo15</italic>, <italic>Whrn</italic> and <italic>Eps8</italic> mutants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Our results show that IHC bundles in <italic>Gpsm2</italic> and <italic>Gnai3</italic> mutants share similar phenotypes, with stereocilia elongation significantly affected at the onset of hair bundle formation and an overall more severe phenotype in <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKOs.</p>
<p>Owing to the well-documented role of Gpsm2 (Pins) on spindle orientation during asymmetric cell divisions, hearing loss in CMCS patients was proposed to result from a defect in planar cell polarity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Once apical/basal polarity has been established in mice, formation of the stereocilia bundle initiates in postmitotic HCs in the basal part of the cochlea coil. The critical phase of stereocilia elongation required to form the mature hair bundle occurs mostly after birth (P0). To confirm a postmitotic role for Gpsm2 in hair bundle elongation, we generated <italic>Gpsm2</italic> conditional mutants using the <italic>Pou4f3</italic> promoter to drive Cre-mediated recombination in postmitotic HCs only<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Hair bundles in these mutants displayed supernumerary rows of shorter stereocilia at P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2k</xref>), similar to the phenotype we observed with an early embryonic deletion of the gene. To confirm a postmitotic function of Gα<sub>i</sub> in stereocilia elongation, we treated cochlear explants from newborn rats (P0/P1) for 8 days <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) with increasing concentrations of pertussis toxin (PTX), a pharmacological inhibitor of all three Gα<sub>i</sub> protein isoforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). After 8 DIV, we found that stereocilia elongate in control cultures, whereas in the presence of PTX, hair bundles of IHCs exhibited supernumerary rows of short stereocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2l</xref>), similar to those observed for the <italic>Gnai3</italic> cKOs. In these PTX-treated samples, the average length of the tallest row of stereocilia was reduced by ∼30% when compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2m</xref>).</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Loss of Gpsm2 or Gα<sub>i3</sub> causes hearing and balance deficits</title>
<p>We assessed the auditory function of <italic>Gpsm2</italic> and <italic>Gnai3</italic> cKOs by measuring the threshold of auditory brainstem responses (ABR) using click-tones and pure tone of frequencies from 1 to 45 kHz. <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKOs were profoundly deaf at 6 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), with ABR thresholds above 90 decibel sound pressure level at all frequencies, whereas <italic>Gnai3</italic> cKOs displayed specifically high frequency hearing loss starting at 11.3 kHz at the same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). These results are consistent with the differences in the severity of the phenotype we observed morphologically, and demonstrate that Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub> are essential for stereocilia maturation and hearing. Another <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKO resulting in a truncated protein lacking the carboxy terminus was recently reported to be deaf<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Also, <italic>Gpsm2,</italic> but not <italic>Gnai3</italic> cKOs, exhibited increased hyperactive behaviour (413%) from controls and circling behaviour (&gt;130 rotations in cKO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c–f</xref>). <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKOs swam in tight circles and are more mobile than their control littermates in a forced swim test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>). These results are indicative of a vestibular dysfunction and are consistent with the shortened stereocilia observed in the vestibular epithelium of the <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>).</p>

<p>Since <italic>Gpsm2</italic> and <italic>Gnai3</italic> mutants have short stereocilia similar to <italic>shaker 2</italic> (<italic>sh2</italic>; myosin 15 functional null) and <italic>whirler</italic> (<italic>wi</italic>) mutants, we hypothesized that these proteins form a larger macromolecular complex. The delivery of whirlin to stereocilia tips requires functional myosin 15, whereas trafficking of myosin 15 can occur independently of whirlin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. We found that Gpsm2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>) and Gα<sub>i3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>) were both absent from the stereocilia tips of <italic>sh2/sh2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,c</xref>) and <italic>wi/wi</italic> HCs at P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b,d</xref>). These data demonstrate that Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub> require myosin 15 to be trafficked to the tips of stereocilia. Myosin 15 was still present at the tip of short stereocilia of <italic>Gpsm2</italic> and <italic>Gnai3</italic> cKOs at P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>), whereas whirlin localization was absent in <italic>Gpsm2</italic> and <italic>Gnai3</italic> cKOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g,h</xref>). Importantly, in earlier stages (P4) we observed that the apical crescent of Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub> was maintained in s<italic>h2/sh2</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). This result demonstrates that both proteins depend upon different interactions and protein complexes for apical membrane or stereocilia tip traffic within the HC. We also confirmed that the localization of both proteins at the tips of stereocilia was interdependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>) as is the case in many other systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Altogether, our data demonstrate that Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub> are sorted to the apical membrane and to the stereocilia tip via different protein interactions.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that whirlin is necessary for the trafficking and/or the maintenance of Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub> at the tip of the stereocilia, and absence of whirlin in <italic>Gpsm2/Gnai3</italic> cKOs also suggest that the protein module participates in whirlin maintenance at the stereocilia tips. Altogether, our data show that the similar phenotypes of <italic>sh2, wi, Gpsm2, Gnai3</italic> mutant mice arise from a common molecular function in driving stereocilia elongation.</p>

<title>Gpsm2 and whirlin interact</title>
<p>To further explore the functional interactions between myosin 15, whirlin, Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub> proteins, we used a heterologous system. COS-7 cells co-transfected with complementary DNA (cDNA) constructs encoding both myosin 15 and whirlin result in numerous actin-rich filopodia protrusions and the two proteins accumulate at the tips of those extensions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Using this system, we show that Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub> were also transported to the tip of the filopodia in the presence of myosin 15 and whirlin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). The majority of filopodia tips (99%) contained Gpsm2 in the presence of whirlin and myosin 15, and this number drops to 6% when an empty vector coding for DsRed replaces DsRed-whirlin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed an interaction between full-length myc-tagged Gpsm2<sup>FL</sup> and either green fluorescent protein (GFP)–whirlin or untagged whirlin, whereas non-immune IgG or pEGFP–C3 coding for GFP did not co-immunoprecipitate either myc-Gpsm2 nor whirlin demonstrating the specificity of the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>). To assess the interaction in the context of CMCS, we evaluated a human <italic>GPSM2</italic> variant reported in patients that is predicted to truncate the GoLoco and linker domains, and is associated with multiple and severe anatomical brain abnormalities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The Gpsm2<sup>R318RfsX8</sup> variant still bound to whirlin, indicating that the N-terminal domain of Gpsm2 was sufficient for this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d,f</xref>). We used glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST)-pull down assays to show that the unstructured C-terminal region of whirlin, between aa 672 and aa 810 was the minimal domain required to interact with Gpsm2<sup>R318RfsX8</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d,g</xref>). All of the whirlin GST-constructs lacking this region failed to interact with myc-Gpsm2<sup>R318RfsX8</sup>, whereas the three GST-constructs containing this region pulled down the variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6g</xref>, lanes 4, 6, 8). To test if Gpsm2<sup>FL</sup> may act as an adapter stabilising whirlin at the tips of stereocilia, we transfected HEK293T cells with increasing amounts of myc-Gpsm2<sup>FL</sup>-encoding cDNA while maintaining the quantity of DsRed-whirlin cDNA constant. Under these conditions, we observed a net increase in DsRed-whirlin protein expression levels, whereas increasing doses of DsRed-whirlin had no significant reciprocal effect on myc-Gpsm2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6h,i</xref>). Controls with increasing amount of cDNA encoding myc-Gpsm2<sup>FL</sup> did not affect DsRed levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). One possible interpretation of these results is that when in a complex with Gpsm2, whirlin protein may be stabilized, possibly by being less susceptible to degradation.</p>
<p>As Gpsm2<sup>R318RfsX8</sup> still bound whirlin, we evaluated if it could modulate the ability of myosin 15 and whirlin to generate filopodia. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6d</xref> illustrates the position of GPSM2 truncating variants identified in CMCS patients and the resulting predicted truncated proteins. In the presence of myc-Gpsm2<sup>FL</sup>, 42% of COS-7 cells extended filopodia, whereas in the presence of Gpsm2<sup>R318RfsX8</sup>, this number was reduced by half to 21% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>, see Methods). These results suggest that the truncation of the linker and GoLoco domains in Gpsm2<sup>R318RfsX8</sup> impairs the filopodia-generating ability of the myosin 15/whirlin complex. To evaluate if some of these truncation mutations could affect the proteins levels, we quantified immunoblots of the different Gpsm2 variants. Results show that the myc-Gpsm2<sup>Q562X</sup> variant (missing the last two GoLoco domains) had an ∼15±4% reduction in protein levels compared with the myc-Gpsm2<sup>FL</sup>, whereas myc-Gpsm2<sup>p.G491GfsX6</sup> variant (missing all four GoLoco domains) led to an ∼70±4% decrease, and the Gpsm2<sup>R318RfsX8</sup> variant (missing all four GoLoco domains and the linker domain) led to ∼60±4% decrease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). The shortest truncation (Gpsm2<sup>R127X</sup>), with only two tetratricopeptide repeats domains remaining, was the most severe (too weak for quantification). The impact of three of these four truncations was evaluated upon filopodia length in the presence of myosin 15 and whirlin. We first noted that co-expressing Gpsm2<sup>FL</sup> with myosin 15 and whirlin statistically increased the average length of filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6j</xref>). This increase was lost with all of the Gpsm2 variants tested. The truncated proteins also affected the myosin 15/whirlin effect, suggesting a dominant-negative effect. Notably, the shortest truncations retaining a amino-terminus (Gpsm2<sup>p.G491GfsX6</sup>, Gpsm2<sup>R318RfsX8</sup>) had the most severe effect on myosin 15/whirlin elongation. Taken together these data show that truncation mutations lead to some reduction in Gpsm2 protein levels, but they also indicate that the shortest forms still harbouring a N-terminus are able to interact with whirlin, therefore affecting the ability of myosin 15 and whirlin to induce filopodia elongation. We conclude that Gpsm2 is a new binding partner of whirlin, and that CMCS mutations affect the ability of the myosin 15/whirlin complex to generate filopodia.</p>

<title><italic>Gpsm2</italic> mutation affects neuronal development and motility</title>
<p>In addition to early-onset sensorineural deafness, patients with CMCS also display specific brain malformations on magnetic resonance images; hypoplasia of the CC being a hallmark of this pathology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. To evaluate the impact of Gpsm2 on CC development, we generated <italic>Emx1</italic>-Cre*<italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKOs (Gpsm2<sup>Emx1</sup>), deleting <italic>Gpsm2</italic> in the early and dorsal telencephalon. Analysis of brains from these cKOs confirmed the existence of a caudal CC agenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>), as reported in CMCS patients. CC defects can result from a disruption in neuronal progenitors or defects in axonal elongation and guidance, which are dependent upon the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Neurite elongation is due to the motility of the growth cone driven in part by protrusive forces generated by actin polymerization at the leading edge<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and the existence of a retrograde flow of actin resulting from a balance of filament polymerization and depolymerization, among other factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. We therefore hypothesized that actin dynamics could be impaired in mutant <italic>Gpsm2</italic> neurons and affect outgrowth. Measures of growth cone locomotion on N-cadherin-coated substrates showed that outgrowth of <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKOs neurons was reduced by 37% compared with controls (control 0.97±0.04 μm min<sup>−1</sup> versus cKO 0.61±0.02 μm min<sup>−1</sup>), whereas the speed of growth cones from <italic>Gnai3</italic> cKOs was indistinguishable from controls (control 0.92±0.02 μm min<sup>−1</sup>; cKO 0.89±0.02 μm min<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). This <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKO phenotype was also observed on a laminin-coated substrate, suggesting that the outgrowth reduction was not specific to an N-cadherin substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). The number of pauses the growth cone made during the 30 min time-lapses on N-cadherin substrate was increased in <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d–f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>).</p>
<p>To evaluate whether Gpsm2 regulates actin cytoskeleton dynamics we monitored the behaviour of individual actin-mEOS2 molecules using Single Particle Tracking combined with Photo-Activation Localization Microscopy (sptPALM) under Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) illumination, in the peripheral region of the growth cones (see Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a,b</xref>). We recorded trajectories longer than seven frames (median of nine frames, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>), and fit the mean squared displacement (MSD) using a power function of time with exponent <italic>α</italic> (values between 0 and 2). This parameter reflects the curvature of the MSD function and the type of movement of actin-mEOS2 molecules, with <italic>α</italic> values close to 2 representing more directed trajectories, and <italic>α</italic> values close to 0 representing more static molecules (illustrated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d</xref>). Comparisons analysis of the distribution of exponent alpha for control and <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKO shows statistical differences in the most extreme <italic>α</italic> values (below 0.6 and above 1.4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8e</xref>). This demonstrates that actin-mEOS2 exhibit different dynamical behaviour in the peripheral region of growth cones of control and <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKOs. These results, together with the reduced neuronal outgrowth in <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKO, suggest that Gpsm2 affects motility of the growth cone through a modulation of actin dynamics.</p>
<p>The retrograde flow of actin is a complex phenomenon that is the result of many individual mechanisms, including actin filament nucleation and polymerization, capping and depolymerization, in addition to mechanical forces experienced from myosin contractility and coupling to adhesion molecules. Although we do not know the molecular complex that could drive Gpsm2 control of growth cone motility, we were able to co-immunoprecipitate (co-IP) endogenous whirlin with Gpsm2 from hippocampi lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8f</xref>). We also found that co-expression of myc-Gpsm2 with DsRed-whirlin and GFP–myosin 15 in young (DIV3) hippocampal neurons lead to a striking colocalization of the three proteins at the tips of filopodia, supporting a role for these proteins in young neurons motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8g</xref>). To test if Gpsm2 could modulate actin polymerization, we compared the ratio of F-actin with G-actin (F/G) in cells transfected with both <italic>Gpsm2</italic> and <italic>Gnai3</italic> constructs. When co-expressed, the proteins significantly increased the F/G-actin ratio by 138% (2.4±0.2) compared with the control, demonstrating its impact on actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8h</xref>). The Gpsm2<sup>R318RfsX8</sup> variant of the protein resulted in a statistically significant reduction of this activation (1.6±0.1). A similar assay performed on cultured cortical neurons (see Methods), resulted in a 32% decrease in F/G-actin ratio in <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKO neurons compared with controls (0.68±0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8i</xref>). These data support the hypothesis that Gpsm2 (with Gα<sub>i3</sub>) stimulates actin dynamics in neurons, and that some of the brain anomalies observed in patients, notably CC hypoplasia, could be related to a disruption of Gpsm2-dependant actin-based mechanisms.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we show that the Gpsm2/Gα<sub>i3</sub> module regulates actin polymerization during stereocilia elongation, and that a pathogenic mutation of either gene leads to abnormally short stereocilia, the likely cause of hearing loss in CMCS patients. We demonstrate that this function is due to a newly identified interaction between Gpsm2 and whirlin, a member of the stereocilia tip complex. Also, we show that a <italic>Gpsm2</italic> mutation affects CC formation and modulates neuronal outgrowth via the regulation of actin dynamics, supporting a global role for Gpsm2 in controlling the actin cytoskeleton.</p>
<p>Myosin 15 is the molecular motor responsible for delivering whirlin and Eps8 to the tips of actin-rich stereocilia and this ternary complex is required for elongation of nascent stereocilia. Our results show that myosin 15 and whirlin are also required for trafficking Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub>, two new members of the stereocilia tip complex, an electron-dense structure believed to contain proteins that regulate actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>). Accordingly, when myosin 15 is non-functional, Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub> (this study), as well as whirlin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and Eps8 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) are all absent from the stereocilia tips. On the other hand, when <italic>Whrn</italic>, <italic>Gpsm2</italic> or <italic>Gnai3</italic> are mutated, myosin 15 still accumulates at the tips of short abnormal stereocilia. The failure of <italic>Whrn</italic>, <italic>Gpsm2</italic> and <italic>Gnai3</italic> cKOs stereocilia to elongate despite the localization of myosin 15, suggests that these proteins assemble in a macromolecular complex (including Eps8) to regulate actin polymerization at the stereocilia tips. Interestingly, it was recently shown that the distribution of whirlin on the tallest row of stereocilia was dependent upon the isoform 2 of myosin 15 (short form)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. It is therefore probable that Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub> are part of a preferential complex with myosin 15 isoform 2 and whirlin.</p>
<p>Our data extend the complexity of the interactions occurring at stereocilia tips during differentiation of HCs and provide new perspectives for the molecular machinery controlling actin polymerization. This complexity is highlighted by the increasing number of proteins identified and accumulating at the tip complex in a domain of ∼200 nm or less during stereocilia elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>). In many cellular contexts, Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub> are at the interface between actin and the membrane, acting as a link between the two<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. In stereocilia, G<italic>α</italic><sub>i3-GDP</sub> could be tethered at the plasma membrane via its myristoyl and palmitylate moieties, and bound to the C-terminal GoLoco motifs of Gpsm2. This would leave the tetratricopeptide repeats and linker region of Gpsm2 free to bind to various proteins (such as whirlin) to anchor or stabilize them, that could in turn interact with actin or other actin-regulatory proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, including Eps8 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results significantly extend a recent report from Tarchini <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, showing the localization of Gpsm2 (LGN) and Gα<sub>i</sub> protein at the tips of P7 mouse HCs stereocilia, and reporting deafness and shortened stereocilia in a <italic>Gpsm2</italic> mutant similar to ours. Importantly, we show that although myosin 15 is not required for the localization of Gpsm2 to the apical membrane crescent reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, it is critical for the targeting of Gpsm2/Gα<sub>i3</sub> to the stereocilia tip. This demonstrates that Gpsm2 binds with different protein complexes to engage in distinct molecular mechanisms at these locations.</p>
<p>Based on our data, the early deafness observed in <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKO would be a consequence of a lack of postnatal elongation of stereocilia in IHC, the auditory sensory cells that are responsible for signal transduction, and which receive the vast majority of afferent innervation. Our results also uncovered Gα<sub>i3</sub> as a specific molecular partner for Gpsm2 during stereocilia elongation, notably within the basal cochlear region, and as a candidate gene for early-onset progressive hereditary hearing loss. Some of the differences in hearing loss (earlier and comprising the entire tonotopic axis in <italic>Gpsm2</italic> mutants) probably reflect compensatory mechanisms by other Gα<sub>i</sub> isoforms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.</p>
<p>Our data support the hypothesis that a decrease in actin polymerization, maybe through a disruption of the actin retrograde flow, underlies the reduced motility of <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKO neurons. In young postmitotic neurons there is an obvious molecular similarity between the mechanism controlling the elongation of the stereocilia, and those controlling the movements of the growth cone, including the existence of a filopodial tip complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>). In both cases, it is the dynamic insertion of globular actin (G-actin) at the extremity of the structure (stereocilium or filopodium and lamellipodium) that allows elongation. This could be due to a role of Gpsm2 modulating the stability of the tip complex components, as we suggest for stereocilia elongation; a hypothesis supported by the endogenous co-IP of the Gpsm2 and whirlin from young hippocampi. All of the proteins identified so far that participate in stereocilia elongation are also expressed in the brain of mammals, including Gpsm2, Gα<sub>i3</sub>, myosin 15, whirlin and Eps8 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>) (this manuscript). Myosin 15 is related to unconventional myosin 10 (MYO10), a powerful inducer of filopodia formation and elongation in neurons and other cells. Myosin 10 is present at the filopodia tip in bright puncta and remains there as the filopodia extend and retract<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. We find myosin 15 enriched in neuronal growth cones and most filopodia, and accumulating with whirlin and Gpsm2 at filopodia tips when co-transfected into hippocampal neurons. Myosin 15 could have overlapping functions with myosin 10 in neuronal protrusions, through a protein complex similar to the tip complex identified in the inner ear. But it is also possible that other neuron-specific binding partners for Gpsm2 participate in this process in neurons. Further studies are required to explore the exact molecular mechanism underlying this result.</p>
<p>Previous work with a <italic>Gpsm2</italic> mouse model resulting in a truncated protein lacking the C-terminus suggested that cortical malformations in CMCS are due to abnormally localized apical progenitors, with no impact on neuronal production or forebrain thickness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. The authors however did not report on the morphology of the CC. In our <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKO, we confirmed an overall normal cortical development and thickness, but we observed a severe hypoplasia of the CC, which appears to phenocopy a short and thin CC reported in the Palestinian patient carrying the p.R127X mutation in <italic>GPSM2</italic> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Our results demonstrating reduced neuronal outgrowth in <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKO neurons offer a mechanistic explanation for CC hypoplasia. The diverse anomalies observed in CMCS patients can be understood in the context of three cellular phenomena: (1) the production and stability of the predicted truncated proteins, (2) the loss of GoLoco domains that are required for interaction with Gα<sub>i</sub>, and (3) the loss or maintenance of domains that can impact on other binding partners of Gpsm2. This last point is illustrated here with results from the Gpsm2<sup>G491GfsX6</sup> and Gpsm2<sup>R318RfsX8</sup> variants whose expression leads to the production of truncated proteins with an almost complete N-terminus that is still able to bind to whirlin and affect the ability of myosin 15/whirlin to generate filopodia. Notably, compared with the shortest Gpsm2<sup>R127X</sup> variant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, the Gpsm2<sup>R318RfsX8</sup> variant is associated with some of the most severe brain anomalies described so far, perhaps because the level of this truncated protein is barely detectable.</p>
<p>Recently, we showed that Gpsm2/Gα<sub>i3</sub> regulates early planar cell polarity in inner ear epithelia by modulating tubulin dynamics in postmitotic cells in a mechanism reminiscent of those controlling oriented cell division<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Here, we show that the same complex controls actin dynamics not only in postmitotic HCs but also in neurons, through different binding partners. Because Gpsm2 has many interacting partners and is involved in microtubule and actin dynamics, in both dividing and postmitotic cells, each mutation identified in CMCS patients might affect a variety of mechanisms. The expression of Gpsm2 in both neurons and glia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> adds another level of complexity to this, as the role of the protein in the latter has not been assessed. On the other hand, in the inner ear the deficits are very similar regardless of the mutation, with early-onset deafness identified in all patients, highlighting the absolute necessity of an intact Gpsm2 protein for hearing.</p>
<p>Altogether our study strongly suggests that the aetiology of CMCS, notably its complexity and multi-syndromic aspect, is due to the multifunctional role of the Gpsm2/Gα<sub>i3</sub> module on actin and tubulin dynamics, in proliferative and postmitotic cells. This new molecular role for Gpsm2/Gα<sub>i3</sub> in the regulation of actin dynamics in epithelial and neuronal tissues show that this protein complex plays sequential and/or partially overlapping roles in mechanisms controlling the polarized growth of tissues. Taken together, our work emphasizes the importance of identifying all interacting partners of Gpsm2 and Gα<sub>i3</sub> and the mechanisms associated with each interaction, in different (patho)physiological contexts.</p>

Recombination occurs efficiently in both HCs and supporting cells in the cochlea (and vestibular system), and in most neurons of the telencephalon (glutamatergic and gabaergic), notably in the cortex and hippocampus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Pou4f3 is expressed only in postmitotic HCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, and Emx1 is expressed in the entire telencephalon as early at E10.5 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). The Cre reporter mouse strain B6.Cg-Gt(Rosa)26Sortm6(CAG-ZsGreen1)Hze/J (Ai6), which induces the expression of ZsGreen from the Rosa26 locus, was used for evaluation of <italic>Pou4f3</italic>-Cre-induced recombination localization.

<title>Cochleae immunostaining</title>
<p>Inner ears from mice or rats were harvested at specific time points between P5 and P21. Up to P5 mice and rats were killed by decapitation, and in later stages, the animals were anaesthetized by CO<sub>2</sub> before decapitation. The inner ears were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1.5– 24 h at 4 °C for immunostaining. Fixed and dissected cochlear duct were processed for immunocytochemistry as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Some cochleae were mechanically scratched using forceps tips within the mounting medium to isolate stereocilia. The primary antibodies were as follow: anti-Gα<sub>i3</sub> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref> or Sigma G4040, 1:600), custom-made anti-Gpsm2 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, pAb 1:500), anti-myosin 15 (PB48, ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, pAb, 1:400), anti-whirlin (HL5136, ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, pAb, 1:200), or anti-Eps8 (BD Transduction Laboratories, mAb, #610143, 1:200). Samples were incubated with primary antibodies for 1.5/2 h at room temperature (RT) to overnight (ON) at 4 °C with the primary antibodies, washed and secondary antibodies applied (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit conjugated with Alexa-488, -594 or ATTO647N (Life Technologies) for 1 h at RT. Phalloidin conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (P5282 Sigma, 1:500) or TRITC (P1951 Sigma, 1:500) were added for 1 h at RT to label F-actin and thereby stereociliary hair bundles of HCs. When comparing staining between controls and knockout, the two cochleae were processed in the same tube at P5. For later stages, they were processed in different tubes as only a small piece can be dissected at this stage, which renders final identification difficult. The samples were placed in mounting medium (Prolong Gold antifade reagent, Life Technologies) and flattened with a glass coverslip under a microscope.</p>
<p>For image acquisition, we used a confocal/STED microscope (TCS SP8; Leica) with a module STED × 3. Imaging was done using a Z step from 0.25 to 0.35 μm. STED microscopy were performed with an objective 100 × 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion STED objective. We used Atto 488 Phalloidin (Sigma, #49409, 1:600) with a depletion laser of 592 nm, goat anti-mouse Atto 647 N (Sigma, #50185-1, 1:300) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 with a depletion laser of 775 nm. Confocal images were processed in Volocity software (Perkin Elmer) and Adobe Photoshop or ImageJ.</p>

<title>SEM and measurements</title>
<p>The inner ear (cochlear and vestibular system) of mice aged P5 and P21 were harvested and immersed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.35, with 3 mM CaCl2 for 24 h or more. The tissues were postfixed in 1% OsO4 in the same buffer, dissected and double processed with thiocarbohydrazide followed by OsO4 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>) before dehydration through an alcohol series and critical point drying with CO2. After mounting on specimen support stubs, samples were sputter coated with platinum. Samples were examined with a JEOL 6700 F cold field emission scanning electron microscope operating at 3 or 5 kV. Measurements were made on the longest row of stereocilia closest to the kinocilium on 84 control stereocilia/16 HCs/2 mice and 75/24/2 (for P5 and P21), on <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKO 36/8/2 and 108/21/2 (For P5 and P21), and on <italic>Gnai3</italic> cKO 95/18/2 and 60/14/2 (For P5 and P21) in at least four different cochleae. The quantification of the number of stereocilia were made on 23 control HCs/2 mice and 12/2 (for P5 and P21), on <italic>Gpsm2</italic> cKO 16/2 and 23/2 (for P5 and P21) and on <italic>Gnai3</italic> cKO 19/2 and 32/2 (for P5 and P21) in at least four different cochleae.</p>
<p>Images were collected from the basal or middle turn of the cochlea, defined as ∼20/30% and 50/60% of the total length of the organ of Corti from the base. At each location, the hair bundles were viewed both from behind the longest row of stereocilia to view the height of the hair bundle as well as approximately perpendicular to the apical surface of the HC or toward the inner aspect of the bundle to examine its overall morphology and composition. To estimate bundle height, measurements were made from images at calibrated instrument magnifications of × 20,000 or occasionally × 10,000. Although we might have underestimated the actual stereocilia length, all efforts were taken to minimize the effect of parallax. Measurements were taken from bundles viewed from the lateral side toward the medial side (from the stria toward the modiolus), so that the row of longest stereocilia were imaged from the ‘rear.’ Samples were tilted and rotated so that the row of longest stereocilia was approximately perpendicular to the direction of view. Stereo-imaging was used in a few cases to gain an indication of possible errors in length measurements from 2D images. From the anaglyphs generated by a pair of images separated by 8 degrees of tilt, height measurements were obtained using analySIS software. These revealed little difference in the height measurement from that obtained from the 2D image of a stereocilium at close to perpendicular to its long axis. Measurements were made using ImageJ software.</p>

<title>ABR and vestibular tests</title>
<p>ABR is measured by averaging the evoked electrical response recorded via subcutaneous electrodes. ABR to click and pure tone stimuli were recorded in anaesthetized mice aged 6 weeks. All physiological recordings were performed under anaesthesia (75 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> ketamin hydrochloride, Ketavet, Pharmacia, Pfitzer, Karlsruhe Germany, 5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> xylazin hydrochloride (Rompun 2%, Bayer Leverkusen, Germany), 0.2 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> atropine (Atropinsulfat B Braun, Melsungen, Germany) in a soundproof chamber (IAC, Niederkrüchten, Germany). In short, ABR thresholds were determined with click (100 μs), and pure tone stimuli (2–45.3 kHz, 3 ms duration).</p>
<p>For vestibular test, <italic>Gpsm2 and Gnai3</italic> cKO mice and their control littermates (6 weeks old) were housed in a controlled environment (20–23 °C) with free access to food and water and maintained on a 12 h/12 h day/night cycle, light on at 7 am. Mice littermates were housed in collective cage and behavioural experiments were performed between 1 and 5 pm. Open-field and Forced swim test activities were analysed with Ethovision (Version 11.5, Noldus Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands). In the open-field test, mice were placed in the arena (30 × 40 cm) and activity was recorded for a period of 10 min. The total distance travelled and the number of rotations were measured (every 360° turn is counted as one rotation). In the forced swim test, mice were placed in a cylinder (height, 30 cm; diameter, 21 cm) filled with water (25 °C). The activity, the total immobility and the number of rotation was recorded for a 2 min period. Immobility is defined by movements inferior to 2 cm s<sup>−1</sup>.</p>

Images were acquired using Zeiss Axovision 4.7 and processed through Photoshop. For long-term assays (48 h), we considered a COS-7 (ATCC-American Type Culture Collection) ‘filopodial cell’ a cell with at least five long filopodia.

The multi-positions were done with a motorized stage Scan IM (Märzhäuser, Wetzlar, Germany). Temperature was maintained at 37 °C. The system was controlled by MetaMorph software. Quantification of neuron growth cone speed was performed using ImageJ software plugin ‘manual tracking’. The average speed (in μm min<sup>−1</sup>) was quantified as this distance divided by 30 min.

In brief, coverslips were mounted in a chamber and placed on a Nikon Ti Eclipse inverted microscope (Nikon France S.A.S., Champigny-sur-Marne, France) equipped with a TIRF arm coupled to a fibre optic linked to a four-colour laser bench (Roper Scientific). Images were acquired using an Apo TIRF 100 × oil numerical aperture 1.49 objective, and a sensitive EMCCD camera (Evolve, Photometrics, Tucson, USA). Photoswitching of mEos2 was done at 405 nm, converting the molecule into a red-emitting form, which was detected using the 561 nm laser and a long-pass emission filter. All the equipment was driven by the software Metamorph. Image stacks of 320 frames were acquired in time-lapse mode at a frequency of two images per second, with a camera exposure time of 250 ms.

<title><italic>Gpsm2</italic> mutations affect stereocilia elongation and neuronal outgrowth by regulating actin dynamics at tip complexes.</title>
<p>Mechanistic model for Gpsm2-dependent stereocilia elongation and neuronal outgrowth. Gpsm2 accumulates at the tip complex of both structures via the myosin 15 motor protein in stereocilia and a comparable motor protein in filopodia. Gpsm2-dependent macromolecular protein complexes modulate actin dynamics at the tip of stereocilia (growing end) or the leading edge of the growth cone, participating respectively in the elongation and motility of the two structures. See text for details.</p>
