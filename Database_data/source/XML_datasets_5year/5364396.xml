<abstract>
<p>Mutations in chromatin modifier genes are frequently associated with neurodevelopmental diseases. We herein demonstrate that the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (Chd7), frequently associated with CHARGE syndrome, is indispensable for normal cerebellar development. Genetic inactivation of <italic>Chd7</italic> in cerebellar granule neuron progenitors leads to cerebellar hypoplasia in mice, due to the impairment of granule neuron differentiation, induction of apoptosis and abnormal localization of Purkinje cells, which closely recapitulates known clinical features in the cerebella of CHARGE patients. Combinatory molecular analyses reveal that Chd7 is required for the maintenance of open chromatin and thus activation of genes essential for granule neuron differentiation. We further demonstrate that both Chd7 and Top2b are necessary for the transcription of a set of long neuronal genes in cerebellar granule neurons. Altogether, our comprehensive analyses reveal a mechanism with chromatin remodellers governing brain development via controlling a core transcriptional programme for cell-specific differentiation.</p>

<body>
<p>The chromatin structure plays a central role in any DNA-dependent biological process such as transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair. Recurrent mutations of chromatin modifier genes have been identified by extensive high-throughput sequencing of a broad spectrum of human patient samples. These findings reveal perturbation of the epigenome as a new hallmark of cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> and neurological diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. This strong correlative evidence requires further functional validation to fully understand the role of chromatin modifiers in development and disease, however.</p>
<p>Chromatin remodellers are key players in the regulation of nucleosome positioning and thus control DNA accessibility in eukaryotic cells. Mutations in the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller <italic>chromodomain, helicase, DNA binding</italic> (<italic>CHD</italic>) <italic>7</italic> are the major cause of CHARGE syndrome, which is characterized by multiple organ defects including Coloboma, Heart defect, Atresia choanae, Retarded growth and development, Genital abnormality and Ear abnormality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Notably, many CHARGE syndrome patients have brain anomalies including hypoplasia of the olfactory bulb and cerebellum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> and often display an autistic phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Moreover, <italic>CHD7</italic> mutations have been identified in patients with Kallmann syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, autism spectrum disorders (ASD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> as well as subsets of patients with both congenital heart disease and neurodevelopmental disabilities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. These findings strongly suggest an important role of CHD7 in brain development. Heterozygous <italic>Chd7</italic> gene trap mice have exhibited many CHARGE-relevant phenotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, supporting the role of transgenic mice as a disease-relevant tool. Our studies and others have utilized <italic>Chd7</italic> conditional knockout mice to specifically dissect the role of Chd7 in the brain, demonstrating that mutations of <italic>Chd7</italic> could be a causal factor for olfactory defects as well as hearing loss and cognitive disabilities in CHARGE patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. However, the exact role of Chd7 in cerebellar development remains unclear.</p>
<p>In both human and mice, the cerebellum undergoes a rapid expansion and foliation during early postnatal age. This expansion of the cerebellum is primarily due to the fast proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) in the outer external granule layer (oEGL), which is stimulated by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) secreted from Purkinje cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. On the other hand, GNPs secret a glycoprotein Reelin (Reln) to control the proper localization of Purkinje cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In a precisely and temporally controlled fashion, GNPs shift to the inner EGL (iEGL) coincident with exiting the cell cycle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The postmitotic cerebellar granule neurons (thereafter called as CGNs) then migrate inwardly to reach the internal granule layer (IGL), where they become mature. Importantly, unbalance between GNP proliferation and differentiation can lead to cerebellar hypoplasia or tumour formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Emerging data demonstrate that chromatin landscape is dynamically changed during differentiation of cerebellar granule cells, implicating an important role of chromatin regulation in neuronal differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Indeed, cerebellar anomalies including vermis hypoplasia and massive Purkinje cell heterotopia represent some of the most prominent features of CHARGE patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, strongly suggesting that CHD7 is essential for normal cerebellar development.</p>
<p>Here, we report <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for an essential role of Chd7 during cerebellar development. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we unravel molecular mechanisms of how Chd7 controls neuron differentiation to govern proper formation of the cerebellar architecture. These results provide not only new molecular insights into cellular differentiation, but also a better understanding of Chd7-associated human diseases.</p>

<title>Chd7 is highly expressed in cerebellar granule cells</title>
<p>Many CHARGE patients carrying <italic>CHD7</italic> mutations have defects in the cerebellum, implicating a functional role of CHD7 in cerebellar development. In support, expression of <italic>CHD7</italic> is enriched in the cerebellum during human brain development when compared to the other brain regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). To investigate the contribution of Chd7 to cerebellar development, we examined detailed spatial and temporal expression patterns of <italic>Chd7</italic> in developing mouse cerebellum. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with a Chd7 antibody at embryonic day (E) 14.5 revealed a higher expression of Chd7 in the external granule layer (EGL) as compared to cells in the ventricular zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Chd7 is highly expressed in cells from EGL and IGL at neonates and persists in the IGL at P21 cerebella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). A very similar expression pattern of GFP was observed in a bacterial artificial chromosome-based <italic>Chd7-GFP</italic> reporter mouse line carrying <italic>GFP</italic> fused to the <italic>Chd7</italic> regulatory element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>, lower panels). Consistent with the expression of Chd7 protein, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization data revealed that <italic>Chd7</italic> mRNA was clearly detected in EGL at E14.5, and in the granule layer at P7 and adult cerebellum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). We next performed co-immunostaining assays to check the co-expression of Chd7 or GFP with cell type-specific markers in the cerebella of wild-type (WT) or <italic>Chd7-GFP</italic> reporter mice, respectively. Exampled as P7 cerebellum, over 90% of Pax6<sup>+</sup> or Pax2<sup>+</sup> cells, namely cerebellar granule cells or inhibitory interneuron progenitors, respectively, expressed GFP in <italic>Chd7-GFP</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, Bergmann glia (Sox2<sup>+</sup>) and Purkinje cells (Calbindin<sup>+</sup>) only showed a very weak expression of Chd7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>
<p>Intriguingly, higher levels of Chd7 were detected in iEGL, where cells have just exited cell cycle (p27<sup>+</sup>) as compared to proliferating GNPs (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) in oEGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). In support, quantitative RT–PCR (qRT-PCR) data of cultured granule cells validated a higher expression of <italic>Chd7</italic> in postmitotic (<italic>Ccnd1</italic>-low) cells than proliferating (<italic>Ccnd1</italic>-high) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). These data suggest that the expression of Chd7 is upregulated during the transition from proliferating into differentiated cerebellar granule cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Disruption of <italic>Chd7</italic> in GNP leads to cerebellar hypoplasia</title>
<p>To examine roles of Chd7 during cerebellar development, we next genetically ablated <italic>Chd7 in vivo</italic> using <italic>Chd7</italic> conditional knockout mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. We first utilized a <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> driver to target neural stem cells in the brain. The homozygous mutant [<italic>Nestin-Cre::Chd7</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup>] mice exhibited largely perinatal lethality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). We observed conspicuous cerebellar hypoplasia in survived homozygous mutant mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). To dissect the role of Chd7 in cerebellar development and overcome the lethality of <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic>-mediated <italic>Chd7</italic> deletion, we decided to use cerebellar neuron-specific Cre drivers. The cerebellar neuroepithelium (Nestin<sup>+</sup>) is mainly divided into two compartments during embryogenesis: the upper rhombic lip (Atoh1<sup>+</sup>) and the cerebellar ventricular zone (Ptf1a<sup>+</sup>) that give rise to excitatory (for example, granule cells) and inhibitory neurons (for example, Purkinje cells), respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Given that Chd7 is predominantly expressed in granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), we first ablated <italic>Chd7</italic> in Atoh1<sup>+</sup> cells. IHC assays with a Chd7 antibody performed in P7 cerebella (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured granule cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>) verified ablation of Chd7 in granule cells of [<italic>Atoh1-Cre::Chd7</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup>] homozygous mutant mice. While no structural anomalies of the cerebella were observed at E15.5, P0 and older [<italic>Atoh1-Cre::Chd7</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup>] homozygous mutant mice, but not [<italic>Atoh1-Cre::Chd7</italic><sup><italic>f/+</italic></sup>] heterozygous mutant cerebella showed severe defects in folia formation and cerebellar hypoplasia especially in the vermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). The cerebellar defects in <italic>Chd7</italic> mutant animals are more prominent in the anterior lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). This is consistent with the previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and a remaining Chd7 protein in the posterior lobe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>), which is probably due to the less recombination efficiency of the <italic>Atoh1-Cre</italic> mouse line.</p>
<p>The crosstalk between GNPs and Purkinje cells is essential for cerebellar development, as revealed by severe cerebellum hypoplasia in <italic>Reln</italic>-deficient <italic>reeler</italic> mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Since massive Purkinje cell heterotopia has been reported in CHARGE patient brains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, we next examined Purkinje cells in [<italic>Atoh1-Cre::Chd7</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup>] mutant mice. Although the <italic>Atoh1-Cre</italic> driver does not target Purkinje cells, abnormal distribution of Purkinje cells were clearly detected in cerebella from P0 onwards until adult, especially at the anterior lobe of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>, arrowheads). Importantly, we did not observe any abnormal phenotype of Purkinje cells, when directly targeting <italic>Chd7</italic> in Purkinje cells using a <italic>Ptf1a-Cre</italic> driver<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Therefore, our findings suggest that the Purkinje cell phenotype in <italic>Chd7</italic> mutant mice and very likely in CHARGE patients is not due to a Purkinje cell-autonomous effect, but rather results from <italic>Chd7</italic> loss in granule cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Chd7 regulates neuronal differentiation and cell survival</title>
<p>To dissect cellular mechanisms responsible for the cerebellar hypoplasia phenotype of <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient mice, we analysed cell proliferation, differentiation, cell death and migration of granule cells during cerebellar development. Two-hour <italic>in vivo</italic> pulse-labelling of BrdU or IdU revealed similar percentages of proliferating GNPs between <italic>Chd7</italic> WT [<italic>Chd7</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup>] and <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient [<italic>Atoh1-Cre::Chd7</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup>] cerebella at both P0 and P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). As further validation, we freshly isolated GNPs at P7 using a percoll gradient centrifugation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> after pulse-labelling of BrdU 2 h before the killing. The FAC-based cell cycle analysis revealed no significant change of the ratio of proliferating cells between WT and <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>). Together, these data revealed that the proliferation capacity of <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient GNPs seems comparable to WT cells. However, 24-h BrdU labelling at P6 followed by co-staining of BrdU and Ki67 at P7 showed less Ki67-negative cells among BrdU-positive cells in the EGL of <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient mice, indicating that <italic>Chd7</italic> loss prevents appropriate cell cycle exit of GNPs <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Failure of cell cycle exit of <italic>Chd7</italic> mutant GNPs implicates less differentiated granule cells. Indeed, IHC analysis with a neuronal marker NeuN revealed significantly less granule neurons in the IGL of <italic>Chd7</italic> mutant than WT cerebella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The decrease of granule neurons in <italic>Chd7</italic> mutant cerebella was confirmed by the counting of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in IGLs of P7 pups that were pulsed and traced with BrdU for 48 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref>). Moreover, IHC for cleaved caspase3 detected more apoptotic cells in the <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient EGL at postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). In line with this observation, <italic>Chd7</italic> loss significantly increased cell death as detected by staining of cleaved caspase3 and Parp in cultured granule cells especially in absence of SHH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>), indicating that mutant cells are more prone to cell death upon differentiation. Meanwhile, we did not observe defects in the migration of granule cells in <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient cerebella, as shown by BrdU labelling and tracing (for 48 h) assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that cerebellar hypoplasia in [<italic>Atoh1-Cre::Chd7</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup>] mutant mice results from both granule cell-autonomous effect (that is, a failure of GNP differentiation and increased cell death) and non-autonomous effects from the abnormal distribution of Purkinje cells.</p>

<title><italic>Chd7</italic> loss alters expression of neuronal genes</title>
<p>To explore molecular consequences of <italic>Chd7</italic> loss in GNPs, we next performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based transcriptome analysis using freshly isolated GNPs from P7 <italic>Chd7</italic> WT, heterozygous [<italic>Atoh1-Cre::Chd7</italic><sup><italic>f/+</italic></sup>] (<italic>Chd7</italic> Het.) and homozygous [<italic>Atoh1-Cre::Chd7</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup>] (<italic>Chd7</italic> Hom.) mutant cerebella. Results from qRT–PCR showed a significant decrease of <italic>Chd7</italic> transcripts according to their genotypes in <italic>Chd7</italic> Het. and <italic>Chd7</italic> Hom. mutant GNPs as compared to WT GNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). At the significance of <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, 151 genes were downregulated in <italic>Chd7</italic> Hom. GNPs, with many of them (62.9%, 95/151, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 between WT and <italic>Chd7</italic> Het.) significantly downregulated in <italic>Chd7</italic> Het. GNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>), suggesting a dosage-dependent regulation of these genes by Chd7. Importantly, DAVID Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis of genes downregulated upon loss of <italic>Chd7</italic> demonstrated neuronal functions including synaptic transmission, ion transport, neuron development and neuron differentiation as the most enriched biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>), while no significantly enriched term (Benjamini adjusted <italic>P</italic> value&lt;0.05) was identified in genes significantly upregulated upon <italic>Chd7</italic> loss. For instance, the proper level of Chd7 is necessary for the expression of neural genes that are important for cerebellar development, including <italic>Cadps2</italic>, <italic>Gap43</italic>, <italic>Neurod1</italic>, <italic>Reln</italic> and <italic>Unc5c</italic> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Consistent with downregulation of Reln, IHC analyses demonstrated that Dab1, the adaptor protein of Reln signalling pathway, was upregulated specifically in mislocalized Purkinje cells in <italic>Chd7</italic> mutant cerebella (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>) in accordance with observation in the <italic>reeler</italic> mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. To exclude the long-term or indirect effect of Chd7 loss on gene expression, we acutely ablated the expression of Chd7 by treating [<italic>Chd7</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup>] or WT granule cells with cell-permeable Cre for 48 h. Results from qRT–PCR showed a consistent downregulation of Chd7 regulated genes identified above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify direct target genes of Chd7, we performed chromatin-immunoprecipitation coupled to sequencing (ChIP-seq) using freshly isolated P7 GNPs. In order to identify <italic>bona fide</italic> Chd7-binding sites, we in parallel performed Chd7 ChIP-seq on <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient GNPs. Using the MACS (<italic>M</italic>odel-based <italic>A</italic>nalysis of <italic>C</italic>hIP-<italic>s</italic>eq) peak calling method, 1,946 peaks were called from WT cells, in contrast to only 96 peaks called from <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient cells. In consistency with reports showing that Chd7 preferentially binds to enhancers in ESCs and oligodendrocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, Chd7-occupied regions in GNPs are enriched of H3K27ac, a histone mark for active promoters and enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Furthermore, Chd7 was enriched in super-enhancers (SEs) defined by H3K27ac ChIP-seq on GNPs (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f,g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). GO analysis revealed a strong enrichment of <italic>Chd7</italic>-associated genes in biological processes like transcription, chromatin organization, neuron differentiation and neuron projection morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Among genes whose expression was significantly altered upon loss of <italic>Chd7</italic> (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05), 12.5% (93/746) downregulated and 9.9% (99/1002) upregulated genes showed association of Chd7. For instance, Chd7 binds Chd7-activated genes, including <italic>Neurod1</italic>, <italic>Cadps2</italic>, <italic>Gap43</italic> and <italic>Reln</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>
<p>As Chd7 functions as an ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeller<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, we hypothesized that Chd7 regulates transcription via controlling DNA accessibility of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements. For this, we utilized an assay for Tn5 transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) and generated a genome-wide map of the open chromatin landscape in <italic>Chd7</italic> WT and mutant GNPs at P7. As expected, most of H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks (81.9%) colocalized with ATAC-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). A small subset of ATAC-seq peaks showed significant alteration upon loss of <italic>Chd7</italic> (2.1%), with <italic>Chd7</italic> Het. cells exhibiting intermediate change between WT and <italic>Chd7</italic> Hom. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). GO analysis of genes containing altered ATAC-seq peaks called transmission of nerve impulse, cell motion and cell adhesion as the most enriched biological processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>). Among genes whose expression was significantly changed upon loss of <italic>Chd7</italic> (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05), 14.2% (106/746) downregulated and 4.5% (45/1002) upregulated genes showed altered ATAC-seq peak. For instance, decreased ATAC-peaks upon <italic>Chd7</italic> loss were detected in Chd7-activated genes including <italic>Cadps2</italic>, <italic>Nkain3</italic>, <italic>Reln</italic>, <italic>Bmp5</italic> and <italic>Fstl5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6d</xref>). Moreover, 22.8% (320/1402) of genes bound by Chd7 in GNPs showed altered ATAC-seq peaks upon <italic>Chd7</italic> loss, revealing that the association of Chd7 is required for the maintenance open chromatin on these genes. Collectively, comprehensive analysis of ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data (for example, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) demonstrate that <italic>Chd7</italic> is involved in the maintenance of open chromatin at the regulatory elements of genes related with neuronal differentiation.</p>

<title>Chd7 regulates granule cell differentiation with Top2b</title>
<p>To get insight into molecular mechanisms underlying Chd7-dependent transcriptional regulation, we aimed at identifying CHD7-interacting proteins using immunoprecipitation (IP) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). For efficient IP with a sufficient amount of exogenous CHD7 protein, a Flag-tagged, truncated CHD7 (1–1,899 amino acids) that preserves nucleosome remodelling activity <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> was overexpressed and immunoprecipitated in <italic>CHD7</italic>-deficient HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a,b</xref>). Besides previously published CHD7-interacting partners, such as BRG1, PARP1 and CHD8 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), DNA topoisomerases TOP2A, TOP2B and TOP1 were identified by MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Protein–protein interactions between CHD7 with these proteins were validated by co-IP assays using nucleic acids-free nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>) from HEK293T cells expressing full-length Flag-tagged CHD7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). DNA topoisomerases are key enzymes that solve the topological problems occurring during virtually all DNA-related processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Inhibition of enzymatic activities of DNA topoisomerases in postmitotic neurons selectively represses the expression of long genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Top2b was shown to be important for neuronal migration in the developing neocortex by controlling the expression of Reln (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Therefore, we decided to further explore the functional relevance of interaction between Chd7 and Top2b. Co-IP assays showed the interaction between endogenous Top2b and Chd7 proteins in not only HEK293T cells but also adult cerebellar cells, 85–90% of which consist of CGNs (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). We also demonstrate that the N-terminal part (1–786 aa) of CHD7 is responsible for its interaction with TOP2B, whereas KU70 does not interact with the N-terminus of CHD7 and PARP interacts with several regions of CHD7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous immunostaining analysis demonstrated that GNPs in the oEGL express Top2a, whereas differentiating cells in iEGL and differentiated CGNs in IGL only express Top2b (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Consistently, the transcript level of <italic>Top2a</italic> in cultured granule cells drastically decreased upon differentiation of proliferating GNPs (cultured with Smoothened agonist SAG) into postmitotic (cultured without SAG) CGNs, as analysed using Affymetrix microarray (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). As Top2b is the sole DNA topoisomerase II expressed in CGNs, we decided to use <italic>in vitro</italic> induced postmitotic CGN to dissect the functional interaction between Chd7 and Top2b. We performed immunostaining of granule cells at 1 and 48 h after plating in order to compare the percentage of proliferating and differentiated cells between WT and <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient cells. At 1 h after plating, over 80% of cells were proliferating (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) and expressed Pax6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>). In contrast, after 48 h, most of cells exited cell cycle (Ki67<sup>−</sup>) and expressed p27, suggesting that these cells were newly differentiated in culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8c</xref>). Importantly, no statistical difference of percentages of proliferating and differentiated cells between WT and <italic>Chd7</italic> mutant cells at these two time points were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8b,c</xref>). To identify genes regulated by Top2b in CGNs, we performed microarray-based gene expression analysis using cultured CGNs treated with DMSO as a control or ICRF-193 (10 μM for 12 h), an enzymatic inhibitor of Topoisomerase II (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Consistent with previous reports in cortical neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, long genes (gene length&gt;100 kb) were selectively downregulated in CGNs upon treatment of ICRF-193 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>, left panel). The average size of genes downregulated by ICRF-193 treatment (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, fold change&gt;1.5) is approximately 300 kb, while the average sizes of all genes expressed in CGNs and the genes upregulated upon ICRF-193 treatment are both around 50 kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>). To directly compare with Top2b-dependent transcription, we next identified Chd7-regulated genes by microarray analysis using <italic>Chd7</italic> WT and homozygous mutant CGNs. Interestingly, many long genes were significantly downregulated upon loss of <italic>Chd7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>, right panel). We subsequently performed GSEA (<italic>G</italic>ene <italic>s</italic>et <italic>e</italic>nrichment <italic>a</italic>nalysis) to check the concordant regulation of gene expression by Top2b and Chd7. Genes that were significantly downregulated upon ICRF-193 treatment showed lower expression level in <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient CGNs than WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>, left panel). Also, genes that were significantly downregulated in <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient CGNs were largely repressed upon ICRF-193 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>, right panel). At the significance of <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, 240 genes were commonly activated by Chd7 and Top2b in CGNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>). Intriguingly, the average gene length of Top2b and Chd7 co-activated genes was even longer than those genes activated by Top2b but not Chd7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>), implicating that transcription of these very long genes requires both enzymes. Next, we compared expression levels of these 240 genes between GNPs cultured with and without SAG. Most of these 240 genes (84.6%, 203/240) were significantly upregulated upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Using qRT–PCR, we validated the downregulation of ASD-related genes involved in cerebellar development (<italic>Cadps2</italic> and <italic>Reln</italic>) (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), and ASD- or epilepsy-related ion channels in neurons (<italic>Cacna2d1</italic>, <italic>Grik2</italic> and <italic>Kcnd2</italic>) (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>) in ICRF-193 treated or <italic>Chd7</italic> mutant CGNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d,e</xref>). Of note, <italic>Chd7</italic> expression in CGNs was significantly downregulated upon ICRF-193 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>), indicating that Top2b is required for activation of <italic>Chd7</italic> during differentiation.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that Chd7 may be required for proper targeting of Top2b to chromatin. To test this, we performed Top2b ChIP-seq in WT and <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient CGNs. The expression level of Top2b in CGNs was not altered upon loss of <italic>Chd7</italic>, at the level of both transcript and protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9c</xref>). The specificity of the Top2b antibody was verified with ChIP analysis on WT and <italic>Top2b</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> using primer sets for Top2b-targeted regions at the <italic>Fos</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9d</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. We next aimed at comparing the genome-wide binding patterns of Top2b and Chd7. Since Chd7 ChIP-seq was done on GNPs, we performed ChIP-qPCR assays to validate the binding of Chd7 in CGNs. Using primers amplifying Chd7 binding regions identified by Chd7 ChIP-seq in GNPs, we detected the association of Chd7 with multiple regions in WT CGNs, and a clear decrease of its association in <italic>Chd7</italic> mutant CGNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9e</xref>). The comparison between the binding pattern of Chd7 in GNPs and that of Top2b in CGNs revealed that Top2b is associated with Chd7 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig.6f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9f</xref>). While the average length of genes bound by Chd7 was around 103 kb, the average gene length of genes co-occupied by Chd7 and Top2b was approximately 165 kb, revealing preferential binding of Chd7 and Top2b on long genes in cerebellar granule cells. Importantly, upon loss of <italic>Chd7</italic>, 23.2% of Top2b binding sites exhibited alteration of the association of Top2b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6g</xref>). GO analysis of genes with decreased Top2b ChIP-seq peaks revealed cell morphogenesis, cell adhesion, ion transport and neuron differentiation as the most enriched biological process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9g</xref>), while no significantly (Benjamini adjusted <italic>P</italic> value&lt;0.05) enriched term was detected in genes with increased peaks in <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient CGNs. For instance, the binding of Top2b to promoters of two Chd7- and Top2b-activated genes <italic>Cadps2</italic> and <italic>Cnksr3</italic> was decreased in <italic>Chd7</italic> mutant CGNs compared to WT, whereas the binding of Top2b to its known binding site at the <italic>Fos</italic> promoter was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9h</xref>). Importantly, GSEA revealed that genes carrying decreased Top2b ChIP-seq peaks in <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient CGNs tended to be downregulated upon ICRF-193 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6i</xref>), revealing that Chd7-dependent recruitment of Top2b is necessary for the expression of these genes. Furthermore, while the average length of genes bound by Top2b (6147 genes) in WT CGNs was around 95 kb, the average gene length of genes carrying decreased Top2b binding peak (1190 genes) or increased Top2b binding peak (718 genes) upon loss of <italic>Chd7</italic> was around 153 or 115 kb, respectively. Thus, Chd7-dependent targeting of Top2b is preferentially observed in long genes. Moreover, we measured the amount of Top2b covalent complexes in <italic>Chd7</italic> WT and mutant CGNs treated with etoposide, a DNA topoisomerase poison that traps DNA with topoisomerases as a complex. We observed reproducible decrease, although not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.2169), of Top2b covalent complexes in <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 9i</xref>), supporting that Chd7 could contribute to the targeting of Top2b.</p>

<title>Top2b regulates cerebellar development</title>
<p>While the reelin signalling is essential for the proper localization of Purkinje cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, the cerebellar phenotype of <italic>Top2b</italic> knockout mice has not been reported so far. To investigate this, we made use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to ablate <italic>Top2b</italic> in the developing cerebellum. The cerebella of E13.5 <italic>Rosa26-CAG-LSL-Cas9-P2A-EGFP</italic> embryos were electroporated with plasmids encoding <italic>Cre recombinase</italic> and either sgRNA against <italic>Top2b</italic> or a negative-control sequence. The transfection of cerebellar cells was efficient as shown at P7 by the wide expression of GFP upon Cre-mediated recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). In both control and <italic>Top2b-</italic>targeted cerebella, most of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the IGL are Pax6<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>), demonstrating efficient targeting of CGNs by electroporation. Around 80% of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in IGL of <italic>Top2b-</italic>targeted cerebella lost the expression of Top2b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>), demonstrating high knockout efficiency by the CRISPR-Cas9 system <italic>in vivo</italic>. Consistent with the data mentioned above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>), we observed that about 40% of cells lost Chd7 expression within transfected (GFP<sup>+</sup>) cells upon targeting of <italic>Top2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Furthermore, Top2b loss resulted in the downregulation of Zfpm2, a common target gene of Chd7 and Top2b (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). These data provide <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that Top2b is required for the expression of neuronal genes in granule cells. Importantly, clusters of mislocalized Purkinje cells were observed in all three <italic>Top2b</italic>-targeted, but not in the two control cerebella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>), as observed in <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient [<italic>Atoh1-Cre::Chd7</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup>] mice. On the other hand, the percentage of proliferating (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) and differentiating (p27<sup>+</sup>) cells among GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in EGL were not altered upon mutation of <italic>Top2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>), similar to our previous finding that <italic>Chd7</italic> loss does not affect cell proliferation of GNPs. Thus, the cerebella bearing <italic>Chd7</italic>- or <italic>Top2b</italic>-deficient granule cells partly share similar phenotype, which supports our conclusion that expression of a subset of neuronal genes are regulated by Chd7 and Top2b.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many CHARGE patients carrying <italic>CHD7</italic> mutation exhibit cerebellar hypoplasia and massive Purkinje cell heterotopia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In both rodents and human, cerebellar development extends a long period from early embryonic stage until the first postnatal weeks (in mouse) or years (in human). One recent study revealed that Chd7 is necessary for cerebellum specification during early embryogenesis (around E8.5 in mouse) using <italic>Chd7</italic> gene trap mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, the contribution of Chd7 during later cerebellar development and its implication in CHARGE syndrome has not been studied, however. In this study, cell type-specific inactivation of the <italic>Chd7</italic> gene using multiple Cre drivers identified failure of cerebellar granule cells differentiation as a contributing factor for cerebellar hypoplasia and Purkinje cell heterotopia. RNA-seq analysis revealed impaired downregulation of Reln in <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient GNPs, by which mislocalization of Purkinje cells could be explained as observed in <italic>reeler</italic> mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Mechanistically, Chd7 is specifically associated with and is required for the activation of a core neuronal differentiation programme through maintaining the open chromatin structure and recruiting DNA topoisomerase IIb to these genes. Our data provide a clear epigenetic mechanism of Chd7-mediated gene transcriptional regulation <italic>in vivo</italic>, thus shedding light on epigenetic mutation-associated human diseases.</p>
<p>Our previous study revealed that loss of <italic>Chd7</italic> in adult neural stem cells impaired the transcriptional activation of two essential neurogenic transcription factors <italic>Sox4</italic> and <italic>Sox11</italic>, leading to defects of both the quantity and quality of newborn neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In the current study, we made use of the abundance of primary cerebellar granule cells to perform comprehensive molecular analyses. Expression profiling data clearly revealed that Chd7 is required for the activation of genes involved in neural functions. ChIP-seq on freshly isolated GNPs demonstrated that Chd7 occupies active chromatin regions in genes involved in transcription and neuronal functions. Consistent with the result from human embryonic stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, Chd7 was found to be associated with SEs, which exhibit densely spaced clusters of active histone marks H3K27ac and clustered occupancy of cell identity-specific transcription factors. The binding of these transcription factors forming self-reinforcing circuits within SEs shapes cell-type-specific transcriptional landscape and thus governs cell identity. Interestingly, two SEs were identified within the <italic>Chd7</italic> gene, co-occupied by Chd7 protein and H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>), implicating that Chd7 could be a key chromatin regulator of cell identity in GNPs. In accordance with our study, a very recent investigation revealed an essential role of Chd7 in the onset of myelination via targeting the enhancers of key myelinogenic genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p>
<p>Both chromatin remodellers and DNA topoisomerases are crucial enzymes involved in DNA-related processes. The cooperative action of these two groups of enzymes was not appreciated until very recently<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. In this study, we revealed the collaboration between Chd7 and DNA topoisomerases Top2b to activate the expression of long neuronal genes. As an example, our molecular analyses identified <italic>Reln</italic> as a common target of both Chd7 and Top2b. Importantly, depletion of <italic>Top2b</italic> using <italic>Foxg1-Cre</italic>, a forebrain-specific Cre driver, leads to aberrant lamination of cerebral cortex due to the repression of <italic>Reln</italic> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of Top2b is crucial for the expression of Reln in cerebellar granule cells and genetic ablation of Top2b in cerebellum during development leads to mislocalization of Purkinje cells that is very likely due to lack of reelin signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). In cortical neurons, the enzymatic activities of Top2b and Top1 are particularly necessary for transcription of long genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. It has been thought that transcription of very long genes causes more supercoiled DNA double helix structures on these genes, thus requiring Top enzymes to solve this topological issue during transcriptional elongation. Our results suggest that besides DNA topoisomerases, chromatin-remodelling activity is critical for transcription of very long genes. Two recent studies have revealed the cooperation between another chromatin remodeller the BAF complex with DNA topoisomerases. The first study demonstrated that in dividing cells, the BAF complex interacts with Top2a and regulates Top2a-mediated decantenation activity during mitosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. The second study revealed that the BAF complex-dependent chromatin remodelling activity is required for the Top1-mediated gene activation during inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Here, we observed Chd7 interacts with several topoisomerases including Top1, Top2a and Top2b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). It will be of great interest to explore the potential functional interaction between Chd7 and Top1 in postmitotic neurons and Top2a in dividing cells. Furthermore, as reported in a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> and our current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), CHD7 protein interacts with the BAF complex. It could be interesting to investigate the cooperation action among CHD7, BAF complex and DNA topoisomerase.</p>
<p>The rapid progress of genomic sequencing technology has provided novel insights into genetic causes of many human diseases. On the other hand, the causal role of most of these newly identified mutations needs to be experimentally validated. It is striking that most of the patients carrying <italic>CHD7</italic> mutations display neurological disabilities, suggesting that CHD7 is a master chromatin regulator for brain function. Using mouse genetics, we here discovered that Chd7 controls a core neuronal differentiation programme during cerebellar granule cell differentiation. Importantly, 16 out of the 151 genes (<italic>P</italic>=3.146E-15, Chi-square test) that were significantly downregulated in <italic>Chd7</italic>-deficient GNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>) were previously found as genetic mutation(s) in ASD patients (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sfari.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.sfari.org</ext-link>). Furthermore, among 240 identified Chd7 and Top2b common activated genes in CGNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>), mutations of 35 genes are associated with ASD (<italic>P</italic>&lt;2.2E-16, Chi-square test). Emerging evidence has linked the cerebellum with higher cognitive functions. Indeed, cerebellar deficits have long been implicated in autism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Our study provides supporting evidence showing Chd7-dependent regulation of transcription is involved in the pathogenesis of autism. Moreover, many Chd7-regulated genes identified in this study, such as <italic>Gap43</italic>, <italic>Cadps2</italic> and <italic>Reln</italic>, function in other brain regions besides cerebellum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Thus, the molecular network controlled by Chd7 maybe a core network for brain development and function in human.</p>
