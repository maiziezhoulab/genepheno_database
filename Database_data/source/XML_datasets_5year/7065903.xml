<p>Discovery of novel bacterial metabolites reveals an unprecedented role for the microbiome in gut-brain axis communication.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Alterations to the gut microbiome are associated with various neurological diseases, yet evidence of causality and identity of microbiome-derived compounds that mediate gut-brain axis interaction remain elusive. Here, we identify two previously unknown bacterial metabolites 3-methyl-4-(trimethylammonio)butanoate and 4-(trimethylammonio)pentanoate, structural analogs of carnitine that are present in both gut and brain of specific pathogen–free mice but absent in germ-free mice. We demonstrate that these compounds are produced by anaerobic commensal bacteria from the family Lachnospiraceae (Clostridiales) family, colocalize with carnitine in brain white matter, and inhibit carnitine-mediated fatty acid oxidation in a murine cell culture model of central nervous system white matter. This is the first description of direct molecular inter-kingdom exchange between gut prokaryotes and mammalian brain cells, leading to inhibition of brain cell function.</p>

<body><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>While the microbiome can exert a degree of protection against invading pathogens, substantial and lasting changes in its composition are linked to many diseases that until recently were thought to be independent of microbial influence. Recent work has demonstrated that the microbiome is also fundamentally changed in many neurological conditions including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), Alzheimer’s disease, and chronic fatigue syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>). Although little conclusive evidence supports a causative role for the microbiome in neurological disease, bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain is now recognized as an important mediator of neurological health. Studies in animal models underscore the importance of a stable microbiome, as its disruption, particularly at key developmental stages, results in long-term effects on anxiety, development, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>). In addition, positive effects of gut bacterial supplementation on the brain are reported, while the positive outcomes of therapeutic interventions in some cases can be attributed to the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>).</p><p>Microbes stimulate host neurotransmitter production in the gut and synthesize their own host-recognized neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>). They can also stimulate the host immune system, leading to inflammation and notable shifts in composition of the gut microbiota with the potential to exert neurological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>). While microbial-derived molecules such as short-chain fatty acids can cross into the brain to exert their effects, most microbial molecules that influence the microbiome-gut-brain (MGB) axis mediate their effects indirectly through the highly enervated gut and the vagus nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>To identify unknown microbial metabolites that mediate MGB axis communication, we used mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to identify molecules that are present in both the gut and brain of specific pathogen–free (SPF) C57BL/6 mice but are absent from germ-free (GF) C57BL/6 mice. This approach enables the identification of both known and novel molecules, with high spatial resolution. We detected a molecule at a mass-to-charge ratio (<italic>m/z</italic>) of 160.133 by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)–MSI and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI)–MSI in the gut and brain of SPF mice at levels greater than 20 times higher than in corresponding tissue sections from GF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and fig. S1). MALDI-MSI was used to gain a high lateral resolution image for brain region analysis, and DESI-MSI was used for further high spectral resolution analysis. The detection of the molecule at <italic>m/z</italic> 160.133 in GF mice was comparable to a baseline off tissue negative control (fig. S1). This molecule, provisionally termed Met1, was particularly abundant in white matter areas of the brain (medulla, corpus callosum, and the arbor vitae) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Met1 was also detected systemically in wild-type C57BL/6 mice, in blood, liver, kidney, lung, spleen, intestine, testes, and heart (fig. S2).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>MALDI-MSI on brain and gut sections from C57BL/6 GF and SPF mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections (top) and MALDI-MSI images (bottom) of brain tissue.

Scale bars, 1 mm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="aax6328-F1"></graphic></fig><p>As detection of Met1 in GF mice was comparable to the negative control, this suggested a microbial origin for the compound in SPF mice. Therefore, we determined whether Met1 in the colon could be reduced by treatment for 7 days with a cocktail of nonabsorbable antibiotics. This treatment was seen to significantly reduce Met1 levels (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05), underscoring the likely microbial origin of Met1 (fig. S3). We next screened intestinal bacterial strains from the gut microbiota of C57BL/6 mice for the production of Met1. Bacterial strains isolated from murine feces were grown on fastidious anaerobe broth (FAB) agar plates before colonies were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and spotted onto glass slides for screening for Met1 by MSI. A peak at <italic>m/z</italic> 160.133 was detected in two closely related bacterial strains from the <italic>Clostridium</italic> XIVa cluster of the Lachnospiraceae family, determined by 16<italic>S</italic> ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing to be <italic>Clostridium clostridioforme</italic> and <italic>Clostridium symbiosum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).

The Met1 product ion spectra from the different sources matched, confirming that the molecules from the murine brain and <italic>C. clostridioforme</italic> were structurally identical (fig. S4).

NMR determined that Met1 was a mixture of two structural isomers differing only in the location of a methyl side chain, located on either C3 [3-methyl-4-(trimethylammonio)butanoate (3M-4-TMAB)] or C4 [4-(trimethylammonio)pentanoate (4-TMAP)] of the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).

However, unlike 3M-4-TMAB and 4-TMAP, GBB is synthesized by a range of intestinal bacteria as well as mammalian cells, meaning that tracking GBB produced specifically by the bacterial producers of 3M-4-TMAB and 4-TMAP was not possible.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title><sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H COSY of crude extracts showing the occurrence of three related trimethylammonium derivatives.</title><p>Cross peaks have been colored-coded accordingly, while lines shown on the spectrum represent the correlation between neighboring coupling protons in the respective derivative: 3M-4-TMAB (green) and 4-TMAP (red) as well as the demethylated congener, GBB (black).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="aax6328-F3"></graphic></fig><p>Because 3M-4-TMAB is highly similar in structure to carnitine and 4-TMAP is similar to GBB, the direct precursor of carnitine, we used MSI to examine colocalization of 3M-4-TMAB and 4-TMAP with carnitine in SPF mouse brain slices. Carnitine is a crucial mediator of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), shuttling long-chain fatty acids in the form of acylcarnitines across the membrane into mitochondria where they are broken down.

To ensure that molecular colocalization in SPF mice was underlying the correlation, as opposed to tissue-based changes in ion suppression, total ion count normalization was also applied before analysis. This indicated that carnitine at <italic>m/z</italic> 162 is in the top 3 highly correlated molecules with 3M-4-TMAB/4-TMAP (table S1). Therefore, as well as being structurally similar to carnitine and its precursor, 3M-4-TMAB and 4-TMAP were also found in the same locations within the brain.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Conversion of MALDI-MSI into binary images showing the high-intensity (black) and low-intensity (gray) regions of the ion images of <italic>m/z</italic> 160.1 (3M-4-TMAB/4-TMAP) and <italic>m/z</italic> 162.1 (carnitine).</title><p>The overlap of these regions was then calculated as the percentage of pixels in the high-intensity region of the <italic>m/z</italic> 160.1 image that were also high intensity in the <italic>m/z</italic> 162.1 image.

This study identifies two novel gut microbiome–derived carnitine mimics that significantly colocalize with carnitine in the white matter of the murine brain while also inhibiting carnitine function in in vitro models of murine CNS white matter. FAO supplies up to 20% of brain oxidative energy needs and is critical for many neurological functions, with neural stem cells reliant in vitro and in vivo on FAO for their survival and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>). Given recent findings underlining the fundamental importance of FAO to brain health, the identification of gut microbiome–derived compounds in the brain that mediate inhibition of brain cell function is of immense importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>).</p><p>Inhibition of mitochondrial function by antimicrobials has been reported previously, and there is a growing body of evidence to support the existence of microbiome-mitochondria communication within the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>). While carnitine is not needed for fatty acid trafficking in microbes, it acts as both a nutrient source and a protectant against environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>). Carnitine metabolism by enteric microbes generates trimethylamine <italic>N</italic>-oxide (TMAO), high serum levels of which are indicative of cardiovascular disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>). Intestinal bacteria can thrive in the presence of carnitine, but <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, of which the 3M-4-TMAB– and 4-TMAP–producing <italic>Clostridia</italic> XIV are members, decrease in its presence likely as a result of being outcompeted by carnitine-metabolizing bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>). Under such competitive conditions, we speculate that carnitine mimics such as 3M-4-TMAB and 4-TMAP may be produced by these <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> in an attempt to inhibit carnitine function or metabolism in competing bacteria.</p><p><italic>C. clostridioforme</italic> and <italic>C. symbiosum</italic>, the identified producers of 3M-4-TMAB and 4-TMAP, remain poorly understood. <italic>C. clostridioforme</italic> is now recognized as distinct from <italic>C. bolteae</italic> and <italic>C. hathewayi</italic>, two species that were previously classified as <italic>C. clostridioforme</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). <italic>C. bolteae</italic> rapidly proliferates after disruption of the human gut microbiota, likely because of its ability to form endospores and resistance to multiple antibiotics, traits also found in <italic>C. clostridioforme</italic> and <italic>C. symbiosum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>). <italic>C. bolteae</italic> exhibits a marked ability to proliferate and persist in the human intestine post-antibiotic use, maintaining its presence for 180 days after treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>). The presence of <italic>C. symbiosum</italic> and <italic>C. clostridioforme</italic> in the gut microbiome is associated with low microbial diversity, while <italic>C. symbiosum</italic> presence could further distinguish obese from lean participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>). The link between <italic>C. symbiosum</italic> and metabolism is further underlined by its ability to promote robust weight gain in growth-stunted mice, one of only two bacteria that exhibited the capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>). Whether 3M-4-TMAB and 4-TMAP could play any role in these metabolic effects warrants further investigation, but we hypothesize that under conditions that are favorable to increased colonization by these microbes, the production of 3M-4-TMAB and 4-TMAP in the intestine is likely to increase significantly with potential systemic effects.</p><p>While 3M-4-TMAB is a molecule not previously described in the literature, 4-TMAP has been chemically synthesized as an analog of mildronate, a potent inhibitor of both human GBB hydroxylase (BBOX1) and carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT) enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>). These enzymes are involved in carnitine synthesis and the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria, respectively. 4-TMAP is bound in the human BBOX1 active site in a near-identical conformation to mildronate and has a lower dissociation constant (4.1 μM) but was found to have an inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) nearly three orders of magnitude higher than mildronate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>). This means that the inhibitory effects seen here are likely mediated by targeting of carnitine-related enzymes other than BBOX1 and CrAT. 3M-4-TMAB bears marked structural similarity to a number of known inhibitors of carnitine function, including aminocarnitine derived from the fungal compound emericidin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27"><italic>27</italic></xref>). Aminocarnitine inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and CPT2, and CrAT as the hydroxyl group essential to carnitine metabolism has been substituted with an alternate nonfunctional side chain. Removal of this hydroxyl group, which is also absent in 3M-4-TMAB and replaced with a methyl group, prevents the esterification reaction needed to link a long-chain fatty acid to carnitine, thereby inhibiting fatty acid shuttling into the mitochondria for oxidation. Future research focusing on a role for metabolites from the gut microbiome in the inhibition of mitochondrial function across a wide range of mammalian tissues and cell types may be highly informative. Such work has the potential to yield significant insight into how the gut microbiome influences the host systemically, not just across the MGB axis.</p><p>While difficult to determine without further detailed confirmatory tests, the presence of 3M-4-TMAB and 4-TMAP in other diseases is suggested through publicly available data and the literature. A molecule of the exact <italic>m/z</italic> of 3M-4-TMAB and 4-TMAP (160.133) has been described in the literature as a biomarker in type 2 diabetes (T2D), significantly increased in cord plasma during preeclampsia, and predictive of diabetic nephropathy in T1D patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28"><italic>28</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><italic>30</italic></xref>). These diseases all have associated mitochondrial dysfunction or incomplete FAO. The likelihood of the biomarker at <italic>m/z</italic> 160.133, which is significantly increased in T2D patients, being 3M-4-TMAB and 4-TMAP, is further supported by separate studies in Europe and China, in which the 3M-4-TMAB/4-TMAP–producing strains were the most significantly enriched species in the T2D gut microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><italic>31</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32"><italic>32</italic></xref>). <italic>C. symbiosum</italic> has shown promise as a biomarker for early and noninvasive detection of colorectal cancer, while a molecule of <italic>m/z</italic> 160.1 was detected as one of the three most significantly correlated molecules to hypoxic regions in breast cancer tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33"><italic>33</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34"><italic>34</italic></xref>). The product ion spectra produced from the MS/MS analysis of the metabolite in the breast cancer tumor model match the spectra from 3M-4-TMAB and 4-TMAP, indicating that they are likely the same and that 3M-4-TMAB/4-TMAP can penetrate tumors.</p><p>The interplay between the microbiome and host mitochondria is likely far more extensive and complex than presently known, with many diseases of mitochondrial dysfunction correlated to well-described changes in microbial populations in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><italic>31</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35"><italic>35</italic></xref>).

A number of ASDs have been linked to underlying mitochondrial dysfunction, with descriptions in the literature describing increased acylcarnitine levels, decreased FAO-mediated stem cell generation, and carnitine-mediated improvement in symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>). While the significance of alterations in the gut microbiota in ASD remains controversial, both of the 3M-4-TMAB/4-TMAP–producing strains identified here have been described in elevated numbers in the gut while being at low levels or completely absent in controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>). These microbiome changes are mirrored in murine ASD models such as the maternal immune activation (MIA) model, with increases in Lachnospiraceae again noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). After treatment decreased Lachnospiraceae numbers in the intestine of the MIA model, improvements in communicative, stereotypic, anxiety-like, and sensorimotor behaviors were all noted, along with a correction in defective fatty acid metabolism. These mitochondrial deficiencies, alongside those described in other neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, mean that any potential role for microbiome input into mitochondrial inhibition is worthy of further investigation.</p><p>This is the first mechanistic description of a microbial molecule inhibiting the function of the mitochondria in cells of the CNS. The two novel molecules produced by the gut microbiome described here are the first found in the murine brain that localize with and antagonize the function of carnitine.

For acquisition of MS/MS spectra, an injection time of 300 ms, automatic gain control target of 5,000,000, and mass resolution of 70,000 were used. MS/MS analysis was performed using various high collision dissociation settings (shown in Results) and a mass isolation window of ±0.3 Da. Data were converted into imzML format using imzML converter version 1.1.4.5, and data were visualized using MSiReader version 0.09 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><italic>40</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>MSI analysis of bacterial spots</title><p>To isolate producing bacteria from the murine microbiome, feces was isolated from C57BL/6J mice and plated onto FAB agar plates. Single isolated colonies of murine gut microbiome bacteria or type strains were grown overnight in FAB or on FAB agar. Taxonomic assignment for the strains was obtained using the complete 16<italic>S</italic> rDNA sequence from each strain and the “Identify” function in EzBioCloud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"><italic>41</italic></xref>). The 3M-4-TMAB/4-TMAP–producing strain, designated LM19, was identified as <italic>C. symbiosum</italic>, being 99.79% similar to the <italic>C. symbiosum</italic> type strain ATCC14940. The second producing strain, designated LM41, was identified as being 99.5% similar to the <italic>C. clostridioforme</italic> type strain ATCC25537. Type strains used for MSI were from the National Collection of Type Cultures (United Kingdom). For MSI analysis, single colonies from FAB agar plates were inoculated into 100 μl of PBS to give an optical density at 600 nm of 0.3. Two microliters of each bacterial culture was spotted onto a glass slide and allowed to dry. Slides were stored in a desiccator until DESI-MSI, which was performed using the same DESI-MSI parameters as above with a spatial resolution of 200 μm.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Nuclear magnetic resonance</title><p>Samples (15 mg) were dissolved in 700 μl of deuterated water (Sigma-Aldrich) and added to a 7-mm NMR tube. Presaturation proton NMR experiments were performed by irradiating the water peak at 4.88 parts per million (ppm), using 128 scans, 15-Hz spin with a relaxation delay of 3 s. NMR was carried out using a 400-MHz JEOL LA400 FT-NMR spectrometer system equipped with a 40TH5AT/FG probe (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The acquisition of the one-dimensional proton spectra (<sup>1</sup>H NMR) was performed by the presaturation pulse sequence using 128 scans per analysis. Subsequently, two-dimensional COSY NMR spectra were also acquired with 64 scans. Data points were collected into a plot using spectral widths of 3.93 kHz for F1 and F2. The presaturation method was used to suppress the solvent signal during acquisition.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Analysis of correlation of <italic>m/z</italic> 160.133 with carnitine in the brain</title><p>Data were first converted to imzML using flexImaging (Bruker Daltonics version 4.1), and processing was performed using SpectralAnalysis.

Briefly, embryonic day 13 (E13; day of plug E0) mouse spinal cords were isolated and stripped of their meninges and then dissociated into a single-cell suspension using trypsin and trituration. Cells were plated at 60,000 to 75,000 cells per well of a Seahorse XF96 cell culture plate (35-μl volume) pretreated with poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine [in boric acid buffer (0.1 mg/ml; pH 8.4)]. Cells were plated initially in 12.5% horse serum, which was gradually withdrawn through feeding every second or third day with serum-free differentiation medium [Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (glucose, 4.5 mg/ml), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), biotin (10 ng/ml), 1% N1, 50 nM hydrocortisone, and insulin (10 μg/ml)].

Twenty-four hours before the assay, cultures were placed in Substrate-Limited Medium [DMEM supplemented with 0.5 mM glucose, 1 mM glutamine, 0.5 mM carnitine, and 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS)]. Just before the assay, media were changed to FAO Assay Medium consisting of KHB buffer (111 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 1.2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) supplemented with 2.5 mM glucose, 0.5 mM carnitine, and 5 mM Hepes, adjusted to pH 7.4. To stimulate FAO, palmitate-BSA substrate (200 μM) was added to all wells except the BSA control. 4-TMAP and 3M-4-TMAB effects on FAO were measured by supplementation into wells of 2 mM 4-TMAP or 3M-4-TMAB or 1 mM 4-TMAP and 1 mM 3M-4-TMAB in combination for 24 hours before the assay and for the duration of the assay. For examination of the effect of the concentrations of 3M-4-TMAB and 4-TMAP found in the brain on FAO, the experiment was repeated as before but in the absence of carnitine (0.5 mM) supplementation into both Substrate-Limited Medium and FAO Assay Medium, meaning that FBS was the only exogenous source of carnitine during the assay. 4-TMAP or 3M-4-TMAB (20 μM), or a combination of 10 μM 4-TMAP and 10 μM 3M-4-TMAB, was supplemented into media for 24 hours before assay and during the assay. OCR was measured over time in the presence of either high or low concentrations of 3M-4-TMAB and 4-TMAP, and at least three repeated measures per well were recorded. For each well, the measurements were normalized on the total micrograms of proteins determined at the end of the assay with a Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The number of replicate wells varied between 5 and 20 per condition. The values of the repeated measurements were averaged, and a mean value was obtained for each individual well. The OCR values per well were further averaged, and a mean value for each condition was obtained. Last, the mean value for each of the conditions was divided by the value obtained for the condition with palmitate and BSA supplementation. These calculations were applied to each of the independent experiments performed, for which the relative OCR values are reported in the figure.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Microbiome analysis of antibiotic-treated mice</title><p>For preparation of DNA samples for microbiome sequencing, fecal samples were defrosted to room temperature and the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil DNA Extraction (MP Biomedicals) was used for DNA extraction; 16<italic>S</italic> ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was undertaken at Glasgow Polyomics for analysis of the microbiome.
