<p>Sullivan et al. showed that pharmacological suppression of BET proteins by a highly selective brain-permeable inhibitor, results in the suppression of genes that have been linked to autism spectrum disorders in humans. BET inhibitor treatment of young mice led to the induction of an autism-like syndrome characterized by alterations in social behaviors. These findings suggest a key role of the BET-controlled gene networks in the development of ASD.</p>

<abstract>
<p>Studies investigating the causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) point to genetic, as well as epigenetic, mechanisms of the disease. Identification of epigenetic processes that contribute to ASD development and progression is of major importance and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we identify the bromodomain and extraterminal domain–containing proteins (BETs) as epigenetic regulators of genes involved in ASD-like behaviors in mice. We found that the pharmacological suppression of BET proteins in the brain of young mice, by the novel, highly specific, brain-permeable inhibitor I-BET858 leads to selective suppression of neuronal gene expression followed by the development of an autism-like syndrome. Many of the I-BET858–affected genes have been linked to ASD in humans, thus suggesting the key role of the BET-controlled gene network in the disorder. Our studies suggest that environmental factors controlling BET proteins or their target genes may contribute to the epigenetic mechanism of ASD.</p>

<body><p>The search for the cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) revealed the disease’s associations with numerous gene mutations. Many of the ASD candidate genes encode proteins that control neuronal network formation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). A significant fraction of ASD-associated genes, however, encode rather ubiquitous regulators of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Rubeis et al., 2014</xref>). The latter finding underscores the possibility of an epigenetic etiology of ASD, where aberrant control of gene expression rather than gene mutations can lead to abnormal neuronal development and function.</p><p>One of the major challenges for testing the role of abnormal gene regulation in brain function is the lack of experimental models where changes in gene expression can be achieved in a controlled fashion and without the generalized negative impact on neuronal development, survival, and function. This obstacle could be potentially overcome by using brain-permeable compounds that regulate transcription in a selective and time-dependent fashion. Pharmacological suppression of well-defined transcriptional processes would allow one to determine the impact of acute or chronic transcriptional deregulation on animal behavior at any developmental time point and would also enable the identification of genes affected by the temporal impairment of these processes.</p><p>Our earlier studies describe the pharmacological modulation of transcription by inhibitors of the bromodomain and extraterminal domain–containing proteins (BETs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nicodeme et al., 2010</xref>). In humans and mice, somatic cells, including neurons, express three independent BET proteins: Brd2, Brd3, and Brd4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sanchez et al., 2014</xref>). All three BET proteins contain two N-terminal bromodomains (BD1 and BD2) that recognize acetylated lysines within the N-terminal domain of histone H4, as well as other lysine-acetylated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Filippakopoulos and Knapp, 2012</xref>). The binding of the BET bromodomain to acetylated histone H4 lysines initiates a chain of biochemical and molecular events that leads to the formation of elongation-competent transcriptional complexes containing RNA Polymerase II phosphorylated at serine 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brès et al., 2008</xref>). Pharmacological inhibitors of BET proteins, such as I-BET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nicodeme et al., 2010</xref>) or JQ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Filippakopoulos et al., 2010</xref>), bind with high specificity to the acetyl-lysine–binding pocket of the tandem bromodomains of all members of the BET family. The inhibitor binding prevents BET protein association with acetylated histone H4 and affects gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nicodeme et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbieri et al., 2013</xref>). However, despite the widespread BET binding to numerous genes, the impact of the BET inhibitors on gene expression in various cell types is surprisingly limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nicodeme et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dawson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>). The mechanism of the selective impact of BET inhibitors on gene expression is not well understood. Our earlier studies showed that susceptibility to I-BET in activated macrophages correlates with the gene’s dependence on SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nicodeme et al., 2010</xref>). Other studies have suggested a link between the susceptibility to BET inhibitors and BET-association with specific enhancer clusters (super-enhancers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lovén et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To address the impact of BET suppression on neuronal gene expression and brain function, we developed a novel, brain-permeable I-BET (I-BET858). Here, we provide evidence for the selective impact of BET protein functions on neuronal gene expression in vitro and in vivo. We show that I-BET858 treatment preferentially suppresses genes associated with neuronal differentiation and synaptic function and has no effect on neuronal housekeeping or early response genes. The suppressive effects of I-BET858 correlate directly with gene length. A significant number of I-BET858–suppressed genes, including genes of extended length, are potential ASD candidate genes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">King et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, suppression of specific neuronal genes by I-BET858 in young mice leads to the development of an autism-like syndrome. Our findings describe for the first time a pharmacologically induced model of ASD and point to the selective I-BET858 suppressed genes as potential key contributors to ASD in mice.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Identification of a novel brain-permeable BET inhibitor</title><p>Brain permeability is a crucial factor in assessing the impact of BET inhibitors on neuronal gene expression and associated behaviors. To investigate the effects of BET inhibition within the central nervous system, we identified a novel BET inhibitor compound with higher brain permeability than the original I-BET151 and I-BET762. Through in silico assessment of ∼1,000 potential brain-penetrant BET inhibitor compounds, we identified the novel tetrahydroquinoline class (THQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gosmini et al., 2014</xref>) compound I-BET858 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). I-BET858 displayed an appropriate profile for progression into in vivo rodent models based on its calculated physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetics, BET inhibitory activity in cell-based assays, and enhanced brain penetrance (Fig. S1, A and B). The binding mode of I-BET858 to BRD4-BD1 was determined by x-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="supp1" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20151271/DC1">Fig. S1, C and D</ext-link>). The curvature of the THQ template complements that of the BET proteins and results in high affinity of I-BET858 for the BET subfamily with &gt;1,000-fold selectivity over 34 other bromodomain-containing proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="supp2" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20151271/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>).</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of the brain-permeable inhibitor of BET proteins (I-BET858) on gene expression in primary neurons in vitro.</bold> (A) Chemical structure of I-BET858.

Primary cortical neurons isolated from E18 mouse brain were grown in an in vitro culture system for 7 d, followed by treatment with I-BET858 at a concentration of 1 µM. As in other cell types treated with I-BET or JQ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nicodeme et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dawson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>), the treatment of primary cultured neurons with I-BET858 leads to a time-dependent up- and down-regulation of numerous genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). Opposite to gene induction, the down-regulation of gene expression by BET inhibitors has been shown to correlate directly with BET-association at the gene loci before the BET inhibitor treatment and loss of BET-association following exposure to the inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nicodeme et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, in our studies we focus exclusively on genes that are suppressed by I-BET858.</p><p>Treatment of primary cortical neurons with I-BET858 results in time-dependent changes in gene expression, characterized by the moderate (2.75-fold, on average) down-regulation of 225 and 1,158 genes at 2 and 12 h after I-BET858 treatment, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="supp3" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20151271/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>). Notably, I-BET858 preferentially affects genes controlling synaptic transmission, neuronal development, and morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Moreover, ∼10% of the suppressed genes (118/1,158; P &lt; 0.0001; OR, 2.486) are previously identified ASD risk genes (combined lists from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al. [2009]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">King et al. [2013]</xref>) in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref> and Table S1). Several of the ASD candidate genes that show strong suppression in response to I-BET858, such as <italic>Met</italic>,<italic> Gabra1</italic>,<italic> Cntn6</italic>,<italic> Pde4b</italic>,<italic> Npas2</italic>,<italic> Cdh10</italic>, and <italic>Foxp1</italic>, have been shown to play an important role in neuronal development and function in circuits relevant to core behavioral domains of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhou et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ozburn et al., 2015</xref>). The brain-specific deficiency of Foxp1-expression was recently shown to impair neuronal development, causing autistic-like behaviors in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacon et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The ability of I-BET858 to modify gene expression in neurons was further demonstrated by the profound yet selective effect of I-BET858 on the expression of genes induced by the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). The BDNF-controlled genes play a crucial role during brain development and are essential for normal neuronal function and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Park and Poo, 2013</xref>). Treatment of primary cortical neurons with BDNF results in the induction of numerous genes that regulate neuronal maturation, axogenesis, synapse formation and synaptic transmission in neurons (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="supp4" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20151271/DC1">Table S2</ext-link>). The BDNF-induced transcriptional changes follow a well-defined temporal pattern with the induction of early response genes, such as <italic>Egr1-4</italic>, <italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>FosB</italic>, <italic>Ier2-5</italic>, <italic>Jun</italic>, <italic>JunB</italic>, and <italic>Nr4a2/3</italic>, within 20 min after BDNF stimulation. The expression of these immediate-early genes (IEGs) is followed by the induction of secondary/late response genes that control the specific BDNF-induced changes in neuronal morphology and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alder et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calella et al., 2007</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>I-BET858 effect on BDNF-inducible gene expression in vitro.</bold> Heat maps show normalized expression values using microarray analysis for all BDNF-inducible and I-BET–suppressed (left, more than twofold) or I-BET–resistant (right) genes in cortical neurons at 2 h (A) and 12 h (B) after treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 3/group; experiment was performed in duplicate).

I-BET858 has no impact on housekeeping gene expression but specifically affects the expression of a selected group of BDNF-induced neuronal genes at 2 and 12 h after BDNF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A–C</xref>; and Table S2). Many BDNF-inducible and I-BET858–suppressed genes are regulators of important neuronal processes, including neuronal transmission via ion channels (such as <italic>Cacna2d1</italic>, <italic>Kcnma1</italic>, and <italic>Kcna1/4</italic>), neurotransmitter receptor signaling (<italic>Drd1a</italic>, <italic>Gabra1</italic>, <italic>Gria1-3</italic>, <italic>Grin3a</italic>, and <italic>Pde1c/4d</italic>), and dendrite and axon development (<italic>Ank3</italic>, <italic>Bdnf</italic>, <italic>Camk2d</italic>, <italic>Dscaml1</italic>, <italic>Dclk1</italic>, <italic>Ntrk3</italic>, and <italic>Sema3a</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A–C</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the expression of IEGs, such as <italic>Arc</italic>, <italic>Dusp1/4</italic>, <italic>Egr1-4</italic>, <italic>Fosb</italic>, <italic>Homer1</italic>, <italic>Ier2/5</italic>, <italic>Junb</italic>, <italic>Nr4a1/2/3</italic>, and<italic> Srf</italic> in response to BDNF treatment after 2 and 12 h was not affected or even slightly increased by I-BET858 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A–C</xref>). These data suggest that I-BET858 treatment in neurons does not disrupt BDNF-induced neuronal signal responses or subsequent IEG induction, but specifically represses the transcription of a selected group of secondary/late response genes in response to BDNF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A–C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Selective impairment of neuronal gene expression by pharmacological BET inhibition in vivo</title><p>The development of the brain-permeable I-BET858 enables us to address for the first time the impact of pharmacological suppression of BET proteins on gene expression in neurons in vivo. We found that I-BET858 enters the mouse brain shortly after an i.p. injection (Fig. S1 B). A single acute i.p. administration of I-BET858 at 30 mg/kg allows I-BET858 detection in the brain at a concentration of ≥1 µM lasting for several hours after the injection (Fig. S1 B). The tissue concentration of 1 µM matches the concentration of I-BET required for the therapeutic impact during systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nicodeme et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In our initial studies, we addressed the impact of acute and chronic I-BET858 administration on gene expression in the striatum. We chose the striatum because of (a) its relatively homogenous neuronal population with 90% of striatal neurons being D1 or D2 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons, (b) the well-known pattern of medium spiny neuron gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heiman et al., 2008</xref>), (c) the well-established role of the striatum in animal behavior, and (d) the contribution of impaired striatal function to neuronal disorders, including ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Di Martino et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Peça et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rothwell et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Acute I-BET858 treatment results in the suppression of 270 genes 4 h after a single i.p. injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="supp5" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20151271/DC1">Table S3</ext-link>). The chronic administration of I-BET858 for 2 wk does not affect the total number, but rather the pattern of affected genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>; and Table S3). Approximately 45% of genes suppressed by acute I-BET858 treatment remain down-regulated 12 h after chronic daily I-BET858 injections, whereas 155 genes are suppressed by I-BET858 only after long-term treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>; P &lt; 0.0001; OR, 124.8). A significant fraction of the in vivo I-BET858–suppressed genes (69/270 after acute; 51/274 after chronic; P &lt; 0.0001; OR, 7.701 and 5.042) overlap with the I-BET–repressed genes in primary neurons in vitro (Table S3). Most importantly, acute and chronic I-BET858 treatment results in significant down-regulation of 34 genes that have been previously implicated in ASD (P = 0.0025; OR, 1.755). Several of the I-BET858–suppressed ASD-associated genes include potent transcriptional regulators, such as the histone lysine demethylase <italic>Phf2</italic>, the Set-domain binding protein <italic>Setbp1</italic>, and the transcription factors <italic>Foxp1</italic>, <italic>Nr4a2</italic>, <italic>Zbtb20</italic>, and <italic>Tcf3</italic> (Table S3). The latter finding points to BET proteins as transcriptional regulators of gene-controlling chromatin circuits that can broaden the impact of BET inhibition on gene expression in neurons. This may, in part, explain the distinct patterns of genes only altered with chronic dosing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Similar to our in vitro studies, in vivo administration of I-BET858 has no impact on housekeeping gene expression (not depicted) but preferentially suppresses genes involved in neuronal development, and dendrite and synapse formation and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Selective effect of I-BET858 on gene expression in vivo.</bold> Volcano plots show genes that are significantly suppressed (blue) or induced (red) more than twofold after acute (A) or chronic (B) I-BET858 treatment in the mouse striatum using RNA sequencing analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 2).

The key behavioral symptoms of ASD in humans include abnormal social interactions, communication deficits, anxiety and repetitive behaviors. A combination of alterations in social behaviors, anxiety, and repetitive behaviors are therefore frequently used to diagnose autism-like phenotypes in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Peça et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellegood and Crawley, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The impact of acute I-BET858 on mouse behavior was determined by assessing basal motor activity, anxiety-like behaviors, social interaction, and memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>).

Acute I-BET858 treatment also did not affect memory formation in mice.

After 2 wk of chronic I-BET858 treatment, 6-wk-old mice displayed reduced explorative motor activity and heightened anxiety-like behavior in the open field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). I-BET858–treated mice also spend slightly more time engaging in stereotypic behaviors as compared with their vehicle-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Using the three-chamber social approach task that is commonly used to reveal ASD-like social deficits in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellegood and Crawley, 2015</xref>), we found that chronic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>), but not acute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>), 6-wk-old I-BET858–treated mice displayed greatly reduced sociability. When tested for their preference to explore a novel mouse versus an inanimate novel object, the chronic I-BET858–treated mice spent equal amounts of time sniffing the mouse and the object, unlike vehicle-treated littermates that prefer to explore the novel mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). In addition to the reduced sociability, chronic I-BET858–treated mice showed a significant reduction in their preference for social novelty. Preference for social novelty requires functional social recognition and is defined as the test mouse spending more time exploring/sniffing a novel mouse than a familiar mouse. Unlike vehicle-injected mice, chronic I-BET858–treated mice displayed no significant preference in exploring a novel mouse over a familiar mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Importantly, the observed effects on social preference in the I-BET858–treated mice are not due to defective olfaction or reduced overall explorative activity in the three-chamber assay; I-BET858-treated mice displayed no differences in hidden food retrieval, no left versus right bias differences, and no reduction in velocity, total distance moved, or time spent sniffing/exploring during the social interaction paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref> and not depicted) as compared with control, vehicle-injected mice. Notably, mice that were chronically treated with I-BET858 between 4–6 wk of age showed a partial reversal of the social behavioral deficits with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our findings reveal a key role of BET proteins in the regulation of selected genes that control normal neuronal development and function. The significance of BET proteins in the regulation of mouse behavior is underscored by the development of an ASD-like syndrome in mice treated with brain permeable I-BET858. The data also suggest that environmental factors that have the ability to affect BET protein function or BET target gene expression may contribute to ASD. The pharmacological induction of ASD-like symptoms in mice provides a valuable tool for the identification of genes that may play a pivotal role in the etiology of the disease or for the development of novel drugs targeting ASD. Moreover, our studies suggest that the pharmacological control of BET proteins or BET-dependent gene expression regulation could be used not only for modeling of autism-like behaviors, but possibly for the correction of aberrantly expressed genes in ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>4-wk-old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.

Mice were injected with either I-BET858 (30 mg/kg) or vehicle 10 min after the training. 24 h later, the mouse was placed back into the test chamber for 5 min and freezing behavior was recorded (context test). 2 h later, the mouse was tested for freezing in response to the auditory cue. Environmental and contextual cues were changed for the auditory cue test. The auditory cue test was divided into two phases: 3 min in the absence of the auditory cue and 3 min of the auditory cue. The time freezing during each test was converted to a percentage of freezing value.</p></sec><sec><title>Social interaction paradigm.</title><p>Social preference and social memory was performed as previous described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellegood and Crawley, 2015</xref>) using a Plexiglas chamber divided into three compartments. The two edge compartments contain an empty wire cup. Mice were habituated to the testing room for at least 1 h before the experiment. Stimulus mice are 6–8-wk-old C67Bl/6 male mice that were housed in separate areas of the animal facility and had no prior contact with the test mice. Stimulus mice were habituated to the wire cup before testing. For the sociability test, the test mouse is introduced to the middle chamber and allowed to freely move and habituate to all three compartments for 10 min. Then, the mouse was restricted to the middle chamber using the dividers, while a novel object (Lego) was placed under the wire cup in one chamber and an unfamiliar mouse in the other. The test mouse was then allowed to investigate the whole apparatus for 10 min. After, the mouse was again restricted to the middle chamber while the object was replaced by a second, unfamiliar mouse. The test mouse was allowed 10 min to investigate. Data were acquired using the Ethovision system (Noldus) to automatically track motion while manual scoring was used to quantify time spent sniffing the stimuli. Counterbalancing was used to control for potential left-right preferences.</p></sec><sec><title>Olfaction.</title><p>Olfaction was tested by exposing mice (<italic>n</italic> = 5) to a small amount of palatable food (Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal; General Mills) once per day for 2 d. Mice were deprived of food overnight before the test. A clean cage was filled with roughly 3 inches of fresh bedding, and the stimulus food was buried in the bedding until it was not visible. Mice were then placed in the cage one at a time and allowed to freely explore. The latency to localize and retrieve the food was measured. All mice retrieved the food within 2 min. Bedding was mixed in between trials and tested mice were placed in a new holding cage until all cage-mates had been tested. After this, all mice were returned to their original cage and ad libitum food access was restored.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Accession nos.</title><p>The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Edgar et al., 2002</xref>) and are accessible through GEO SuperSeries accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:geo" xlink:href="GSE72149">GSE72149</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>In Fig. S1, the characterization of the novel brain-permeable inhibitor of BET proteins (I-BET858) is shown.
