<p id="P1">Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is associated with deficits in various types of learning, including those that require the hippocampus. Relatedly, hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) is impaired in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) mouse model of FXS. Prior research found that infusion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rescues LTP in the KOs. Here, we tested if, in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, up-regulating BDNF production or treatment with an agonist for BDNF’s TrkB receptor restores synaptic plasticity and improves learning. In hippocampal slices, bath infusion of the TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) completely restored otherwise impaired hippocampal field CA1 LTP of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs without effect in wild types (WTs). Similarly, acute, semi-chronic, or chronic treatments with 7,8-DHF rescued a simple hippocampus-dependent form of spatial learning (object location memory: OLM) in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs without effect in WTs. The agonist also restored object recognition memory, which depends on cortical regions. Semi-chronic, but not acute, treatment with the ampakine CX929, which up-regulates BDNF expression, lowered the training threshold for OLM in WT mice and rescued learning in the KOs. Positive results were also obtained in a test for social recognition. An mGluR5 antagonist did not improve learning. Quantification of synaptic immunolabeling demonstrated that 7,8-DHF and CX929 increase levels of activated TrkB at excitatory synapses. Moreover, CX929 induced a robust synaptic activation of the TrkB effector ERK1/2. These results suggest that enhanced synaptic BDNF signaling constitutes a plausible strategy for treating certain aspects of the cognitive disabilities associated with FXS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Turner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Fombonne, 2006</xref>). No mechanism-based therapeutics exist for the condition’s cognitive component, although aspects of the FXS phenotype are treated symptomatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hagerman and Hagerman, 2002</xref>). The <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) mouse model is widely used for investigations into neurobiological defects underlying cognitive and behavioral abnormalities in FXS. The studies describing disturbances in neuronal biochemistry, circuitry, and cellular phenotypes in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs have exploded in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Pfeiffer and Huber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bhakar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gross et al., 2012</xref>), but progress in developing treatment strategies for cognitive disabilities in FXS is still limited. Recent work has, however, identified synaptic defects in the hippocampus that are plausibly related to the disorder’s characteristic learning problems. Although baseline synaptic transmission is not significantly disturbed in the mutants, long-term potentiation (LTP), an effect intimately related to the encoding of many forms of memory, is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). For hippocampal field CA1, the pertinent defects involve an increase in the amount of stimulation needed to induce LTP and some of the complex signaling cascades that stabilize the potentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lauterborn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chen et al., 2010c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Seese et al., 2012</xref>). These observations describe potential targets for mechanism-based treatment strategies.</p>
<p id="P3">Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a releasable neurotrophin that plays a central role in the production of hippocampal LTP and in the formation of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Mizuno et al., 2000</xref>). Acting through synaptic TrkB receptors, BDNF promotes signaling that regulates the assembly and stabilization of subsynaptic actin networks, a process required for LTP consolidation. Multiple studies have shown that learning activates TrkB and LTP-related actin management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bramham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Chen et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bekinschtein et al., 2014</xref>). Up-regulating the neurotrophin with semi-chronic treatment with a positive AMPA receptor modulator (ampakine) rescues synaptic plasticity and learning in rodent models of cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Rex et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Simmons et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Baudry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Kramar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lauterborn et al., 2016</xref>). Other studies have suggested that modulating TrkB signaling reduces abnormalities in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Osterweil et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Louhivuori et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Uutela et al., 2012</xref>). Along these lines, infused BDNF restores LTP in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lauterborn et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, <italic>in vivo</italic> activation of TrkB with a selective agonist has been reported to rescue learning in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Tian et al., 2015</xref>) and decreasing BDNF expression in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs has been shown to induce a robust impairment in contextual fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Uutela et al., 2012</xref>). These earlier studies employed behavioral paradigms that rely on an animal’s ability to avoid stressful and anxiety-provoking circumstances. <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs exhibit increased anxiety-like behaviors and are particularly sensitive to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kazdoba et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, given the possibility of treatment effects on the stress response, we extended the above studies to test if two alternative strategies leading to increased TrkB activation – systemic treatment with a TrkB agonist or with an ampakine – normalize hippocampus-dependent learning in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs using paradigms that instead rely on rodents’ inherent preference for novelty. Additionally, it is noteworthy that ampakine effects are somewhat more naturalistic in that they rely on increased BDNF expression and thus increased TrkB signaling specifically within regions engaged during learning.</p>
<p id="P4">Previous work has demonstrated that <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs have a robust impairment in object location memory (OLM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Seese et al., 2014b</xref>), a simple form of spatial learning that relies on the preference for novelty and is dependent on hippocampal field CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Haettig et al., 2011</xref>). This deficiency in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs was associated with a failure of training to activate the TrkB effector ERK1/2 at hippocampal synapses, a response that is pronounced in wild type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Seese et al., 2014b</xref>). ERK1/2 contributes to the dynamic modification of both actin- and microtubule-based cytoskeletal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Sanchez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Harrison and Turley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cosen-Binker and Kapus, 2006</xref>) and, as expected from this, plays a prominent role in the stabilization of LTP. We accordingly tested for the effects of TrkB signaling up-regulation on activation of the kinase at hippocampal synapses in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p id="P5">Adult (3 to 5-month-old) male <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice on the FVB/129 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Irwin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Seese et al., 2012</xref>) and age-, sex-, and background-matched wild type (WT) mice were group housed with littermates (2–5 mice per cage) in rooms maintained at 22 °C and 55% humidity on a 12-hours-on/12-hours-off light cycle and with food and water available ad libitum. Experiments were performed on the animal’s light cycle and in accordance with National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and protocols approved by the University of California, Irvine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>

<title>Slice electrophysiology</title>
<p id="P6">Adult (3–4 months of age) male <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO and WT FVB/129 mice were used for extracellular field recordings from acute hippocampal slices. Transverse 360-μm thick slices were prepared from the middle third of hippocampus and were promptly transferred to an interface recording chamber maintained at 31 ± 1 °C with a constant 60–70 ml/h infusion of oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing 124 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM dextrose. Experiments began 1.5 h after slice preparation. To monitor responses to stimulation of the Schaffer-commissural projection from field CA3 to field CA1, a bipolar stimulating electrode was placed in CA1a or CA1c stratum radiatum, and a glass pipette electrode filled with 2 M NaCl was placed in CA1b stratum radiatum; both electrodes were placed equidistant from the pyramidal cell layer. For baseline recordings, stimulation was applied at 0.05 Hz with pulses that were set to elicit field EPSPs (fEPSPs) that were 50% of the maximum pop-spike free response. The responses were collected using NAC Gather 2.0 software (Theta Burst Corp., Irvine, CA, USA).</p>
<p id="P7">For studies of LTP, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF; 1 μM; Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Tokyo, Japan) or vehicle was infused for 30 min prior to induction of LTP, which was done by using a single short train of theta burst stimulation (TBS: 5 bursts of four pulses at 100 Hz, with 200 ms between bursts, at baseline stimulation intensity). After TBS, low frequency (0.05 Hz) stimulation was resumed and responses were collected for 60 min. To assess the level of LTP, the mean fEPSP response during the last 5 min of recordings was compared to the mean response during the last 5 min of baseline recordings.</p>
<p id="P8">The 7,8-DHF was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted so that DMSO was at &lt; 0.001% in the aCSF bath.</p>

<title>Object recognition and object location memory tasks</title>
<p id="P9">Behavioral analyses were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Stefanko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Haettig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Seese et al., 2014b</xref>). Briefly, animals were handled for 2 min daily for 5 days and then habituated to a white chamber measuring 24 × 30 × 30 cm and containing sawdust bedding for 5 min daily for 5 days. On the following day, mice were subjected to a 5-min training episode in which they were placed in an experimental chamber containing two identical 100 ml glass beakers placed in two corners along the same wall, approximately 1 in. from the perimeter.</p>
<p id="P10">Mice were then tested for either OLM or object recognition memory (ORM). For OLM testing, this involved a 5-min retention trial 1 day after the training trial. One beaker remained in the original training location and one was moved towards the center of the apparatus. For ORM testing, one beaker was replaced with a novel object; both objects remained in the same positions as the objects in the training trial. Animals were video recorded and tracked with ANY-Maze software (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA).</p>
<p id="P11">Videos were scored offline by raters blind to genotype and experimental group. Mice were scored as interacting with an object when they were sniffing and their nose touched or was within 0.5 cm of the object. Interaction was not scored when the animal was within this radius while grooming or digging or if the animal fell within this zone when turning. Total exploration time was quantified as the time interacting with both objects. A discrimination index was calculated as (t<sub>novel</sub> – t<sub>familiar</sub>)/(t<sub>novel</sub> + t<sub>familiar</sub>) x 100. “Familiar” refers to the object that was in the same location during training or the object that remained identical in the training and testing sessions. “Novel” refers to the object that was moved to the new location (OLM) or the object that was replaced (ORM). Thus, a positive discrimination index represents a preference for the new location or new object. Total distance traveled was calculated using ANY-Maze.</p>

<title>Social approach and recognition tasks</title>
<p id="P12">The social approach task was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, behaviorally naïve wild type C57BL/6 mice, to be used as ‘targets’, were habituated to the inside of inverted wire mesh cups for 10 min at a time until they no longer urinated or defecated. Experimental mice (FVB/129 background) were then habituated to the room (60 min), the center chamber of the three-chambered apparatus (10 min), and then all three chambers (10 min). Following habituation, experimental animals were placed in the three-chambered apparatus for 10 min, with one chamber containing an empty inverted cup and the other chamber containing a target mouse inside the inverted cup (“social approach”). To assess “social recognition”, experimental mice were removed from the chamber and then 5 min later, they were reintroduced to the arena for a total of 10 min, with one chamber containing (under the cup) the familiar target mouse from the social approach task and the other chamber containing (under the cup) a novel C57BL/6 WT target mouse.</p>
<p id="P13">Videos were recorded and then scored by raters blind to genotype. Exploration was defined as time in seconds that the experimental mouse was sniffing or directly facing the mouse inside the cup. A discrimination index for the social approach task was calculated as (t<sub>mouse</sub> − t<sub>object</sub>)/(t<sub>mouse</sub> + t<sub>object</sub>) × 100, and a discrimination index for the social recognition task was similarly calculated as (t<sub>novel</sub> − t<sub>familiar</sub>)/(t<sub>novel</sub> + t<sub>familiar</sub>) × 100.</p>

<title>In vivo drug administration</title>
<p id="P14">The TrkB agonist 7,8-DHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Jang et al., 2010</xref>) was dissolved in 100% DMSO before 0.1 M sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added to reach a diluted solution of 17.5% DMSO at a final concentration of 0.67 mg/ml 7,8-DHF. Animals received twice daily (9 am and 4 pm) intraperitoneal (IP) injections of sterile saline (2 days), 17.5% DMSO (4 days), and then either 17.5% DMSO or 7,8-DHF (5 mg/kg; 4 days). The first of these injections corresponded with the first day of handling. An episode of handling or habituation followed each injection. A final 7,8-DHF injection was given 1 h before training. For acute injection studies, mice were injected once daily with sterile saline (2 days), 17.5% DMSO (4 days), and then either 17.5% DMSO or 7,8-DHF (5 mg/kg; 1 day). The first of these injections corresponded with the fifth day of handling such that 7,8-DHF was injected 1 h prior to the training episode. We chose this time point and dose based on prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Jang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Andero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Devi and Ohno, 2012</xref>). In some experiments, 7,8-DHF was given in the drinking water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>). To do so, 7,8-DHF was dissolved in DMSO to generate a stock solution of 50 mg/ml, and 160 μl of this stock was added to every 100 ml of tap water containing 1% sucrose. Mice were provided this 7,8-DHF solution or vehicle (1% sucrose in tap water) continuously for 1 month prior to training. Drinking bottles containing these solutions were replaced every 3–4 days. Because animals were group housed, the total volume of water containing 7,8-DHF consumed by each animal could not be directly measured.</p>
<p id="P15">The ampakine CX929 was prepared as a stock solution at 7.5 mg/ml in sterile 30% cyclodextrin (CDX) before being diluted with sterile 0.9% sodium chloride to a working concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in 10% CDX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Simmons et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Baudry et al., 2012</xref>). In some studies, animals were given two daily (9 am and 4 pm) IP injections containing equivalent volumes of sterile saline (first 2 days), 10% CDX (next 4 days), and then either 10% CDX or CX929 (5 mg/kg; next 4 days) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Rex et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Simmons et al., 2011</xref>). The beginning of these injections corresponded with the first day of handling such that the final injection occurred on the afternoon of the fifth day of habituation (e.g., approximately 17 h prior to training). In another set of experiments, mice were given once daily IP injections of sterile saline (2 days), 10% CDX (4 days), and then either 10% CDX or CX929 (5 mg/kg; 1 day). This dose of CX929 was chosen as it has been shown to increase BDNF and promote learning in other rodent models of neurocognitive and neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Rex et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Simmons et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Baudry et al., 2012</xref>). The beginning of these injections corresponded with the fifth day of handling such that CX929 was injected 15 min prior to the training episode.</p>
<p id="P16">The metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) antagonist 2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP; gift of FRAXA, Newburyport, MA, USA) was dissolved in sterile saline to a final concentration of 2.5mg/ml. Mice were given once daily IP injections with saline (4 days) and then with saline or MPEP (5mg/kg; 1 day). The first injection corresponded with the second day of habituation and the final injection containing MPEP was administered 30min before training. This dose and protocol were selected based on prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Seese et al., 2014a</xref>).</p>

<title>Tissue collection and immunohistochemistry</title>
<p id="P17">Mice were euthanized 2 min after a 5-min training episode with deep isoflurane anesthesia followed by decapitation. Brains were harvested, cryostat sectioned (20 μm, coronal), and fixed in −20 °C methanol as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Seese et al., 2012</xref>). After being air dried, the tissue was incubated (48 h at room temperature) in a primary antisera cocktail containing mouse anti-PSD95 (1:1000; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and with either rabbit anti-phosphorylated (p-) TrkB Y515 (1:250; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) or p-ERK1/2 Thr202/Tyr204 (1:500; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA). We specifically analyzed the Y515 site of TrkB, as this TrkB phosphorylation site promotes ERK1/2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Minichiello, 2009</xref>), which is dysregulated in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Price et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Michalon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Seese et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Osterweil et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Seese et al., 2014b</xref>). Slides were rinsed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) and then incubated with donkey anti-mouse IgG and donkey anti-rabbit IgG tagged with AlexaFluor 488 and 594, respectively (each 1:1000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), for 1 h. The diluent for both primary and secondary cocktails included 4% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PB. Following the second incubation, slides were washed in PB, air dried, and cover slipped using Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).</p>

<title>Fluorescence deconvolution tomography</title>
<p id="P18">Using a Leica DM6000 epifluorescence microscope, a 63× oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.4), and an ORCA-ER camera (Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan), digital image z-stacks were collected through 3 μm (0.2 μm steps) for 136 × 105 μm sample fields that were centered on stratum radiatum of hippocampal field CA1. For each section, 2–3 z-stacks were collected and processed for restorative deconvolution (Volocity 5.0, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Automated systems were used to normalize background fluorescence intensity, construct three-dimensional (3D) montages of each 42,840 μm<sup>3</sup> sample field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Rex et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Seese et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">2013</xref>), and measure the size, fluorescence intensities, and numbers of each single-and double-labeled element that satisfied the size and eccentricity constraints of synapses. To be included in the analysis, each of the double-labeled elements had to be detected across multiple density thresholds and fully contained within the image z-stack. Elements were classified as double-labeled if there was any overlap in their 3D immunolabeled boundaries as assessed in three dimensions. Counts of double-labeled postsynaptic densities (PSDs; i.e., objects immunoreactive to PSD95) were normalized to the total number of PSD95-immunopositive (+) elements within a given sample field; these normalized values from each z-stack were averaged to obtain a mean value for each brain.</p>
<p id="P19">Data were expressed as frequency distributions for density of immunolabeling for phosphorylated target proteins (TrkB, ERK1/2) co-localized with synapse-sized clusters of PSD95 (% of all doubled-labeled contacts at each density bin in an ascending series). Variability in the skewedness of individual curves within a group was low (i.e., the coefficient of variation was &lt; 10%) and comparable between control (vehicle) and drug-treated groups. We removed one animal with the greatest skew for a single experiment in which these conditions were not met.</p>

The TrkB agonist increased the number of synapse-sized PSD95+ elements that were densely labeled for TrkB phosphorylated at its Y515 auto-activation site in CA1 stratum radiatum of WT mice.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, in slices from WT mice, infusion of the agonist or vehicle had no effect on baseline responses.

As anticipated, the WT mice showed a preference for the novel location object in the retention trial (previous vehicle group: 22.9 ± 3.1; previous CX929 group: 20.3 ± 6.2). In contrast, <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice previously treated with either chronic CX929 or vehicle showed no preference for the novel location object on retention testing (Bonferroni post-test, WT CX929 vs. KO CX929, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Specifically, there was a robust difference between genotypes (two-way ANOVA: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,18</sub> = 37.07, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), no interaction between genotype and treatment (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,18</sub> = 0.01, <italic>P</italic> = .91), and no effect of treatment (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,18</sub> = 0.42, <italic>P</italic> = .52). Thus, while the facilitation of learning with a 4-day period of CX929 treatment extends beyond the drug’s immediate modulation of AMPA receptors, the benefit of ampakine treatment dissipated by 2 weeks following treatment cessation.</p>
<p id="P35">In the above studies, WT mice that received CX929 did not perform better than WTs that received vehicle, at least when given training that is otherwise sufficient for their learning. However, it is possible that treatments that facilitate TrkB signaling might lower the threshold for learning in WTs. Therefore, we tested if semi-chronic CX929 treatment facilitates object location learning in WT mice given a 3-min long training session that is otherwise insufficient for enduring OLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Haettig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Seese et al., 2014b</xref>). Adult WT mice were injected with CX929 twice daily for 4 days, with the last dose administered approximately 17 h prior to a 3 min training trial. Mice that received the ampakine performed significantly better than those pretreated with vehicle (10% CDX) on the retention trial performed 1 day later (Student’s t-test: <italic>P</italic> = .005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). This facilitation of learning object location was not associated with ampakine effects on object exploration times during either the training (Student’s t-test: <italic>P</italic> = .46) or retention trials (Student’s t-test: <italic>P</italic> = .30; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>).</p>

<title>Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonism does not rescue Fmr1 KO OLM</title>
<p id="P36">Antagonism of mGluR5 using MPEP normalizes a number of abnormalities in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs, including spine morphology, mGluR-driven long-term depression, seizure threshold, and other behavioral phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Krueger and Bear, 2011</xref>). To determine if mGluR5 antagonism normalizes OLM, <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO and WT mice were given IP injections of saline or 5 mg/kg MPEP 30 min before a 5-min OLM training trial and tested for retention 1 day later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Discrimination indices for KOs treated with MPEP were not different than for those treated with vehicle (two-way ANOVA: genotype, <italic>F</italic><sub>1,32</sub> = 29.16, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001; treatment, <italic>F</italic><sub>1,32</sub> = 0.21, <italic>P</italic> = .65; genotype x treatment, <italic>F</italic><sub>1,32</sub> = 0.59, <italic>P</italic> = .45) and were significantly smaller than those for WTs treated with MPEP (Bonferroni post-test: MPEP-treated WT vs. KO, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>).

<title>AMPAR modulation rescues social recognition in Fmr1 KOs</title>
<p id="P37">Finally, we tested if the pharmacological manipulations that restored memory in the above paradigms also influence the social recognition abnormalities that characterize FXS and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs. Mice were tested in the three-chambered social approach and recognition paradigm described by Crawley and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). The social approach test involves a choice between sampling, within chamber A, an empty inverted wire mesh cup versus, within chamber B, an identical cup containing a novel target mouse; after a 5 min delay, this is followed by a social recognition test in which the animal is exposed to the previously encountered mouse in chamber A vs. a novel mouse in chamber B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). Prior studies found that WT but not <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice have a strong preference for the novel mouse in the recognition test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Budimirovic and Kaufmann, 2011</xref>). We first evaluated the total time spent exploring the two choices, a measure that would be sensitive to arousal level and overall locomotion. The total time spent exploring the two choices was not detectably different for <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs treated with vehicle as compared to treatment with 7,8-DHF or CX929 during both approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>) and recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>) phases of testing; this was the case for both acute and semi-chronic treatment schedules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">C</xref>). <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs treated with vehicle showed a strong preference for exploration of the target mouse (vs. empty cup) in the approach phase of the task and this was unaffected by treatment with 7,8-DHF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>, left). Across groups, the mutants spent 6 to 8 times more time exploring the mouse than the empty cup (<italic>P</italic> values ranged from 0.002 to 0.00001 in paired <italic>t</italic>-tests). In the social recognition test, the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs given vehicle did not exhibit preferential exploration of the novel vs. familiar mouse (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .20, paired t-tests), as expected from earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Budimirovic and Kaufmann, 2011</xref>). In contrast, KOs given either acute or semi-chronic treatment with 7,8-DHF spent considerably more time investigating the novel mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>, right; <italic>P</italic> = .021 and 0.002 vs. vehicle, respectively). In a second study of KOs given ampakine or vehicle treatment, the acute and semi-chronic vehicle groups again had high discrimination indices for the approach phase of the task. These were associated with robust differences between the total exploration times of the target mouse and empty cup (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .00001 in both groups). During the recognition phase, the vehicle-treated KOs demonstrated no evident preference for the novel mouse. Ampakine treatment did not influence the otherwise high discrimination indices of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs in the approach phase of the task, whereas semi-chronic, but not acute, treatment with CX929 rescued social recognition, increasing the discrimination index to levels seen in the approach phase (acute: <italic>P</italic> &gt; .30; semi-chronic: <italic>P</italic> &lt; .00001 vs. vehicle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7E</xref>). In all, stimulation of TrkB receptors directly with the agonist 7,8-DHF or indirectly via ampakine treatment and associated increases in BDNF levels had a normalizing effect on the response to social novelty in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P38">The present studies show that enhanced TrkB signaling lowers the learning threshold in WTs and restores long-term potentiation as well as two forms of otherwise impaired learning in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, a model for the most common form of inherited intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hagerman and Hagerman, 2002</xref>). Specifically, the TrkB agonist 7,8-DHF and the ampakine CX929 both promoted long-term memory. Moreover, training-associated signaling known to be impaired in the KOs – namely, synaptic ERK1/2 activation – was enhanced following semi-chronic ampakine administration.</p>
<p id="P39">As demonstrated previously for other models of cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Simmons et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Baudry et al., 2012</xref>), we show here that a semi-chronic ampakine treatment regimen known to increase endogenous BDNF protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Rex et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Lauterborn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Simmons et al., 2009</xref>) rescued memory encoding in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs. Additionally, we show that ampakine treatment reduced the previously established threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Stefanko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Seese et al., 2014b</xref>) for encoding simple spatial memory in WT mice. This result aligns with slice electrophysiology results showing that ampakines lower the induction threshold and increase the magnitude of LTP in rat hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Lynch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Lynch and Gall, 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, effects of acute ampakine treatment were not sufficient to rescue either OLM or social recognition, indicating that second-order actions of positive AMPA receptor modulation, such as changes in gene expression, underlie the efficacy of treatment.</p>
<p id="P40">How might increasing endogenous BDNF with an ampakine or increasing signaling through the TrkB receptor with an agonist alter learning thresholds (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>)? LTP requires reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Krucker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kramar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Rex et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">2010</xref>), and stabilization of filamentous actin has been implicated in different forms of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Fedulov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cox et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Rudy, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Lamprecht, 2016</xref>). Along these lines, hippocampus-dependent learning induces robust TrkB signaling at hippocampal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Chen et al., 2010b</xref>). Prior studies demonstrated that activity-induced signaling leading to new filamentous actin is not impaired in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lauterborn et al., 2007</xref>), a feature that distinguishes these mice from other rodent models of cognitive disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Simmons et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Baudry et al., 2012</xref>). We show here that semi-chronic ampakine treatment significantly enables training-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, a kinase downstream of TrkB Y515 phosphorylation that contributes to actin stabilization through phosphorylating actincrosslinking proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Kruchten et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Seese et al., 2012</xref>). Synaptic ERK1/2 is hyper-phosphorylated in the mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Price et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Michalon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Seese et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Osterweil et al., 2013</xref>), an effect that is associated with multiple measures of kinase dysfunction, including a lack of responsiveness to synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Seese et al., 2012</xref>) and training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Seese et al., 2014b</xref>) as well as impaired associations with upstream (Ras and protein phosphatase 2A) and downstream (cortactin) substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Seese et al., 2012</xref> and unpublished results). Further increasing phosphorylation of this kinase to offer therapeutic benefits seems counterintuitive in these conditions. However, the ERK1/2 measurements in the present study were collected after several daily ampakine treatments and so reflect an extended period over which BDNF levels and TrkB signaling were increased. The neurotrophin activates multiple small GTPase-initiated pathways and downstream effectors leading to rapid structural modifications to synapses and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Minichiello, 2009</xref>). While these processes are expected to have been influenced in ampakine-treated KOs, we propose that the combination of events results in a more normal baseline ERK1/2 activity prior to learning. This could allow for successful, task-specific regulation of cytoskeletal events (e.g., cortactin phosphorylation and actin network stabilization) critical for memory encoding that are otherwise impaired in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chen et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Seese et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p id="P41">The present results build on existing literature implicating ERK1/2 as a therapeutic target in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs. ERK1/2 inhibition normalizes excessive protein synthesis and abolishes audiogenic seizures in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Osterweil et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Spaced training both rescues topographic increases in synaptic phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels in hippocampal field CA1 of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs and restores long-term memory in an ERK1/2-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Seese et al., 2014b</xref>). Interestingly, in the BTBR <italic>T(+) Itpr3(tf)</italic>/J mouse model of autism spectrum disorders, increased synaptic ERK1/2 phosphorylation in hippocampal field CA1 successfully predicted the subset of animals with poorer OLM performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Seese et al., 2014a</xref>). With high-throughput fluorescence deconvolution tomography, we confirmed here that in vivo CX929 decreases <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO object location learning threshold while promoting activation of ERK1/2 within synapses of the same region. Although other studies have demonstrated that the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP normalizes many aspects of the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Krueger and Bear, 2011</xref>), the present results show that mGluR5 antagonism does not exert the same potent effects as does promoting TrkB signaling in restoring hippocampus-dependent learning in the mutants.</p>
<p id="P42">Evidence that the TrkB agonist 7,8-DHF facilitated long-term memory in all paradigms tested supports the hypothesis that CX929’s therapeutic effects involve enhanced TrkB signaling. This aligns with a rapidly growing literature demonstrating that 7,8-DHF rescues many cognitive functions in different models of intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Devi and Ohno, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Zeng et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">2012b</xref>). Importantly, Tian and colleagues showed that 7,8-DHF promotes fear conditioning and performance in the Morris water maze in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Tian et al., 2015</xref>) and Uutela and colleagues demonstrated that decreasing BDNF expression in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs induces a significant impairment in contextual fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Uutela et al., 2012</xref>). To build on this work, we confirmed the compound’s utility in less anxiety-provoking tasks while also demonstrating the compound’s efficacy through oral administration, a paradigm that may be more clinically relevant. One surprising result in our study was that KOs that received 7,8-DHF performed even better than treated WTs on ORM, a task that depends on cortical regions for retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Balderas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Haettig et al., 2011</xref>). Further studies are needed to test if there are regional differences in TrkB expression or activation following learning and if these differences are affected by genotype. However, one clue to help explain this effect of genotype comes from work showing that pilocarpine-induced seizures increases BDNF mRNA in the proximal dendrites of layer V cortical neurons significantly more in KOs than in WTs, while the degree of increase of BDNF mRNA in hippocampal proximal dendrites is not different between the genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Louhivuori et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that learning-induced BDNF increases may be more pronounced in KO cortex than in WT cortex, resulting in more robust ORM once exogenous 7,8-DHF activates a baseline amount of required TrkB receptors. Nonetheless, our observations further support the conclusion that BDNF signaling enhancement leading to cytoskeletal modifications produces cognitive improvement in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs. Future studies can test this hypothesis more directly by assessing effects of 7,8-DHF on OLM in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs when actin dynamics have been disrupted by infusion of local treatments with agents that specifically target actin assembly and/or stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Rex et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p id="P43">Notably, results for the two TrkB-related treatments on a social recognition test in which <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs are markedly different from wild types paralleled those for object location learning: acute 7,8-DHF or semi-chronic CX929 treatment increased the extent to which the mutants interacted with a novel mouse. These effects could not be ascribed to global changes in behavior because the compounds did not noticeably influence the total time exploring the choices in either phase of testing. Our findings do not address the question of whether the positive actions of the drugs reflect enhanced discrimination between a familiar and a stranger mouse or instead are due to normalization of the response to social novelty. One interesting possibility as to how increasing TrkB signaling produces the shift towards the WT behavior is that the KOs may have problems rapidly familiarizing themselves with a stranger and so do not spend the greater part of their time interacting with this stranger when given the choice between a recently encountered mouse and a novel one. Enhanced BDNF signaling could, via actions like those underlying its effects on spatial learning, enable a more effective and rewarding encoding of a novel, complex encounter.</p>
<p id="P44">The beneficial effects of up-regulating TrkB signaling may come hand-in-hand with adverse effects. A third of FXS patients exhibit some degree of seizure disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hagerman and Stafstrom, 2009</xref>), <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs exhibit increased audiogenic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Yan et al., 2005</xref>), and BDNF is reported to promote seizures in the epileptic brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Binder et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Heinrich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">McNamara and Scharfman, 2012</xref>). Moreover, the potential contributions of BDNF signaling to epilepsy in FXS is complicated by the fact that different TrkB phosphorylation sites normally promote different seizure-related processes. Phosphorylation of TrkB residue Y515 promotes recruitment of Shc to TrkB and ultimately protects against status epilepticus-induced hippocampal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Phosphorylation of TrkB residue Y816, on the other hand, promotes the receptor’s association with PLC-γ1, and disrupting this association prevents the development of epilepsy following seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gu et al., 2015</xref>). Whether pharmacological up-regulation of BDNF production or signaling with either CX929 or 7,8-DHF promotes seizures in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs is an unresolved issue. We did not observe evidence for such an effect in the sizable number of mice tested in the present studies or with rats and mice in prior studies using CX929 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Rex et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Simmons et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Baudry et al., 2012</xref>). Further studies will need to directly test the effects of these compounds on the TrkB Y816 phosphorylation site in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs.</p>
<p id="P45">Decreasing BDNF expression in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice has been demonstrated to ameliorate many phenotypes in the mouse model, including locomotor hyperactivity and rotarod-based motor coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Uutela et al., 2012</xref>). Given that the present studies used treatments that increase TrkB signaling, we tested if either compound influenced the total distance traveled or interaction with objects during the behavioral trials (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). We observed no significant effects of treatment on these measures, during training or retention trials, for 7,8-DHF or CX929. However, further in-depth examination of these issues is warranted and should be conducted in conjunction with conventional preclinical toxicology. Limitations aside, the results presented here suggest strong translatable approaches for the treatment of cognitive and social impairments in FXS and possibly other neurodevelopmental disabilities.</p>

<p id="P65">Phosphorylation of TrkB at Y515 promotes synaptic signaling that modifies the actin cytoskeleton and promotes memory.</p>
<p id="P66">This report tests the effects of two compounds in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice: 7,8-DHF and CX929. 7,8-DHF is a small molecular agonist of the TrkB receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Jang et al., 2010</xref>) and CX929 has been demonstrated to increase endogenous BDNF, TrkB’s major ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Simmons et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Simmons et al., 2011</xref>). The TrkB receptor is phosphorylated at many different residues, including Y515, Y816, and Y490. The Y515 site has been demonstrated to be crucial for activation of the canonical Ras-ERK1/2 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Minichiello, 2009</xref>). ERK1/2, in turn, has many effectors, many of which are related to the modification of the actin cytoskeleton. One of these effectors is cortactin, which plays an important role in stabilization of actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Sanchez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Harrison and Turley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cosen-Binker and Kapus, 2006</xref>). Actin dynamics are crucial for both LTP and many different forms of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Krucker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kramar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Fedulov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Rex et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cox et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Rudy, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Lamprecht, 2016</xref>).</p>
