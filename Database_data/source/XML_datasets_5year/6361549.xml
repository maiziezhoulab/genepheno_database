<p id="P4">Nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCOR1) and NCOR2 (also known as SMRT) regulate gene expression by activating histone deacetylase 3 through their Deacetylase Activation Domain (DAD). We show that mice with DAD knock-in mutations have memory deficits, reduced anxiety levels, and reduced social interactions. Mice with NCOR1/2 depletion specifically in GABAergic neurons (NS-V mice) recapitulated the memory deficits and had reduced GABRA2 expression in lateral hypothalamus GABAergic neurons (LH<sup>GABA</sup>). This was associated with LH<sup>GABA</sup> neuron hyperexcitability and impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation, through a monosynaptic LH<sup>GABA</sup> to CA3<sup>GABA</sup> projection. Optogenetic activation of this projection caused memory deficits, while targeted manipulation of LH<sup>GABA</sup> or CA3<sup>GABA</sup> neuron activity reversed memory deficits in NS-V mice. We describe <italic>de novo</italic> variants in <italic>NCOR1, NCOR2</italic> or <italic>HDAC3</italic> in patients with intellectual disability or neurodevelopmental defects. These findings identify a hypothalamus–hippocampus projection that may link endocrine signals with synaptic plasticity through NCOR-mediated regulation of GABA signaling.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="P5">Regulation of gene expression is a key component of intracellular signaling and confers long-lasting effects that are particularly relevant to the memory formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Many endocrine factors use nuclear receptors (NRs) to regulate gene expression. NRs recruit nuclear receptor coactivators (NCOAs) or nuclear receptor corepressor (NCORs) in a ligand-dependent manner, which alters epigenome modifications such as histone acetylation, remodels chromatin architecture, and regulates gene transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. NCOR1 and its homolog NCOR2 (also known as SMRT, silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors) are the fundamental scaffold proteins of the NCOR corepressor complex in mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. NCORs regulate gene expression by recruiting and activating histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P6">Our previous work has elucidated the metabolic functions of NCORs and HDAC3 in multiple tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. NCORs have been shown to interact with methylated CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) that binds methylated DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Mutations in the human <italic>MECP2</italic> gene are known to cause Rett syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, developmental regression, autism spectrum disorders, seizures, and acquired microcephaly. It was shown that MeCP2 missense mutations affecting MeCP2-NCORs interactions can cause Rett syndrome-like phenotype in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. NCORs can also form a stable protein complex with transducin beta like 1 X-linked receptor 1 (TBL1XR1 or TBLR1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, another protein that is associated with neurocognitive disorders presenting with variable phenotypes including autism, intellectual disability, and multiple congenital anomalies in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, whether and how NCORs regulate cognitive functions has not been directly studied.</p>

<title>Disruption of NCORs function by NS-DADm mutations causes cognitive deficits</title>
<p id="P7">NCORs regulate gene expression by recruiting and activating histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The Deacetylase Activation Domain (DAD) on the N-terminal region of NCORs is responsible for activating HDAC3 enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>). HDAC3 can be inactivated both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> by missense mutations in either DAD or HDAC3 that abolishes the DAD-HDAC3 interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Conversely, HDAC3 is the only HDAC that confers deacetylase enzymatic activity to the NCOR complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Therefore, inactivating HDAC3 renders the NCOR complex deficient in the deacetylase activity. We have previously constructed an NS-DADm whole-body knock-in mouse model that contains NCOR1-Y478A and NCOR2-Y470A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. NS-DADm mice do not have HDAC3 enzymatic activity but display normal development and appearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P8">In the whole-body knock-in NS-DADm mouse line, HDAC3 enzyme activity was undetectable in all brain regions tested, including cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>). The interaction between HDAC3 and NCOR or TBLR1 was also reduced in the hypothalamus compared to littermate control (referred to as wild-type, WT), although not completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>). The HDAC1 enzyme activity remained unaltered in the NS-DADm brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S1a</xref>). NS-DADm mice were born at the Mendelian ratio and had slightly lower body weight than WT, with normal brain weight, breathing pattern, hindlimb activity, circadian locomotor activity, and gross histological morphology in various brain regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S1b-i</xref>). Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test revealed a robust deficit in recognition memory in NS-DADm mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1j-k</xref>). This was not confounded by a lack of locomotor activity or more susceptibility to stress during the test, because NS-DADm mice actually showed hyperactivity and less anxiety compared to control in the Open Field test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1f</xref>), Elevated Plus Maze test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1g-h</xref>), and Light-Dark test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1i</xref>). The recognition memory deficit was not associated with defective motor learning, because NS-DADm mice had enhanced motor coordination and motor learning in the Rotarod test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1j</xref>) even when compared with body weight-matched control mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S1d</xref>). Importantly, NS-DADm mice were less interested in social interaction with other animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1k, l</xref>) and displayed spatial memory deficits in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1m-o</xref>). These findings demonstrated that NCOR loss-of-function causes cognitive deficits, which can be independent of general developmental defects.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Depletion of HDAC3 in the LH impairs memory</title>
<p id="P9">To explore which brain regions are susceptible to the loss of HDAC3 enzyme activity in the context of memory deficits, we stereotaxically injected HDAC3<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mice with adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing Cre recombinase from a neuron-specific promoter using AAV-GFP as a control. Depletion of HDAC3 in the hippocampal CA1 region was shown to enhance memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, suggesting that CA1 is unlikely the region mediating the memory deficit due to the loss of HDAC3 enzyme activity. We started with the hippocampus CA3 region. After injecting AAV-Cre into the CA3, we did not find altered learning behaviors or memory deficit in the NOR or MWM tests (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S2a-i</xref>). This suggests that the CA3 region unlikely mediates the memory deficit due to the loss of HDAC3 enzyme activity, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the absence of behavioral changes could be due to non-complete HDAC3 depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S2c</xref>). The lateral hypothalamus is another brain region involved in motivated behaviors. We found that depletion of HDAC3 at the lateral hypothalamus resulted in robust memory deficit in both NOR and MWM tests (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S2j-r</xref>), suggesting that the NCOR/HDAC3 function in the lateral hypothalamus is required for learning and memory. These findings do not exclude the possibility that other brain regions could also be important in the memory deficit in NS-DADm mice, especially considering that NS-DADm mice were deficient in the HDAC3 enzyme activity while HDAC3 regional knockout mice had disrupted HDAC3 protein levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Downregulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits in the NS-DADm hypothalamus</title>
<p id="P10">To address how NCORs regulate gene expression in the hypothalamus, we performed RNA-seq analysis using total RNAs extracted from the hypothalamus of NS-DADm and their WT littermates. There were more genes downregulated than upregulated in NS-DADm compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>). The differentially expressed genes were highly enriched in pathways involved in synapse function and cell junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b</xref>), with multiple GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits downregulated in NS-DADm compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref>). The downregulation of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors was further confirmed by RT-qPCR and immunostaining using antibodies against α2 subunit (<italic>GABRA2</italic>) in the NS-DADm hypothalamus, especially in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2d-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S3a</xref>). HDAC3 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed several possible HDAC3 binding sites at the genes of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. ChIP-qPCR analysis further confirmed that HDAC3 indeed bound to those regions and the binding intensity was lower in NS-DADm mice compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2f</xref>). The residual binding in NS-DADm mice was presumably due to the interaction of HDAC3 with the NCORs C-terminal region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Of note, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors gene expression remained unaltered in the NS-DADm hippocampus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S3b-c</xref>), suggesting that NCORs-mediated transcription regulation is highly region-specific. To address the functional significance of NCORs-mediated regulation of GABA signaling, we used diazepam, a positive modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, at a dosage lower than what was commonly shown to be amnesic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Diazepam rescued the recognition memory deficit of NS-DADm mice in the NOR test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2g</xref>), suggesting a causative role of disrupted GABA signaling in the memory deficit of NS-DADm mice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>GABA neuron-specific depletion of NCORs impairs memory</title>
<p id="P11">We found that <italic>NCOR1</italic> was ubiquitously expressed across different brain regions, including those that are highly populated with GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S3d</xref>). To address the function of NCORs specifically in GABAergic neurons, we crossbred NCOR1<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>, NCOR2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> with Vgat-Cre mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> that expresses Cre recombinase only in GABAergic neurons. The NCOR1<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>/NCOR2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>/Vgat-Cre (NS-V) mice were born at the Mendelian ratio and showed no obvious abnormality from littermates NCOR1<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>/NCOR2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> or Vgat-Cre controls (referred as wild-type, WT). <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization confirmed deletion of NCOR1 in GABAergic neurons in multiple brain regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Fig 3e-f</xref>). Unlike NS-DADm mice, NS-V mice maintained normal locomotor activity and anxiety level in the Open Field test and Elevated Plus Maze test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a-b</xref>). However, NS-V mice displayed memory and learning deficits in both the NOR test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c-d</xref>) and the MWM test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3e-g</xref>) to a similar degree as the whole-body knock-in NS-DADm mice, demonstrating that NCORs loss-of-function specifically in GABAergic neurons is sufficient to cause cognitive deficits. These data do not necessarily suggest that NCORs dysfunction in GABAergic neurons fully account for the memory deficit in NS-DADm mice, considering that NCORs have functions other than activation of the HDAC3 enzyme activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S7">
<title>NCORs regulate GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor expression in LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons</title>
<p id="P12">Does the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor downregulation occur in GABAergic neurons? NS-V mice and control Vgat-Cre mice were stereotaxically injected at the LH with AAV expressing a Flag-tagged 60S ribosomal protein L10a (Rpl10a) using the flip-excision (FLEX) system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> to ensure Cre-dependent expression of Rpl10a-Flag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3h-i</xref>). Subsequent immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibodies enriched ribosome-bound mRNAs that were only expressed in LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3h</xref>). The expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors was downregulated in LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons upon NCORs depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3j</xref>), which confirmed that NCORs regulate expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S8">
<title>NCORs depletion causes LH<sup>GABA</sup> hyperexcitability</title>
<p id="P13">How do NCORs regulate firing activities of GABAergic neurons? After crossbreeding NS-V mice or Vgat-Cre mice (referred to as WT control) with Rosa26-tdTomato mice that express the red fluorescent protein tdTomato in a Cre-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, we used electrophysiology patch clamp to survey tdTomato-labeled GABAergic neurons in different brain regions. LH was the region showing the most prominent change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a-j</xref>). NCORs-depleted LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons displayed higher spontaneous firing rate and more depolarized than control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a-c</xref>), while hippocampal CA3<sup>GABA</sup> neurons showed a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4c</xref>). These results were further confirmed in perforated clamp analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S4a</xref>). The amplitude of mIPSCs was drastically reduced by more than 50% in LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons after NCORs depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4h-i</xref>). As a result, the excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratio in LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons was higher in the absence of NCORs compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4j</xref>). The frequency of mIPSC in LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4g</xref>), suggesting a postsynaptic mechanism for the hyperexcitability in LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons. This could be explained by the lower GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor expression in these neurons.</p>

<title>LH<sup>GABA</sup> sends monosynaptic projections to CA3<sup>GABA</sup></title>
<p id="P14">The concurrence of the LH<sup>GABA</sup> hyperexcitability and the seemingly CA3<sup>GABA</sup> hyperpolarization prompted us to check the neural connection between LH<sup>GABA</sup> and CA3<sup>GABA</sup> using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-mediated anterograde tracing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. WGA travels across the axon terminals and labels downstream neurons. Vgat-Cre/tdTomato mice were stereotaxically injected at LH with adenovirus expressing a WGA-GFP fusion protein in a Cre-dependent manner (Ad-iN/WGA-GFP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a</xref>). Robust co-labeling of WGA-GFP (green) and tdTomato (red) at CA3 demonstrated an anatomical LH<sup>GABA</sup> &gt; CA3<sup>GABA</sup> projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5b-c</xref>). To further characterize the LH<sup>GABA</sup> &gt; CA3<sup>GABA</sup> projection, we used channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-assisted circuit mapping (CRACM). ChR2 is an excitatory light-gated ion channel. Its expression was restricted in LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons by injecting an AAV vector expressing ChR2 in a Cre-dependent manner (AAV-FLEX-hChR2-EYFP) into the LH of Vgat-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5d</xref>). Ad-iN/WGA-GFP was co-injected to label CA3<sup>GABA</sup> neurons that receive LH<sup>GABA</sup> projections. Upon excitation of LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons with blue light shed on the CA3 region, evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs) were detected within 10 ms in GFP-labeled CA3<sup>GABA</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5e-g</xref>). The eIPSCs were insensitive to potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX), but could be blocked by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist bicuculline (Bic) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5e</xref>), suggesting a monosynaptic GABA input from LH to CA3. Similar findings were made in NS-V mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S4b-d</xref>), suggesting that the projection is intact in the NS-V mice. In comparison to CA3<sup>GABA</sup> neurons, CA3<sup>Glutamate</sup> neurons do not receive as many projections from LH<sup>GABA</sup> in WGA-based antegrade tracing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S4e-f</xref>). As a negative control, contralateral CA3 did not show WGA-GFP signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S4g</xref>). In addition, when a GFP-tagged synaptophysin, a synaptic vesicle glycoprotein, was expressed in the LH through injection of Vgat-Cre mice with AAV-FLEX-Synaptophysin-GFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, GFP-labeled neuron axons were observed in CA3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S4h</xref>), further confirming the monosynaptic projections from LH to CA3.

<title>The LH<sup>GABA</sup> to CA3<sup>GABA</sup> projection regulates memory and learning behaviors</title>
<p id="P15">Could the altered excitability in LH<sup>GABA</sup> and CA3<sup>GABA</sup> neurons explain the cognitive deficit in NS-V mice? DREADD (Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) uses engineered G-protein coupled receptors to activate or silence specific neurons in response to clozapine-N-oxide (CNO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. We first used an activating DREADD receptor hM3Dq to address the role of CA3<sup>GABA</sup> in the memory deficit of the NS-V mice. NS-V mice and control Vgat-Cre mice were injected at the CA3 with AAV-FLEX-hM3Dq-mCherry or a control virus AAV-FLEX-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5h</xref>). All mice were subjected to behavior tests after administration of CNO to control for potential direct pharmacological effects of CNO itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. NOR and MWM tests showed that NS-V mice showed improved spatial memory and recognition memory after the DREADD-mediated activation of CA3 neural activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5i-j</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S5a-d</xref>). To specifically activate the LH<sup>GABA</sup>-projecting CA3 neurons, we used an optogenetic approach by expressing ChR2 in LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons in Vgat-Cre mice and shedding blue light at CA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5k</xref>). Such stimulation during the NOR test reduced the discrimination index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5l</xref>), without affecting the total exploration time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S5e</xref>). This finding demonstrates that the targeted activation of the LH<sup>GABA</sup>–CA3 circuit is sufficient to cause memory deficits.</p>
<p id="P16">We then address whether the hyperexcitability of LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons is necessary for the memory deficits in NS-V mice. We used hM4Di, a silencing DREADD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. AAV-FLEX-hM4Di was injected into the LH of the NS-V mice and the control Vgat-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5m-p</xref>). DREADD-mediated suppression of LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons in NS-V mice rescued their spatial memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5m-n</xref>) and recognition memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5o</xref>) without affecting explorative or locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S5f-g</xref>). To further address whether the LH<sup>GABA</sup> -CA3 projection <italic>per se</italic> mediates such effect, we used an enhanced natronomonas halorhodopsin (eNpHR), a suppressing optogenetic receptor. NS-V mice and control Vgat-Cre mice were injected at the LH with AAV-FLEX-eNpHR-EYFP or AAV-FLEX-EYFP, and implanted with an optic fiber at CA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5q</xref>). The NS-V mice showed improved recognition memory in the NOR test when all 4 groups of mice received photosuppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5r</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S5h-i</xref>). The efficient photosuppression of CA3<sup>GABA</sup>-innervating LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons in NS-V mice was validated in patch clamp analysis in brain slices after shedding a yellow light on the CA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5s-t</xref>). LH<sup>GABA</sup> hypoexcitability did not cause memory deficits, suggesting that the relationship between the LH<sup>GABA</sup> excitability and the cognitive function is not linear on different sides of the normal range. These data demonstrated that the LH<sup>GABA</sup> hyperexcitability contributes to the memory deficits in NS-V mice.</p>
<p id="P17">In addition to chemogenetic and optogenetic rescue, we sought to treat the cognitive defects in NS-V mice by pharmaceutical manipulation of LH neurons.

SL651498 did not change total travel distance or exploration time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S5l</xref>).

We found that hippocampal CA3<sup>GABA</sup> neurons in NS-V mice displayed impaired LTP when induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) at the dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6a</xref>). We used DREADD to address whether the hyperexcitability of LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons plays a role in impaired LTP formation in CA3<sup>GABA</sup> neurons. AAV-FLEX-hM4Di was co-injected with Ad-iN/WGA-GFP into the LH of the NS-V mice and the control Vgat-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6b-j</xref>). Administration of CNO silenced the spontaneous firing of LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons in both WT and NS-V to a comparable level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6c</xref>). CNO also abolished the difference of LH<sup>GABA</sup> resting membrane potential between WT and NS-V mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6d</xref>), validating efficient suppression of LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons. Remarkably, CNO completely rescued LTP at LH<sup>GABA</sup>-innervated CA3<sup>GABA</sup> neurons (co-labeled by WGA-GFP and tdTomato) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6e-f</xref>). These data demonstrated that the LH<sup>GABA</sup> hyperexcitability contributes to the impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity in NS-V mice. We then used optogenetics to address the role of the LH<sup>GABA</sup>-CA3<sup>GABA</sup> projection. NS-V mice and control Vgat-Cre mice were injected at the LH with AAV-FLEX-eNpHR-EYFP or AAV-FLEX-EYFP and LTP was measured after shedding yellow light on CA3 in brain slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6g</xref>). Such photosupression rescued LTP at LH<sup>GABA</sup>-innervated CA3<sup>GABA</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6h-i</xref>).

<p id="P19">The changes in AMPA receptors (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors, AMPAR) and NMDA receptors (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, NMDAR) constitute a molecular basis of synaptic plasticity.

Mice were either left untrained (naive) or trained for 3 days to memorize the location of a hidden platform in the MWM test, and were then allowed to rest for a day before recording. Training increased the amplitude of AMPAR-dependent sEPSC in LH<sup>GABA</sup>-innervated CA3<sup>GABA</sup> neurons in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6j-k</xref>), which led to an elevated AMPAR/NMDAR ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S6a</xref>).

Training slightly increased the expression of the GABRA2 in LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S6b-d</xref>). We did not observe obvious changes in firing activities of CA3-innervating LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons (labeled with retrograde beads) in response to MWM training (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig S6e-h</xref>), although a small increase in the mIPSCs amplitude was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6e</xref>). This suggests that learning-induced CA3 plasticity in WT mice is not directly driven by a possible suppression of LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons.

<title>Genetic variants of the NCORs complex in human neurocognitive disorders</title>

<p id="P22">Importantly, we identified subjects carrying deleterious mutations in <italic>NCOR1</italic>, <italic>NCOR2</italic> or <italic>HDAC3</italic> with neurocognitive disorders from the DECIPHER database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, including one individual with a pathogenic deletion, one individual with a pathogenic single nucleotide variant (SNV), and two individuals with likely pathogenic SNVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7a</xref>). For <italic>NCOR1</italic>, a 152 kb heterozygous <italic>de novo</italic> deletion was found in patient #251746, a boy with severe global developmental delay and no language expression. He developed refractory epilepsy before the age of 4 years, severe mental retardation, poor motor coordination, stereotyped hand and head movements (jactatio capitis), and auto-aggressive attitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7a, b</xref>). The deletion removes the last 25 exons of <italic>NCOR1,</italic> which is predicted to result in depletion of the truncated allele through nonsense-mediated decay. The deletion also removes three other genes, <italic>ADORA2B</italic>, <italic>TTC19</italic>, and <italic>ZSWIM7</italic>.

Defects in <italic>TTC19</italic> cause mitochondrial complex III deficiency, nuclear type 2 (MIM: 615157), an autosomal recessive disorder that cannot explain the phenotypes in this patient with a heterozygous deletion. No other known pathogenic deletion was found in this patient. Therefore, we consider that <italic>NCOR1</italic> is the likely contributing gene in patient #251746. A <italic>de novo</italic> heterozygous c.2182+2T&gt;G variant of <italic>NCOR1</italic> was identified in another 8-year old boy with global developmental delay, moderate learning difficulties, autistic spectrum disorder, epilepsy, absences and drop attacks, tip-toe walker, and double incontinence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7a, b</xref>).

<p id="P24">We performed cellular assays to further characterize the human genetic variants.

This is consistent with the HDAC3 crystal structure showing that L266 forms one wall of the catalytic tunnel and is likely important for the substrate to access the active site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Overexpression of WT HDAC3 itself did not increase the total HDAC3 deacetylase activity, in keeping with the previous finding that the endogenous NCORs is a limiting factor for HDAC3 enzyme activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. L266S overexpression reduced the enzyme activity below the baseline, suggesting a dominant negative effect.

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P25">Our results delineated a molecular and circuitry pathway through which NCORs regulate neurocognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6p</xref>). NCORs loss-of-function causes downregulation of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor expression in LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons, leading to hyperexcitability of these inhibitory neurons. Such an E/I imbalance in the hypothalamus inhibits LTP formation in the hippocampus, likely through monosynaptic LH<sup>GABA</sup> &gt; CA3<sup>GABA</sup> projections, which underlies memory deficits caused by NCORs loss-of-function. This model is supported by the following observations. (1) Depletion of NCORs specifically in GABAergic neurons in NS-V mice recapitulated memory deficit observed in the NS-DADm mice and impaired LTP formation in the hippocampal CA3 region. (2) Electrophysiology in NS-V mice identified hyperexcitability in LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons. (3) LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons send monosynaptic projects to CA3<sup>GABA</sup> neurons. (4) Transcriptomic profiling identified GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits as the molecular targets of NCORs in the hypothalamus, and downregulation of GABRA2 in LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons was further confirmed by immunostaining and ribosomal profiling. (5) Targeted activation of the LH<sup>GABA</sup> &gt; CA3<sup>GABA</sup> projection is sufficient to cause memory deficit. (6) Learning behaviors facilitate synaptic plasticity in LH<sup>GABA</sup>-innervated CA3<sup>GABA</sup> neurons in an NCORs-dependent manner. (7) Targeted manipulation of LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons or the LH<sup>GABA</sup> &gt; CA3<sup>GABA</sup> projection rescued LTP in hippocampal CA3 and cognitive deficits in NS-V mice. (8) Targeted manipulation of CA3<sup>GABA</sup> neurons rescued cognitive deficits in NS-V mice. (9) Positive modulators of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor administered in the LH rescued cognitive deficits in NS-V mice. Collectively, these findings delineate a molecular and circuitry mechanism through which NCORs regulate synaptic plasticity and cognitive function.</p>
<p id="P26">Our study established a pivotal role of LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons in memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. LH glutamatergic neurons expressing orexin were previously implicated in regulating memory formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons were less studied in the context of learning and memory. In addition to the direct monosynaptic LH<sup>GABA</sup> to CA3<sup>GABA</sup> projection, it is possible that LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons could affect hippocampal synaptic plasticity indirectly through projections to other brain regions. LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons have been shown to regulate feeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. However, we did not observe abnormal eating behaviors in NS-V mice or NS-DADm mice. It is possible that loss of NCORs in other brain regions compensates for orexigenic effects of LH<sup>GABA</sup> activation. It is also possible that the alteration of LH<sup>GABA</sup> excitability in NS-V or NS-DADm mice is not sufficient to change consummatory behaviors, unlike high-frequency optogenetic stimulation or genetic ablation of the LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons.</p>
<p id="P27">It remains an open question whether LH<sup>GABA</sup> hyperexcitability can fully explain the seemingly hypoexcitability of CA3<sup>GABA</sup> neurons in the NS-V mice. The frequency of IPSCs/EPSCs generally reflects presynaptic inputs, while the amplitude is often attributable to postsynaptic mechanisms. However, synapses are complex and this general principle may not be applicable in all situations. CA3<sup>GABA</sup> neurons likely receive multiple inputs that are integrated in a complex manner that is yet to be fully defined. It is possible that the dysfunction of NCORs in other regions of the brain can also contribute to the cognitive deficits.</p>
<p id="P28">We found that several human patients with genetic variants involving <italic>NCORs</italic> or <italic>HDAC3</italic> show growth abnormalities in multiple systems. This is consistent with the previous findings that NCORs and HDAC3 are essential for development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. However, growth abnormalities were not observed in NS-DADm mice or NS-V mice, except slightly lower body weight in both mouse lines compared to their littermate control. This suggests that the abnormal growth in various systems in human patients is attributable to HDAC3-independent functions of NCORs in cells that are distinct from GABAergic neurons. This further suggests that the function of NCORs in neurocognition can be separated from developmental regulation. Our previous study has demonstrated normal development and survival of NS-DADm mice despite lacking HDAC3 enzymatic acitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, the developmental function of HDAC3 does not require its enzymatic activity, in line with its known deacetylase-independent function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Our circuit mapping study revealed intact LH<sup>GABA</sup> &gt; CA3<sup>GABA</sup> projections in NS-V mice, demonstrating normal anatomy and development of GABAergic neurons in those regions. The memory deficit in NS-DADm mice and NS-V mice can be rescued by small molecule modulators or chemogenetic manipulation in adult mice, indicating that the cognitive dysfunction is not caused by an irreversible anomaly originated from early development. One caveat is that the rescue experiments in the current study were performed acutely, so the long-term reversibility of cognitive deficits remains an open question.</p>
<p id="P29">Several previous studies have nicely demonstrated that HDAC3 can play different or opposite roles in neurocognition. Depletion of HDAC3 in hippocampus CA1 regions facilitated the formation of context memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, while depletion of HDAC3 in forebrain excitatory neurons caused memory deficits in multiple neurobehavioral tests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Transcriptomic changes were also context-dependent. Our RNA-seq showed that expression of Fos, Nr4a1, and Nr4a2 were not changed in the hypothalamus in NS-DADm mice, while Fos and Nr4a2 gene expression were upregulated in hippocampal CA1 after depletion of HDAC3 in CA1 using AAV-Cre injection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In contrast, Fos and Nr4a1 were downregulated after depletion of HDAC3 in forebrain excitatory neurons using the Camk2a-Cre transgenic line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. These findings highlight the heterogeneity of gene expression regulation in the central nervous system.</p>
<p id="P30">The NCOR complex is one of several corepressor complexes that interact with MeCP2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, and thus could partially contribute to MeCP2 function. MeCP2 mutations that either abolish or reinforce interactions with NCORs cause Rett-like phenotype, as nicely demonstrated in mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. These data suggest that the NCOR/HDAC3 complex is required for normal function of MeCP2, although they do not exclude possibilities that these mutations could also affect other aspects of the MeCP2 function such as DNA binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Another recent study clearly showed that MeCP2 is required for maximum HDAC3 genomic recruitment in the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Comparison of our NS-DADm or NS-V mice with MeCP2-KO mice or MeCP2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>/Vgat-Cre mice revealed some overlapping, but yet distinct phenotypes. Both MeCP2-KO mice and NS-DADm exhibit less anxiety, reduced social interaction, and explicit memory deficit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. But unlike MeCP2-KO mice, NS-DADm mice exhibit normal brain weight, normal hindlimb activity, regular breathing, and normal survival for at least a year. Also contrary to the MeCP2-KO mice, NS-DADm mice show hyperactivity, superior locomotor coordination, and better cerebellar learning than control. Neurocognitive functions of both MeCP2 and NCORs can be largely attributed to their function in GABAergic neurons. However, MeCP2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>/Vgat-Cre mice display lower locomotor activity without memory deficit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, while NS-V mice show a robust deficit in explicit memory without changes in total locomotor activity. At the molecular level, transcriptome and cistrome analysis of MeCP2 and NCORs revealed some, but limited, similarities in the hypothalamus. Expression of <italic>GABRA2</italic> is downregulated in both NS-DADm, NS-V, and MeCP2-KO hypothalamus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. However, MeCP2 target genes BDNF and GAD1/2 remain unaltered in the NS-DADm hypothalamus. Although both NCORs and MeCP2 are known as transcription repressors, loss-of-function of either NCORs or MeCP2 causes more genes downregulated than upregulated in the hypothalamus. The molecular basis of such regulation remains elusive in the hypothalamus and further studies are required to delineate the relationship between NCORs and MeCP2 in various brain regions. As far as neuronal activity is concerned, both MeCP2-KO mice and NS-V mice showed neuronal hyperexcitability at certain brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. These findings support excitation/inhibition imbalance as an important factor contributing to cognitive dysfunction and pinpoint the inhibitory GABA signaling as a possible therapeutic target. We attempted treatment in the adult NS-DADm and NS-V mice with small molecule modulators or chemogenetic manipulation and successfully reversed the cognitive and memory deficits, which provided strategic insights for the treatment of NCORs-related neurocognitive disorders in human patients.</p>
<p id="P31">NCORs are fundamental players in the action of many endocrine factors. Hypothalamus is the central nexus of neuroendocrine regulation that governs many basic biological processes through hormones. Our finding thus established a hypothalamic-hippocampal communication that potentially links endocrine signals with synaptic plasticity through NCORs-mediated regulation of GABA signaling.</p>

NCOR1<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>/NCOR2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>/Vgat-Cre (NS-V) mice were generated through crossbreeding. tdTomato<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>/NCOR1<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>/NCOR2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>/Vgat-Cre mice (tdTomato-labeled NS-V mice) were further generated for circuit mapping and electrophysiology studies. All mice were C57BL/6 genetic background. Male mice at the age of 2-6 months were used for all experiments except otherwise noted. Female mice were also used for some of the tests and no sexual dimorphism was observed for the phenotypes of NS-DADm mice or NS-V mice. For NS-DADm mice, wild-type littermates were used as the control and referred to as WT. For the initial characterization of NS-V mice, NCOR1<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>/NCOR2<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mice were used as the control and referred to as WT. For electrophysiology studies, ribosomal profiling, circuit mapping, and chemogenetic experiments involving NS-V mice, Vgat-Cre mice or tdTomato/Vgat-Cre mice served as control and referred to as WT. All tests were repeated at least 2 times. 5 mice were housed in each cage in a 12-12 light-dark (7am - 7pm) facility with free access to water and food. After surgery, mice were housed singly in the same facility. All animals were grouped according to their sex, age, and genotype. Mice with the same sex, age, and genotypes were randomized into different surgery groups or treatment groups. All the animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Baylor College of Medicine.</p>

<title>Behavioral tests:</title>
<p id="P33">All the behavior tests were done during 12pm-6pm in a dim light environment unless specifically mentioned. Mice were given a 2-weeks interval to recover from the first behavioral test to have a next behavioral test. Mice were not subjected to more than four behavioral tests.</p>

<title>Novel Object Recognition Test:</title>
<p id="P34">For Novel Object Recognition test (NOR), the objects used in the Novel Object Recognition test were built from Legos and were provided by the Neurobehavioral Core at Baylor. We used a small (22cm x 44 cm) arena to facilitate object exploration and reduce the time needed to habituate mice to the arena. The arena was surrounded on three sides by a white screen to limit spatial information and prevent spatial biases. During the training session, two identical objects were placed at both right and left side of the arena. During the first day<strike>s</strike>, mice were put into the center of the arena and allowed to explore freely for 5 min. After that, mice were returned to their home-cages. 24 hours later, one of the objects was replaced by a novel object with different color and shape, and mice were allowed to freely explore the whole arena for 5 min. Animal behavior during the training and test session was tracked by a top camera and analyzed by ANY-maze software (Stoelting Co.). Discrimination index was calculated as (Exploration time on the novel object - Exploration time on the familiar object) / (Exploration time on the novel object + Exploration time on the familiar object). Sniffing, touching (&gt;1s), and staring the objects were judged as exploration behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Elevated Plus Maze:</title>
<p id="P35">For Elevated Plus Maze test, we used a plus-shaped platform that was elevated to 40 cm above the floor. Two opposite arms of the maze were walled (15cm high), whereas the other two arms were open with a 5mm high ridge to prevent falling. Each arm was 8cm wide, 25 cm long. The test lasted for 10 min and was started by placing a mouse in the center part of the maze facing one of the two open arms under a bright environment. An overhead camera and the ANY-maze software program were used to track the position of the mouse in the elevated plus maze. The number of visits to the open arms and the time spent on the open arms was used as measures for anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Open-Field Arena Test:</title>
<p id="P36">Open-Field Arena Test was performed using the Versamax animal activity monitor equipped with infra-red photo beams as horizontal X-Y sensors and/or Z sensors. Mice were placed in the center of the open-field arena (40cm x 40cm x 30cm) and allowed to explore for 60-min.

<title>Morris Water Maze:</title>
<p id="P38">Morris Water Maze test (MWM) was performed as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> with modification. During the training session, a transparent rescue platform was submerged under the painted water (0.5cm-1cm) and was placed in a fixed position of the pool. On the first day training, mice were first let stand on the platform for 10s. After that, mice were gently placed into the water facing the wall of the pool and are allowed to freely explore the whole maze for 1min. Mice were then guided to the rescue platform if they did not find it. Mice were allowed to take a rest on the platform for 10s, and then re-trained from a different start position with the same procedure. After four training trials, they were dried by a paper towel and returned to home cages. Twenty-four hours later, mice were trained again following the same procedure without the initial habituation session. Mice were trained for five consecutive days. At the end of the 4th trial on day 5, mice were returned to home cages for a rest. One hour later, mice were put into the water maze for 1 min, where the platform had been removed. Mouse behaviors were videotaped and analyzed by the Noldus EthoVision XT. The Morris Water Maze was virtually divided into 4 quadrants. The rescue platform located in the target quadrant. Escape latency was defined as time spent before finding the platform. Escape latency during the 5-day training sessions served as an independent measurement of spatial learning and memory.</p>

Mice were given two consecutive 10 min tests: the first measured baseline activity in the apparatus and the second test measured sociability of the test mouse given a choice of exploring a chamber containing another mouse under a mesh pencil cup or a chamber containing a novel object under a mesh pencil cup. A camera and the ANY-maze Behavioral Tracking software program (Stoelting Co.) were used to track the position of the mouse in the 3-chambered box, while the user scores the approaches to the object or partner mouse using a wireless keyboard. Partner mice (sex-, age- and weight-matched) were purchased from the Center for Comparative Medicine (CCM) at Baylor College of Medicine and habituated to the mesh pencil cups in the apparatus for 1 hour per day for 2 days prior to the day of testing.

Mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (100mg/kg:10mg/kg) and the head were fixed on the surgery platform by a stereotaxic system (Stoelting Co). For virus injection, a blur hole was drilled on each side of the skull (posterior 1.06 mm and lateral 1.2 mm to the bregma; depth: 5.48 mm for LH; and posterior 1.98mm and lateral 2.0mm to the bregma, depth: 2.25mm for CA3), and 150nl of each virus/side/mouse was injected. For i.c.v. injection, a mouse was implanted with a guide cannula (posterior 0.8, lateral 1.6 to the bregma; depth 2.2mm for i.c.v.). One or two weeks later after the surgery, diazepam (0.5µg/mouse/µl) or SL651498 (1µg/2µl/mouse) was injected through the cannula in the freely moving mouse 2hr. prior to the tests.

<p id="P54">AAV9.FLEX.Rpl10a-Flag was stereotaxically injected into the LH of NS-V mice and Vgat-Cre WT mice. Mice were decapitated 3 weeks later, and hypothalamus tissues were harvested. Tissues from 6 mice were pooled and treated as one biological sample for the subsequent procedure. Tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 100 µg/ml cycloheximide (CHX), 40 U/ml RNase inhibitor (Ambion) with a Downs homogenizer on ice. 1/9 sample volume of 10% NP-40 and 1% Saponin were added and mixed, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g in 4 <sup>o</sup>C. An aliquot of total RNA was saved, while the rest were gently mixed with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min in the cold room with end-over-end. After washing the gel beads three times with washing buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.4], 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 350 mM KCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5 mM DTT, and 100 ug/ml CHX), we recovered enriched mRNA with phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation with glycogen.

ChIP and ChIP-seq were described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Briefly, brain tissues were grounded in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Whole cell extracts were sonicated followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies for HDAC3 (Abcam, ab7030) and Protein A Sepharose CL-4B (GE, 17-0780-01). After the immunoprecipitation, beads were washed by ChIP dilution buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 155 mM NaCl, 1.1% TritonX-100, 0.11% NaDeoxycholate, 1mM EDTA) for 3 times followed once wash by ChIP wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 10 mM EDTA, 0.5 % NaDeoxycholate, 250 mM LiCl, and 0.5 % NP-40). Sepharose beads were further washed one by TE buffer (Promega, E260A). DNA were enriched with phenol/chloroform extraction and dissolved in 20 µl TE buffer followed the RNA degradation by RNase (Roche, 11119915001) for 30min at 37°C. Four HDAC3 ChIP reactions were performed with each reaction containing samples from 3 mice. The ChIP reactions were then pooled to be sequenced as one sample, together with the pooled total input DNA as the control. The precipitated DNA was then pooled and amplified according to the guide of Illumina, followed by 50 bp single-end deep sequencing on Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx.

Behavioral experiments were done by experimentalists who know the drug treatment information but do not know the genotype or surgery information. During the early stage of analysis such as counting the time duration from video clips, experimentalists were blind to both genotype and treatment information.
