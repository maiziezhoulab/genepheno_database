<abstract>
<p id="P1">Ras/MAPK pathway signaling is a major participant in neurodevelopment, and evidence suggests that BRAF, a key Ras signal mediator, influences human behavior. We studied the role of the mutation <italic>BRAF</italic><sup>Q257R</sup>, the most common cause of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC), in an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived model of human neurodevelopment. In iPSC-derived neuronal cultures from CFC subjects, we observed decreased p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 compared to controls, as well as a depleted neural progenitor pool and rapid neuronal maturation. Pharmacological PI3K/AKT pathway manipulation recapitulated cellular phenotypes in control cells and attenuated them in CFC cells. CFC cultures displayed altered cellular subtype ratios and increased intrinsic excitability. Moreover, in CFC cells, Ras/MAPK pathway activation and morphological abnormalities exhibited cell subtype-specific differences. Our results highlight the importance of exploring specific cellular subtypes and of using iPSC models to reveal relevant human-specific neurodevelopmental events.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">Mental health disorders account for 13% of the global burden of disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Five major psychiatric disorders—autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia—have substantial heritability and shared genetic etiology, indicating common pathophysiologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Genome-wide association studies found that the most significant shared signaling pathway is the Ras/MAPK pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, which regulates cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival across many cell types and is critical in neurodevelopment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">Germline mutations in the Ras/MAPK pathway cause a class of Mendelian genetic syndromes termed RASopathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, which include cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC; OMIM #115150). CFC individuals have increased risk for behavioral manifestations affecting cognitive systems, social processes, and arousal/regulatory systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, all relevant to the symptomology of major psychiatric disorders. CFC is an autosomal dominant disorder primarily caused by gain-of-function mutations in the <italic>BRAF</italic> gene (73% of CFC subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>), which is ubiquitously expressed in the developing human brain with peak expression between postconceptional weeks 8 and 12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Individuals with CFC commonly present developmental delay, intellectual disability (more than 80%), increased risk for ASD (54–64%), seizures (45%) and a higher incidence of structural brain abnormalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. A systematic study of 66 CFC subjects observed increased ventricular size and cortical atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Other common neurologic manifestations of CFC are abnormal EEG findings (including hypsarrhythmia), agenesis of the corpus callosum, abnormal myelination, and Chiari malformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. There are many structural abnormalities in common between CFC and major psychiatric disorders: cortical atrophy is observed in schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, thinner corpus callosum in ASDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and enlarged ventricles in both<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">Attempts to mechanistically model CFC in mice have led to mixed results. The ablation of <italic>Braf</italic> in the developing mouse brain led to increased frequency of repetitive movements, seizures, hyperactivity, and impairments in sociability and learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, mouse models with gain-of-function mutations in <italic>Braf</italic> failed to recapitulate the central nervous system (CNS) structural defects found in CFC subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and led to embryonic lethality or overall reduced viability. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have proven to comprise a successful platform that allows for the direct examination of human neuronal development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Our recent studies on another RASopathy, Costello syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, indicated that an activating mutation in <italic>HRAS</italic> led to an extended progenitor phase and subsequent increase in the number of cortical neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> as well as excessive astrocyte-to-neuron signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, all of which correlated with the progressive postnatal brain overgrowth in Costello syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P5">Because Ras/MAPK signaling controls differentiation in most tissues, we hypothesized that the <italic>BRAF</italic> gain-of-function p.Q257R mutation would affect neuronal maturation. We generated iPSC lines from four CFC subjects carrying <italic>BRAF</italic><sup>Q257R</sup> (the most common CFC mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>) and differentiated them towards several neuronal lineages. We characterized the biochemical consequences of aberrant Ras/MAPK signaling in CFC-derived neural cultures and revealed cellular properties associated with altered maturation, including morphological and physiological features.</p>

<p id="P6">All human research was consistent with IRB approved protocols. All participants or their parents provided written consent as approved by the UCSF Human Research Protection Program (CHR #10-02794). We selected subjects based on the presence of <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation p.Q257R. Recruitment was described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>: all CFC subjects were recruited at national RASopathy family meetings and two control participants at a UCSF Neurofibromatosis Symposium. The third control line used in our study, HS1-11, was kindly provided by Dr. Arnold Kriegstein’s lab (UCSF). Control lines were sex- and age-matched to the subject lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>; clinical features in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Generation of pluripotent stem cell lines</title>
<p id="P7">Dermal fibroblasts were isolated from skin biopsies as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. When the dermal fibroblast culture reached passage 5, they were detached using 0.25% trypsin/EDTA, spun at 500xg for 5 minutes, resuspended in DMEM high-glucose media. We used 360,000 cells per individual per reprogramming. Before electroporation, one μg of each of the plasmids pCXLE-hOCT3/4-shp53-F, pCXLE-hSK, pCXLE-hUL, and pCXLE-EGFP (Addgene)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> was mixed with 100ul Resuspension Buffer R (Neon™ Transfection System, Life Technologies), and added to the cells to be transformed. We pipetted 100μl of the cell suspension into the Neon Transfection System chamber (Life Technologies) and electroporated the cell suspension with three 1,650V, 10ms pulses. Immediately after electroporation, the cell suspension was pipetted directly into a gelatin-coated well containing a warmed fibroblast medium (DMEM High Glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) and incubated in a 37ºC, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. GFP-positive cells were examined during the first five days post-electroporation to monitor transfection efficiency. After day 5, transfected fibroblasts were detached and plated onto Mitomycin C treated Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (Millipore) at 10,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Until iPS-like colonies were ready to be picked and passaged, we fed the cells with hES-KSR Basal Medium - Knockout DMEM (Life Technologies), 20% Knockout Serum Replacement (Life Technologies), 5% L-glutamine (Life Technologies), 10% Non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies), and beta-mercaptoethanol and 10ng/ml bFGF (GlobalStem). Clonal colonies displaying iPSC morphology were manually selected and subsequently cultured on a Matrigel substrate (BD Biosciences) with mTeSR1 media (Stem Cell Technologies). All lines were shown to be pluripotent using a random differentiation protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The presence of the <italic>BRAF</italic> Q257R point mutation in the CFC subjects was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of exon 6 of the <italic>BRAF</italic> gene for all the cell lines before and after reprogramming (forward primer: 5′-GGGAGAGAAATACTGTCCATTCCA-3′; reverse primer: 5′-GCTTGAAATCAGTTGCCAGCC -3′; annealing temperature= 58°C). Both DNA fingerprinting analysis and genotyping using the Affymetrix Axiom EUR array<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> were performed by the Genomics Core Facility at UCSF using standard protocols before reprogramming, after reprogramming and in one-week old neural differentiation cultures. Subclones utilized for each cell line and independent differentiations performed are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p id="P8">At the previously described time points, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 90% ice cold methanol in PBS for 10 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked with IF blocking buffer [2% BSA (Sigma), 1% Fish Skin Gelatin (Sigma) and 0.2% Saponin (Sigma) in PBS] for 1h at room temperature. Cells were incubated with primary antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) overnight at 4°C, followed by three 5 minute PBS washes. Cells were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) for 1h at room temperature. Slides were mounted with Prolong Gold with DAPI mounting solution (Invitrogen). All images in the same set were obtained using the same exposure and speed parameters.

<title>Protein expression</title>
<p id="P9">We prepared total protein extracts using Phosphosafe extraction reagent (EMD Biosciences) supplemented with complete protease inhibitors (Roche), according to manufacturer’s protocol. 5μg of protein per well was loaded into a gradient 4–12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE Bolt gel (Invitrogen) under denaturing conditions, along with 4ul of PageRuler prestained protein ladder (Thermo Fisher). Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (BioRad), blocked in 5% BSA in TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20 in TBS), and blots were incubated overnight at 4°C using the antibodies specific to proteins of the Ras/MAPK pathway and PI3K pathways in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>. All antibodies targeting phosphorylated proteins recognize the activated form of the proteins. The next day, blots were exposed to anti-rabbit IgG–peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich) for 1h at room temperature. Following TBST washes, blots were exposed to chemiluminescent detection substrate ECL prime (GE Healthcare) for 1 minute at room temperature. Next, they were exposed to x-ray film Amersham Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare) for up to 1h. Films were scanned with a Canon LiDE210 Flatbed Scanner (Canon) and analyzed using the gel analysis method, as outlined in the ImageJ documentation: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/menus/analyze.html#gels">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/menus/analyze.html#gels</ext-link>.</p>

Complementary DNA (cDNA) was produced from 1μg of total RNA using High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Life Technologies). The qRT-PCR assay was performed using 20ng of cDNA and TaqMan gene expression master mix in a QuantStudio™ 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). We determined expression levels by relative quantification in comparison to the endogenous control gene <italic>GUSB</italic>. Expression of each target gene was assessed relative to a control sample using the 2<sup>−ΔΔCT</sup> method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Samples were run in technical triplicates, and the threshold suggested by the instrument’s software was used (after visual confirmation) to calculate the Ct. Outlier replicate samples (any data point more than 1.5 interquartile ranges below the first quartile or above the third quartile) were excluded from analysis.

<title>Neural progenitor cell culture</title>
<p id="P11">To induce neural differentiation, free floating iPSC aggregates were formed for 24h in mTeSR1 culture medium (Stemcell Technologies). After 24h, the iPSC aggregates were switched into a neural induction medium [DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen), N2 supplement (Invitrogen), MEM-NEAA (Gibco) and 2μg/ml heparin (Sigma-Aldrich)]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> with media exchange every other day. To promote neural induction, we added small molecule TGF-βR inhibitor, SB431542 (5μM, Stemgent), and BMP signaling inhibitor, LDN-193189 (0.25μM, Stemgent), for 48h. On day 3, aggregates were attached to 6-well plates and cultured in neural media for an additional week during which rosettes appeared in the colonies. On day 11, neuroepithelial cells in the center of the colonies were mechanically removed and kept as free-floating aggregates. At day 25 of neural differentiation, neurospheres were dissociated into single cells using Accutase (Stem Cell Technologies) and cultured as monolayer neural progenitor cells (NPCs). NPCs were maintained at high density, grown on polyornithine/laminin-coated plates in NPC media (STEMdiff™ Neural Progenitor Medium, Stem Cell Technologies) and split ~1:5 every week with Accutase (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). All subsequent experiments utilized NPCs between passages 4 to 6, when cultures were 80% confluent.</p>

<title>Neural differentiation</title>
<p id="P12">In this protocol, we obtain not only diverse types of neurons, but glial cells as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, therefore we refer to it as neural differentiation (protocols for differentiation directed towards specific neuronal cell types is described below). NPCs were plated into poly-ornithine/laminin-coated plates at 50,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and fed with neural medium [Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with N2 supplement (Invitrogen), and B27 supplement (Invitrogen)]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.

<title>Cell cycle exit analysis</title>
<p id="P13">A single dose of BrdU (Sigma, 15ng/ml) was added to NPCs for 4h before differentiation into forebrain neurons and fixed after 48h of culture in the neural medium. Neural cultures were processed for immunostaining with mouse anti-BrdU (1:100, BD Biosciences) and rabbit anti-Ki67 antibodies (1:400, Abcam). Cell cycle exit was established by counting all BrdU<sup>+</sup> but Ki67<sup>−</sup> cells over the total number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells per coverslip. The percentage of (BrdU<sup>+</sup>/Ki67<sup>−</sup>)/BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells is reported as the percentage of cells that exited cell cycle.</p>
<p id="P14">For analysis of the role of ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation in early maturation, DMSO (control), MEK inhibitor U0126 (10μM, Cell Signaling Technologies), PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin (1μM, Cell Signaling Technologies), a combination of both U0126 (10μM) and Wortmannin (1μM), or AKT activator SC79 (10μg/ml, Millipore Sigma) were added to the single dose of BrdU for 4h prior to changing the NPC medium to neural medium.

<p id="P15">To label neurons for visual targeting, cultures were infected with a lentivirus that expresses <italic>Discosoma</italic> Red Fluorescent Protein (DsRFP) under the synapsin promoter (Addgene). Coverslips containing cultures differentiated for 5 weeks in neural medium were transferred to a recording chamber in an upright light microscope (Nikon Eclipse, Japan). The coverslips were immersed in recording solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 D-glucose, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4) and maintained at room temperature. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from DsRFP+ neurons (total neurons analyzed for control lines: n=15; CFC: n=18; Wortmannin pre-treated controls: n=7) under visual guidance using borosilicate glass pipette electrodes. Electrodes were filled with a K-gluconate based internal solution (in mM: 123 K-gluconate, 12 KCl, 10 HEPES-KOH pH 7.2, 1 EGTA, 0.1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 Mg-ATP, 0.2 Na<sub>4</sub>GTP and 4 D-glucose; adjusted to 320 mOsm with added sucrose). Electrophysiological signals were acquired using a patch clamp amplifier (Multiclamp 700B, Axon Instruments/ Molecular Devices) and digitizer (Digidata 1440A, Axon Instruments/ Molecular Devices), and recorded using pCLAMP 10 software (Axon Instruments/ Molecular Devices). For current-clamp recordings, signals were filtered at 10kHz and sampled at 25kHz. In the voltage-clamp recording mode, signals were filtered at 4 kHz and sampled at 10kHz.

<title>CFC neural cultures display early maturation and imbalance of neural cell types</title>
<p id="P23">We first investigated the cell cycle exit of differentiating NPCs to determine if the <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation affects the neural progenitor cell population.

<title>CFC-derived neurons have increased intrinsic excitability</title>
<p id="P28">The <italic>bona fide</italic> marker of cortical neuronal functional maturation is the ability to maintain moderate frequency action potential (AP) firing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that if CFC-derived neural cultures do mature faster, they would display an increase in the frequency of AP firing. To this end, we utilized whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology to examine various measures of intrinsic excitability in CFC and control neurons. To specifically target neurons within the mixed neural cultures, we transduced five-week old neural cultures with SYN1-DsRFP lentivirus to label mature neurons at four days before recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>).</p>
<p id="P29">In order to elicit AP firing, in current-clamp configuration, a series of positive current steps of successively increasing amplitude (200ms, 10–190pA) were delivered to neurons maintained at a holding potential of −70mV. We found that the overwhelming majority of DsRFP+ neurons fired APs (49/52 cells), illustrating the usefulness of SYN1-DsRFP lentiviral transduction to label neurons. The amount of current to elicit a single AP was similar in control and CFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). CFC-derived neurons had markedly distinct AP firing behavior at higher amplitude stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c and 2d</xref>). Control neurons fired a maximum of 2 AP in response to a 70-pA step current, on average, with a decrease in the average number of APs fired using higher amplitude stimuli. In contrast, in CFC-derived neurons, although higher amplitude current was required to reach maximal AP firing rates (~110–160pA), the maximal rate was superior to that of controls (<italic>BRAF</italic><sup>WT</sup>: 2.87±1.51 APs vs. <italic>BRAF</italic><sup>Q257R</sup>: 4.12±2.34 APs). Moreover, CFC-derived neurons could maintain this maximal firing rate even at the highest amplitude stimuli. When we assayed other metrics of intrinsic excitability, including potassium/sodium currents and input resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e, 2f, and 2g</xref>), we did not observe further significant differences except for an increased potassium current at the highest tested voltage step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>), suggestive of neurons with a larger area.

<title>Decreased phosphorylation of AKT leads to progenitor cell pool depletion in CFC</title>
<p id="P30">Because the first noticeable differences between CFC and control cultures were the reduction in the levels of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a and 1b</xref>) and early cell cycle exit during neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>), we sought to test whether these two observations were related. First, we added either DMSO only, the MEK inhibitor U0126 only (10μM in DMSO), the PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin only (1μM in DMSO), or a combination of both U0126 and Wortmannin to the media of control NPCs for 1h. We then compared the ratio of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT to DMSO-treated control and CFC NPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 3a and 3b</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed that U0126 inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 while increasing that of AKT. On the other hand, Wortmannin decreased the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2, similar to our observations in CFC NPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 3a and 3b</xref>). Next, we tested whether these pathways are associated with the accelerated cell cycle exit by pre-treating control NPCs with DMSO, U0126, Wortmannin, or U0126+Wortmannin, to simulate the phosphorylation profile of CFC NPCs. After 48h in neural differentiation medium, double staining for BrdU and Ki67 revealed that exposure to Wortmannin is sufficient to mimic the CFC phenotype in control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 3c and 3d</xref>). Simultaneous pre-exposure to both the U0126 and Wortmannin did not produce effects beyond those of the Wortmannin exposure alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 3c and 3d</xref>). Therefore, this observation indicated that the accelerated cell-cycle exit of CFC cultures was associated with the inhibition of the AKT pathway accompanied by decreased activation of the ERK pathway before neural differentiation.</p>
<p id="P31">To corroborate the role of decreased AKT activation in the progenitor pool depletion of CFC lines, we tested whether increasing AKT phosphorylation in CFC cultures would rescue this phenotype. We added the AKT activator SC79<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> (10μg/ml) to the media of CFC NPCs for 1h and compared the levels of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT in SC79 pre-treated CFC NPCs to both DMSO-treated control and CFC NPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary figure 3e and 3f</xref>). SC79 pre-treated CFC cells showed an increased level of AKT activation compared to the same cells exposed to DMSO only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary figure 3e and 3f</xref>). Following the same cell cycle exit assay described above, we observed that AKT inhibition (Wortmannin treatment) in control cells recapitulated the increase in post-mitotic cells of the CFC lines, while AKT activation (SC79 treatment) in CFC cells prevented the depletion of progenitor cells to levels similar to the observed in control lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b and 3c</xref>).</p>
<p id="P32">Moreover, to assess whether decreased phosphorylation AKT in CFC NPCs and subsequent depletion of progenitor cells was driving the neural maturation phenotype, we compared neural differentiation of control NPCs pre-treated with Wortmannin to CFC NPCs, and we compared CFC NPCs pre-treated with SC79 to control NPCs), all four conditions undergoing the same protocol. We were able to recapitulate early neural maturation of CFC cultures in the control cultures pre-treated with Wortmannin, while mitigating the phenotype in CFC cultures with SC79 pre-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d–h</xref>), evidenced by MAP2 expression and TUJ1<sup>+</sup> cell morphology at one-week old neural differentiation cultures. At week 5, even though control lines pre-treated with Wortmannin showed increased number of deep layer cortical neurons and decreased number of astroglial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3i–n</xref>), CFC lines displayed a more accentuated and significant difference compared to untreated control lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3i and 3j</xref>).

<title>BRAF<sup>Q257R</sup> causes cellular subtype-specific phenotypes</title>
<p id="P33">To explore potential differences between CFC and control specific neuronal subtype populations that are independent of the progenitor pool depletion, we used previously established protocols to differentiate CFC and control NPCs into two distinct neuronal cell lineages: cortical glutamatergic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and GABAergic interneurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. In both protocols, NPCs were first treated with Compound E (γ-secretase inhibitor XXI) during the first 24h of the neuronal induction protocol to inhibit Notch signaling. The Notch signaling pathway suppresses differentiation and promotes proliferation: ligand-receptor binding activates the pathway through the cleavage and subsequent nuclear translocation of Notch intracellular domain by γ-secretase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Consequently, by adding Compound E, we overcame the initial progenitor cell pool depletion observed in the CFC neural cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). To confirm that these protocols generated subtype specific enriched populations, these methodologies were directly compared. Five-week old GABAergic cultures on average displayed 5.99±3.85% FOXP2<sup>+</sup> cells and no expression of CUX1+ cells, compared to 29.49±12.33 FOXP2<sup>+</sup> cells and 25.52±20.28% CUX1<sup>+</sup> cells in five-week old glutamatergic cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Figure 4a–f</xref>).

Unlike what was observed in CFC glutamatergic neurons, the CFC GABAergic interneurons showed an increase in the phosphorylation of residue S445 of BRAF (1.55-fold increase expression of p-BRAF, <italic>p=</italic>0.01) accompanied by a decrease in the activation of PI3K (83% reduction in the expression of p-AKT, <italic>p=</italic>0.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5l and 5m</xref>).</p>
<p id="P36">Overall, by performing two distinct neuronal type specific differentiations and analyses, our results suggested that imbalance in the number of different types of neural cells in CFC is associated with the depletion of progenitor cells. Moreover, BRAF could have additional cell type specific regulation during neurodevelopment, as we observed that CFC glutamatergic neurons and GABAergic interneurons had opposite morphological changes compared to the respective control neurons, as well as different levels of phosphorylation of BRAF.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P37">The earliest difference we established between CFC and control iPSC derived cultures was the decrease in the progenitor cell pool not associated with cell death. The depletion of the progenitor cell pool in CFC cultures was followed by early expression of mature neuronal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a–i</xref>), imbalance in different neural populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2j–o</xref>), and increased excitability in CFC cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Taken together, these results imply that the <italic>BRAF</italic><sup>Q257R</sup> mutation is associated with accelerated maturation. Moreover, the loss of progenitor cells was followed by the disproportionate representation of glutamatergic cortical layer neurons, increase in the number of GABAergic interneurons, and marked decrease in the number of astroglial cells, all of which can be paralleled to clinical observations in CFC. In a few CFC patients, white matter atrophy (1.5%) and defects of myelination (7.5%) have been reported. However, these findings are only discernible upon completion of myelination, and only a limited number of CFC subjects have undergone a brain MRI. Therefore it is possible that these abnormalities are more common than reported in literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. We observed an increase in glutamatergic cortical layer VI neurons and a decrease in layer II/III neurons, where cortical projection neurons primarily reside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2j</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, which could result in a decline in the proportion of callosal projection neurons and increase in the number of cells that project to subcortical structures. Accordingly, corpus callosum abnormalities, including agenesis of corpus callosum, are found in CFC subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. The high prevalence of seizure and ASD traits in CFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> suggests an imbalance of excitation and inhibition, which could be due to a decrease in glutamatergic excitatory signaling, or to increased GABAergic signaling. CFC neural cultures showed an increase in GABA<sup>+</sup> neurons, favoring the latter hypothesis.</p>
<p id="P38">Our neuronal type-specific results show that without progenitor pool depletion and with specific cues, CFC and control lines give rise to similar percentages of different subtypes of glutamatergic neurons as well as GABAergic interneurons. Even so, the CFC glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons differed in morphology and Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathway activation profiles, implying that the <italic>BRAF</italic><sup>Q257R</sup> mutation affects cell type specification and cell type morphological development independently. However, we cannot rule out that the differences in the percentage of GABAergic interneurons in the neural and directed differentiation could be because we are looking at different populations of interneurons. In humans, there is a dual origin of cortical interneurons: 65% of cortical GABAergic interneurons are derived from the Dlx1/2+/Mash1+ lineage situated in the neocortical ventricular and subventricular zones, whereas 35% have a ventral origin from the ganglionic eminence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. The neural differentiation protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> could enrich for interneurons of the ventricular and subventricular zones, while the directed differentiation generates the progenitors corresponding to the ganglionic eminence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Of note, the dual origin of cortical interneurons is not present in rodents, so further human-derived cell studies will be needed to investigate this possibility.</p>
<p id="P39">We also observed cell context dependent Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathway activation profiles in CFC. It is thought that the cysteine rich domain of BRAF – where mutation p.Q257R resides – inhibits basal catalytic RAF activity and mediates membrane docking upon activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. While <italic>BRAF</italic><sup>Q257R</sup> led to enhanced activation of ERK signaling in NIH3T3 cells upon transient transfection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, the function of this mutation for Ras/MAPK signaling in NPC and neural maturation is unknown. Although RASopathies are usually described as syndromes with overactivation of the Ras/MAPK pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, the study of the BRAF phosphorylation and dimerization suggest that RASopathy <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations can cause impaired kinase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Our data support that abnormal activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway is cell context dependent; e.g., the same mutation in <italic>BRAF</italic> is associated with decreased phosphorylation of BRAF in glutamatergic neurons and increase in p-BRAF in GABAergic interneurons. The cell type dependent role of BRAF is in line with recent work that several RASopathy-associated MEK mutations both increased and reduced the levels of Ras pathway activation <italic>in vivo</italic>; furthermore, the divergent effects were dependent on cellular context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P40">By exposing control NPCs to a PI3K inhibitor, phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 were decreased, and we were able to emulate the progenitor cell depletion and partially recapitulate the imbalance in cell types observed in CFC lines. Conversely, activation of AKT by SC79 in CFC lines was able to attenuate the CFC phenotypes of the cell lines with the <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation. Therefore, we supported that loss of the progenitor pool in CFC is associated with the decreased activation of AKT. The progenitor pool size determines the eventual size and morphology of the brain. Rapid depletion of the neural progenitor cell pool can contribute to reduced cortical thickness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, which could be linked to cortical atrophy in CFC subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and might also be relevant to cortical atrophy in schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Decreasing activation of the kinases AKT, ERK1, and ERK2 also recapitulates the early increase in MAP2+ and NEUN+ cells in CFC cultures. However, in the longer term, brief one-time initial Wortmannin treatment of control lines is not sufficient to fully recapitulate the CFC cellular phenotype. On the other hand, SC79 may activate AKT irreversibly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> and was able to reduce the progenitor pool depletion and the early expression of MAP2, alleviate the decrease in GFAP+ cells, increase in FOXP2+ neurons and decrease in CUX1+ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), which suggests that a sustained decrease in activation of AKT, rather than at a particular time point in development, is associated with an observable phenotype. Our results imply that, besides the ERK pathway (which is most commonly associated with RASopathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>), AKT activation also has a role as a mediator of the CFC neuronal phenotype. That is not surprising, given that there are several cross-feedback loops between Ras/MAPK and PI3K pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P41">The morphological and biochemical phenotype of glutamatergic neurons and GABAergic interneurons harboring the <italic>BRAF<sup>Q257R</sup></italic> mutation was also cell type dependent. Compared to the same control neuronal types, glutamatergic CFC neurons had more neurites and branching per cell accompanied by a decrease in p-BRAF, while GABAergic CFC interneurons had fewer neurites per cell, increase in p-BRAF, and decrease in p-AKT. This difference could enhance the excitation-inhibition imbalance in CFC. Moreover, it has been shown that the same gene can cause ASD or schizophrenia by affecting distinct neuronal populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. This difference highlights the importance of taking the cellular context into consideration when studying neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
<p id="P42">Mutation p.G12S in the <italic>HRAS</italic> gene causes Costello syndrome, also a RASopathy, and in iPSC-derived neurons, it extended the progenitor phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. This observation is the opposite of the phenotype observed in CFC iPSC-derived neurons. HRAS<sup>G12S</sup> is a constitutively active form of HRAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Therefore, the <italic>BRAF</italic><sup>Q257R</sup> mutation decreases activation of ERK 1/2 in NPC cells while the <italic>HRAS</italic><sup>G12S</sup> mutation increases phosphorylation of ERK1/2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, explaining the different neuronal phenotypes. Moreover, the neuronal phenotype in each case corresponds to the clinical phenotype: Costello syndrome shows postnatal progressive overgrowth of the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> that could be due to the extended progenitor phase; cortical atrophy found in some CFC subjects can be linked to the rapid depletion of the progenitor pool. These results call for caution when proposing a general drug therapy or treatment for neurodevelopmental disorders, even when the mutations are in the same pathway.</p>
<p id="P43">In conclusion, our results provide insight into ways that the BRAF<sup>Q257R</sup> mutation may contribute to common neurological and psychiatric symptoms of CFC. Our findings at a cellular level – progenitor pool depletion, decrease in layer II/III neurons, and increase in GABAergic interneurons – can be correlated with neurological findings in the CFC subjects – cortical atrophy, corpus callosum abnormalities, and ASD and seizures, respectively. Hence, our data indicate that iPSC-derived cells are an informative model to study human neurodevelopment and underlying cellular pathologies resulting from abnormal signaling. Through directed differentiation into specific neuronal lineages, we showed morphological differences of <italic>BRAF</italic><sup>Q257R</sup> neurons, which are cell type dependent. Although the use of iPSCs as a platform to study neurodevelopment has become widespread, most of the effort to date has focused on specific neuronal lineages and failed to investigate different neuronal types simultaneously. This traditional narrow focus could generate seemingly contradictory or non-comparable results across studies examining different lineages. Finally, our results, alongside a growing body of evidence in the literature, suggest a complex and intertwined crosstalk between two signaling pathways associated with major psychiatric disorders: Ras/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Our study suggests that for future screening of potential therapeutic agents to be successful, these pathways must be considered in depth and that cellular context should be taken into account.</p>

<p>(A) Western blot analysis of the components of the Ras/MAPK pathway and its phosphorylation status, and quantification of the blots (B) from protein lysates extracted from CFC and control NPC cultures. The results were normalized with their corresponding α-tubulin values (assigned a value of 1) and are mean ±SD of two independent experiments (C) Double immunostaining for BrdU (green) and Ki67 (red) of early neuronal progenitors within 48h of differentiation; progenitors that exited the cell cycle, %(BrdU<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>−</sup>)/BrDU<sup>+</sup> cells (orange arrows) were quantified. (D) Cleaved caspase 3 staining for cell death of the same NPCs and subsequent quantification. (E) Immunostaining of TUJ1, MAP2, NEUN, GABA, and TBR1 of CFC lines and control lines at week 1 of neural differentiation. Quantification of these stainings are shown as percentage of TUJ1<sup>+</sup> cells (F), MAP2<sup>+</sup> cells (G), NEUN<sup>+</sup> cells (H), average neurite length of TUJ1+ cells (I), average number of neurites per TUJ1<sup>+</sup> cell (J), percentage of GABA<sup>+</sup> cells (K), and TBR1+ cells (L).
