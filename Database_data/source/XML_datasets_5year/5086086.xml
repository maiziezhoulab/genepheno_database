<abstract>
<p id="P1">Cell death is an inherent process that is required for the proper wiring of the nervous system. In the last four decades, it has been found that in a parallel developmental pathway, axons and dendrite are eliminated without the death of the neuron. This developmentally regulated “axonal death” results in neuronal remodeling which is an essential mechanism to sculpt neuronal networks in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Studies across various organisms have demonstrated that a conserved strategy to form adult neuronal circuitry often involves generating too many connections that are later eliminated with high temporal and spatial resolution. Can neuronal remodeling can be perceived as developmentally and spatially regulated neurodegeneration? It has been previously speculated that injury induced degeneration (Wallerian degeneration) share molecular similarities with dying back neurodegenerative diseases. In this opinion piece, we examine the similarities and differences between the mechanisms regulating neuronal remodeling and those being perturbed in dying back neurodegenerative diseases. We focus primarily on ALS and peripheral neuropathies and highlight possible shared pathways and mechanisms. While mechanistic data is just beginning to emerge, and despite the inherent differences between disease oriented and developmental processes, we believe that some of the similarities between these developmental and disease-initiated degeneration warrant closer collaborations and cross talk between these different fields.</p>
