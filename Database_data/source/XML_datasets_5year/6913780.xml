<title>SUMMARY</title>
<p id="P3">Commissural axons initially respond to attractive signals at the midline, but once they cross, they become sensitive to repulsive cues. This switch prevents axons from re-entering the midline. In insects and mammals, negative regulation of Roundabout (Robo) receptors prevents premature response to the midline repellant Slit. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the endosomal protein Commissureless (Comm) prevents Robo1 surface expression before midline crossing by diverting Robo1 into late endosomes. Notably, Comm is not conserved in vertebrates. We identified two Nedd-4-interacting proteins, Ndfip1 and Ndfip2, that act analogously to Comm to localize Robo1 to endosomes. Ndfip proteins recruit Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases to promote Robo1 ubiquitylation and degradation. Ndfip proteins are expressed in commissural axons in the developing spinal cord and removal of Ndfip proteins results in increased Robo1 expression and reduced midline crossing. Our results define a conserved Robo1 intracellular sorting mechanism between flies and mammals to avoid premature responsiveness to Slit.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="P6">During the development of the nervous system in bilaterally symmetric animals, many neurons extend their axons across the midline in order to establish neural circuits that are essential for cognitive functions and motor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dickson and Zou, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Neuhaus-Follini and Bashaw, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Vallstedt and Kullander, 2013</xref>). In both the ventral nerve cord of invertebrates and the mammalian spinal cord, midline crossing is controlled by a balance of attractive and repulsive signals through the interaction between growth cone receptors and ligands secreted by the midline and other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Evans and Bashaw, 2010</xref>). Growing commissural axons initially respond to attractive signals, which include members of the Netrin and Sonic Hedgehog families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Charron et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Ishii et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Mitchell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Serafini et al., 1996</xref>). Once across the midline, commissural axons become sensitive to repellents, which include Slit and Semaphorin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Brose et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kidd et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Zou et al., 2000</xref>). This switch prevents commissural axons from re-entering the midline and allows them to turn longitudinally and ultimately reach their synaptic targets. In humans, defects in midline axon guidance have been implicated in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders such as horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis, congenital mirror movements, and autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Blockus and Chédotal, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Engle, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Jamuar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Jen et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">The secreted Slit ligands and their Roundabout (Robo) receptors mediate repulsive axon guidance at the midline, and this function is highly conserved in both invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dickson and Zou, 2010</xref>). Axons expressing Robo receptors are repelled from the midline in response to the repulsive ligand Slit, which is secreted from the midline. In both insects and mammals, prior to crossing the midline, commissural axons prevent premature responsiveness to Slit by regulating the expression and activity of Robo receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Evans et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Keleman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sabatier et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> a major mechanism that regulates repulsive signaling in pre-crossing axons is the negative regulation of Robo1 surface expression by Commissureless (Comm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Keleman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kidd et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Tear et al., 1996</xref>). Comm inhibition of Robo repulsion is absolutely required for midline crossing. Prior to midline crossing, Comm expression is upregulated in commissural neurons, in part by a mechanism involving the transcriptional activation function of the Frazzled (Fra) receptor intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Neuhaus-Follini and Bashaw, 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). Once commissural axons reach the midline, Comm is downregulated, so that Robo1-dependent Slit sensitivity is re-established, thereby preventing axons from re-crossing. Comm acts by diverting newly synthesized Robo1 into the late endosomal compartment, thus preventing Robo1 expression on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Keleman et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">2005</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">In contrast to Slit ligands and Robo receptors, the <italic>comm</italic> gene is apparently not conserved outside of insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Evans and Bashaw, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Keleman et al., 2002</xref>). This raises the critical question of how Robo1 surface levels are negatively regulated in commissural axons prior to crossing the floor plate in the mammalian spinal cord. Interestingly, in <italic>robo3</italic>−/− mutant mouse embryos, all spinal commissural axons fail to cross the midline, a phenotype resembling <italic>comm</italic> mutants in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sabatier et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, the absence of midline crossing in <italic>robo3</italic> mutants can be partially suppressed by the removal of <italic>robol</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sabatier et al., 2004</xref>). However, and in marked contrast to the role of Comm in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> Robo3 does not localize to endosomes and does not bind to Robo1. Most important, Robo3 does not inhibit Robo1 surface expression on pre-crossing commissural axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sabatier et al., 2004</xref>). More recent evidence indicates that Robo3 can contribute to midline axon attraction by potentiating the activity of the Netrin-1 receptor DCC, suggesting that the Robo3 phenotype is likely only partially dependent on its ability to inhibit Slit responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Zelina et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it remains unclear how Robo1 protein levels are kept low on pre-crossing axons in mammals and whether there is a Comm-like mechanism that operates in the developing spinal cord.</p>
<p id="P9">Here we report the discovery of a class of mammalian proteins with limited sequence similarity to the functional domain of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Comm that regulate mammalian Robo1 trafficking through an analogous mechanism. The Nedd4-family interacting proteins Ndfip1 (N4WBP5) and Ndfip2 (N4WBP5A) can serve as adaptor proteins to recruit Nedd4 E3 ligases to specific substrate proteins, leading to their ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Harvey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mund and Pelham, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Shearwin-Whyatt et al., 2004</xref>). Besides their role as adaptors, Ndfip proteins also act as activators of E3 ligase enzymatic activity by releasing the Nedd4 ligase from its auto-inhibitory conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mund and Pelham, 2009</xref>). In association with their downstream interacting E3 ligases, Ndfip proteins play important roles in regulating T cell differentiation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Layman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">O’Leary et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Oliver et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ramon et al., 2012</xref>). Several reports also suggest that Ndfip1 has neuronal functions, including regulating cortical development, neurite outgrowth, and dendrite development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Goh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hammond et al., 2014</xref>); however, it is unclear how Ndfip1 regulates these processes.</p>
<p id="P10">In this paper we show that, like Comm, Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 can prevent the surface expression of the mammalian Robo1 receptor by recruiting it to late endosomes <italic>in vitro.</italic> In addition to altering Robo1 localization, Ndfip proteins also trigger the ubiquitylation and degradation of the Robo1 receptor. The ability of Ndfip proteins to regulate Robo1 depends on HECT E3 ligases, because point mutations that disrupt the interaction of Ndfip proteins with E3 ligases or pharmacological inhibition of HECT E3 ligase activity result in the failure to reduce surface Robo1 levels. <italic>In vivo,</italic> Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 proteins are detected in commissural axons in the developing spinal cord. Finally, in <italic>Ndfip1</italic> and <italic>Ndfip2</italic> single- and double-knockout mice, Robo1 expression is increased in pre-crossing commissural axons in the spinal cord, and there is a significant reduction in midline crossing. On the basis of these observations, we propose that Ndfip proteins act analogously to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Comm to regulate mammalian Robo1 localization and then lead to receptor degradation through the recruitment of Nedd4-family E3 ubiquitin ligases. This intracellular trafficking mechanism is important to prevent commissural axons from prematurely responding to Slit.</p>

<title>RESULTS</title>
<sec id="S3">
<title>The NEDD4-Family Interacting Proteins Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 Share Similarities with Comm</title>
<p id="P11">We sought to identify proteins with any similarity to Comm in mammals by searching for proteins that share features of the short cytoplasmic domain that is conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mosquito Comm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Keleman et al., 2002</xref>). We find that this domain aligns with a region of Nedd4-family interacting proteins Ndfip1 and Ndfip2. These proteins share 60% similarity with the core 25 amino acid functional domain of Comm proteins, but outside of this region there is no obvious sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Ndfip proteins share many additional properties with Comm. Like Comm, Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 are localized to endosomes and have transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Shearwin-Whyatt et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, the Ndfip proteins both have cytoplasmic PPXY and LPXY motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mund and Pelham, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">2010</xref>). Last, Comm and the Ndfip proteins can both bind to HECT family E3 ubiquitin ligases, although the significance of this interaction for Comm function is unclear (see Discussion). In the case of the Ndfip proteins, it has been shown that they can also recruit these E3 ligases to proteins destined for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Howitt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mund and Pelham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Myat et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Ndfip Proteins Regulate the Levels and Localization of Robo1 <italic>In Vitro</italic></title>
<p id="P12">Because Ndfip proteins recruit E3 ubiquitin ligases and target their substrates for degradation, we first tested whether overexpression of these proteins regulates Robo protein levels <italic>in vitro.</italic> Strikingly, we found that expression of Ndfip1 or Ndfip2 reduces Robo1 levels in COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of Ndfip proteins has no effect on the steady-state levels of another closely related repulsive receptor, Robo2, indicating the specificity of Ndfip proteins toward Robo1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1C</xref>). To test if Ndfip proteins can regulate endogenous Robo1 levels, we transfected HeLa cells with Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 and monitored Robo1 protein levels. Consistent with our observation in COS-7 cells, overexpression of Ndfip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>) or Ndfip2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>) significantly reduces endogenous Robo1 levels but has no effect on the levels of the transmembrane integrin beta-1 receptor, further supporting the idea that the Ndfip proteins specifically regulate Robo1. To test whether Robo1 levels could be regulated by other PY motif-containing proteins, or if instead this effect is specific to the Ndfip proteins, we also performed similar experiments with Itch (a PY motif-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase) and found that overexpression of Itch has no significant effect on Robo1 levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1G</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">Ndfip proteins localize to endosomes and target their substrates for degradation; therefore, we examined whether ectopic expression of Ndfip proteins influence the subcellular localization of Robo1. As expected, when expressed in COS-7 cells, the majority of Robo1 is localized to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). Remarkably, upon overexpression of either Ndfip1 or Ndfip2, the intensity of plasma membrane localized Robo1 is significantly reduced, and a majority of the perinuclear and cytoplasmic Robo1 is co-localized with Ndfip proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref>). The distribution of hRobo1 in the presence of Ndfip proteins is quite similar to the distribution of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Robo1 in COS-7 cells overexpressing Comm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Keleman et al., 2002</xref>). On the basis of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Harvey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Shearwin-Whyatt et al., 2004</xref>), and our observation that Ndfip proteins predominantly localize to the Rab7 positive late endosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>), these sites of Robo1 and Ndfip co-localization are likely to be late endosomes. Our data indicate that Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 can regulate the levels and localization of Robo1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and suggest that they do so through a mechanism that may be analogous to the way that Comm regulates Robo1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>
<p id="P14">Because Ndfip proteins serve as adapters between E3 ubiquitin ligases and specific substrate proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Foot et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mund and Pelham, 2009</xref>), we tested whether Ndfip proteins bind to Robo1. We find that Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 are both coimmunoprecipitated with Robo1, indicating that Robo1 and Ndfip proteins can physically interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A</xref>). To test whether these interactions could be detected under more physiological conditions, we also performed immunoprecipitation from mouse brain homogenates using Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 antibodies and found that Robo1 immunoprecipitated with both Ndfip1 and Ndfip2, indicating that they form a complex <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3C</xref>). Together these results suggest that Ndfip proteins interact with Robo1, potentially leading to its subsequent redistribution and degradation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 Decrease Surface Robo1 Expression</title>
<p id="P15">The results described above indicate that Ndfip proteins share Comm’s ability to bind to and regulate the subcellular localization and expression levels of Robo1. A key feature of the Comm sorting model is that Comm acts to negatively regulate the surface expression of Robo; therefore, we next examined whether Ndfip proteins also reduce surface expression of Robo1. We monitored the levels of Robo1 present on the plasma membrane by immunostaining prior to fixation and permeabilization. Cells transfected with Robo1 display high levels of Robo1 on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A′</xref>). In contrast, surface Robo1 intensity is significantly reduced in cells co-expressing Ndfip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B′</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) or Ndfip2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C′</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), indicating that Ndfip proteins can reduce Robo1 surface levels. To more carefully quantify the effect of Ndfip proteins on Robo1 surface expression, we used a surface biotinylation assay. Cells co-expressing Robo1 and Ndfip proteins were subjected to chemical coupling with biotin, and the surface fractions were isolated. In cells transfected with Robo1 alone, a significant amount of biotinylated Robo1 is present. However, we detect significantly less surface Robo1 in cells transfected with either Ndfip1 or Ndfip2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). Together these results provide strong evidence that Ndfip proteins can negatively regulate total and surface Robo1 levels when expressed in heterologous COS-7 cells.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 Promote Robo1 Ubiquitylation and Degradation</title>
<p id="P16">Given the potent effect of Ndfip proteins on Robo1 localization and surface expression, we sought to determine the biochemical mechanism underlying Ndfip-mediated Robo1 degradation. Previous studies have shown that Ndfip proteins interact with E3 ubiquitin ligases and promote their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mund and Pelham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Riling et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, these proteins also interact with substrate proteins to facilitate the recruitment of E3 ligases, thus promoting ubiquitin dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Foot et al., 2008</xref>). Because Robo1 levels are reduced upon overexpression of Ndfip proteins, we hypothesized that Ndfip proteins promote Robo1 ubiquitylation, thus marking it for subsequent degradation. To test the ubiquitylation status of Robo1, we co-expressed it with Ndfip proteins and FLAG-tagged ubiquitin and performed immunoprecipitation studies followed by western blot analysis with anti-FLAG antibodies. We observe minimal Robo1 ubiquitylation under basal conditions. Although the amount of ubiquitylated Robo1 varied between cells expressing Ndfip1 and Ndfip2, overexpression of either protein significantly increases Robo1 ubiquitylation compared with basal conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4B</xref>). To investigate the effect of the two major degradative pathways on the fate of ubiquitylated Robo1, we treated the cells with proteasomal (MG132) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>) and lysosomal (chloroquine [CQ]) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>) inhibitors. To our surprise, ubiquitylated Robo1 is stabilized and detected at higher levels upon treatment with both of these inhibitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4B</xref>), indicating the possible involvement of both pathways in clearance of ubiquitylated Robo1.</p>
<p id="P17">On the basis of these observations, we reasoned that these inhibitors should also prevent the degradation of Robo1 and stabilize Robo1 protein levels in cells overexpressing Ndfip proteins. Indeed, overexpression of either Ndfip1 or Ndfip2 results in reduced levels of Robo1, while neither Ndfip1 nor Ndfip2 proteins promote Robo1 degradation in cells treated with CQ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4C</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4E</xref>). MG132 treatment significantly restores Robo protein levels in Ndfip1-expressing cells, but it does not restore Robo protein levels in Ndfip2 expressing cells. These results suggest that both proteosomal and lysosomal pathways are involved in Robo1 clearance and that Ndfip2 may selectively target Robo for lysosomal degradation. It is interesting to note that both Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 protein levels are also stabilized upon the treatment with MG132 and CQ. Together, our data provide evidence that Ndfip proteins mark Robo1 for ubiquitin dependent degradation through proteasomal and lysosomal pathways.</p>

<p id="P18">It has been shown that the PY motifs of both Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 are important for their interaction with the WW domains of E3 ubiquitin ligases, and this interaction is also known to enhance E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Foot et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mund and Pelham, 2009</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that mutation of the PY motifs in Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 would prevent Robo1 protein re-localization and degradation. To test this idea, we co-expressed Ndfip proteins bearing mutations in their PY motifs with Robo1 in COS-7 cells. Robo1 is strongly expressed on the cell surface and in a perinuclear location in control-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), while cells expressing either Ndfip1 or Ndfip2 result in reduced plasma membrane expression of Robo1 and co-localization of Robo and Ndfip proteins in the endosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Conversely, co-expression of PY mutant form of Ndfip proteins fails to reduce the plasma membrane localization of Robo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>), suggesting that these motifs are critical for Ndfip proteins to regulate Robo1. Mutation of the PY motifs does not appear to significantly alter the localization of the Ndfip proteins themselves, as both proteins are still predominantly co-localized with late endosomal markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>); however, the PY mutant form of Ndfip1 is expressed at much higher levels than wild-type Ndfip1, suggesting that preventing its association with HECT ligases leads to stabilization of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p>
<p id="P19">Next, we used surface biotinylation to measure the amount of Robo1 on the cell surface in COS-7 cells expressing PY mutant forms of Ndfip proteins. Consistent with our previous observations, the amount of surface Robo1 is reduced in cells expressing Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>), as indicated by reduced levels of biotinylated Robo1 in these cells. In marked contrast, biotinylated Robo1 levels are significantly restored in cells transfected with PY mutant forms of either Ndfip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>) or Ndfip2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). It is interesting to note that PY mutated Ndfip1 completely restores cell surface Robo1, while PY mutated Ndfip2 results only in a partial restoration of surface Robo1, suggesting that the mutant version of Ndfip2 still retains some ability to regulate Robo1. Importantly, total Robo1 protein levels are also significantly restored in cells transfected with PY mutant forms of either Ndfip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3J</xref>) or Ndfip2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3K</xref>). This suggests that the ability of Ndfip proteins to recruit HECT E3 ligases through their PY motifs is required for Ndfip proteins to reduce Robo1 receptor levels at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3L</xref>).</p>
<p id="P20">Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 enhance the catalytic activity of HECT domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligases by inducing conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mund and Pelham, 2009</xref>). Because overexpression of Ndfip proteins promotes ubiquitylation of Robo1 (as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4B</xref>), we reasoned that HECT E3 ligase activity should also be required for the regulation of Robo1 levels. In order to test this prediction, we used a specific HECT ligase small molecule inhibitor, Heclin, which inhibits several HECT ligases in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Mund et al., 2014</xref>). We measured the level of Robo1 ubiquitylation and degradation in Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 transfected COS-7 cells in the presence or absence of Heclin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>, the amount of Robo1 ubiquitylation is strongly increased in both Ndfip1 and Ndfip2-transfected cells. However, Robo1 ubiquitylation is significantly attenuated in cells that are treated with Heclin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). Likewise, Heclin also inhibits degradation of Robo1 in cells expressing Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3I</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3K</xref>), indicating the importance of HECT E3 ligase activity in Ndfip-mediated Robo1 degradation. Collectively, our data provide compelling evidence that the PY motifs of Ndfip proteins and an active HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase complex are important for the regulation of Ndfip-dependent Robo1 turnover <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3M</xref>).</p>

<title>Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 Are Expressed in Spinal Commissural Neurons</title>
<p id="P21">To examine potential <italic>in vivo</italic> roles for the Ndfip proteins during axon guidance, we first performed mRNA <italic>in situ</italic> analysis to examine Ndfip transcript expression during embryonic stages when spinal commissural axons are growing toward and crossing the floor plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Both Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 transcripts are specifically and robustly expressed in E10.5 and E11.5 spinal cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Ndfip1 is enriched in the floor plate region, motor column and in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), while Ndfip2 mRNA appears to be more uniformly expressed. Expression of both Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 mRNA is higher in E11.5, and signal is detected in the dorsal spinal cord in areas occupied by commissural neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, arrows). These patterns of mRNA expression are specific, as no signal is detected using sense control probes and specific signals are absent in sections from <italic>Ndfip</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>).</p>
<p id="P22">Antibody staining reveals that Ndfip1 is strongly expressed in the region of the floor plate during embryonic stages E10.5–E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). In addition, we also observe Ndfip1 signal in motor neurons and in the DRG. Co-localization of Ndfip1 with TAG1, a cell surface protein that is expressed on pre-crossing commissural axons, indicates that Ndfip1 is expressed within a subset of commissural axons, which can be detected at both E10.5 and E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). Intriguingly, like TAG1, Ndfip1 protein is not detected at high levels in post-crossing commissural axons, as shown by complementary domains of expression for Ndfip1 and Robo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). Additional co-labeling experiments with Ndfip1 and DCC, Robo3, and L1CAM also support the conclusion that Ndfip1 is enriched in the pre-crossing portions of commissural axons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). This pattern of expression is consistent with a potential role in the transient regulation of Robo1 surface expression. Importantly, Ndfip1 protein expression is decreased in spinal cord sections from Ndfip1 mutants at all stages examined (E10.5, E11.5, and E12.5) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). Because existing Ndfip2 antibodies do not work well for immunohistochemistry on tissue sections, we took advantage of the fact that the Ndfip2 mutants were generated by replacing the Ndfip2 coding sequence with a GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">O’Leary et al., 2016</xref>). Examination of GFP expression in Ndfip2-GFP heterozygous mice reveals strong expression of Ndfip2 during stages when spinal commissural axons are growing toward and crossing the floor plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Co-labeling with GFP and TAG1 or DCC reveals clear expression in commissural neurons at E10.5 and E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4H</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4J</xref>). Because we are detecting Ndfip2 expression with the GFP reporter, it is unclear whether, like Ndfip1, Ndfip2 protein is also enriched in pre-crossing commissural axons: we can only conclude that Ndfip2 is indeed expressed in commissural neurons at these stages. To further explore the expression of Ndfip proteins in commissural axons, we generated primary cultures of dorsal spinal cord neurons from E12.5 wild-type mice and co-labeled for Ndfip1 and either DCC or TAG1. In both cases we observe clear Ndfip1 expression in DCC and TAG1-positive dorsal commissural axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4L</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Ndfip1</italic> and <italic>Ndfip2</italic> Mutants Show a Reduction in Midline Crossing</title>
<p id="P23">To examine the role of Ndfip proteins in commissural axon guidance, we analyzed embryonic spinal commissural axons in <italic>Ndfip1</italic>- and <italic>Ndfip2</italic>-knockout mice. Ndfip1 mutants were generated by the insertion of a gene trap vector in the Ndfip1 locus, which results in disruption of the <italic>Ndfip1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Oliver et al., 2006</xref>). On the basis of analysis of Ndfip1 transcripts in these mice, the gene trap insertion was demonstrated to completely abolish Ndfip1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Oliver et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Ndfip2</italic> mutant mice were generated by replacing the Ndfip2 coding sequence with a GFP reporter as described above. RNA <italic>in situ</italic> analysis on Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 mutants and controls indicates that these mutants completely remove Ndfip transcripts, and using an anti-Ndfip1 antibody, we further confirmed that the overall signal for Ndfip1 is reduced in <italic>Ndfip1</italic> mutant embryonic spinal cords compared with wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). We analyzed commissural axon guidance defects in <italic>Ndfip</italic> mutant embryos by immunostaining transverse sections of the spinal cord with antibodies to the commissural axon markers, TAG1 and Robo3. There is a significant reduction in TAG1-positive commissural axons crossing the floor plate at the ventral midline in <italic>Ndfip1</italic> and <italic>Ndfip2</italic> mutant embryos at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). There is also a significant decrease in the thickness of Robo3-positive commissural axon bundle crossing the floor plate in both mutants at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). At E11.5, the reduction of both TAG1-positive and Robo3-positive commissure thickness in <italic>Ndfip1</italic> and <italic>Ndfip2</italic> mutant embryos is more modest, but it is still significantly different from littermate controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>). Interestingly, Robo3-positive pre-crossing commissural axons exhibited abnormal pathfinding and are defasciculated in the mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, arrowheads). Taken together, our results strongly suggest that Ndfip proteins act <italic>in vivo</italic> to support the timely midline crossing of a significant number of commissural axons.</p>
<p id="P24">Because Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 proteins are both capable of downregulating Robo1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and because the single mutants reveal only partial disruption in midline crossing, we next sought to evaluate the consequence of simultaneous removal of both Ndfip1 and Ndfip2. We focused our analysis on E11.5 because at earlier stages (E10.5) Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 single mutants can result in a near complete absence of midline crossing of TAG1-positive axons and to reduce the chance that observed reductions in crossing could be due to developmental delay. As predicted, if Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 work together to promote midline crossing, we find that double mutants have significantly stronger disruptions in midline crossing than Ndfip2 single-mutant sibling controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Enhanced crossing defects are observed with both TAG1 and Robo3 antibodies. These observations are consistent with the idea that Ndfip proteins act in parallel to promote midline crossing.</p>
<p id="P25">In order to more carefully evaluate the role of Ndfip proteins in the regulation of commissural axon guidance, we performed a series of unilateral dye-labeling experiments to document the behavior of small groups of axons as they approach and cross the midline. E12.5 spinal cords were dissected in open-book preparations from embryos generated by crossing <italic>Ndfip1</italic><sup>+/−</sup>, <italic>Ndfip2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice with <italic>Ndfip1</italic><sup>+/−</sup>, <italic>Ndfip2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, and Dil was injected into one side of the dorsal spinal cord. In wild-type controls, the majority of labeled axons at E12.5 have crossed the midline and have turned anteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). In contrast, labeled axons in Ndfip2<sup>−/−</sup> spinal cords frequently stop and fail to make the correct anterior turn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>). In double-mutant spinal cords, these phenotypes are significantly stronger than those observed in the Ndfip2 single-mutant cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6I</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6K</xref>). In addition, we sometimes observe ipsilateral mis-projections in the spinal cord of Ndfip double mutants (~20% of injection sites) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6M</xref>). We do not observe these phenotypes in wild-type or single mutants, again suggesting that removing both Ndfip genes results in stronger axon guidance defects than single mutants. Combined with data from transverse sections of the spinal cord, these observations further support the model that Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 act in parallel to promote the guidance of spinal commissural axons across the midline.</p>

<title>Robo1 Levels Are Increased in <italic>Ndfip1</italic> and <italic>Ndfip2</italic> Mutants</title>
<p id="P26">The <italic>Ndfip1</italic> and <italic>Ndfip2</italic> mutant phenotypes in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8</xref>) are consistent with the idea that some spinal commissural axons fail to cross the floor plate because of elevated expression of Robo, which in turn leads to a premature response to Slit. To test whether the loss of Ndfip1 alters Robo1 levels and localization in commissural axons, we used immunofluorescence to monitor the levels of Robo1 in <italic>Ndfip1</italic> and <italic>Ndfip2</italic> in single- or double-mutant embryos. In wild-type E11.5 embryos, Robo1 is localized primarily to the post-crossing portion of commissural axons, with low levels detected on pre-crossing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>, arrows) and crossing commissural axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>, arrowheads). However, in <italic>Ndfip1</italic> mutant embryos, there is a significant elevation of Robo1 levels in pre-crossing commissural axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>, arrows with asterisks, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>) compared with wild-type embryos. There is also a small but significant elevation of Robo1 expression in <italic>Ndfip2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>), and Robo1 expression is further increased in <italic>Ndfip1, Ndfip2</italic> double mutants relative to <italic>Ndfip1</italic> or <italic>Ndfip2</italic> single mutants. Together with our <italic>in vitro</italic> data, these observations suggest that Ndfip proteins promote midline crossing in the mammalian spinal cord by sorting Robo1 for degradation. To further support an <italic>in vivo</italic> role for Ndfip1 in the negative regulation of Robo1 expression, we also examined the levels of Robo1 in <italic>Ndfip1</italic> mutant adult brain and spinal cord extracts.

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P27">In this paper, we have described the role of Ndfip proteins in controlling midline crossing through the regulation of Robo1 levels in the mammalian spinal cord. <italic>In vitro</italic> biochemical analyses show that Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 can regulate mammalian Robo1 receptor levels by acting as adaptors to recruit HECT E3 ligases, leading to the ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of Robo1 via the lysosomal and proteosomal pathways. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies demonstrate the specificity of Ndfip proteins in the regulation of the Robo1 receptor. Inhibition of HECT E3 ligases or expression of Ndfip proteins that cannot bind to E3 ligases disrupts the ability of Ndfip proteins to regulate Robo1 surface levels, indicating that the negative regulation of Robo1 requires an active Ndfip-HECT E3 ligase complex. Ndfip proteins are expressed in commissural axons, and in the absence of Ndfip1 or Ndfip2, we observe a significant reduction in midline crossing in the spinal cord and a significant increase in Robo1 expression. Simultaneous removal of Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 in double mutants leads to significantly stronger phenotypes consistent with the idea that the Ndfip proteins act in parallel to regulate spinal commissural axon guidance. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that Ndfip proteins function analogously to Comm to regulate mammalian Robo1 by recruiting it to endosomes. Furthermore, our biochemical data define an intracellular trafficking pathway consisting of Ndfip adaptor proteins and HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases that act together to promote Robo1 ubiquitylation and its subsequent degradation in lysosomal and proteasomal compartments. We propose that Ndfip/E3 ligase-mediated sorting and degradation of Robo1 in pre-crossing commissural axons in the developing spinal cord ensures midline crossing by preventing the premature response to Slit.</p>

<title>Mammalian Ndfip Proteins Act Analogously to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Comm to Regulate Robo</title>
<p id="P28">Several lines of evidence indicate that Comm can recruit the Robo1 receptor directly to endosomes before it reaches the cell surface and that this sorting function is important for controlling axon crossing at the fly embryonic midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Keleman et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">2005</xref>). Our results indicate that Ndfip proteins regulate mammalian Robo1 in a Comm-like manner. In support of this, (1) Ndfip proteins can bind to Robo1 and re-localize it to endosomes, (2) overexpression of Ndfip proteins can strongly downregulate Robo1 surface expression, (3) point mutations in the PY motifs in Ndfip proteins prevent the regulation of Robo1 protein levels and localization, (4) Ndfip proteins are expressed in commissural neurons, and (5) <italic>Ndfip1</italic> and <italic>Ndfip2</italic> single mutants result in a failure of some commissural axons to cross the midline and these defects are enhanced in <italic>Ndfip1, Ndfip2</italic> double mutants. It is important to point out that despite an increase in the strength of the midline crossing phenotypes relative to single <italic>Ndfip</italic> mutants, many axons are still able to cross the floor plate in the <italic>Ndfip1, Ndfip2</italic> double mutants. This contrasts with Comm in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> in which mutations in <italic>comm</italic> result in the complete absence of midline crossing in the embryonic CNS. This is perhaps not that surprising given the increased complexity of midline guidance mechanisms and the abundance of molecules that act to normally promote crossing in the mammalian CNS, including Netrin, Shh, VegF, and their respective receptors, as well as Robo3. It would seem that the level of increased Robo repulsion resulting from manipulations to Ndfip proteins is not sufficient to prevent all midline crossing. This could be explained either by the activities of pro-crossing pathways that are unaffected by these manipulations and/or additional mechanisms that act in conjunction with Ndfip-dependent trafficking. Interestingly, a recently published report suggests that an additional mammalian protein, PRRG4, shares some sequence features and <italic>in vitro</italic> properties with <italic>Drosophila comm;</italic> however, the expression and function of this protein in the developing spinal cord have not been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Justice et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest the existence of functional conservation of Robo1 receptor sorting in flies and mammals to control midline crossing, despite the fact that the molecules that fulfill this function are not encoded by homologous genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>).</p>
<p id="P29">Our favored interpretation of the loss-of-function phenotypes in <italic>Ndfip</italic> mutants is that the defects in midline crossing that we observe stem from the elevated expression of Robo1. However, it is possible that the Ndfip defects may be due to effects on other substrate proteins that we have not analyzed. For example, Ndfip proteins could regulate other pathways involved in switching axon responses at the midline. Semaphorin3B-PlexinA1 repulsion is also inhibited before midline crossing, and Plexin protein expression is also regulated during midline crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Nawabi et al., 2010</xref>). It is also interesting to note that we actually observe a significant decrease of Robo3 expression in Ndfip1 mutant adult brains relative to control, suggesting a possible indirect link between Ndfip1 and Robo3 in adult brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>). Importantly, this reduction in Robo3 expression levels was not observed in the embryonic spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9</xref>) or in adult spinal cord extracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>). In contrast, Ndfip proteins are sufficient to decrease levels of Robo3 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>); however, unlike Robo1, we do not observe any increase in Robo3 expression in <italic>Ndfip</italic> mutants in any of the tissues or developmental stages we have examined, suggesting that the regulation of Robo3 by Ndfip proteins may be context specific. A rigorous evaluation of the contribution of the altered levels of Robo1 receptor expression to the <italic>in vivo</italic> mutant phenotypes of Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 will necessitate the generation and analysis of double and triple mutants between Robo1, Ndfip1, and Ndfip2. On the basis of our <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical data and the expression patterns of Ndfip proteins, we favor the interpretation that Ndfip proteins function cell-autonomously in commissural neurons; however, a rigorous demonstration of this will await the future analysis of conditional removal of Ndfip proteins.</p>

<title>Requirement of E3 Ubiquitin Ligases in the Regulation of the Mammalian Robo1 Receptor</title>
<p id="P30">Several guidance receptors are known to be regulated by intracellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">O’Donnell et al., 2009</xref>). For example, Semaphorin3A-induced endocytosis of Neuropilin-1 has been shown to be important for growth cone collapse during axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Castellani et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> Comm allows axon growth across the midline by sorting Robo from new membrane vesicles to late endosomes before they can be delivered to the growth cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Keleman et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">2005</xref>). It has been proposed that Comm’s ability to regulate surface levels of Robo depends on Comm’s interaction with and ubiquitylation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Myat et al., 2002</xref>). However, the observation that a mutant version of Comm that cannot be ubiquitylated can restore Comm’s activity and that <italic>Nedd4</italic> zygotic null mutants have no commissural guidance defects <italic>in vivo</italic> argues against the requirement for Nedd4 and Comm ubiquitylation in midline crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Keleman et al., 2005</xref>). Here we have shown that Ndfip proteins recruit Nedd4-family E3 ubiquitin ligases that ubiquitylate Robo1 receptors and lead to their subsequent proteosomal and lysosomal degradation. Whether Comm also recruits E3 ligases to drive the ubiquitylation and degradation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Robo receptors remains to be tested. Given that multiple studies have demonstrated that in addition to regulating Robo localization, Comm also negatively regulates Robo protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gilestro, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kidd et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Myat et al., 2002</xref>), it is surprising that the ubiquitylation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Robo receptor has not been investigated. It is worth noting here that in addition to Nedd4, there are two other Nedd4 family members in <italic>Drosophila:</italic> Suppressor of deltex (Su[dx]) and dSmurf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dalton et al., 2011</xref>); thus, whether E3 ubiquitin ligase activity is required in <italic>Drosophila</italic> for the regulation of Robo during midline crossing is still an open question.</p>
<p id="P31">In mammals, the Nedd4 family has further expanded and includes Nedd4 (Nedd4-1), Nedd4L (Nedd4-2), Itch, WWP1, WWP2, Smurf1, Smurf2, NEDL1, and NEDL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Ingham et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Rotin and Kumar, 2009</xref>). Nedd4 is a positive regulator of cell proliferation and animal growth. <italic>Nedd4</italic> mutant mice are small, and <italic>Nedd4</italic> mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have less mitogenic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Fouladkou et al., 2008</xref>). SMURFs have a major role in the regulation of TGF beta signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Massagué and Gomis, 2006</xref>), whereas ITCH regulates the immune system by controlling the levels of its substrate, JUNB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gao et al., 2004</xref>). Recent evidence also suggests that Nedd4-family E3 ligases promote axonal growth and branching in the developing mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hsia et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, several of these Nedd4 ligases are strongly expressed in the post-natal mouse spinal cord (The Allen Brain Atlas [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mousespinal.brain-map.org/">http://mousespinal.brain-map.org/</ext-link>]).</p>
<p id="P32">Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 are a subset of proteins that interact with Nedd4 E3 ligases to modulate their enzymatic activity and substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mund and Pelham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Riling et al., 2015</xref>).

Although our <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical data using Ndfip proteins with mutations in their PY motifs and the HECT E3 ligase inhibitor Heclin strongly suggest the involvement of Nedd4 ligases in the regulation of mammalian Robo1 levels and axon guidance <italic>in vivo,</italic> the requirement for and identity of the specific Nedd4-family E3 ligases await future investigation.</p>

<title>How Is the Expression of Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 Regulated in the Developing Spinal Cord?</title>
<p id="P33">Our <italic>in vivo</italic> expression data that Ndfip1 is specifically expressed in commissural axons that are crossing the midline suggest that it may promote their crossing by decreasing Robo1. How is this spatial expression of Ndfip regulated? In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> Comm expression is regulated partly by Fra, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of the DCC receptor. The intracellular domain of Fra is released by γ-secretase proteolysis and functions as a transcriptional activator to induce <italic>Comm</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Neuhaus-Follini and Bashaw, 2015b</xref>). Interestingly, DCC is also proteolytically processed, and its intracellular domain can enter the nucleus to regulate gene expression <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Taniguchi et al., 2003</xref>). It will be interesting to determine if DCC has a role in the transcriptional regulation of Ndfip1 and/or Ndfip2 during the development of the spinal cord.</p>
<p id="P34">In addition to potential transcriptional regulation, the levels of Ndfip proteins are known to be regulated post-translationally through ubiquitylation mediated by Nedd4-family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Harvey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Shearwin-Whyatt et al., 2004</xref>). In this regard, it is interesting to note that mutating the PY motifs of Ndfip1 has a profound stabilizing effect on the Ndfip1 protein itself, consistent with previous reports that Ndfip1 is itself a target for E3-ligase dependent degradation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). This stabilizing effect of the PY mutations is much more pronounced for Ndfip1 than Ndfip2. The possibility that Ndfip1 could be ubiquitylated and degraded together with its substrate would also be consistent with a role in the transient downregulation of Robo1. Finally, another post-translational modification, phosphorylation, may also have a role in controlling Ndfip expression of activity, as it has been shown that Ndfip proteins undergo EGFR dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Mund and Pelham, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Robo, Ndfip, and Nedd4 Family Proteins in Developmental Disorders</title>
<p id="P35">Disruption of Slit-Robo signaling and altered regulation of axon guidance receptor levels more generally are implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and in movement disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Blockus and Chédotal, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Jen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Suda et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, mutations in genes encoding HECT E3 ligases have been characterized in patients with severe intellectual disability and ASDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ambrozkiewicz and Kawabe, 2015</xref>). Thus, further investigation of the molecular function of Ndfip proteins and HECT E3 ligases in the regulation of Slit-Robo signaling in the developing and adult nervous system may provide new insights in the pathophysiology of diverse developmental disorders.</p>

<title>QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</title>
<p id="P49">Embryos were scored blind to genotype. Data are presented as mean values ± s.e.m. All statistical analyses were performed using the Student’s t test. All statistics and graphs were generated using Microsoft Excel. Differences were considered significant when p &lt; 0.05. The thickness of spinal commissural bundle was quantified for each embryo on five to eight sections per embryo. Three to four embryos of each genotype were quantified. The ratio of the commissural axon bundle size was normalized to wild-type or heterozygous sibling controls. In order to control for any variability in the size of embryo, the values of commissure thickness were normalized with length of spinal cord. For western blots, densitometry analysis was performed and quantified from three independent experiments and normalized with tubulin levels. For surface labeling, fluorescence intensity was measured as mean gray value (integrated density/area) by drawing an outer and inner rings on either side of cell surface using ImageJ.</p>

<p id="P56">(B and C) Cos-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with Myc-Robo1 (0.5 μg) and with N-terminally HA-tagged Ndfip1 (B) or Ndfip2 (C) (0.5 μg) expression constructs. 48 h after transfection, cell extracts were prepared and analyzed using western blotting with anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies. Robo1 levels are strongly reduced in cells transfected with either Ndfip1 or Ndfip2 (Ndfip1: 0.56 ± 0.09, p = 0.013; Ndfip2: 0.194 ± 0.06, p = 0.002).</p>
<p id="P57">(D and E) HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either HA-tagged Ndfip1 (D) or Ndfip2 (E) (0.5 μg) expression constructs, and the levels of endogenous Robo1 protein were analyzed using anti-Robo1 antibody. Endogenous Robo1 levels were reduced in both Ndfip1- and Ndfip2-transfected cells (Ndfip1: 0.62 ± 0.04, p = 0.005; Ndfip2: 0.50 ± 0.02, p = 0.0009), but integrin beta-1 receptor levels are unaltered. An anti-Tubulin antibody was used to control for equal protein loading.</p>

Surface expression of Robo1 was visualized by staining the N-terminal Myc tag before fixation and permeabilization (A–C, green). The HA staining reveals the expression of Ndfip1 (B′, red) and Ndfip2 (C′, red). DRAQ-5 is a nuclear marker. Co-expression of Ndfip1 or Ndfip2 with Robo1 leads to a significant decrease in Robo1 at the cell surface.</p>

Significance was assessed using Student’s t test (**p &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p id="P66">(E) HeLa cells transiently transfected with Myc-Robo1 and Ndfip1-HA or Ndfip2-HA plasmids. 48 h after transfection, cell surface proteins isolated using biotinylation were analyzed using western blot using anti-Myc antibody (top panel). Levels of total Robo1 and the expression of Ndfip proteins were analyzed using western blot using anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies, respectively. An anti-Tubulin antibody was used to control for equal protein loading. Biotinylated surface Robo1 levels are strongly reduced in Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 transfected cells (Ndfip1: 0.60 ± 0.103, p = 0.022; Ndfip2: 0.006 ± 0.004; p = 0.0014).</p>

<p id="P80">(A and B) mRNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization reveals clear expression of Ndfip1(A) and Ndfip2 (B) in E10.5 and E11.5 mouse spinal cord. mRNA probes to the sense strand serve as controls for the specificity of Ndfip1 (A) and Ndfip2 (B) expression. Yellow arrows in the E11.5 images show expression in regions of dorsal commissural axon cell bodies.</p>
<p id="P81">(C) Representative confocal images of transverse sections of wild-type mouse spinal cord from E10.5 to E12.5 labeled with anti-Ndfip1 antibody. Ndfip1 is expressed at the floor plate, in the motor column, and in DRGs.</p>
<p id="P82">(D) Anti-GFP immunostaining of E10, E10.5, and E11.5 of embryos reveals the pattern of Ndfip2 expression. Embryos are heterozygous for an allele of Ndfip2 where the coding sequence has been replaced by a GFP reporter. Commissural axons are clearly labeled by E11.5.</p>
<p id="P83">(E–G) Higher magnification images of E10.5 and E11.5 spinal cord sections illustrate co-labeling of Ndfip1 and TAG1 (E and F) or Robo1 (G) in the ventral commissure. Co-localization of Ndfip1 with TAG1-positive commissural axons demonstrates the commissural axonal expression of Ndfip1.</p>
<p id="P84">(H–J) Higher magnification of anti-GFP immunostaining of E10.5 and E11.5 of Ndfip2-GFP heterozygous embryos reveals co-labeling of Ndfip2 and TAG1 (H and I) or DCC (J) in the ventral commissure.</p>
<p id="P85">(K and L) Double immunostaining of Ndfip1 (K and L, green) and DCC (K, red) or TAG1 (L, red) in dissociated commissural neurons showing the expression of Ndfip1 in the cell body, axon and growth cone of commissural neurons.</p>

Robo3-positive axons are defasciculated at E10.5 (arrows) with a few axons observed in the motor column in E10.5 <italic>Ndfip1</italic> mutant embryos.</p>
<p id="P91">(E and F) Quantification of TAG1-positive (E) and Robo3-positive (F) commissure thickness at E10.5. The thickness of the axon bundle at the ventral midline is represented as commissure size in wild-type and <italic>Ndfip1</italic> or <italic>Ndfip2</italic> mutant embryos. In order to control for any variation in size of the embryos, the values of commissure thickness were normalized with the length of the spinal cord (distance between the floor plate and roof plate using ImageJ). Data were normalized to sibling controls. There was a significant reduction in either TAG1- or Robo3-positive commissural axon bundle thickness at the ventral midline at E10.5. The quantifications show the mean and SEM of five to eight sections per embryo, with n = 3 embryos for <italic>Ndfip1</italic> heterozygotes and mutants, n = 3 embryos for <italic>Ndfip2</italic> heterozygotes, and n = 4 for <italic>Ndfip2</italic> mutants.</p>

<p id="P95">(E–L) Confocal images of Dil injections in E12.5 spinal cord open-book preparations labeling commissural axons. The majority of axons in open-book preparations of wild-type embryos cross the floor plate and turn anteriorly on the contralateral side (E and F). In contrast, labeled axons in <italic>Ndfip2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> spinal cords frequently stop short and fail to make the correct anterior turn (G).
