<p>Simultaneous impairment of Purkinje cell inhibitory input and parallel fiber LTD severely affects cerebellar learning.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning has been used extensively to study the neural mechanisms underlying associative and motor learning. During this simple learning task, memory formation takes place at Purkinje cells in defined areas of the cerebellar cortex, which acquire a strong temporary suppression of their activity during conditioning. Yet, it is unknown which neuronal plasticity mechanisms mediate this suppression. Two potential mechanisms include long-term depression of parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses and feed-forward inhibition by molecular layer interneurons. We show, using a triple transgenic approach, that only concurrent disruption of both these suppression mechanisms can severely impair conditioning, highlighting that both processes can compensate for each other’s deficits.</p>

<body><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>During eyeblink conditioning, subjects typically hear a short beep or see a light [conditional stimulus (CS)] followed several hundred milliseconds later by an air puff on the eye [unconditional stimulus (US)]. As a result of repeated CS-US pairings, subjects will eventually learn to close their eye in response to the CS, which is called the conditioned response (CR). The CR is not simply a static reflex, but instead an acquired, precisely timed eyelid movement, the kinetic profile of which depends on the temporal interval between the CS and the US (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) [for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>)]. During Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning, memory formation takes place in Purkinje cells (PCs) of defined areas of the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>). These PCs receive inputs from the mossy fiber–parallel fiber (PF) system, which conveys sensory CS signals and input from single climbing fibers (CFs), which transmit the instructive US signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). During the conditioning process, these PCs acquire a well-timed suppression of their simple spike firing in response to the CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>), thereby temporarily disinhibiting the cerebellar nuclei, which drive the overt eyeblink CR.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Eyeblink conditioning setup and confirmation that <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice lack both PF-PC LTD and MLI-PC FFI.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mice were placed in a light- and sound-isolating chamber on a freely moving foam treadmill with their head fixed at a horizontal bar. The US consisted of a weak air puff, and the CS was a green light-emitting diode (LED) light. Eyelid movements were recorded with the magnetic distance measurement technique (MDMT). In vivo PC recordings were performed on the same treadmill system. (<bold>B</bold>) Neural circuits essential and sufficient for eyeblink conditioning, explained in detail in the main text.

Most models on eyeblink conditioning assume a critical role for long-term depression (LTD) of the PF-PC synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). However, PCs show high firing frequencies that are intrinsically generated, even when the PF input is silenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>), and animal models lacking PF-PC LTD can have completely normal eyeblink conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>). A second contribution, which, in principle, may actively suppress the intrinsic PC simple spike activity, could be provided by molecular layer interneurons (MLIs), since they provide the PC with a powerful feed-forward inhibition (FFI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>). However, removal of MLI-PC FFI induces compensation at the PF-PC synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>) and only mildly impairs eyeblink conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>).</p><p>Here, we asked this question: To what extent does a concurrent disruption of PF-PC LTD and MLI-PC FFI affect Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning? To this end, we developed a mouse line in which we aimed to block both synaptic processes simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). We generated <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice by crossing <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7</italic> knock-in (KI) mice with <italic>L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> knockout (KO) mice. <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7</italic> KI mice have impaired PF-PC LTD, because they lack the last seven amino acids at the intracellular C-terminal tail, which hampers the interaction of GluR2 with PICK1 (protein interacting with C kinase 1) and GRIP1/2 (glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 and 2), and thereby the internalization of the AMPA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>). <italic>L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> KO mice have impaired MLI-PC FFI, as they have a PC-specific ablation of the γ2 subunit of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>We first established in vitro that <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice lack both PF-PC LTD and MLI-PC FFI. For PF-PC LTD induction, we used 100-Hz PF stimulation in conjunction with a single CF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>) at an interstimulus interval of 110 ms, which is an interval that closely mimics those used during eyeblink conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>). We were unable to induce postsynaptic PF-PC LTD in <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice, just like in the <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> and table S1; see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>)], whereas LTD could be readily induced in controls and <italic>L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> and table S1; see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>)]. We found that our LTD protocol briefly induced an initial LTD-like pattern (~2 min after LTD induction) in <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), which is in line with Piochon <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>); they show the same phenomenon using this protocol in patDp/+ mice with similar PF-PC LTD impairments. Most probably, this is due to the high-frequency (100 Hz) PF stimulation. There were no signs of presynaptic neurotransmitter release abnormalities at the PF-PC synapse in <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice, in that paired-pulse facilitation was unaffected following PF stimulation at intervals varying from 50 to 200 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref> and table S1). To evaluate the inhibitory MLI to PC input, we measured the spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) of PCs. We found that these sIPSCs were virtually absent in <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref> and table S1), similar to what has been reported for <italic>L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>). Thus, <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice show both impaired PF-PC LTD and MLI-PC FFI.</p><p>Next, we evaluated performance in eyeblink conditioning. The <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic>, <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7</italic>, <italic>L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic>, and control mice all showed a significant increase in CR percentage and fraction eyelid closure [FEC, ranging from 0 (fully open) to 1 (fully closed)] over the course of 10 acquisition sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, A and B, and table S2). However, compared to the other three groups, <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice showed severely affected acquisition, in terms of both CR percentage and FEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, A and B, and table S2). Nevertheless, CR timing, that is, latency to CR onset and CR peak time, was comparable to control mice: CRs initially had no preferred peak time in the CS-US interval (session 1), but after 10 days of training, it peaked around the onset of the expected US (session 10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The smaller FEC but normal CR timing was even more obvious in the CS-only trials presented in the probe session (session 11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and table S2).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Acquisition of eyeblink CRs is severely impaired in <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice, whereas <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7</italic> and <italic>L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice show normal or only mildly impaired conditioning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Mouse individual (colored) and average (black) learning curves per group showing the development of (A) CR percentage (B) and FECs (or “amplitude of eyelid closure”) over the 10 consecutive training sessions. <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice have a significantly slower acquisition and lower CR percentage and FEC than the other three groups. <italic>L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice have a mild phenotype with a normal CR percentage but significantly lower FEC at the end of training.

These data indicate that the timing of the CR peak in <italic>L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice is more jittered compared to that in the other three groups, which is mainly due to a right shift of CR peak times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, A and B).</p><p>We could not establish any significant difference between the latency to onset and peak time of the unconditioned response (UR) to the US for any of the groups (fig.

Thus, over the course of 10 training sessions, <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice acquired only few CRs that had relatively small amplitudes.</p><p>The level of eyeblink conditioning in the <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice was much more affected than what could be expected on the basis of the individual phenotypes observed in the LTD-deficient <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7</italic> mice or the FFI-deficient <italic>L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice. These data are in line with our hypothesis that the two mechanisms may both contribute to the simple spike suppression required for eyeblink conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>) and that each may compensate for the other’s absence to largely preserve conditioned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><italic>25</italic></xref>). Alternatively, the exceptionally strong behavioral phenotype in the <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice could potentially result from general deficits in PC complex spike and simple spike firing levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>), although they appear relatively normal in the <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7</italic> and <italic>L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>). We therefore recorded PC activity in the anterior lobe of awake <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice, which should have the characteristic firing patterns of zebrin-negative modules, including that of the eyeblink microzone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The complex spike activity of <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice showed an average firing frequency of 1.13 Hz [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.91 to 1.34], and the simple spike pause following the complex spike was, on average, 15.55 ms (95% CI, 14.16 to 16.94), both frequencies being indistinguishable from those of <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7</italic> mice, <italic>L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice, or controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref> and table S3).

Instead, the most parsimonious explanation is that the simple spike suppression required for eyeblink conditioning is facilitated by both PF-PC LTD and MLI-PC FFI and that ablating only one of these mechanisms will elicit processes that can at least partly compensate for the deficit induced. It has been shown that deleting GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors from PCs, as occurs in the <italic>L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice, will reduce the efficacy of the excitatory PF to PC synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>). These presumptively homeostatic mechanisms may well keep the excitatory-inhibitory inputs in balance and still permit simple spike suppression to be induced. This notion is further supported by the observation that combined PF and CF stimulation may lead to concurrent LTD of the PF-PC synapse and LTP of the PF-MLI synapse in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27"><italic>27</italic></xref>).</p><p><italic>L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice have a stronger phenotype, in both their simple spike firing regularity (higher CV2) and CR peak time regularity (lower CV), than <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice. It is unknown whether more regular simple spikes and more jittered CR peak times are causally related, but this finding does suggest that, in addition to simple spike rate coding, simple spike temporal coding contains important functional features for cerebellar learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>). It is interesting that the added PF-PC LTD impairment in the <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice seems to partially “rescue” simple spike and CR peak time regularity. In terms of simple spikes, the reduced attenuation of PF-PC input in this mutant could lead to a stronger displacement of simple spike timings due to stronger PF input, in absence of FFI. A plausible explanation for the lack of a CR timing phenotype in <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice could be the very low CR expression and the fact that a real timing deficit is more prominently present in movements with bigger amplitude. It should be noted that, in all analyses on CR timing, we corrected for FEC, since it is known that CRs that peak too early or too late typically have an amplitude or FEC value of less than 0.25 (fig. S2).</p><p>Whether induction of PF-PC LTD is completely blocked in the <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice under physiological circumstances is unclear. Recently, it was shown that some PF-PC LTD can still be induced in <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7</italic> mice when the PF stimulus conditions are intensified; the CF stimulus is replaced by a strong somatic depolarization of the PC, and their stimulus interval is shortened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28"><italic>28</italic></xref>). As pointed out by Hesslow <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>) and Titley and Hansel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>), many of the LTD-induction protocols have temporal characteristics that do not match those of eyeblink conditioning. Therefore, we have chosen to induce LTD with a protocol that closely mimics the temporal aspects of eyeblink conditioning, similar to what has been used previously by the Hansel group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>), using a more subtle PF stimulation followed by a single CF activation after a 110-ms delay. We find a significant behavioral phenotype that can be associated with an LTD blockage following the GluR2Δ7 genetic manipulation in conjunction with MLI blockage. Thus, even if LTD induction would only be partly impaired in the GluR2Δ7 mouse (depending on the induction protocol used), our behavioral data indicate that this difference in sensitivity for LTD induction is apparently still sufficient to allow for behavioral differences to occur.</p><p>Here, we used the PCP2-cre 2Mpin/J line, for which it has been reported that Cre may also be expressed by ±3% of the MLIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><italic>29</italic></xref>). Still, for our research on the <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mutants, this line appeared suitable since we intended to block MLI-PC transmission and since the <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mutants can be expected to have a 3% MLI Cre expression similar to that of the <italic>L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mutants, which served as controls. Thus, this potential caveat cannot explain the severe learning phenotype in the triple mutants.</p><p>Although eyeblink conditioning in <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice was severely affected, they do undeniably show some CRs at the end of the training. These eyeblink CRs are properly timed; that is, they peak around the onset of the expected US. Moreover, they do not show the higher CV for the latency to CR peak as found in the <italic>L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>), which probably occurred because of their relatively low expression level. Our findings in the <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7-L7-</italic>Δγ<italic>2</italic> mice suggest additional neural mechanisms that contribute to PC simple spike suppression. It is unclear at this point whether PF-PC LTD and MLI-PC inhibition are indeed the only factors driving the PC simple spike suppression or only facilitate it by optimizing the PC’s inputs that transmit the CS information. In line with recent findings supporting a more neurocentric instead of exclusively circuit-synaptocentric view on learning, such a mechanism might well involve a temporal memory that is partly formed <italic>inside</italic> the PC itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><italic>30</italic></xref>). Such a cell-intrinsic learning mechanism, however, may still depend on optimized synaptic inputs provided by PFs and MLIs. Our finding that only a concurrent disruption of PF-PC LTD and MLI-PC inhibition could severely impair eyeblink conditioning, but not completely block learning, rejects the idea that a single form of neural plasticity is essential and sufficient, and it supports the notion that synaptic and intrinsic plasticity synergistically contribute to form a temporal memory in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><italic>25</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Subjects and generation of mice</title><p>For all experiments, we used male and female mice with a C57Bl/6 background (individually housed under 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycles with food ab libitum).

We made use of three different transgenic mouse lines. First, <italic>GluR2</italic>Δ<italic>7</italic> KI mice lack the last seven amino acids at the intracellular C-terminal tail, thereby disrupting the interaction of GluR2 with PICK1 and GRIP1/2, in turn disrupting the internalization of AMPA receptors, which impairs PF-PC LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><italic>31</italic></xref>).

Next, we carefully removed the exposed periosteum and roughened the surface of the skull using an etchant gel (Kerr). After this, a small messing block (10 mm × 4 mm × 3 mm) with one screw thread and two additional pinholes was placed on the skull using OptiBond primer and adhesive (Kerr) and Charisma (Heraeus Kulzer).

The treadmill consisted of a foam roller (diameter, ±15 cm; width, ±12 cm; Exervo, TeraNova EVA) with a horizontal metal rod through the axis that was connected with a ball bearing construction to two solid vertical metal poles. A horizontal messing bar was fixated to the same vertical poles at 3 to 5 cm above the treadmill. Mice were head-fixed to this bar using one screw and two pins, thereby ensuring perfect head fixation [for further details, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34"><italic>34</italic></xref>)]. National Instruments (NI-PXI) equipment was used to control experimental parameters and to acquire the eyelid position signal. Eyelid movements were recorded with the MDMT, which makes use of an NVE giant magnetoresistance magnetometer, positioned above the left upper eyelid, that measures movements of a minuscule magnet (1.5 mm × 0.7 mm × 0.5 mm) that is placed on the left lower eyelid of the animal with superglue (cyanoacrylate). This way, MDMT allows high spatiotemporal detection of eyelid kinematics [for further details, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35"><italic>35</italic></xref>)]. The CS was a green LED light (CS duration, 280 ms; LED diameter, 5 mm) placed 10 cm in front of the mouse’s head. Because we performed our experiments in almost complete darkness, this small LED light was a salient stimulus, which could be easily detected by both eyes. The US consisted of a weak air puff applied to the eye (30 psi; duration, 30 ms), which was controlled by an API MPPI-3 pressure injector, and delivered via a 27.5-gauge needle that was perpendicularly positioned at 0.5 to 1 cm from the center of the left cornea. The training consisted of 3 daily habituation sessions, 1 baseline measurement, 5 or 10 daily acquisition sessions, and 1 probe session immediately after the last training session. During the habituation sessions, mice were placed in the setup for 30 to 45 min, during which the air puff needle (for US delivery) and green LED (for CS delivery) were positioned properly but no stimuli were presented. On the day of acquisition session 1, each animal first received 20 CS-only trials as a baseline measure, to establish that the CS did not elicit any reflexive eyelid closure. During each daily acquisition session, the animals received either 100 or 200 paired CS-US trials, separated over 10 or 5 daily acquisition sessions, respectively. The interval between the onset of CS and that of US was set at 250 ms. Because of an inherent 14-ms delay in the delivery of the air puff, we triggered the air puff at 236 ms after CS onset so that it would hit the cornea exactly at 250 ms after CS onset. The intertrial interval was set according to the following constraints: At least 10 s had to elapse, the eyelid had to be open below a predetermined threshold of 50% of a full eyelid closure, and eyelid position had to be stable for at least 2 s for a trial to begin. Immediately after acquisition session 10, we started a probe session, during which we presented another 100 paired CS-US trials, but now intermingled with 30 CS-only trials. During all training sessions, the experimenter carefully inspected threshold and stability parameters and adjusted them if necessary. All experiments were performed at approximately the same time of day by the same experimenter.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Individual eyeblink traces were analyzed automatically with custom computer software (LabVIEW or MATLAB). First, 2000-ms eyeblink traces were imported and filtered in forward and reverse directions with a low-pass Butterworth filter using a cutoff frequency at 50 Hz. Second, trials with significant activity in the 500-ms pre-CS period (&gt;7 * interquartile range) were regarded as invalid for further analysis. Third, trials were normalized by aligning the 500-ms pre-CS baselines and calibrating the signal so that the size of a full blink was 1 (FEC). Fourth, in valid normalized trials, all eyelid movements larger than 0.1 and with a latency to CR onset between 50 and 250 ms and a latency to CR peak of 100 to 250 ms (both relative to CS onset) were considered as CRs. For CS-only trials in the probe session, we used the exact same criteria except that the latency to CR peak time was set at 100 to 500 ms after CS onset. Additionally, we determined for each individual trial the following parameters: (i) maximum eyelid closure (= FEC) in the CS-US interval, (ii) CR amplitude, (iii) latency to CR onset, (iv) latency to CR peak, (v) latency to UR onset, and (vi) latency to first UR peak. For (i), we used all valid trials; for (ii) to (iv), we only used the trials in which a CR was present; for (v) and (vi), we used US-only trials in the baseline session.

Sixth, statistical effects of session and genotype on all outcome measures were established in R version 1.1.442 using linear mixed-effect models (LMMs).
