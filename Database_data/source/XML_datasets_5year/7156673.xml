<p id="Par1">Mutations that inactivate negative translation regulators cause autism spectrum disorders (ASD), which predominantly affect males and exhibit social interaction and communication deficits and repetitive behaviors. However, the cells that cause ASD through elevated protein synthesis resulting from these mutations remain unknown. Here we employ conditional overexpression of translation initiation factor eIF4E to increase protein synthesis in specific brain cells. We show that exaggerated translation in microglia, but not neurons or astrocytes, leads to autism-like behaviors in male mice. Although microglial eIF4E overexpression elevates translation in both sexes, it only increases microglial density and size in males, accompanied by microglial shift from homeostatic to a functional state with enhanced phagocytic capacity but reduced motility and synapse engulfment. Consequently, cortical neurons in the mice have higher synapse density, neuroligins, and excitation-to-inhibition ratio compared to control mice. We propose that functional perturbation of male microglia is an important cause for sex-biased ASD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders with deficits in two core domains: social interaction and communication, and repetitive or restrictive behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. ASD are frequently associated with comorbidities, such as intellectual disability and anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Prevalence of ASD is 1 in 59 children under 8 years of age, and males are four times more likely than females to be identified with ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The biological basis for this sex bias is not clear. There is a strong genetic basis for ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. One recognized common biochemical pathway underlying ASD is dysregulation of protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Eukaryotic mRNAs contain a modified guanosine (m<sup>7</sup>Gppp), termed a cap, at their 5′ end. Translation of mRNAs requires binding of a translation initiation factor eIF4E to the cap. This factor interacts with the scaffolding protein eIF4G, which is essential for formation of the translation initiation complex by bridging an mRNA to the ribosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Hypophosphorylated forms of eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) repress translation initiation by sequestering eIF4E and consequently disrupting formation of the translation initiation complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Although most mRNAs need basal amounts of eIF4E to be translated, eIF4E preferentially increases translation of a selective set of mRNAs with extensive secondary structures at their 5′ untranslated regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) phosphorylates 4E-BPs and releases eIF4E from the 4E-BP complex, thus stimulating translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">There are four main negative regulators upstream of mTORC1: PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis complex 1), TSC2 and neurofibromatosis type 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Inactivating mutations in the genes for these proteins cause ASD in a subset of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, fragile X syndrome is caused by silencing of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene, which encodes fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and the mTORC1-eIF4E pathway is over-activated in fragile X syndrome patients diagnosed with ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. These single-gene disorders account for over 3% of all ASD cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These discoveries suggest that elevated translation might cause ASD in a subset of individuals. Importantly, a causal relationship between elevated translation and ASD-like behaviors has been recently established in mice. Deletion of the 4E-BP2-coding <italic>Eif4ebp2</italic> gene or overexpression of eIF4E under the promoter of beta tubulin (βT-Eif4e) increases protein synthesis in the mouse brain and leads to ASD-like behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">Microglia are derived from myeloid progenitors generated in the yolk sac and migrate into the brain when neurons and other glial cells only begin to be produced during early embryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. After the closure of the blood brain barrier, microglia self-renew without the contribution of circulating monocytes in the healthy brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Until recently, the primary function of microglia was thought to migrate to inflammation sites and engulf debris from dead or dying cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Recent work indicates that homeostatic microglia also play important roles in synaptic development and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par7">As synthesis of synaptic proteins is necessary for enduring synaptic plasticity and synaptic dysfunction can lead to ASD, it has been proposed that inactivating mutations in negative translation regulators cause ASD by enhancing translation of mRNAs in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Because mRNA translation is elevated in all cells of the body in <italic>Eif4ebp2</italic> knockout and transgenic βT-Eif4e mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, it remains, however, to be determined whether translational dysregulation in neurons is sufficient to cause ASD and whether translational dysregulation in glial cells contributes to autism manifestations. In this study, we elevated mRNA translation by overexpressing eIF4E and showed that exaggerated translation in microglia is sufficient to cause ASD-like phenotypes in mice via its detrimental impact on microglia-neuron interactions.</p>

<p id="Par8">We generated a conditional eIF4E overexpression allele at the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus (<italic>R26</italic><sup><italic>Eif4e</italic></sup>) that expresses Myc-tagged eIF4E in a Cre-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a, b</xref>). eIF4E-Myc interacted with eIF4G as efficiently as untagged eIF4E (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>), indicating that the Myc tag does not interfere with the function of eIF4E. As it is generally believed that elevated protein synthesis in neurons causes ASD-like behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, we first overexpressed eIF4E in neurons by crossing <italic>R26</italic><sup><italic>Eif4e</italic></sup> mice with Syn1-Cre mice, which selectively express Cre in neurons as early as embryonic day 12.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, to generate Syn1-Cre;<italic>R26</italic><sup><italic>Eif4e/Eif4e</italic></sup> mice (termed NN<sup>4E</sup> mice thereafter) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Levels of total eIF4E (eIF4E + eIF4E-Myc) in the NN<sup>4E</sup> hippocampus were more than twice as high as those in control mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). Interestingly, neuronal transgenic eIF4E expression significantly reduced endogenous eIF4E levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>). In fact, we found that one copy of the <italic>R26</italic><sup><italic>Eif4e</italic></sup> allele was not sufficient to significantly increase levels of total eIF4E in the brain due to this negative feedback regulation (1.01 ± 0.10 for Syn1-Cre;<italic>R26</italic><sup><italic>Eif4e/+</italic></sup> vs. 1.00 ± 0.09 for <italic>R26</italic><sup><italic>Eif4e/+</italic></sup>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.92, <italic>n</italic> = 5 mice per genotype). Using surface sensing of translation (SUnSET) which measures incorporation of puromycin into nascent polypeptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, we found that protein synthesis rate was doubled in cultured NN<sup>4E</sup> hippocampal neurons over control neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). These results indicate that neuronal protein synthesis is increased in NN<sup>4E</sup> mice.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Neuronal eIF4E overexpression elevates anxiety without altering social interaction.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Syn1-Cre;<italic>R26</italic><sup><italic>Eif4e/Eif4e</italic></sup> (NN<sup>4E</sup>) mice overexpress eIF4E in neurons, while <italic>R26</italic><sup><italic>Eif4e/Eif4e</italic></sup> mice serve as controls (Ctrl). <bold>b</bold> Levels of eIF4E in hippocampal extracts prepared from control and NN<sup>4E</sup> mice.

<p id="Par9">We assessed if elevated protein synthesis in neurons leads to abnormal behaviors in mice. As revealed in rotarod and open-field tests (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2b, c</xref>), NN<sup>4E</sup> mice had intact motor function. We examined anxiety-like behaviors by performing open field, elevated plus maze, and light-dark box tests. Anxious mice tend to avoid open, exposed, and brightly illuminated areas. Although NN<sup>4E</sup> and control mice spent comparable time in the light chamber in light-dark box tests (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2e</xref>), NN<sup>4E</sup> mice of both sexes spent significantly less time in the center of the open field than control mice in the first 5 min of a 30-min open field test (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). In addition, male NN<sup>4E</sup> mice stayed longer in the closed arm of an elevated plus maze than control mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2d</xref>). These results indicate that elevated neuronal protein synthesis increases anxiety. In agreement with the requirement of protein synthesis for long-term memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, NN<sup>4E</sup> mice showed more freezing in the contextual chamber 24 h after fear condition training than control mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2g</xref>). Conversely, working memory was unaffected in NN<sup>4E</sup> mice as measured by T-maze alternation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2f</xref>). We then ran marble burying and 3-chamber sociability tests to determine if elevated neuronal protein synthesis leads to repetitive behaviors and deficits in social interaction. Although female NN<sup>4E</sup> mice showed increased repetitive behaviors in marble burying tests relative to control mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>), male NN<sup>4E</sup> mice were unaffected (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2h</xref>). Unexpectedly, NN<sup>4E</sup> mice of both sexes stayed longer in the chamber with a holder holding a stranger mouse than in the chamber with an inanimate object (empty holder) and spent more time in investigating the stranger mouse than the empty holder, as did control mice in 3-chamber sociability tests (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f, g</xref>). These behavioral results indicate that elevated neuronal protein synthesis does not lead to deficits in social interaction associated with ASD. This suggests that social interaction impairments observed in <italic>Eif4ebp2</italic> knockout and transgenic βT-Eif4e mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> are attributable to elevated protein synthesis in glial cells.</p>

<title>Elevated microglial translation leads to ASD-like behavior</title>
<p id="Par10">We next overexpressed eIF4E in astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a–c</xref>), which is the largest population of glia in the brain, using a Cre transgene driven by the astrocyte-specific promoter for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP-Cre)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> which becomes active during late embryogenesis and the first postnatal week<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. We found that astrocytic eIF4E overexpression did not alter repetitive and social behaviors in mice of either sex (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3d–f</xref>).

<p id="Par13">There is a difference in the extent of microglial eIF4E overexpression between the two aforementioned assays. To understand the discrepancy, we established cultures enriched for neurons, astrocytes, or microglia. To our surprise, eIF4E levels in cultured microglia were higher than those in cultured neurons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5b</xref>), although eIF4E levels are higher in neurons than in microglia in vivo on the basis of immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5a</xref>). This result indicates that cell culturing somehow upregulates microglial eIF4E expression, which should cause underestimation of transgenic eIF4E expression. Therefore, it is likely that microglia in MG<sup>4E</sup> mice have more than twice as much eIF4E and protein synthesis as those in control mice, as do neurons in NN<sup>4E</sup> mice and astrocytes in AC<sup>4E</sup> mice.</p>

<p id="Par15">MG<sup>4E</sup> mice had normal locomotion in open field tests, indicating normal motor function (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7a</xref>).

Male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice displayed social interaction deficits, as they spent similar amounts of time investigating a stranger mouse and an inanimate object (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>), whereas female MG<sup>4E</sup> mice had normal social interaction behaviors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). To further characterize social behaviors of male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice, we performed social recognition tests in the home cage-like environment, an assay which relies on the mouse’s innate tendency to investigate a novel social partner and decrease the investigation of a known social stimulus (social habituation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Consistent with the social interaction deficit observed in 3-chamber sociability tests, male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice spent less time investigating a novel stimulus mouse in trial 1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>). Furthermore, social habituation (trial 4 vs. trial 1) and dishabituation (novel stimulation mouse vs. trial 4) were impaired in male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f, g</xref>), indicating that their ability to adapt to novel social stimuli was attenuated, a phenomenon which has been linked to the pathognomonic social impairment and behavioral rigidity in ASD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Again, female MG<sup>4E</sup> mice performed normally in social recognition tests (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7f, g</xref>).

<p id="Par20">We next sought to investigate why microglial eIF4E overexpression increased protein synthesis in both sexes, but only caused ASD-like behaviors in males. We performed Iba1 immunohistochemistry to examine the impact of elevated protein synthesis on microglia in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), hippocampus and striatum, the three brain regions that have been implicated in ASD pathophysiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. We found that microglia in the mPFC were more numerous and larger in 2-week-old male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice than male control littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a–c</xref>). The same phenotype was observed in the hippocampus and striatum (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9a–f</xref>).

<title>Synaptic alterations in male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice</title>
<p id="Par23">As microglia play important roles in neuronal development, the observed changes in microglial number and morphology could alter synaptic development and function in male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice, which then leads to ASD-like behaviors. To investigate this possibility, we examined synaptic structures in layer 2 of the mPFC prelimbic area (PrL) in 6-week-old male control and MG<sup>4E</sup> mice using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). Three-dimension reconstruction of dendrites revealed that male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice had higher spine density, with contributions from both non-synaptic and synaptic spines compared to control mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). Male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice had smaller spines and synapses on average (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>).

<p id="Par24">Because dendritic spines are the postsynaptic sites for the vast majority of excitatory synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, higher spine density indicates more excitatory synapses. Indeed, transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed more asymmetric (excitatory) synapses in the PrL of 6-week-old male, but not female, MG<sup>4E</sup> mice compared to control mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>). This analysis also found a normal density of symmetric (inhibitory) synapses in the PrL of both male and female MG<sup>4E</sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>). Thus, exaggerated protein synthesis in microglia increases the number of excitatory synapses in the mPFC in male mice.</p>
<p id="Par25">Increased spine density has been observed in ASD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. To determine if spine density is also increased in other brain areas of male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice and at other ages, we employed the Thy1-GFP transgene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> to label isolated neurons in 2-week and 6-week-old mice. We found that male, but not female, MG<sup>4E</sup> mice had higher spine density in pyramidal neurons of mPFC layer 5 and hippocampal CA1 area at both ages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">16a</xref>). These results indicate that elevated microglial protein synthesis increases the density of excitatory synapses in multiple brain areas.</p>
<p id="Par26">We next examined whether levels of synaptic proteins are altered in the mPFC and hippocampus of MG<sup>4E</sup> mice. We found that adult male and female control and MG<sup>4E</sup> mice had comparable levels of presynaptic synaptophysin and postsynaptic neuroligin 3, neuroligin 4, PSD95 and GluA1 in the hippocampus and mPFC (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">15c</xref>, <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">15d</xref>, <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">16b</xref>, <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">16c</xref>). Neuroligins are cell-adhesion molecules important for synaptogenesis and have been implicated in ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Levels of neuroligins 1–4 are increased in the hippocampus of <italic>Eif4ebp2</italic> knockout and transgenic βT-Eif4e mice, which was interpreted as a result of increased mRNA translation in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Interestingly, levels of neuroligins 1 and 2 in the hippocampus and mPFC were significantly higher in male, but not female, MG<sup>4E</sup> mice, compared with sex-matched control mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">16b, c</xref>). This finding suggests that the observed increase in hippocampal levels of neuroligins in <italic>Eif4ebp2</italic> knockout and transgenic βT-Eif4e mice could be a result of microglial alterations rather than increased eIF4E activity in neurons. This argument is supported by the observation that levels of neuroligins1–4 were comparable between male control mice and male NN<sup>4E</sup> mice that overexpress eIF4E in neurons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">17</xref>). The increase in levels of neuroligins 1 and 2 is likely due to enhanced transcription in neurons, as levels of mRNAs for the two proteins show a trend of increase in male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">15e</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par27">To investigate if alterations in synaptic structure and proteins lead to abnormal synaptic function in male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice, we recorded miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the mPFC. The amplitude, but not the frequency, of mEPSCs was increased in male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice relative to control mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). In contrast, the amplitude of mIPSCs were slightly reduced in male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice, as indicated by a significant but small left shift of its cumulative curve (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>). These results suggest an alteration in the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, which is believed to contribute to ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, in the mPFC. Indeed, we found that the normalized total charge transfer in male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice relative to control mice was significantly larger for mEPSCs than for mIPSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>). As expected on the basis of synapse density and levels of synaptic proteins, female control and MG<sup>4E</sup> mice had comparable mEPSCs, mIPSCs and charge transfer in the mPFC (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">16d, e</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Abnormal synaptic function in male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice.</title><p><bold>a</bold> mEPSCs recorded in mPFC layer 5 neurons of male control and MG<sup>4E</sup> mice at 6–7 weeks of age. <italic>n</italic> = 20 cells from five control mice and 33 cells from 8 MG<sup>4E</sup> mice.

<p id="Par29">To understand how microglial eIF4E overexpression alters synaptic structure and function, we analyzed hippocampal gene expression in male control and MG<sup>4E</sup> mice at 2 and 6 weeks of age using RNA-Seq. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> revealed 11 modules of highly co-expressed genes in control and MG<sup>4E</sup> mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">18a</xref>).

Pathway enrichment analysis of genes within the magenta module revealed top KEGG pathways related to antimicrobial activities, including herpes simplex infection, antigen processing and presentation, phagosome, influenza A and autoimmune thyroid disease (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b, c</xref>). Some of the disease-associated microglial genes found in neurodegenerative conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> were also upregulated in 2-week-old MG<sup>4E</sup> mice (28 out of 138 genes in the magenta module; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>). By 6 weeks of age, the magenta module eigengene was no longer significantly upregulated in MG<sup>4E</sup> mice, suggesting that this set of transcripts were only upregulated during postnatal development.

<p id="Par33">Given that microglia have been shown to prune synapses through phagocytosis during postnatal development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, we were puzzled by how elevated spine density (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b, e</xref>) and enhanced microglial phagocytosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8a</xref>) co-exist in male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice. We noticed that the downregulated genes are associated with leukocyte cell–cell adhesion, leukocyte migration, and cell–cell adhesion (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">18d</xref>). Thus, we examined migration of microglia to an injection site of Aβ<sub>(1–42)</sub> aggregates in 2-week-old male control and MG<sup>4E</sup> mice. We found that the number of microglia migrated to the Aβ<sub>(1–42)</sub> injection site was significantly reduced in male, but not female, MG<sup>4E</sup> mice relative to control mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8b, c</xref>). These results indicate that elevated protein synthesis impairs the motility of microglia in male mice.</p>
<p id="Par34">Microglial processes display two modes of motility: constant extension and retraction to survey the brain (baseline motility) and extension to the source of attractants such as ATP released from a damaged site (induced motility)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Because synapse pruning involves contacts of microglial processes with synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, it should be affected by the motility of microglial processes. As elevated protein synthesis impaired the motility of whole microglia, it could also affect the motility of microglial processes. We monitored the baseline motility and ATP-induced motility of microglial processes in organotypic hippocampal cultures established from P14-P18 control and MG<sup>4E</sup> mice harboring the CD68-EGFP transgene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> which is selectively expressed in microglia. Irrespective of sex, microglial processes in control and MG<sup>4E</sup> mice had comparable baseline processes motility (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">18f</xref>). However, ATP-induced motility was impaired in male, but not female, MG<sup>4E</sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8d</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par35">Synapses to be eliminated may release a factor to initiate their interactions with microglial processes, and thereby deficits in the induced motility in male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice would impair engulfment of synapses. We assessed synapse engulfment by measuring the immunoreactivity of postsynaptic protein Homer1 inside microglia. Three-D reconstruction of Iba1 and Homer1 immunoreactivities revealed that the volume of Homer1 immunoreactivity inside microglia was significantly reduced in male, but not female, MG<sup>4E</sup> mice relative to control mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8e</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par36">Collectively, these results indicate that induced motility of microglia is impaired in male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice, which might lead to reduced microglial engulfment of synapses and subsequently increased density of excitatory synapses, despite of enhanced microglial phagocytosis capacity in these mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par37">Our results indicate that elevated neuronal protein synthesis does not lead to deficits in social interaction, but it produces some ASD-related behaviors. NN<sup>4E</sup> mice of both sexes displayed elevated anxiety, a common ASD comorbidities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In addition, as revealed by marble burying tests, elevated neuronal protein synthesis increased repetitive behavior in female but not male mice. These behavioral phenotypes are interesting, given the observation that elevated microglial protein synthesis impaired social behaviors without elevating anxiety in male mice. These results indicate that different ASD-like and related behaviors have distinct cellular basis. They also suggest that ASD manifestations could be different in females and males.</p>
<p id="Par38">How does elevated protein synthesis in microglia lead to ASD-like synaptic and behavioral aberrations only in male mice? Our results indicate that the key mechanism is a sex-dependent response of microglia to elevated protein synthesis. Male microglia alter their transcriptome, which leads to changes in their function and morphology, but female microglia do not. Our transcriptomic analysis reveals that eIF4E overexpression shifts microglia from the homeostatic state to an undefined functional state only in male mice. The alterations in male microglia should result from elevated translation of some mRNAs in-these cells. However, our data do not exclude a remote possibility that elevated translation in peripheral immune cells impacts microglia differently in males and females through circulating factors, because monocytes and peripheral macrophages do overexpress eIF4E in MG<sup>4E</sup> mice in the first few postnatal weeks.</p>
<p id="Par39">Homeostatic microglia are constantly surveying their microenvironment with extremely motile processes and their processes rapidly converge at the site of injury in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. The motility and convergence of microglial processes in response to ATP released from damaged cells are dependent on the purinergic receptors such as P2Y12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. It is likely that homeostatic microglia employ a similar mechanism to reach synapses tagged for elimination. We found that eIF4E overexpression downregulates many genes specific to homeostatic microglia including genes for purinergic receptors (<italic>P2ry12</italic> and <italic>P2ry13</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> in young male mice. As this gene expression change would predict, eIF4E overexpression dramatically diminishes the induced motility of microglia. The loss of the induced motility would impair the ability of microglia to find synapses tagged for elimination so that microglia could not efficiently prune synapses. Indeed, we found that microglia in male MG<sup>4E</sup> pups contain a lower amount of engulfed Homer1 than those in control pups. This could be the main reason for observed increases in spine density and synapse density in male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice. This conclusion does not exclude the possibility that elevated microglial protein synthesis increases the rate of spine formation in male mice. We found that microglia in male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice have more processes relative to control mice, which would increase points of microglial contacts with neurons. The contact has been found to induce synapse formation in the cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. It would be important to identify the proteins that lead to alterations in transcription, morphology, and function in MG<sup>4E</sup> microglia when their synthesis is elevated and to understand why elevated synthesis of the proteins only affects male microglia in future studies.</p>
<p id="Par40">Our RNA-Seq data indicate that microglia in male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice upregulate expression of several cytokines, including C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), CXCL16, C-C motif chemokine 12 (CCL12) and interleukin 1 alpha (Il1α). We speculate that these cytokines could upregulate the expression of neuroligins and modify the function of glutamate receptors via posttranslational modifications, leading to the observed increase in the amplitude of mEPSCs. The increase in the function of excitatory synapses, along with increased density of excitatory synapses, would lead to E/I imbalance. Deficits in synapse pruning would lead to the presence of excess, imprecise and inefficient neuronal connections. Both E/I imbalance and synapse pruning impairment have been linked to ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and could be responsible for deficits in social interaction and repetitive behaviors in male MG<sup>4E</sup> mice.</p>
<p id="Par41">It is generally believed that <italic>PTEN</italic> haploinsufficiency elevates protein synthesis by increasing mTORC1 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, a recent study shows that genetic ablation of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), but not mTORC1, activity reverses the pathophysiology of <italic>Pten</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. It is likely that the complete ablation of mTORC1 activity is not the best way to reverse mTORC1 hyperactivity in <italic>Pten</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice. It is known that mTORC2 can fully activate Akt via Ser473 phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>, thereby increasing the activity of mTORC1, an Akt downstream target. Therefore, it could be a good strategy to treat ASD associated with elevated protein synthesis by targeting mTORC2 to reduce mTORC1 activity. There are conflicting reports on the effect of elevated protein synthesis on basal synaptic transmission. Enhanced mTORC1 activity via expression of a constitutively active form of Rheb was reported to reduce the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs in pyramidal neurons of the anterior cingulate cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. However, increases in both the frequency and the amplitude of mEPSCs were found in the hippocampal CA1 region of <italic>Eif4ebp2</italic> knockout mice, where mRNA translation is elevated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. The discrepancy could result from differences in the extent of translation enhancement, brain region, and recorded synaptic property in these studies. We found that elevated protein synthesis in microglia via eIF4E overexpression increases the amplitude of mEPSCs in the mPFC without affecting the frequency of mEPSCs. It would be interesting to investigate if elevated protein synthesis in multiple types of brain cells is required to affect both frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs.</p>
<p id="Par42">Transcriptomic analyses of post-mortem brains find that genes associated with activated microglia are upregulated in the cortex of ASD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Furthermore, knockdown of the microglia-specific <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> gene leads to a transient reduction in microglia, deficits in synapse pruning and ASD-like behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. These findings provide some evidence for involvement of microglia in ASD; however, ASD-associated causal genetic variants in microglial genes have not been identified yet. Protein synthesis is elevated as a result of ASD-causing mutations in genes encoding negative translation regulators (such as in <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>TSC1/2</italic>, and <italic>FMR1</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Our results show that elevating protein synthesis in microglia leads to ASD-like synaptic and behavioral aberrations in mice. Therefore, our study suggests that ASD-associated mutations in ubiquitously expressed genes could lead to ASD through their primary effects on microglia. In addition, our findings may provide some insights into the pathophysiology of ASD associated with other risk factors. Environmental insults, such as microbial infection during pregnancy, lead to the emergence of core ASD symptoms in the adult offspring, especially in males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. Because microglia are at the interface between the brain and environment, our findings suggest that environmental insults could increase the risk of ASD by altering functional states of microglia in the offspring. We propose that augmented responses of microglia to biochemical perturbations induced by gene mutations or microbial infection are an important underlying pathogenesis for ASD. Elucidation of the sexual difference in microglial response to the perturbations in future studies could provide innovative strategies for prevention and treatment of ASD.</p>

Immediately after habituation, a stimulus mouse (same-sex, similar age, and unfamiliar mouse) was introduced into a wire cage located in one of the two side chambers. An identical empty wire cage was placed in the other side chamber. The test mouse was allowed to explore the arena for 10 min. Time spent in each chamber and time spent in sniffing the stimulus mouse (or empty wire cage) was recorded by Ethovision XT video tracking system. In addition to analyzing the time spent in each chamber or investigation time, we also calculated the social preference index, which represents the difference between time spent in investigating the stimulus mouse vs. object, divided by total time spent in investigating both targets.</p>
<p id="Par75">For social recognition test, a tested mouse was housed alone for 2 h in a home cage-like environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. A same sex, juvenile (3–4 weeks old) stimulus mouse was placed into an acrylic tube (7.25 cm in diameter, 12.5 cm tall) with holes at the bottom. Social recognition test consisted of 5-min stimulus presentations separated by 10-min inter-trial intervals; the first four presentations (H1–H4) were of the same stimulus mouse, with the fifth using a novel juvenile (non-littermate juvenile). Time spent in sniffing the stimulus mouse was manually scored from video. Habituation index is calculated using the formula: (H1 investigation time – H4 investigation time)/total H1 and H4 investigation time.</p>
<p id="Par76">Novel object recognition was conducted in a three-chamber arena. A test mouse was placed in the middle chamber and allowed to explore the two side chambers with two identical objects located in each side chamber for 10 min. Immediately after this, one object was replaced with a novel object and the test mouse was allowed to explore for another 10 min. Time spent investigating the object (nose-point tracking) was automatically recorded by Ethovision XT video tracking system. Discrimination index is defined as (novel object time – familiar object time)/total time on two objects.</p>

<title>RNA-Seq analysis</title>
<p id="Par77">Total RNA was extracted from dissected hippocampal tissues using a Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research, R1054). RNA was quantified using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and run on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer RNA nano chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) for quality assessment. All RNA samples were of excellent quality with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) &gt; 8.0 and were processed for mRNA_seq library preparation. The final mRNA libraries were validated on the bioanalyzer DNA chips, normalized to 1 nM, pooled equally, loaded onto the NextSeq 500 (Illumina) at a final concentration of 1.8 pM, and sequenced using 2 × 40 bp paired-end chemistry. Library preparation and sequencing was performed at the Scripps Florida Genomic Core.</p>
<p id="Par78">Reads were trimmed off for sequencing adapter and were mapped to the mouse genome using the STAR version 2.5.2a aligner. Differential gene expression analysis was performed with genes with CPM &gt; 0.5 in at least four samples, using Bioconductor packages edgeR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup> with false discovery rate (FDR) threshold &lt;0.05 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org">http://www.bioconductor.org</ext-link>). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to find modules of highly correlated genes via its R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. WGCNA clustering, using the “blockwiseModules” function with the network type “signed hybrid”, a power parameter of 5 (as established by scale-free topology network criteria), and minModSize = 50, minKMEtoStay = 0.3, deepSplit = 2, mergeCutHeight = 0.15, dissected the data into 11 modules. The gene set enrichment and pathway analysis were performed using online tools DAVID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov">https://david.ncifcrf.gov</ext-link>) and Generic GO Term Finder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Quantitative reverse transcription PCR</title>
<p id="Par79">Mouse hippocampi were collected at 2-week and 6-week of ages. Total RNA was extracted from Trizol homogenates following the manufacturer’s protocol. Following DNaseI (New England Biolabs) treatment, cDNA was synthesized using M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs) with oligo dT primers. Candidate genes were then quantified by real-time PCR using SYBR Green Mix (Roche). The actin gene ACTB was used as control. The PCR primers for each gene are listed (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).</p>

<title>Two-photon imaging of microglial motility and data analysis</title>
<p id="Par80">We performed two-photon imaging to visualize microglial motility according to a previously described protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>.

Brain sections were recovered in aCSF at 32 °C for 1 h. Microglia were imaged at a depth of 50–100 µm in the brain slice using a Leica TCS SP8 MP multiphoton microscope (25× lens). Stacks of 26 images with 2-µm intervals were acquired every 60 s for 5 min (base line) and for another 10 min after ATP (1 mM) was bath-applied to brain slices. Images were analyzed using ProMoIJ, an ImageJ macros that perform automatic microglial motility analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>. Briefly, microglia were cropped and aligned, subsequently individual microglial processes were selected for automated analysis of their motility. Process motility was analyzed by reconstructing the process 3D skeleton and was calculated as the absolute difference of process length between two consecutive time frames.
