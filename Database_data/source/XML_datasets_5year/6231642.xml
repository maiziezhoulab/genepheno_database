<abstract>
<p><italic>Aristaless</italic>-related homeobox (<italic>ARX</italic>) gene encodes a paired-type homeodomain transcription factor with critical roles in development. Here we identify that ARX protein is phosphorylated. Using mass spectrometry and <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays we identify phosphorylation at serines 37, 67 and 174. Through yeast-2-hybrid and CoIP we identified PICK1 (Protein interacting with C kinase 1) binding with the C-terminal region of ARX. PICK1 is a scaffold protein known to facilitate phosphorylation of protein partners by protein kinase C alpha (PRKCA). We confirm that ARX is phosphorylated by PRKCA and demonstrate phosphorylation at serine 174. We demonstrate that phosphorylation is required for correct transcriptional activity of the ARX protein using transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression of phospho-null mutants (alanines replacing serines) compared to ARX wild-type (ARX-WT) overexpressed in pancreatic alpha TC cells. Compared to untransfected cells, ARX-WT overexpression significantly altered expression of 70 genes (Log2FC &gt;+/-1.0, P-value &lt;0.05). There were fewer genes with significantly altered expression compared to untransfected cells with the double phospho-null mutant Ser37Ala+Ser67Ala (26%) and Ser174Ala (39%), respectively. We demonstrate that the c-terminal region of ARX required to bind PICK1 causes a shift in PICK1 subcellular localisation to the nucleus to co-locate with the ARX protein, and truncation of this C-terminal region leads to the same loss of transcriptional activation as S174A mutant. In conclusion, we show that ARX is phosphorylated at several sites and that this modification affects its transcriptional activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The <italic>Aristaless</italic>-related homeobox (<italic>ARX</italic>) gene [NM_139058.2] is a member of the paired-type homeodomain transcription factor family, with critical roles on development. <italic>ARX</italic> expression is restricted predominately to the brain (highest in the fetal brain), with low levels of expression in the pancreas, testes, skeletal muscle and highly expressed in ovaries. Mutations in this gene (MIM 30082) are a heritable cause of X-linked intellectual disability with or without other comorbidities including epilepsy, infantile spasms, dystonia, dysarthria, autism or lissencephaly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref004">4</xref>]. The most striking consequences of loss of ARX function impact the development of the brain, testis in both mouse and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref006">6</xref>]. However, ARX also plays a critical role in the developmental determination and maintenance of alpha cell fates in the pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref007">7</xref>]. Arx-deficient mice develop early-onset hypoglycaemia, dehydration and weakness, and die 2 days after birth likely due to the lack of Arx function in the pancreas leading to a near-complete deficiency of alpha cells and a concomitant increase in beta cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Transcriptional activity of the ARX protein is largely defined by the presence of a conserved paired-type homeodomain, involved in binding to specific DNA sequences to regulate the expression of subsets of target genes. The molecular mechanism that homeodomain proteins, such as ARX, employ to regulate transcription of specific target genes is still poorly understood. Other components of the protein may contribute to the transcriptional regulation capacity. For example, the ARX protein also contains an <italic>Aristaless</italic> domain, which is present in over half of the members of the paired class homeodomain family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref008">8</xref>]. This domain is located at the carboxyl end of ARX protein. The function of this domain is not well understood, although a number of studies have indicated a role in transcription activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref012">12</xref>]. Four hydrophobic polyalanine tracts located throughout the ARX protein are suggested to be involved in protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and stabilise the interaction between transcription regulators and/or DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref013">13</xref>]. Located near the N-terminus of ARX is a highly conserved octapeptide domain. This sequence shares high similarity with the Engrailed homology repressor domain (eh1) known to be involved in transcriptional repression both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. This domain recruits Grouch/transducing-like enhancer of split (TLE) co-factor protein (TLE1-4), which modulates transcription repression activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Similar to many transcription factors, there is evidence to support that ARX transcriptional function might be regulated through post-translational modification. A study examining the potential role of CDKL5 mutants in phosphorylating MECP2 or ARX has indicated that although ARX does undergo <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation when overexpressed in HEK293T cells, CDKL5 was not the kinase responsible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref014">14</xref>]. The kinase phosphorylating ARX is unknown, as is the effect of this modification on its function. In this study, we have established that ARX is phosphorylated at multiple sites, including serine 37, 67 and 174. We have identified protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1) as a novel protein partner of ARX using yeast-2 hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation studies. PICK1 is a scaffolding protein first identified as an interaction partner for protein kinase C alpha (PRKCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref015">15</xref>]. PICK1 is known to facilitate the phosphorylation of its substrate by PRKCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref016">16</xref>]. The PKC family consists of ubiquitously expressed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent/independent, phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases that play key roles in a large number of biological processes, including cell growth and differentiation. Our study has demonstrated that ARX is a novel substrate of PRKCA, with phosphorylation at serine 174. We demonstrate that ARX is phosphorylated at several sites and that this modification is important for aspects of transcription activity of ARX.</p>

<title>Multiple phosphorylation sites exist in ARX</title>
<p>In the presence of radiolabelled ([<sup>32</sup>P]) orthophosphoric acid, immunoprecipitated recombinant Myc-tagged full-length ARX protein overexpressed in HEK293T cells shows a positive signal of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, top panel). No phosphorylation signal was detected in Myc-vector transfected cells or mock-transfected cells. To narrow down the possible phosphorylation site(s) in ARX we designed seven partial ARX constructs spanning the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). When these partial recombinant ARX proteins were expressed in HEK293T cells and labelled as above, we determined a positive phosphorylation signal in the N-terminal octapeptide domain region (OP), polyalanine tract 1 &amp; 2 region (PA1&amp;2), polyalanine tract 3 region (PA3) and the homeodomain region (HD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g001">Fig 1C</xref> top panel—arrows). Additional bands on this panel are likely phosphorylated proteins non-specifically captured by the immunoprecipitation process. The presence of each partial protein was confirmed by immunoblotting (IB) using an anti-Myc antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, bottom panel). The <italic>ARX</italic> gene encodes a predicted protein of 562 amino acids including 43 serines, 28 threonines and 8 tyrosines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Given all three residues (serine, threonine, tyrosine) could be potentially modified by phosphorylation, we used anti-phospho antibodies against Myc-ARX overexpressed in HEK293T cells and confirmed that the tyrosine and the threonine residues were not phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). However, a positive signal was observed for serine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g001">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206914.s004">S1 Fig</xref>). These experiments established that ARX is phosphorylated at multiple serine residues.</p>

<title>Serine Phosphorylation sites at the N-terminus of ARX</title>
<p>Immunoprecipitated full-length recombinant Myc-tagged ARX protein was isolated using SDS-PAGE and digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin and analysed as a fee for service (Prof Peter Hoffmann, Proteomics Facility, University of Adelaide, Australia) by liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-eSI-IT-MS/MS) in a Bruker HCT Ultra 3D-Ion-trap mass spectrometer to identify phosphorylated residues within ARX. Data was analysed with BioTools (Version 3.1, Bruker Daltonics) and reported phosphopeptides were verified by manual inspection of spectra. The fragmented peptides generated by either digestion method were consistent with ARX protein sequence when analysed by MS, indicating the preparations were free of contaminating material. When the Mass Spec analysis from both trypsin and chymotrypsin enzyme digestions were combined, up to 76% of the ARX ORF was successfully mapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, unmapped areas in grey). Of the 135 residues that were not adequately covered by MS following digestion with either trypsin or chymotrypsin, there was only one serine residue not analysed; serine 213. Therefore phosphorylation at this residue cannot be discounted. Two phosphopeptides (PP1 and PP2) were identified at the N-terminus of ARX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The phosphopeptide, PP2 spans residues 56-69aa and contains only one modifiable residue, serine 67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). This residue is clearly identified as being phosphorylated by the MS peak (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206914.s005">S2 Fig</xref>). This analysis is in agreement with the HEK293T cell labelling data identifying phosphorylation in the PA1&amp;2 region of ARX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) and a positive signal observed for serine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). The other phosphopeptide, PP1 spans from 20-40aa of the ARX protein and contains 5 potential serine residues that could be modified at residue p.20, p.25, p.26, p.31 and p.37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). LC-ESI-IT-MS/MS analysis suggests that serine 20 or 37 are the most likely phosphorylation sites in PP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206914.s005">S2 Fig</xref>). NetPhos3.1 is a database that predicts putative phosphorylation sites based on consensus kinase recognition sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref017">17</xref>]. Of the two candidate serine residues in PP1, NetPhos3.1 scores of predicted active kinases for these sites indicated serine 37 was a potential substrate for CDK5 and GSK3. On the other hand, the serine 20 residue prediction scores did not meet the threshold (above 0.5), suggesting that serine 37 is the likely site of phosphorylation in PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g002">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0206914.t001">Table 1</xref>). To confirm that serine 37 is the site phosphorylated in PP1, alanine substitution of serine 37 was introduced to full-length ARX construct. Full-length Myc-ARX-WT and the ARX-S37A mutant were expressed in HEK293T cells and subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE) analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206914.s006">S3 Fig</xref>). ARX-WT and ARX-S37A mutant proteins displayed multiple protein spots each with a different protein variant pattern when aligned (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206914.s006">S3 Fig</xref>), indicating substitution of serine 37 with alanine changes the isoelectric properties of the ARX protein. This analysis supports a change in the phosphorylation status and indicates that the serine 37 residue is the site of phosphorylation in PP1. Hence, we identify and confirm that serines at position 37 and 67 of ARX are phosphorylated.</p>

<title>Alternative strategies to identify predicted sites of phosphorylation in the ARX protein</title>
<p>Our <italic>in vivo</italic> labelling data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g001">Fig 1</xref>) indicates that there are likely sites of phosphorylation that were not detected by mass spectrometry, even when employing an additional strategy of phosphopeptide enrichment (using a magnetic bead-based immobilised metal affinity chromatography capture kit). Taking an unbiased approach we analysed the ARX protein sequence using <italic>in silico</italic> prediction software, NetPhos3.1. The protein sequence in FASTA format was used as input for NetPhos3.1 software. ARX has 11 serine, and 3 threonine sites predicted to be phosphorylated with a score greater than 0.9, which suggests very likely phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0206914.t001">Table 1</xref>). The anti-phosphoantibody immunoblot data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g001">Fig 1E</xref> indicates that tyrosine and threonine residues of recombinant full-length ARX are not phosphorylated in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0206914.t001">Table 1</xref>- dark grey). Rows highlighted in light grey indicate no phosphorylation signal by <italic>in vivo</italic> labelling assay of partial recombinant proteins. Combining the <italic>in silico</italic> analysis and the <italic>in vivo</italic> labelling data and the phosphoantibody data we refined the predicted phosphorylation sites to a possible 9 serine residues across the ARX protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0206914.t001">Table 1</xref>). Two of these sites were those confirmed by MS analysis; residues S37 and S67 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0206914.t001">Table 1</xref>-highlighted in green). Both Serine 37 and 67 are predicted substrates of CDK5 and GSK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g002">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0206914.t001">Table 1</xref>). Hence, there were 7 remaining serines with a positive signal in the <italic>in vivo</italic> labelling assay but were not detected as phosphorylated by MS analysis when overexpressed in Hek293T cells. Using our <italic>in silico</italic> approach, possible active kinases for each of these sites were identified using a prediction score above 0.5 (the prediction score is a value in the range [0.0–1.0]; with a score above 0.5 indicating a positive prediction). The kinase listed for Serine 174 was PKC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0206914.t001">Table 1</xref>- highlighted in yellow). Interestingly, a yeast-2 hybrid screen of a human fetal brain cDNA library using the human ARX <italic>Aristaless</italic> domain (472-562aa) as a bait identified protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1) (GeneBank: NM_012407) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) as a novel protein partner. PICK1 contains a PDZ domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) that is known to interact with PKC, in particular, the PRKCA isoform, at its C-terminal PDZ-binding domain. Hence, the analysis of predicted sites and kinases indicates that S174 of ARX may be subject to phosphorylation by PRKCA, facilitated by ARX binding to PICK1. The remaining 6 serines may represent additional sites of phosphorylation in ARX but were not pursued in the current investigation.</p>

<title>ARX is phosphorylated at S174A by PRKCA</title>
<p>PRKCA is known to interact with PICK1 at its C-terminal PDZ-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This interaction regulates specific subcellular localisation of PRKCA to phosphorylate its target protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref016">16</xref>]. The interaction of ARX and PICK1 led us to predict that ARX might be phosphorylated at S174 by PRKCA and that this modification, potentially regulates ARX activity. To examine whether PRKCA directly phosphorylates ARX, we first performed <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays using a pool of purified protein kinase C (PKC) enzymes. Overexpressed full-length Myc-ARX immunoprecipitated from HEK293T cells or ARX produced using a cell-free <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription-translation system (cell-free Xpress-tagged full-length ARX) were used as substrates. The enzymes used in this kinase assay were a pool of PKC isozymes isolated from rat brain, consisting mainly of classical PKC isozymes (PRKCA, PRKCB and PRKCG). Using this approach, the cell-based Myc-ARX was phosphorylated upon addition of the PKC enzyme pool (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206914.s007">S4 Fig</xref>; top panel). The inclusion of a PKC inhibitor led to the attenuation of the phosphorylation signal, confirming the phosphorylation of ARX by PKC. A known PKC substrate, neurogranin (NGRN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref018">18</xref>] served as a positive control in the assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206914.s007">S4 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, when we used the Xpress-tagged ARX substrate in this assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206914.s007">S4 Fig</xref>), background bands of the IP antibody and sepharose complex were observed but no specific band correlating to ARX protein was detected. Hence, cell-free ARX was not phosphorylated by PKC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206914.s007">S4 Fig</xref>). We cannot rule out that cell-free ARX may not have been correctly folded or modified to obtain the necessary tertiary structure required for PKC modification by this assay. Despite this, our data suggest that a factor(s) present in mammalian cells that co-immunoprecipitated with ARX may be important for phosphorylation of ARX by PKC. One such factor may be the novel protein partner PICK1.</p>
<p>Co-immunoprecipitation was used to confirm the interaction of ARX and PICK1. Myc-tagged ARX and V5-tagged PICK1 were co-expressed in HEK293T cells. When V5-tagged PICK1 was immunoprecipitated (IP) from total cell lysates using a monoclonal anti-V5-HRP antibody, Myc-tagged ARX (~62 kDa) was detected by monoclonal anti-Myc antibody in this precipitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Protein lysates from cells transfected with Myc-ARX alone and V5-PICK1 alone were included as controls. Specific IP of overexpressed V5-tagged proteins was confirmed by the negligible protein detected in the no anitbody lane, demonstrating very low levels of nonspecific binding of polyalanine rich ARX to protein A sepharose beads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref019">19</xref>]. Taken together, our data show that ARX interacts with PICK1 in mammalian cells.</p>
<p>To confirm that S174 is the specific residue phosphorylated by PKC we used the Myc-tagged partial proteins spanning ARX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) and demonstrate that PKC phosphorylates the PA1&amp;2 and 165–214 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, indicated by arrows in top panel). The presence of each partial protein was confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-Myc antibody. The levels of detectable protein for 165–214 were very low. Despite this, its phosphorylation signal by the radioactive assay was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, lane 3 middle panel). Although serine 174 is present in both PA1&amp;2 and 165–214 partial proteins, it is the very last reside in the PA1&amp;2 (61-174aa) and as such lacks the necessary surrounding residues to form the PKC consensus recognition sequence, making phosphorylation at this site in the PA1&amp;2 partial protein unlikely. As expected, no phosphorylation signal was observed in the absence of PKC enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Although modification at threonine residues was unlikely given the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, we chose to interrogate the phosphorylation by PKC at two sites predicted by <italic>in silico</italic> analysis, with alanine substitution in place of threonine at position 158 in PA1&amp;2 and serine at position 174 in the 165–214 partial proteins. In the absence of PKC enzyme, no phosphorylation was detected in any sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). In the presence of PKC enzyme, the phosphorylation signal of phospho-null mutant p.S174A was markedly reduced compared to the corresponding ARX-WT partial protein (165–214) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, right top panel). This reduction in phosphorylation signal was in the context of similar levels of protein in both the ARX-WT and p.S174A samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, right bottom panel lane 3 and 4). This result confirms that serine at position 174 is modified by PKC. However, no difference in the phosphorylation signal was observed when the PA1&amp;2 protein with p.T158A mutation was assayed compared to the wild-type equivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, right middle panel lane 1 and 2), showing that this threonine is not PKC modified. This outcome agrees with our previous results demonstrating that threonine residues in ARX are unlikely to be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g001">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>PICK1 is a protein that plays a key role in PKC phosphorylation and links PRKCA to its targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref016">16</xref>]. Given that we have identified PICK1 as a novel protein partner of ARX, we wanted to investigate if the classical PRKCA was responsible for this phosphorylation of ARX, particularly at serine 174. We began by investigating if PRKCA interacts with ARX, using Co-IP. Myc-ARX and HA-PRKCA were co-transfected into HEK293T cells. When the HA-PRKCA was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibody we detected Myc-ARX co-immunoprecipitating when immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206914.s008">S5 Fig</xref>). Next, we substituted PRKCA as the enzyme in place of the commercially available PKC enzyme pool. A clear signal is again noted in the 165–214 partial protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, middle panel). Similar to the previous assay, the phosphorylation signal of mutant p.S174A is attenuated compared to the corresponding wildtype 165–214 partial protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, right panel). The partial ARX proteins were confirmed by immunoblot using anti-Myc antibody. Our data demonstrates that serine 174 is the site modified by PRKCA in partial protein 165–214. Serine S174 is conserved across multiple ARX orthologs as shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g003">Fig 3F</xref>).</p>

<title>The function of ARX as a transcriptional regulator requires phosphorylation</title>
<p>To determine the impact of serine phosphorylation on the function of the ARX protein, phospho-null substitutions were generated in which the serine residues identifed to be phosphorylated were replaced with alanines. Using a dual-luciferase reporter assay described in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref021">21</xref>] we measured the impact of these mutations on the interaction with an orthologous Arx-binding site in the enhancer region of <italic>Lmo1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref022">22</xref>] inserted upstream of an SV40 promoter driving luciferase expression. Using this assay, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of serine residues identified in this study does not affect ARX transcriptional activity in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206914.s009">S6 Fig</xref>). This reflects that phosphorylation at these residues does not negatively impact the binding of the ARX homeodomain to the identified transcription factor binding motif in this <italic>in vitro</italic> setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref022">22</xref>]. However, ARX is known to be able to act as both an activator and repressor of gene expression. Hence, we chose to determine the functional consequences of phosphorylation of the ARX protein using an unbiased approach of transcriptome-wide analysis. Two phospho-null mutants were included in the analysis, ARX-S174A and a double mutant ARX-S37AS67A, compared to untransfected cells and ARX-WT controls. We chose to use alpha TC cells, a mouse pancreas-derived cell line in which Arx is vital for the establishment and maintenance of glucagon-producing alpha cells. Although the endogenous levels of <italic>Arx</italic> expression within the pancreas are tightly regulated, and lower than expression within selected brain tissue, we reasoned that these cells would contain the necessary cellular machinery required for <italic>Arx</italic> transcriptional activity. Transcriptomes of cells transfected with ARX-WT and phospho-null mutants were compared to transcriptomes of the untransfected cells to determine specific gene expression changes triggered by phosphorylated/phospho-null ARX. In all experiments, we achieved similar transfection efficiencies as determined by immunofluorescence. Individual genes were considered to be differentially expressed with a significance threshold of log2FC&lt;±1, P&gt;0.05 applied to the analysis. Validation of RNASeq analysis showed a correlation of deregulation detected by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206914.s010">S7 Fig</xref>). To investigate genes deregulated in alpha TC cells either expressing ARX WT, or ARX phosphorylation mutants we compared functional enrichment analysis of gene ontology (GO) terms for biological processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206914.s001">S1 Table</xref>), cellular component (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206914.s002">S2 Table</xref>) and molecular function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206914.s003">S3 Table</xref>). Genes with a log2 fold change with +/-&gt;1 cutoff value were used as the input into EnrichR (23). This analysis highlights some of the pathways that may be deregulated in response to the ablation of different phosphorylation sites, however, due to the modest list of deregulated genes used as the input for analysis we saw no significant enrichment of terms.</p>
<p>Overexpression of ARX–WT resulted in 70 genes significantly deregulated compared to the untransfected alpha TC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) (Data has been submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus under the GEO accession number: GSE105113). Of the 70 genes, we saw 53% of these were downregulated when compared to untransfected alpha TC cells. When ablation of phosphorylation sites p.S174A or p.S37A67A in ARX were tested, there were 92 and 52 genes significantly impacted, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Of the genes impacted by the phospho-null mutants, 75% were downregulated for both ARX-S37AS67A and ARX-S174A. Next, we compared the 70 genes that were changed in ARX-WT (black) alpha TC cells to the genes deregulated in the phospho-null mutants (p.S174A, pink and p.S37AS67A, blue). This analysis shows that the ablation of phosphorylation at these sites lead to a partial loss of function, with 73% (51/70) and 60% (42/70) of genes no longer being significantly deregulated in ARX-S37AS67A and ARX-S174A, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, left panel). Loss of phosphorylation at the sites tested resulted in significantly altered expression of an additional 45 genes (82% with reduced expression) for ARX-S174A and 14 genes for ARX-S37AS67A and another 19 genes for both mutations that were not impacted by ARX-WT overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, right panel). Of the 45 genes significantly altered by the phospho-null ARX-S174A mutant, using Enrichr, a enrichment analysis tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref023">23</xref>], we saw a significant enrichment of genes (Adjusted p-value = 0.02948) with a PAX4 transcription factor DNA binding motif within the promoter region (indicated by a star in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, right panel) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref023">23</xref>].</p>

<title>The function of ARX as a transcriptional regulator requires the C-terminal region that binds and co-localises PICK1</title>
<p>To examine the role of PICK1 binding impacting the transcriptional activity of ARX, we removed the c-terminal region of ARX that was initially used to establish PICK1 as a binding partner. Hence, we introduced a stop codon at p.R472X lead to truncation of the protein at p.471. This c-terminal truncated protein displayed the same subcellular nuclear localisation pattern as the full length ARX WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). This was not unexpected, with the homeodomain and flanking nuclear localisation sequences of ARX known to be necessary and sufficient to localise the protein to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref020">20</xref>]. When PICK1 was co-transfected with ARX-WT there was no change to the localisation pattern of the ARX protein. In contrast, PICK1 protein shifts from a predominate cytoplasmic localisation (89.5%) when overexpressed alone, to being co-located with ARX in the nucleus in co-transfected cells (15% cytoplasmic vs 63% nuclear) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). However, this shift of PICK1 protein to the nucleus was not observed when co-transfected with the C-terminal truncated ARX 1–471 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Instead, the majority of co-transfected cells display PICK1 still in the cytoplasm (53%) with increased numbers of cells with either the PICK1 protein localised more diffusely in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (20%) or in cells with abnormal protein localisation (17%) of both PICK1 and ARX 1–471 protein. Next, we compared the impact of the c-terminal region of ARX binding to PICK1 on the transcriptional activity of the ARX protein. ARX WT overexpression in alpha TC cells results in transcriptional activation of <italic>Aft3</italic> and <italic>Lgi3</italic> genes by RNASeq analysis. This activation is confirmed by qRT-PCR from multiple transfections. Although the phospho-null S174A mutant does not abolish the overall transcriptional activity of ARX protein, the post-translation modification at S174 is required for adequate transcriptional activation of these specific gene targets by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The outcome agrees with the RNASeq analysis for S174A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Interestingly, we demonstrate that the truncation of the c-terminal region of ARX that is required to bind and co-localise PICK1 displays a loss of transcriptional activation comparable to the S174A mutant in relation to the ARX WT activity for <italic>Aft3</italic> and <italic>Lgi3</italic> genes tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206914.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have identified ARX as a multisite phosphoprotein. By LC-eSI-IT mass spectrometry, we were able to identify serine 37 and serine 67, both in the N-terminal region of the protein, as phosphorylation sites. Additional phosphorylation sites were indicated experimentally, but could not be resolved at the present time. We identified a novel ARX protein partner, PICK1, by yeast 2-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation, which implicated PRKCA as the ARX phospho-modifying enzyme. We subsequently demonstrated that PRKCA phosphorylates ARX at multiple sites, including serine 174 as the major PRKCA phosphorylation target. We demonstrate that phospho-null mutants do not affect ARX transcriptional activity in HEK293T cells using an <italic>in vitro</italic> luciferase reporter assay. However, our study shows that phosphorylation at these three sites is very likely required for correct transcriptional activity of the ARX protein in a correct cellular context. Using a transcriptome-wide approach to analyse gene expression in pancreatic alpha TC cells we show that compared to untransfected cells, the significantly regulated gene expression with overexpression ARX-WT was markedly reduced with the double phospho-null mutant Ser37Ala+Ser67Ala and Ser174Ala. Generating a c-terminally truncated mutant of ARX, we confirm that the c-terminal region of ARX is required to bind PICK1 and show this binding causes a shift in PICK1 subcellular localisation to the nucleus to co-locate with the ARX protein. Moreover, we demonstrate that the c-terminal truncated mutant of ARX gives rise to the same loss of transcriptional activation as S174A mutant using qRT-PCR analysis of targets identified in RNA-Seq analysis. Our study demonstrates for the first time that ARX is phosphorylated at several sites and that phosphorylation is important for aspects of transcriptional activity.</p>
<p>Our data establishes that there are at least three novel phosphorylation sites across ARX, serines 37, 67 and 174. The two serine residues at the N-terminal region of the protein were identified using a LC-eSI-IT mass spectrometer. Detection by this method implies that a reasonable proportion of the overexpressed ARX-WT protein was post-translationally modified at these sites. Both are predicted to be substrates of CDK5 or GSK3. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref024">24</xref>]. Within the nervous system, CDK5 is involved in a range of functions including neuronal migration. Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK3) is a promiscuous protein kinase known to phosphorylate a diverse range of substrates. Almost all GSK3 substrates require a priming phosphorylated residue to be 4 amino acids C-terminal to the Serine/Threonine phosphorylated by GSK3, although unprimed GSK3 mediated phosphorylation has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref026">26</xref>]. There are no Serine or Threonine sites 4 amino acids C-terminal of serine 37 in ARX. We cannot rule out that a priming event may occur 4 amino acids C-terminally of serine 67 at serine 71 in ARX required for GSK3, however, we were not able to detect any priming event at this site by the current analysis.</p>
<p>The third phosphorylation site, serine 174 was identified and demonstrated to be a novel site phosphorylation by PRKCA. PKC translocates to different subcellular sites, generally from cytosolic to membrane, and phosphorylates and regulates its target proteins as a consequence of this translocation. Identifying this kinase modifying ARX at serine 174 was achieved through our identification of PICK1 as a novel interacting partner. As PICK1 is known to have a key role in PRKCA phosphorylation by linking PRKCA to its target proteins, we predict that the interaction of PRKCA with ARX to modify serine 174 is enhanced by the interaction with PICK1. Interestingly, PICK1 is expressed in many tissues with the highest expression found in the brain, followed by the testis (15). These are both sites in which ARX is also expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref028">28</xref>]. PICK1 is known to be localised to the cytoplasmic region of cells, in particular, the perinuclear region and associates with the mitochondria. PICK1 contains both a PDZ domain and a BAR domain, enabling multifunctional capacity to bind to a large selection of proteins, including more than one at a time. The PICK1-PRKCA interaction is formed between the PDZ domain of PICK1 and PDZ ligand of PRKCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref016">16</xref>]. The bait construct used to identify PICK1 as a binding partner of ARX consisted of the C-terminal portion of the ARX protein including the aristaless (OAR) domain. ARX belongs to a subset of paired class homeoproteins which are characterised by the presence of this conserved domain located in the carboxyl-terminal region known as the OAR domain. The presence of the aristaless domain in a subset of Paired-like homeodomain proteins and the invariable C-terminal location suggest that it has a molecular function that is inherently and directly related to the way these homeoproteins exert their function. A function as an activation domain in the Otp protein was proposed originally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref029">29</xref>], but more recent studies including both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data suggests that the aristaless domain functions to attenuate transcriptional activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref031">31</xref>]. It has been proposed that intramolecular interactions between the aristaless domain and the N-terminus of these proteins lead to a protein conformation associated with a relatively inactive state of these transcription factors. Conceivably, intermolecular interactions <italic>in vivo</italic> would unfold the protein leading to its activation. Our finding of ARX-PICK1 binding through the C-terminal region of the ARX protein, including the OAR domain and PRKCA phosphorylation of ARX through PICK1, a scaffold protein, allowing PRKCA to access the phosphosite of ARX we predict drives this conformation change. Interestingly, a number of missense mutations across this C-terminal portion of the <italic>ARX</italic> gene including the <italic>Aristaless</italic> domain lead to Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy (MIM#308350) or in one case the severe brain malformation phenotype of lissencephaly, X-linked 2 (MIM#300215). Further studies are required to assess if these missense mutations negatively impact on the capacity of the ARX protein to be phosphorylated and alter transcriptional capacity contributing to disease.</p>
<p>Post-translational modification of transcription factors can alter the dynamics by which they function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref032">32</xref>]. Phosphorylation in particular, can have multiple consequences, including interference of the phospho-group with DNA binding leading to inactivation of the transcription factor, increased protein stability and interaction with putative partners, and consequently DNA binding and target gene activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref035">35</xref>]. In HEK293T cells we showed ablation of each serine site identified as modified by phosphorylation did not result in marked changes to the normal subcellular localisation of the protein (overexpression studies). Nor was there a loss of transcriptional capacity of our phospho-null constructs compared to ARX-WT using a luciferase reporter assay consisting of three copies of the orthologous region identified as an ARX-binding site in the enhancer region of Lmo1 upstream of SV40-luciferase. This outcome indicates that phosphorylation of the ARX protein at these sites is not required for the homeodomain of ARX to bind to DNA motif containing ‘TAATTA’, at least in this <italic>in vitro</italic> settting. As these phosphorylation sites fall outside of the homeodomain it is likely that each site may influence the affinity and selectivity of protein-DNA and/or protein-protein interactions. Hence, each site modified may contribute to altering transcriptional activity differently through promoting association with distinct molecular partner/promoter regions.</p>
<p>RNASeq was used to determine the transcriptional consequences of two phospho-null constructs, p.S37AS67A and p.S174A. When phosphorylation at these sites was blocked, the transcriptional capacity of ARX in the alpha TC pancreatic cell line in which Arx is known to have a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref036">36</xref>], there was a considerable number of deregulated genes in mutant vs ARX-WT analysis. When the c-terminal region of ARX was truncated, the capacity to bind and co-localise PICK1 into the nucleus of cells with ARX protein was lost, and a similar loss of transcriptional activity as the S174A mutation was demonstrated by qRT-PCR. This strongly supports the role of PICK1 binding to the C-terminal region of ARX in subsequent phosphorylation at S174 by PRKCA required for transcriptional activity of the ARX protein on selected gene targets.</p>
<p>The phosphorylation state and the functional relevance of this modification in other cell types in which ARX plays a biological role is required, particularly in the brain. Hampering these efforts are the difficulties in isolation of adequate amounts of endogenous ARX required for analysis. This is due in part to the limited expression pattern of this transcription factor in the brain during early embryonic development coupled to the lack of a high specificity antibody against endogenous ARX/Arx, despite many antibodies generated to date. Ideally, generation (by CRISPR/Cas9 technology) of a mouse line in which the Arx locus is manipulated to incorporate a HA or Flag tag is required as a viable strategy to target the tagged-endogenous Arx protein by validated antibodies against the tag. This approach would provide an opportunity to investigate the role of Arx as a critical transcription factor in developmental processes, particularly in the brain, as well as the pancreas and reproductive organs.</p>
<p>ARX is known to be able to act as both an activator and repressor of gene expression. ARX-WT activity in alpha TC cells resulted in an even distribution of genes with increased (activated) and decreased (repressed) levels of expression. We saw an increase in the proportion of genes remaining repressed when alpha TC cells were transfected with the phospho-null mutants. We also saw additional targets repressed in the ARX-S174A mutant further supporting ARX-PICK1-PRKCA relationship for the activation of transcriptional activity. Pathway analysis of the genes specifically deregulated by ARX-S174A highlighted an enrichment of genes with a PAX4 motif upstream. ARX and PAX4 are drivers of different endocrine precursor cell fates. Indeed, ARX is involved in specifying the α-cell fate whereas Pax4 promotes the β and δ cell lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref037">37</xref>]. These two factors were found to mutually inhibit each other’s transcription and to display antagonistic activities for proper endocrine cell lineage allocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref011">11</xref>]. Lineage-tracing studies have shown that α-cells can serve as progenitors of β-cells and upon Arx inactivation, α-cells can be continuously regenerated and converted into β-like cells. The additional loss of Pax4 does not impact these processes, suggesting that Arx is the main trigger of α-cell-mediated β-like cell neogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0206914.ref038">38</xref>]. Therefore posttranslational modification of ARX may be an important switch driving between α and β cell fates. The present study establishes ARX as a multisite phosphoprotein. Our study suggests that ARX phosphorylation may have biological and in extrapolation, neurodevelopmental relevance. Further investigations to establish the <italic>in vivo</italic> modification of the ARX protein across relevant tissues and developmental time points are warranted.</p>

To improve the outcome of the mutagenesis reaction in residues located adjacent to GC-rich regions of <italic>ARX</italic>, additional primers (an <italic>ARX</italic> primer and a vector primer) with the same orientation as the mutagenesis primer were added. Alanine (A) substitutions were introduced to abolish the most likely phosphorylation sites (phospho-null mutants) including; two changes c.109A&gt;G and c.110G&gt;C to achieve p.S37A (ARX-S37A), c.199T&gt;G leading to p.S67A (ARX-S67A), and all three combined to give an ARX-S37AS67A double mutant; c.472A&gt;G leading to p.T158A (ARX-T158A) and c.520T&gt;G leading to p.S174A (ARX-S174A). To test the role of the C-terminal binding of PICK1 on ARX transcriptional activity, a c.1414C&gt;T change was generated to lead to a stop codon at p.R472X.

<title>Abolition of S37, S67 and S174 phosphorylation does not affect the transcriptional repression via homeodomain binding in a luciferase reporter assays nor sub-cellular localisation of ARX.</title>
<p><bold>A)</bold> Abolition of S37 and S67 phosphorylation does not affect the transcriptional activity of ARX using a luciferase reporter assay. ARX protein partner, co-repressor Groucho/TLE1 was added to determine the co-repression activity of ARX and TLE1 <italic>in vitro</italic>. <bold>B</bold>) Abolition of S174 by substitution with alanine does not affect the transcriptional activity of ARX in HEK293T cells in a luciferase reporter assay. Myc-tagged full-length ARX WT, phosphorylation mutant S174A, constitutively active S174E or Myc empty constructs were co-transfected with luciferase and Renilla (internal control) reporter constructs into HEK293T cells. Data were calculated as a ratio of luciferase to Renilla expression and expressed as a percentage of transcriptional activity relative to the activity of the Myc empty vector (100%). Error bars indicate SEM from three independent experiments.</p>
<p><bold>C)</bold> ARX-WT and phosphorylation mutant proteins (ARX-S37A, ARX-S67A, ARX-S174A and ARX-S174E) show normal non-homogenous staining in the nucleus. The percentage of transfected cells displaying abnormal localisation was determined from ~200–300 transfected cells per construct from at least two separate transfection reactions, 24hr post-transfection. R332P mutation is an ARX mutant known to have abnormal localisation.</p>
