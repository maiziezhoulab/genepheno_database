<abstract id="ab005">
<p>Clinical exome sequencing (CES) has become a routine diagnostic tool in several pediatric subspecialties, with a reported average diagnostic yield of ~25% in this patient poulation. The utility of CES in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has not been previously investigated, most likely due to the lack of the appropriate tertiary pediatric centers and diagnostic genomic facilities in this country. Here, we report, for the first time, CES findings on a multispecialty pediatric cohort in the UAE (N = 51). This cohort, which was mostly Emirati (86%; 44/51), was followed at Al Jalila Children’s Hospital (AJCH), the first and only dedicated tertiary pediatric center in the country. CES demonstrates a high diagnostic yield (41%; 21/51) in this cohort, where 55% (28/51) had previous non-diagnostic genetic testing while for the remaining individuals (45%), CES was the first-tier test. Given the reported high consanguinity rate in this population, 48% of the positive cases (10/21) were due to genes associated with recessive conditions. However, 11 out of 21 positive cases (52%) were due to heterozygous pathogenic variants in genes known to cause dominantly inherited disorders, including a case with a dual diagnosis attributed to two different genes (2%; 1/51), and another case with a novel <italic>de novo</italic> variant and new phenotypic features for a known gene (2%; 1/51). Overall, we have identified 13 novel clinically significant variants and showed that application of CES as a first-tier test plays a significant role in genetic diagnosis and management of Emirati pediatric patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="p0005">Clinical exome sequencing (CES) is currently a routine pediatric diagnostic tool that has demonstrated an average diagnostic yield of 25% for patients with a wide range of indications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0005">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0010">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0015">[3]</xref>. The incidence of genetic disorders in the Arab countries, including the UAE, is extremely high and placing a burden of an estimated total annual cost of not less than $13 billion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0020">[4]</xref> to the economy. According to the March of Dimes report, the UAE is ranked sixth in the context of the prevalence of birth defects reaching up to 75.9 cases per 1000 live births <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0025">[5]</xref>. Although the major known genetic illnesses include hemoglobin disorders (thalassemia, sickle cell), Down syndrome, and G6PD deficiency, the burden of other rare genetic disorders in the UAE has not yet been established partly due to lack of appropriate genetics diagnostic testing facilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0030">[6]</xref>. The collective prevalence of those disorders is expected to be relatively high in this part of the world due to the high rate of consanguinity, extended family structure, and advanced paternal and/or maternal age at conception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0035">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p id="p0010">The utility of CES has been assessed in a small cohort from the UAE, though, this cohort was mainly focused on patients with highly suspected inborn errors of metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0040">[8]</xref>. However, utility of CES across multiple other pediatric subspecialties remains to be explored. Al Jalila Children’s Specialty Hospital (AJCH) is the first dedicated tertiary pediatric center in the UAE. Therefore, its patient population presents with uniquely complex clinical scenarios across multiple specialties, of which genetics is most likely to be a major component. Since its opening in 2016, clinicians at Al Jalila have been utilizing CES for several indications as part of their clinical workup. This represents an unprecedented opportunity to explore the utility of CES in the UAE, and to start estimating the prevalence and types of rare genetic disorders in this country.</p>
<p id="p0015">Here we demonstrate the high diagnostic yield of CES in a predominantly Emirati pediatric cohort presenting to multiple pediatric subspecialties at AJCH, and stratify this yield with respect to indication, age, gender, family history, and other demographics. We have also attempted to characterize the genetic landscape (i.e. genes and mutations) of the diseases for which a molecular diagnosis was made. Further, we detail the impact of CES diagnosis on medical management of patients.</p>

<title>Ethical approval</title>
<p id="p0020">This study (AJCH-022) was approved by the Dubai HealthCare Authority (DHCA) Research Ethics Committee. Since this is a retrospective de-identified cohort description study, the ethics committee determined that an informed consent was not required.</p>

<title>Study design and WES testing</title>
<p id="p0025">The period of this study was from July 2017 to January 2019, and the cohort included all patients seen as outpatient or inpatient at AJCH and for whom CES testing was ordered. There were no inclusion or exclusion criteria. This included 51 patients whose medical records were searched for the exome reports, indication, age, gender, nationality, and other lab or MRI/EEG imaging findings. CES during this period was performed at an external CAP-accredited clinical genetic testing laboratory. CES was performed using Agilent exome capture probes (Human All Exon V5 or V6) and Illumina sequencing platform at the testing facility where bioinformatics analysis and variant calling was done using a validated custom pipeline. Turnaround time for CES genetic diagnostic report release was approximately 12 weeks. We analyzed all reports from testing laboratory and defined “Diagnostic” reports as those that included variants classified as “pathogenic” or “likely pathogenic” according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines for sequence variant interpretation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0045">[9]</xref> and that explained the patient’s underlying clinical condition. “Likely diagnostic” reports included rare, highly suspicious variants in genes matching patients’ clinical indications, though more information was needed at the time to confirm the pathogenicity of those variants according to the ACMG guidelines. The clinical utility of CES has been measured by evaluating medical charts to demonstrate the impact CES has on medical management and treatment strategies. The clinical factors measured include changes in patient care, medication or dietary changes, and further diagnostic testing.</p>

<title>Cohort description</title>
<p id="p0030">The studied cohort presented with diverse clinical indications typical of cases referred for CES. Based on the phenotypic information provided by the referring physician, the cases were classified into broad clinical categories. The largest category comprised of neurodevelopmental phenotypes (23/51, 45%), with global development delay (GDD), failure to thrive (FTT), hypotonia, seizures/epilepsy, intellectual disability and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) as the most common indications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>a). Patients with complex phenotypes involving multiple organ system abnormalities constituted 24% of the cases. Other categories were patients presenting with possible auto-inflammatory or rheumatology disorders, abnormalities of the neuromuscular system, abnormalities of the metabolic/endocrine system and gastrointestinal disorders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>a).<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Descriptive statistics of the patient cohort. The cohort included 51 consecutive cases referred for CES at AJCH (a) Primary disease classification of the patients based on clinical indications. (b) Ancestry of the cohort (c) Parental consanguinity in the cohort (d) Proportion of patients who had undergone other forms of genetic testing, prior to CES, which returned negative or normal results.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="p0035">Of the 51 index cases, the largest proportion (44/51, 86%) were from the Emirati population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>b). The age of the patients ranged from 2 months to 14 years with the largest group consisting of 1–5 years accounting to 43% (22/51). Approximately 10% of the patients were less than 1 year of age. Around 61% of the cohort were males. For 31 cases (61%), analysis of parents (trios) or an additional family member was performed, enabling investigation into possible modes of inheritance of disease in the family. Of note, 43% of the index cases were self reportedly from consanguineous families and 57% were from non-consanguineous families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>c). In the consanguineous group, 63% were presented with positive family history while in the non-consanguineous group, 24% had positive family histories.</p>
<p id="p0040">Prior to CES referral, 55% (28/51) of the patients had undergone extensive genetic diagnostic work-up, which were returned negative for the indication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>d). The majority of the patients had been tested negative for chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) alone (22/51, 43%) or in combination with other tests (~6%). Other tests included karyotyping, single-gene testing, next-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panels and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) gene deletion/duplication analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>d). One patient had been tested negative for 4 tests including karyotype, CMA, methylation analysis, and an NGS gene panel.</p>

<title>Diagnostic yield of CES</title>
<p id="p0045">Overall, 41% (21/51) CES referrals harbored one or more variants that satisfied the criteria for a full or partial genetic diagnosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>a). The diagnostic yield across different clinical categories are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>b. Among the major clinical categories, the highest diagnostic rate was observed in the neuromuscular disease category (67% or 2/3) followed by neurodevelopmental category (52% or 12/23). Despite the high rate of consanguinity, variants identified for 11 out of the 21 cases were heterozygous for dominant disorders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>c). When we analyzed the data for consanguineous and non-consanguineous groups separately, the consanguineous group was found to have a higher number of recessive homozygous variants (n = 7) than the non-consanguineous group (n = 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>c). Parental consanguinity was observed to be linked to a higher diagnostic rate since the observed diagnostic yield for consanguineous group was 59% (13/22) while that for the non-consanguineous group was 28% (8/29). Among CES positive cases 11 out of 21 had undergone previous genetic tests that were unrevealing.<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Descriptive statistics of the positive exome cases. A total of 21 index cases out of 51 referred for WES received a positive diagnosis. (a) Overall diagnostic yield of CES across all disease categories (b) Diagnostic yield of CES in specific clinical categories. (c) Proportion of dominant and recessive disorders among consanguineous versus non-consanguineous positive cases. “C” indicates consanguineous, "NC" indicates non-consanguineous. Number of total identified variants were 22 across 21 positive cases. (d) Proportion of novel variants identified in the cohort. Novel variants are defined as variants that were absent from population databases such as gnomAD and dbSNP, and disease databases such as ClinVar and HGMD and published literature (refer to <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s0065">Suppl Table S1</xref>) (d) Proportion of diagnostic/likely diagnostic cases receiving an altered management plan as indicated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr2"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="p0050">The diagnostic or likely diagnostic cases included a diverse array of disorders such as infantile hypotonia, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 1; (IHPRF1; <italic>NALCN</italic>), Aspartylglucosaminuria (<italic>AGA</italic>), Epileptic encephalopathy, early infantile, 4 (<italic>STXBP1</italic>) and severe myoclonic epilepsy (<italic>SCN1A</italic>). In patients with complex phenotypes the molecular diagnoses included Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliotic type, 1 (<italic>PLOD1</italic>), Bardet-Biedl syndrome 7 (<italic>BBS7</italic>) and Weaver syndrome (<italic>EZH2</italic>) suggesting highly heterogeneous syndromes can be resolved by CES. One patient in this category presenting with GDD, motor delay and infections received dual diagnosis for two autosomal dominant disorders attributed to the presence of heterozygous pathogenic variants in two different genes (<italic>KMT2C;</italic> OMIM#617768 and <italic>GNAO1;</italic> OMIM #617493) associated with those disorders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0005">Table 1</xref>). The spectrum of variants included missense (n = 9), nonsense (n = 7), frameshift (n = 4) and splice-site (n = 1) variants. One case was heterozygous for a deletion at the chromosomal locus 9q34.3. About 59% of the variants identified by CES were previously unpublished in the peer-reviewed literature or disease variant databases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>d) which included 7 novel loss-of-function variants and 6 novel missense variants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0005">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s0065">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).<table-wrap id="t0005" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Diagnostic and likely diagnostic CES cases with clinical indications and details of variants identified.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>ID</th><th>Age</th><th>Gender</th><th>Ancestry</th><th>Case</th><th>Family History</th><th>Parental Consanguinity</th><th>Primary Disease classification</th><th>Genes</th><th>Variants (cDNA; protein)</th><th>Variant class/ status</th><th>Mode of Inheritance</th><th>Zygosity</th><th>Therapeutic interventions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>2 Yrs.</td><td>M</td><td>Emirati</td><td>Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal (COFS) syndrome, GDD.</td><td>Positive in first degree cousins</td><td>Yes</td><td>Neurodevelopmental</td><td><italic>ERCC5</italic></td><td>NM_000123.3: c.2902 T &gt; C; p.Trp968Arg</td><td>VUS/ Novel<sup>#</sup></td><td>AR</td><td>Hom.</td><td>Occupational therapy, physiotherapy, Postponed surgical procedure</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>14 Yrs.</td><td>M</td><td>Emirati</td><td>GDD, FTT, RF, Cerebral palsy, generalized tonic colonic seizure</td><td><italic>Mother:</italic> Hyperactive thyroid, undergone thyroidectomy, currently on thyroid replacement therapy, <italic>brother:</italic> developmental delay &amp; hypothyroidism, <italic>maternal uncle:</italic> muscle weakness &amp; wheelchair bound</td><td>No</td><td>Neurodevelopmental</td><td><italic>NALCN</italic></td><td>NM_001350748.1:c.2621_2622insATACTAAA; p.Phe875Tyrfs*2</td><td>Pathogenic/Novel</td><td>AR</td><td>Hom.</td><td>Intermittent non-invasive BIPAP, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, dietary management</td></tr><tr><td><italic>3</italic></td><td>19 Mos.</td><td>M</td><td>Emirati</td><td>Rubinstein taybi syndrome, Recurrent seizures, GDD, FTT</td><td>Sister: Congenital hypothyroidism, 2 maternal aunts: hypothyroidism</td><td>Yes</td><td>Neurodevelopmental</td><td><italic>TSHR</italic></td><td>NM_000369.2: c.1295A &gt; G; p.Asn432Ser</td><td>VUS/Novel<sup>#</sup></td><td>AR/AD</td><td>Hom.</td><td>Neuro rehabilitation, physiotherapy, speech therapy</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>10 Yrs.</td><td>F</td><td>Emirati</td><td>GDD secondary to anoxic brain injury, intellectual disability</td><td>None</td><td>Yes</td><td>Neurodevelopmental</td><td><italic>TRAPPC6B</italic></td><td>NM_001079537.1: c.267 + 1G &gt; A; p.?</td><td>Pathogenic/Novel</td><td>AR</td><td>Hom.</td><td>School for special needs, occupational therapy, psychology care</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>7 Yrs.</td><td>M</td><td>Emirati</td><td>Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, Epilepsy</td><td>None</td><td>Yes</td><td>Complex, multisystem</td><td><italic>BBS7</italic></td><td>NM_176824.2: c.124G &gt; A; p.Gly42Arg</td><td>VUS/ Novel<sup>#</sup></td><td>AR</td><td>Hom.</td><td>Multiple specialties follow up</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">6</td><td rowspan="2">3 Yrs.</td><td rowspan="2">M</td><td rowspan="2">Emirati</td><td rowspan="2">ASD, G6PD, GDD</td><td rowspan="2">Mother: G6PD, One maternal cousin: delayed walking</td><td rowspan="2">Yes</td><td rowspan="2">Neurodevelopmental</td><td><italic>TSC2</italic></td><td>NM_000548.4: c.1754G &gt; A; p.Arg585His</td><td>VUS/ Reported</td><td>AD</td><td>Het</td><td rowspan="2">Speech therapy, occupational therapy</td></tr><tr><td><italic>G6PD<sup>┼</sup></italic></td><td>NM_000402.4: c.653C &gt; T; p.Ser218Phe</td><td>Pathogenic/Reported</td><td>XLD</td><td>Hemi</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5 Yrs.</td><td>M</td><td>Emirati</td><td>Central DI, CVID, ICF, GDD, FTT, OSA</td><td>Paternal cousin: cleft lip, mother: DMT1</td><td>Yes</td><td>Endocrine/Metabolic</td><td><italic>BCL11A</italic></td><td>NM_022893.3: c.317C &gt; T; p.Thr106Met</td><td>VUS/ Novel</td><td>AD</td><td>Het.</td><td>Monitoring of fluid intake, low salt diet, Life-style changes, caregiver escort</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>3 Yrs.</td><td>M</td><td>Emirati</td><td>Acute gastritis, Epilepsy</td><td>Brother: 4 years old, speech delay.

<p id="p0055">Out of the 21 cases with a genetic diagnosis, 14 had a definitive molecular diagnosis with the identification of pathogenic or a likely pathogenic variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>a, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t0005">Table 1</xref>). Variants of unknown significance (VUS), which we still considered as “likely diagnostic”, were reported in seven cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>a). These variants were included in the list of positive cases because they were rare variants with strong evidence of pathogenicity (segregation, different amino acid changes at the same position, etc.), and were in genes highly matching the patient’s reported phenotype and the inheritance model. For example, the heterozygous c.1927G &gt; C (p. Gly643Arg) variant of uncertain clinical significance, detected in the <italic>CIC</italic> gene, was identified in three affected siblings from the same family. Pathogenic variants in the <italic>CIC</italic> gene cause mental retardation, autosomal dominant 45 (OMIM#617600), characterized by variable intellectual disability, often with language delay and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0050">[10]</xref>. Parental analysis was also included in this study, which revealed that this variant was inherited from the father, with borderline IQ. Another selected example involves a novel missense variant in <italic>BCL11A</italic> that occurred <italic>de novo</italic> in a patient with suspected metabolic/endocrine syndrome and dysmorphic features that was able to explain the patient phenotype partially. Heterozygous <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in the <italic>BCL11A</italic> gene are associated with Diaz-Logan syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, variable dysmorphic features and asymptomatic persistence of fetal hemoglobin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0055">[11]</xref>. This patient had additional renal phenotypic features that are not currently associated with the variations in the <italic>BCL11A</italic> gene. However, a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving the <italic>BCL11A</italic> and adjacent genes in the 2p15p16.1 interval is associated with renal and cardiac anomalies in addition to brain anomalies, though those phenotypes are largely attributed to other genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0060">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0065">[13]</xref>. Emerging information on the genes may help to reclassify these variants in the future and provide better clinical correlation.</p>

<title>Impact of CES on medical management</title>
<p id="p0060">Importantly, several of the positive diagnoses had implications for the patients and their families. Altered medical management was reported in 13 out of 21 patients (62%). Physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and other forms of psychosocial supports were initiated for 6 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>e). Although such therapies could have been started anyways, genetic diagnosis reinforced those management therapies and ruled out any possible underlying serious disorders for which other management plans would have been more appropriate. Medical management changes such as altered medications, treatment plan or specialties follow-up were reported for another 6 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>e). Dietary changes were implemented for one patient. An example is case No.2 presenting with global developmental delay, generalized muscle wasting, crowded teeth, scoliosis, dysmorphic features, epilepsy, and mild hypotonia, who received a positive diagnosis for infantile hypotonia, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 1 (IHPRF1) related to <italic>NALCN</italic> gene. Although no specific treatment plan was available for this disorder, the CES findings excluded other possible differential diagnoses and supported a management plan including intermittent non-invasive bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP), occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and dietary management.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="p0065">We have reported here the overall diagnostic yield of 41% for CES in a complex pediatric cohort mainly comprised of Emirati patients. This yield is higher than the reported average CES yield of 25% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0010">[2]</xref>, which can vary based on indication reaching up to ~50% for hearing and vision disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0070">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0075">[15]</xref>. Although larger cohort sizes are needed for more generalizable conclusions, our findings from this small cohort (n = 51) did provide interesting insights into the incorporation of whole exome sequencing into clinical practice and affirm previous observations about the influence of cultural practices and population structure on genetic disorders. The cohort presented here had diverse and striking phenotypes that belonged to different clinical categories. The highest diagnostic yield (52%) was obtained in the neurodevelopmental category which encompassed patients presenting with more than one phenotype related to developmental delays, seizures, hypotonia and dysmorphisms emphasizing the fact that CES can resolve many underlying genetic conditions in this category. Since AJCH is a tertiary pediatric care hospital, most patients selected for CES had undergone extensive clinical and diagnostic work-up, which would have helped the physicians to eliminate other underlying reasons making a positive CES result highly probable. At present, for individuals with unexplained DD/ID, ASD, or MCA, chromosomal microarrays (CMA) are recommended as the first-tier test with a reported diagnostic yield of 15%–20% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0080">[16]</xref>. A recently reported meta-analysis led to a consensus statement that among patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, whole exome sequencing is likely to produce a higher molecular diagnostic yield than CMA and should be considered as a first-tier test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0085">[17]</xref>. Among the 21 CES positive patients in our cohort, 10 had been previously tested negative in CMA analysis indicating the trend of higher diagnostic utility of CES.</p>
<p id="p0070">The prevalence of genetic disorders is attributed to the peculiar demographic features of UAE which is characterized by large family size, advanced maternal and paternal age and consanguinity in the ranges of 25–60% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0035">[7]</xref>. In our cohort comprising mostly of Emirati individuals (86%), around 43% were from consanguineous unions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Fig. 1</xref>c). Among the hereditary disorders, recessively inherited disorders appear to be predominant owing to the high rates of consanguinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0020">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0035">[7]</xref>. Surprisingly, in our cohort dominant disorders were found to be more common than recessive disorders. However, when we analyzed the consanguineous group and non-consanguineous group separately, autosomal recessive disorders were more common in the consanguineous group than in the non-consanguineous group. The consanguineous group had a higher diagnostic yield than the non-consanguineous group with recessive and dominant disorders in equal proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0010">Fig. 2</xref>c). Some variants in the autosomal dominant category were <italic>de novo</italic> or presumed <italic>de novo</italic>. Paternal age-related <italic>de novo</italic> mutations have been reported to confer high risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), congenital heart disease, neurodevelopmental disorders with epilepsy, intellectual disability and schizophrenia (SCZ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0090">[18]</xref>, which requires additional investigations in this cohort.</p>
<p id="p0075">Large scale studies on genetic variations in this unique population are lacking and could prove to be a bottleneck for identifying and classifying rare variants since this population is underrepresented in the popular public databases such as gnomAD. The Greater Middle East (GME) Variome Project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0095">[19]</xref> catalogues coding base variations from 2,497 individuals in the greater Middle East region, namely the Arabic Peninsula, Northeast Africa, Syrian Desert, Central Asia, Northwest Africa and Turkish Peninsula. Although very useful, this study is very small and does not represent the full normal variation in all subpopulations within this highly diverse region.</p>
<p id="p0080">Variants that are rare in other public databases, such as gnomAD, could be common in this population and can confound exome analysis. Among the positive variants identified, 59% were novel variants not published before, either in the literature or public databases, revealing population-specific disease variants. Some of the disorders uncovered through CES were found to be disorders having a higher prevalence in the Arab population or clustering to Arab communities or isolates. For example, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome caused by the <italic>PLOD1</italic> gene has been reported to cluster in Bedouin families in UAE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0100">[20]</xref>. Bardet-Biedel syndrome is reported to be highly prevalent in Arab populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0100">[20]</xref>. Comorbidity is another factor contributing to diverse clinical presentations patients from the region especially with major disorders including thalassemias, sickle cell disease, and cystic fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0020">[4]</xref>. Patient No.6 was diagnosed with G6PD deficiency and the occurrence of a <italic>G6PD</italic> pathogenic variant had been earlier confirmed. In this patient a VUS in the <italic>TSC2</italic> gene was identified which could partially explain their ASD/GDD features. Another patient received a dual diagnoses for two different autosomal dominant disorders.</p>
<p id="p0085">In patients with positive CES results altered medical management was documented for 13/21 cases highlighting the clinical utility of the assay. Many of these patients in the neurodevelopment category would have received appropriate treatment modalities regardless of CES results. In our experience of this cohort, CES helped to bring an end to the diagnostic odyssey for these patients, directed sub-specialty follow-up and/or appropriate medical rehabilitation.</p>
<p id="p0090">In conclusion, our results from 51 complex pediatric probands demonstrate the clinical utility of CES which can be a cost-effective diagnostic test in a tertiary pediatric setting. A positive diagnosis could help the physicians in taking medical management decisions and put an end to the diagnostic odyssey of the patients and reduce the burden of expensive multiple tests. For many negative cases, periodic exome reanalysis can provide clarity for an uncertain diagnosis. We anticipate that our findings will encourage research in the direction of incorporation of CES as a first-line diagnostic test for unexplained/heterogeneous genetic disorders encountered in the Emirati population.</p>
