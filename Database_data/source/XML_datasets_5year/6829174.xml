<abstract>
<p>Cognition has attracted a growing interest in psychiatry. Since the 1990s,
cognition as a whole has become an important determinant in the outcome of psychosis.
Despite recent progress in the genetics of cognition, the development of new
pharmacological compounds in order to improve cognition has not progressed as quickly.
This issue will review and discuss the main areas of clinical and basic research in this
domain. </p>

A quick Medline search using the keywords “cognition” and “psychiatry” generated
about 40 000 records. Numerous publications are related to memory and/or executive
functioning in psychotic disorders, or to aging and dementia. Cognitive performance
in clinical neuropsychology typically refers to assessment of cognitive domains of
functioning. Originally, these domains were linked to specific brain areas where
processes were supposed to take place. More recently, circuit-based conceptions
focused on activation of different brain regions and their potential interactions.
Moreover, brain imaging helped to understand how brain structures might be involved
in normal and pathological cognition. Cognitive assessment was currently used to
identify patterns of performance/impairments across domains as markers of functional
deficits, which could become treatment targets in populations with brain damage,
degenerative diseases and psychiatric conditions. Finally, metacognition (ie,
“knowledge and regulation of cognition”) is a concept which has been developed since
1970. Flavell
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
distinguished several aspects of “knowledge”: a declarative or person knowledge
(understanding one’s own abilities); a procedural or task knowledge; and a strategy
knowledge (one’s ability to use strategies to learn information and adapt these
strategies to novelty). The term “regulation“ was used to describe how people
monitor and assess their knowledge. Motivation plays also an important role in
metacognition. The term “cognitive,” as used in most contemporary psychotherapeutic
interventions, refers to a metacognitive approach aimed at modifying inappropriate
thoughts and beliefs. 
</p>
<p>
Psychiatric populations were usually classified according to the prominent clinical
symptoms observed, independently of the cognitive dysfunctions measured. Yet, these
latter dysfunctions may overlap among psychiatric disorders. A better understanding
of these common cognitive dysfunctions may contribute to identifying the brain
mechanisms involved in these disorders. 
</p>
<p>
Moreover, psychotic symptoms are observed in primary psychotic disorders (eg,
schizophrenia) as well as in affective psychoses (eg, bipolar disorder with
psychotic features); they can also occur in certain somatic disorders or, in some
patients exposed to certain medications/substances or to alcohol. Beyond clinical
symptoms, a significant majority of patients with psychosis also present impaired
cognition. Since the 1990s, there has been a growing interest and recognition in
cognition as an important determinant in the outcome of psychosis. Thus, the
prevalence, profile and magnitude, the developmental course and the longitudinal
stability of cognitive impairment are major areas of research to target treatments,
which can improve functional outcome in these populations. McCleery and Nuechterlein
(p 239) as well as Robbins et al (p 301) review this topic in this issue. Moreover,
Harvey, in this issue (p 227), reviews the assessment of major cognitive domains and
comments on whether each domain fits into a top-down or bottom-up structure (complex
vs basic domains). In addition, the intrinsic validity of these tests was raised in
psychiatric populations (which differ from the patients with specific regional brain
lesions in whom these tests were originally validated). As deficits in higher-order
executive functions and decision-making are significant predictors of relapse,
cognitive training, remediation, and pharmacological approaches have the potential
to rescue cognition. To date, cognitive rehabilitation has focused on cognitive
enhancing pharmacological agents and cognitive training (CT). CT has shown efficacy,
while glutamatergic and cholinergic pharmaceutical compounds demonstrated small
improvements in working memory and overall cognition. Physical exercise and
neurostimulation are new areas of investigation, which can be combined with other
approaches (eg, with CT) to improve cognition (see Moritz et al [p 309] and Schmitt
et al [p 261] in this issue). In addition, the benefit of not only exercise, but
also physical activity in general, is linked to improvement of neural plasticity and
neurogenesis.  
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, whereas cognitive deficits can be considered as symptoms when “cold
cognition” domains are impaired (attention, memory, working memory, etc), they can
also be understood to interact with emotional or motivational factors in the case of
“hot cognition” impairments (decision making, impulsivity, social cognition, etc).
Until recently, this latter area was insufficiently studied, especially in psychotic
disorders and autism, where these deficits are associated with major social
adjustment difficulties. Blair (p 291) discusses in this issue two forms of
dysfunctional neurocognition that increase the risk of psychopathology. Firstly, a
reduced emotional responsiveness, empathy, moral judgment, and immoral behavior may
increase the risk for aggressiveness in adolescents and adults. Secondly, reduced
reward responsiveness, including to drug cues in adolescents with clinically
antisocial behavior, may increase the risk for psychopathy. 
</p>
<p>
More broadly, Verdejo-Garcia et al, in this issue (p 281) summarize knowledge about
substance-use disorders including alcohol, stimulants, and opioids related to
cognitive deficits. 
</p>
<p>
Kühn et al, in this issue (p 319) review video gaming and its involvement in
cognition as well as in functional and structural changes in brain regions. Among
observed effects, visuospatial cognition and attention seem to be enhanced; this
might be able to be used in cognitive remediation of certain psychiatric
disorders. 
</p>
<p>
Ongoing research focused on the association of cognitive function and presynaptic
proteins, which could become a target for new drugs, taking into consideration that
presynaptic plasticity contributes to cognitive function evolution during aging (see
Honer et al in this issue, p 271). 
</p>
<p>
Finally, according to recent studies, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based
estimates of heritability for general cognitive function were approximately 20% to
30%; these estimates might increase to 50% when family-based designs were used (due
to potential contributions of rarer SNPs).

Davies et al,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
analyzing more than 300 000 individuals of European ancestry, aged between 16 and
102 years, reported 148 genome-wide significant loci for general cognitive function.
In this study, a general cognitive function component phenotype was constructed from
a number of cognitive tasks. Using polygenic scoring, 4.31% of the general cognitive
function variance was predicted in an independent sample. In Davies’ study, variants
associated with neurodegenerative as well as neurodevelopmental disorders, physical
and psychiatric illnesses, or brain structures, neural and cell development were
reported. In parallel, most of the candidate genes involved in major psychiatric
disorders were also involved in core neurodevelopmental processes which are strongly
associated with synaptic plasticity, brain circuit formation, and, ultimately,
higher-order cognitive performance. Yet, the development of new pharmacological
compounds in order to improve cognition has not progressed as quickly as genetics.
Both the lack of genetically validated targets and of mechanisms involved and, the
almost exclusive focus of preclinical research and industrial drug discovery on
aminergic signaling, have contributed to this delay. Stephan et al, in this issue (p
249), will discuss new concepts and future potential of translational research on
cognition in psychiatry.
