<abstract>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disability characterized by impaired social interactions, stereotypical repetitive behavior and restricted interests. Although the global incidence of ASD has increased over time, the etiology of ASD is poorly understood, and there is no effective pharmacological intervention for treating ASD. Recent studies have suggested that metformin has the potential to treat ASD. Thus, in this study, we assessed the therapeutic effects of early metformin treatment in a BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mouse model of ASD. We observed that early metformin administration significantly reversed social approach deficits, attenuated repetitive grooming and reduced marble burying in BTBR mice. Metformin did not change the general locomotor activity or anxiety-like behavior in both BTBR and C57BL/6J (B6) mice. Our findings suggest that early metformin treatment may have beneficial effects on ameliorating behavioral deficits in ASD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a cluster of neurodevelopmental disabilities characterized by defective social interactions, impaired communication and restricted and repetitive behaviors (Leekam et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2011</xref>; Fakhoury, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2015</xref>). About 1% of children are affected by ASD all over the world, and the prevalence is allegedly increasing with even more unreported and undiagnosed ASD cases (Huguet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2016</xref>). Despite its significance, there are still no validated pharmacological or behavioral treatments to alleviate ASD symptoms (Chahrour et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2016</xref>; Lacivita et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2017</xref>). Therefore, it is urgent for efficacious treatments to be developed to prevent and treat ASD.</p>
<p>Metformin, a biguanide drug, is widely utilized in the therapy of diabetes mellitus. It was demonstrated that metformin crosses the blood brain barrier and it was amply demonstrated to not only prevent diabetes-induced memory deficits in rats (Mousavi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2015</xref>), but also modulate cognitive functional abnormalities in several neuropsychiatric disorders (Hsu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2011</xref>; Dy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2018</xref>). In depressed patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic treatment with metformin has antidepressant behavioral effects through improvements in cognitive performance (Guo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2014</xref>). Metformin treatment rescued spatial memory impairment and neuronal death in the hippocampus, and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis in Alzheimer’s disease mouse model (Ou et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2018</xref>). One clinical study conducted by Dy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2018</xref>) has shown that metformin treatment could cause consistent alleviation in social responsiveness, social avoidance, irritability and hyperactivity in individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading inherited cause of intellectual disability and ASD, without significant side-effects. A recent study has also shown that metformin corrected social deficits, reversed increased self-grooming and reduced the incidence of seizures in the adult FXS mouse model (Gantois et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2017</xref>). These data suggest that metformin may have the potential to counteract the cognitive and behavioral deficits shown in ASD models.</p>
<p>It has been inferred that early intervention is important to prevent and correct the pathological phenotypes of neurodevelopmental disorders, thereby reversing behavioral and functional deficits in adults (Cioni et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2016</xref>). Treatment with Metformin significantly improved deficits of locomotor activity and cognition in rats subjected to perinatal hypoxia-ischemia (Qi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2017</xref>). Another study indicated that metformin administration during the neonatal period could alleviate a contextual fear memory deficit in a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder model (Tunc-Ozcan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2018</xref>). One preclinical study reported that early social enrichment could rescue adult behavioral and spine morphology abnormalities shown in a FXS mouse model (Oddi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2015</xref>). The study conducted by Vuillermot et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2017</xref>) revealed that vitamin D treatment during pregnancy could prevent autism-relevant behavioral abnormalities in an ASD mouse model. However, the role of early metformin treatment in the prevention-correction remains unclear.</p>
<p>The BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) inbred mouse strain, a well-characterized animal model, displays several ASD-related behaviors. Similar to the clinical symptoms of ASD, BTBR mice display low sociability and increased repetitive behaviors, like self-grooming and marble burying (McFarlane et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2008</xref>; Silverman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2010</xref>; Amodeo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2016</xref>). In the present experiment, we examined the effect of early metformin treatment on social and repetitive behavioral deficits in the BTBR mice. The effect of metformin on social and repetitive behaviors was also examined in the control strain, C57BL/6J (B6), which displays normal sociability and a low level of repetitive behavior. This preclinical study shows that metformin has the potential of being a pharmacological target for ameliorating the core symptoms of ASD.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="s2-1">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Mice were bred according to the Third Military Medical University guidelines and 2–4 mice were grouped per cage under a 12:12 h light:dark cycle. All mice were maintained in a standard animal facility with water and food <italic>ad libitum</italic>. BTBR mice breeding pairs were purchased from the Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University (Nanjing, China). The B6 mice breeding pairs were obtained from the Third Military Medical University. Male pups used in our studies were all bred in the same facility of the Third Military Medical University. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of Laboratory Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee of the Third Military Medical University. The protocol was approved by the Laboratory Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee of the Third Military Medical University. All efforts were made to minimize the suffering of animals and the number of animals used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-2">
<title>Drug Treatment</title>
<p>To avoid the litter effects, we randomly chose a maximum of two male pups per litter for each experimental group. B6 groups were composed of offspring from 10 different litters and BTBR from 9 litters. Postnatal day 0 (P0) refers specifically to the day of birth. Fourteen male pups in each group were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with metformin (200 mg/kg), a dose previously used in animal studies (Gantois et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2017</xref>; Tunc-Ozcan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2018</xref>) or the vehicle (same volume of sterile saline solution) from P7 to P14 once per day (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The treatment groups included the following: B6+Saline (SAL), B6+metformin (MET), BTBR+SAL, BTBR+MET.</p>

<sec id="s2-3">
<title>Behavioral Tests</title>
<p>Behavioral tests of BTBR and of the control strain B6 were conducted at the age of 8 weeks during daytime of the circadian cycle (each group contains 10 mice). The mice were subjected to a comprehensive battery of behavioral tests; the timeline for behavioral testing is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>. Mice were acclimated to the behavior laboratory for at least 30 min prior to each test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-4">
<title>Three-Chambered Social Approach</title>
<p>The testing procedures were evaluated in a rectangular apparatus (40 cm × 60 cm × 22 cm, divided into three equal parts) as previously described (Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2011</xref>). In brief, the test had a 10-min habituation phase and a 10-min testing phases (object vs. stranger mouse). During the habitation period, a test mouse was introduced and allowed to freely explore the whole arena. Then, the subject animal explored all three chambers for 10 min, where they were given the choice to interact with a novel caged mouse (S) on one side of the chamber, or stay on the other side of the chamber with a novel object (O). The chambers were cleaned using 70% ethanol and water between each test. The amount of time spent in each chamber sniffing, and the number of entries into each chamber were analyzed utilizing Ethovision XT 11.5. The preference index was calculated, which represents a numerical alteration numerical between the time in the chambers (stranger mouse vs. object) divided by the total time spent in both chambers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-5">
<title>Open Field Test</title>
<p>General open field locomotion was assessed in a photocell-equipped automated open field arena (40 cm × 40 cm × 30 cm). The animals were placed in the center of the apparatus and allowed to move around freely for 30 min. The movements of the mice were recorded for 30 min using a video camera secured to the top of the apparatus and analyzed using Ethovision XT 11.5. The test apparatus was cleaned with 70% ethanol between each subjects test session. The testing room was illuminated at ~200 lux (Silverman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2015</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-6">
<title>Self-Grooming</title>
<p>The mice were introduced gently into a clean standard mouse cage with a video camera placed 15 cm away from the cage. Twenty minutes were recorded for the manual scoring of repetitive self-grooming during the second 10 min of the testing session, illuminated at 40 lux. The total amount of time spent grooming, number of grooming bouts and the percentage of incorrect grooming transitions were analyzed by an observer that was blind to the experimental design. The grooming behavioral microstructure was analyzed using a grooming analysis algorithm. A grooming bout consists of the following grooming steps: no grooming (0), paw (1), face (2), body (3), leg (4), tail/genital (5). A complete bout includes an in-order grooming from 0 to 5, without any longer than 6’s interruption and no other behavior during the bout. We defined a sequentially transition move in the correct order, as 0–1, 1–2, 2–3. The incorrect transitions of disordered grooming movements, are defined as 1–3, 4–1 (Kalueff et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2007</xref>; Pearson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2011</xref>). The percentage of incorrect transitions was calculated as incorrect transitions divided by total number of transitions. The cages were cleaned with 70% ethanol between each subjects test session (Silverman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2015</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-7">
<title>Marble Burying</title>
<p>The marble burying was measured by previously described methods (Gould et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2011</xref>). In brief, empty and clean cages were filled with bedding up to 5 cm in depth, and 20 black glass marbles were arranged in a 4 × 5 grid throughout the bedding. The mice were then moved to the cages and allowed to freely explore for 30 min, deprived of food and liquids. Afterwards, the number of marbles buried was counted. Marble “burying” was defined as two-thirds or more covered by bedding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-8">
<title>Elevated Plus-Maze</title>
<p>The Elevated Plus-Maze (EPM) was structured with two open arms and two closed arms (30 cm × 6 cm ×15 cm) extending from a central area (6 cm × 6 cm). Initially, the mice were placed in the center area facing an open arm. During the 10-min session, the ratio of time spent in the open arms divided by the total time spent in all arms and the total number of entries were analyzed (Cai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2017</xref>). The maze was thoroughly cleaned using 70% ethanol and water after each test session.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-9">
<title>Light-Dark Transitions</title>
<p>The light-dark exploration test was used to evaluate the anxiety levels of the mice according to previously described procedures (Flannery et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2015</xref>). Mice were placed into the “light” side (~400 lx) and allowed to move freely for 10 min. Time spent in the dark side and the total number of transitions were automatically recorded by Noldus Observer software (Ethovision XT 11.5). The illumination of the room was ~400 lux.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-10">
<title>Real-Time PCR</title>
<p>Mice were sacrificed 2 h after the last injection of metformin at P14. The isolated cerebral cortex of the mice were used for the Real-time PCR (each group contains four mice). The total RNA was extracted using a RNeasy kit (CWBIO, Cat.CW05815, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A spectrophotometric instrument (NanoDrop) was used to quantify the RNA concentration. The purified total RNA (approximately 1–2 μg per 20 μl reaction) was followed by a reverse transcription. The SYBR Green qPCR Mix (Takara) was used for Real-time PCR analysis. The specific primer sequences for mTOR, S6K, NF-κB and GAPDH are listed as follows: mouse mTOR: forward: 5′-CAGTTCGCCAGTGGACTGAAG-3′, reverse: 5′-GCTGGTCATAGAAGCGA G TAGAC-3′; mouse S6K, forward: 5′-GGGGCTATGGAAAGGTTTTTCA-3′ reverse: 5′-CGTGTCCTTAGCATTCCTCACT-3′; mouse NF-κB, forward: 5′-ATG GCAGACGATGATCCCTAC-3′ reverse: 5′-CGGAATCGAAATCCCCTCTGTT-3′; mouse GAPDH forward primer: 5-AGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG-3 and reverse primer: 5-TGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCA-3. The relative expression levels were normalized to GAPDH and calculated using the 2<sup>−ΔΔC(t)</sup> method.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-11">
<title>Western Blotting</title>
<p>The entire cortex was harvested and homogenized in an ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) 2 h after the last injection of metformin at P14. The concentration was measured by the Bicinchoninic Acid Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gel (120 min 80 V) and then transferred to a PVDF membrane (90 min at 210 mA). After being blocked with 5% fat-free milk for 3 h at RT, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight (rabbit anti-mTOR, 1:1,000, Cell Signaling; mouse anti-β-actin, 1:1,000, Cell CWBIO, Beijing, China). The bands were incubated with secondary antibodies (mouse IgG, 1:2,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; rabbit IgG, 1:2,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at RT and visualized by the bioimaging system (Quantity One 4.0; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Three mice per group and at least three independent experiments were used for the analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2-12">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>The data were presented as the mean ± SEM. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate results of self-grooming, marble burying, EPM, light-dark transitions and real-time PCR. Open field locomotion and body weights were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA. Two-way ANOVA, repeated measures ANOVA and paired <italic>t</italic>-test were performed in a three-chambered social approach experiment, as previously described (Scattoni et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2008</xref>; Silverman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2015</xref>). Significant effects were evaluated with the least significant difference (LSD) <italic>post hoc</italic> test. For all comparisons, the statistical significance was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s3-1">
<title>Effects of Metformin on Average Body Weight</title>
<p>Body weights were measured from P7 to P14 during the treatment. An apparent effect was detected in both groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(3,36)</sub> = 20.906, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and time factors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(7,36)</sub> = 557.009, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), but the effect of interaction between factors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(21, 36)</sub> = 1.697, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) was not obvious. Consistent with previous research (Scattoni et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2008</xref>), the body weight of BTBR pups, treated with saline, was higher than B6 pups treated with saline from postnatal days 7 to 14 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). However, metformin administration did not affect the body weight in B6 and BTBR mice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3-2">
<title>Deficits in the 3-Chambered Social Approach Task in BTBR Mice Can Be Rescued by Early Metformin Treatment</title>
<p>The three-chambered social test was conducted to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze social approach behaviors in rodent models of disorders, such as autism (Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2011</xref>). During the 10-min habitation session, the B6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, B6 saline: <italic>F</italic><sub>(2,27)</sub> = 1.801, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05; B6 metformin: <italic>F</italic><sub>(2,27)</sub> = 1.810, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) and BTBR mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, BTBR saline: <italic>F</italic><sub>(2,27)</sub> = 2.035, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05; BTBR metformin: <italic>F</italic><sub>(2,27)</sub> = 1.028, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) showed no particular chamber preference in the three-chambered social task with drug treatment across the habituation. In addition, no significant difference was found in the number of total entries in B6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, B6 saline: <italic>t</italic><sub>(9)</sub> = 0.000, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05; B6 metformin: <italic>t</italic><sub>(9)</sub> = 0.300, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) and BTBR mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, BTBR saline: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 9)</sub> = 0.205, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05; BTBR metformin: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 9)</sub> = 0.161, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). This result suggests that early metformin treatment did not directly affect the exploratory activity during the habituation session preceding the social approach test in BTBR and B6 mice.</p>

<p>Sociability is defined as a preference for spending more time with the novel mouse than with the novel object. In the present study, B6 mice spent significantly more time in the chamber containing the novel mouse as compared to the time spent in the chamber with the nonsocial novel object, in both the saline- (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref>, <italic>t</italic><sub>(9)</sub> = −4.869, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and the metformin-treated group (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref>, <italic>t</italic><sub>(9)</sub> = −4.108, <italic>P</italic> = 0.003). Saline treated BTBR mice showed neither preference for the novel mouse chamber nor the novel object chamber (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref>, <italic>t</italic><sub>(9)</sub> = −1.434, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, metformin treatment did rescue the sociability deficit of BTBR mice as conformed by the increased social preference for the novel mouse chamber (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref>, <italic>t</italic><sub>(9)</sub> = −5.157, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001), displaying restoration of the characteristic social behavioral abnormalities.</p>

<p>We also measured the total time spent sniffing the novel caged mouse and the novel object in each group (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,C</xref>). B6 mice treated with saline or metformin during early postnatal life spent significantly more time sniffing the novel mouse than sniffing the novel object (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). BTBR mice treated with saline showed no significant difference in the total time spent sniffing the novel object than the novel mouse (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, <italic>t</italic><sub>(9)</sub> = −1.072, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, BTBR mice treated with metformin did spend significant more time sniffing the novel mouse than time sniffing the novel object (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, <italic>t</italic><sub>(9)</sub> = −5.038, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001), which indicated improved social sniffing and more time engaging with a social stimulus.</p>
<p>To further quantify changes in sociability following metformin treatment during early postnatal life, the social preference index was assessed across the four groups. A two-way ANOVA indicated a main effect of genotype across the social preference index (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 2.456, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), B6 mice displaying a high social preference index compared with BTBR mice regardless of treatment. In addition, there was a significant drug effect in BTBR mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 14.711, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), as well as a drug by genotype interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 16.255, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), with metformin treated BTBR mice displaying a significantly increased social preference index compared to early saline treated BTBR mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). These differences in the social preference index were not detected between treatment groups in B6 mice. Together, these data indicate that metformin administered to BTBR mice during early postnatal life improved social approach behaviors.</p>
<p>In addition, we showed that entries into the side chambers were not affected by metformin administration in B6 or BTBR mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>), indicating that the exploratory locomotion of the mice were not changed during the social approach task.</p>

<title>Early Metformin Treatment Reduced Repetitive Self-Grooming and Marble Burying Behaviors in BTBR Mice</title>
<p>It was established that BTBR mice exhibited multiple patterns of repetitive and stereotypical behaviors. We therefore further investigated the effects of early postnatal metformin treatment on the time of self-grooming and number of marble burying, as measures of stereotypical repetitive behaviors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Saline-treated BTBR mice also exhibited significantly higher self-grooming behavior compared with saline-injected B6 mice.

An early postnatal metformin treatment did not change self-grooming behavior in B6 mice.</p>

<p>Saline-treated B6 mice revealed significantly lower grooming bouts compared with saline-injected BTBT mice. The two-way ANOVA analysis showed no significant effect of genotype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 0.861, <italic>P</italic> = 0.360) or early metformin treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 0.178, <italic>P</italic> = 0.676) on grooming bouts. The grooming bouts were significantly altered by drug × genotype interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 4.447, <italic>P</italic> = 0.042). <italic>Post hoc</italic> analysis revealed that early metformin treatment decreased grooming bouts in BTBR mice compared to saline-treated BTBR mice, and this effect approached statistical significance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.082).</p>
<p>The percentage of sequentially incorrect grooming transitions was significantly altered by the genotype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 7.274, <italic>P</italic> = 0.011), with non-significant results in the drug treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 3.974, <italic>P</italic> = 0.054) and drug × genotype interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 3.199, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). <italic>Post hoc</italic> analysis revealed that saline-treated BTBR mice exhibited a reduced percentage of sequentially incorrect grooming transitions compared to the saline-treated B6 mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Additionally, early metformin treatment sequentially increased the percentage of sequentially incorrect grooming transitions in BTBR mice compared to saline-treated BTBR mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p>The marble burying test was also used as an evaluation of repetitive behavior (Gould et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2011</xref>).

<title>Effects of Early Metformin Treatment on Locomotion and Anxiety in BTBR Mice</title>
<p>Since general locomotor activity and exploratory behavior could confound the results detected in the three chambered social tasks and self-grooming, we conducted an open-field locomotion test in BTBR and B6 mice. During the 30 min testing period, the total distance in the open field decreased significantly across time (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A,B</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(5,36)</sub> = 34.419, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), indicating that mice could habituate to the novel environment normally. There was no significant time in the genotype interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(5,36)</sub> = 0.258, <italic>P</italic> = 0.855). We found a significant main effect of the genotype during 0–5 min (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 12.195, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and 20–25 min (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 13.255, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). This means BTBR groups showed increased locomotor activity during 0–5 min while showing deceased activity during 20–25 min. Higher initial open field activity of the BTBR was also reported in other previous studies (McFarlane et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2008</xref>; Silverman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2010</xref>). The two-way ANOVA analysis showed there was no drug effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 0.258, <italic>P</italic> = 0.614), genotype effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 0.404, <italic>P</italic> = 0.529), and drug × genotype effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 0.100, <italic>P</italic> = 0.754) for the total distance, revealing the absence of any confounding hypo- or hyperactivity effect. Mice with higher levels of anxiety preferred spending time in the non-center regions of an open field as they became habituated to the novel environment. There was no significant change of time in the genotype interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(5,36)</sub> = 0.138, <italic>P</italic> = 0.264), in the center time during the 30 min session. The center time was not altered by the genotype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 0.044, <italic>P</italic> = 0.834) or metformin treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 0.161, <italic>P</italic> = 0.691). Although there were no significant drug × genotype effects for the center time, a trend was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 3.936, <italic>P</italic> = 0.055). This indicated that metformin treatment has no effect on general anxiety in the Open Field Test (OFT).</p>

<p>The anxiety effects of early metformin treatment were assessed using two paradigms: an EPM test and light-dark transitions.

Analysis using a light-dark box further found no significant effects for the genotype, drug and drug × genotype on the cumulative time spent in the dark chamber (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 0.055–0.551, <italic>P</italic> = 0.463–0.815), as well as for the transitions between the light and dark compartments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,36)</sub> = 0.004–2.396, <italic>P</italic> = 0.130–0.953). These data suggest that the level of anxiety in these two paradigms was not altered in these mice.

<title>Effects of Early Metformin Treatment on mTOR, S6K and NF-κB Expressions in the Cerebral Cortex of Mice at P14</title>
<p>We further noticed that the mRNA levels of target rapamycin (mTOR) and the ribosomal protein p70S6 kinase1 (S6K), a downstream target of mTOR in BTBR the cerebral cortex, were higher than in the B6 cerebral cortex. After administration of metformin, relative levels of mTOR mRNA were significantly decreased in BTBR mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, main effect of drug: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,12)</sub> = 0.277, <italic>P</italic> = 0.609; main effect of the genotype: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,12)</sub> = 5.802, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; drug × genotype effect <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,12)</sub> = 5.802, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Although the difference was not significant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.057), a decreasing trend of S6K mRNA levels was observed after metformin treatment in BTBR mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, main effect of drug: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,12)</sub> = 0.629, <italic>P</italic> = 0.443; main effect of genotype: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,12)</sub> = 11.435, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; drug × genotype effect <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,12)</sub> = 4.780, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, metformin did not alter the expression of mTOR and S6K in B6 mice. We also found that there were no significant differences in the expression of NF-κB between B6 and BTBR mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>, effects for genotype, drug and drug × genotype: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,12)</sub> = 0.000–4.267, <italic>P</italic> = 0.061–0.983).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The major results of this study reveal that neonatal metformin treatments, administered from P7 to P14, can improve social interaction and reduce some repetitive behaviors in BTBR mice. Our study suggests that metformin treatment, during neonatal development, might play a role in preventing some of the behavioral abnormalities associated with ASD and that the BTBR mouse model can be a promising model for the preclinical screening of suitable drugs.</p>
<p>The BTBR mice and the control strain B6 mice were used to investigate the efficacy of pharmacological agents on the modification of autism-related phenotypes in the BTBR model, as a potential preclinical translational strategy to screen valuable therapies for ASDs (Kazdoba et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2016</xref>). In the 3-chambered test for social approach, BTBR mice treated with metformin during neonatal development showed a strong preference for the novel mouse compared to the object, revealed by the time spent in the chamber and sniffing. While the exploratory activity and motor abilities of mice could affect their social behaviors, we further evaluated the effects of metformin on exploratory locomotion. The chamber entries made by mice with early metformin treatment were not significantly different than the chamber entries made by mice with early saline treatment, neither during the sociability test period nor during the habituation period that preceded the social approach task, indicating no confounding effects of early metformin treatment on locomotion. We also conducted a standard 30 min OFT to assess the general exploratory locomotion of mice. The total distance traveled by mice receiving early metformin treatment was not significantly different than that of mice with vehicle treatment, neither in B6 nor BTBR mice. This result indicated that the improvement of social impairments by early metformin treatment was typical in BTBR mice.</p>
<p>Self-grooming behavior represents a highly stereotypical pattern of movements which may model obsessive, compulsive-like behaviors when elevated in rodents (Silverman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2015</xref>). The results of self-grooming were similar to previous studies, which demonstrated that BTBR mice spent significantly more time grooming themselves than the control B6 mice. Early metformin treatment could reduce the time spent self-grooming in the BTBR mice, but not in the B6 mice. In this study, we also analyzed the percentage of incorrect grooming transitions, which could evaluate rigidity displayed by the mice (Kalueff et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2007</xref>). The BTBR mice groomed with a lower percentage of sequentially incorrect grooming transitions, suggesting more rigidity than the control C57BL/6J mice. Early metformin treatment decreased rigidity in the BTBR mice, defined as an increased percentage of sequentially correct grooming transitions. The marble burying test was developed as a measure of repetitive behavior (Gould et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2011</xref>). Remarkably, early metformin treatment reduced the number of buried marbles by BTBR mice. Since locomotion activity of either strain during the OFT was unchanged by metformin administration, the data indicated that the treatment of metformin during early development could reduce the presentation of certain repetitive behaviors.</p>
<p>Metformin increases anxiolytic behavior in either a diabetic rat model followed by focal ischemia, or in rats with cerebral ischemic injury (Sarkaki et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2015</xref>). Growing evidence has indicated that BTBR mice showed a large variability in the performance of the EPM, ranging from lack of anxiety-like traits to enhanced behavioral responses to stimulus (Benno et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2009</xref>; Cai et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2017</xref>). In this study, metformin treatment during neonatal development had no anxiolytic effect in BTBR mice in the EPM or the light-dark tests, indicating that early metformin treatment reduces repetitive behaviors without inducing anxiety-like behaviors.</p>
<p>According to reports of the effects of metformin in rodents, the dose for metformin administration selected in our study, was equivalent to the dose (1,200 mg per 75 kg per day) used in humans, within the recommended dose range (&lt;2,550 mg/day; Nair and Jacob, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2016</xref>; Tunc-Ozcan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2018</xref>). We also found that there are no obvious effects on the body weight of the pups during the injection period, which suggests no observable side-effects on the pups. Considering that autism treatment should optimally be provided early in life, metformin administration from P7 to P14, closely approximates the developmental stage from the last trimester of human pregnancy, to the first few postnatal years in humans, which have a significant impact on neuroplasticity in the developing brain. Generally, there are no severe adverse events when metformin is used to treat pediatric populations (Jones et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2002</xref>). However, refinement of the dose and timing of metformin administration to young children, remains a concern.</p>
<p>The underlying mechanisms for ameliorating the behavioral phenotypes of ASD in BTBR mice by metformin administration, during early postnatal period, remains an interesting question. Signaling pathways interrupted by important cellular processes such as synaptic plasticity, neuromodulation and/or receptor trafficking or composition might be involved in the pathogenesis of ASD (Gilbert and Man, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2017</xref>; Oron and Elliott, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2017</xref>; Ohja et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2018</xref>). BTBR mice displayed abnormalities in mTOR signaling and inflammation signaling pathways, which can also be regulated by metformin (Onore et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2013</xref>; Steinmetz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2018</xref>). Growing evidence has suggested that increased mTOR signaling pathways in the brain may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of ASD (Ehninger and Silva, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2011</xref>; Kaeberlein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2013</xref>; Wang and Doering, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2013</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, our results indicated that both mTOR and S6K mRNA levels in the cerebral cortex of BTBR mice were significantly higher than that in B6 mice. Metformin treatment decreased mTOR gene expression in BTBR mice and showed a tendency to decrease in the S6K expression. In addition, metformin could significantly reduce the mTOR protein in a BTBR mouse cortex but not in a B6 mouse cortex. Autistic children showed abnormal immune responses along with the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway (Nadeem et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2017</xref>). However, there was no statistical difference in the expression of NF-κB in the four groups. It is supposed that mTOR signaling might be involved in the behavioral alleviation in autism-like behaviors in BTBR mice mediated by metformin treatment.</p>
<p>In summary, this study discovered that metformin treatment during neonatal development, rescued the social deficits and reduced repetitive behavior in BTBR mice. The data presented in this study suggest that early intervention with metformin may provide a promising strategy to treat core symptoms of ASD. Metformin represents one potential pharmacological intervention.</p>
