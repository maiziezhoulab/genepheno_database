<p>Astrocytes promote synapse formation during development via secreted factors including thrombospondin family proteins, which act through the neuronal calcium channel subunit α2δ-1. Risher et al. demonstrate that this process requires signaling via the Rho GTPase Rac1 to facilitate the maturation of dendritic spine synapses in the cortex.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Astrocytes control excitatory synaptogenesis by secreting thrombospondins (TSPs), which function via their neuronal receptor, the calcium channel subunit α2δ-1. α2δ-1 is a drug target for epilepsy and neuropathic pain; thus the TSP–α2δ-1 interaction is implicated in both synaptic development and disease pathogenesis. However, the mechanism by which this interaction promotes synaptogenesis and the requirement for α2δ-1 for connectivity of the developing mammalian brain are unknown. In this study, we show that global or cell-specific loss of α2δ-1 yields profound deficits in excitatory synapse numbers, ultrastructure, and activity and severely stunts spinogenesis in the mouse cortex. Postsynaptic but not presynaptic α2δ-1 is required and sufficient for TSP-induced synaptogenesis in vitro and spine formation in vivo, but an α2δ-1 mutant linked to autism cannot rescue these synaptogenesis defects. Finally, we reveal that TSP–α2δ-1 interactions control synaptogenesis postsynaptically via Rac1, suggesting potential molecular mechanisms that underlie both synaptic development and pathology.</p>

<body><sec id="s01" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The controlled development of neuronal networks is crucial for proper function of the central nervous system (CNS). Thus, the formation of CNS synapses, the smallest cell biological units of neural circuits, is tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scheiffele, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">West and Greenberg, 2011</xref>), but the manner in which this occurs is poorly understood. Research in the last two decades revealed that astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell in the brain, promote the establishment of synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clarke and Barres, 2013</xref>). Astrocyte-secreted factors strongly enhance excitatory synapse formation in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldwin and Eroglu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bosworth and Allen, 2017</xref>). The thrombospondin (TSP) family of extracellular matrix proteins were the first astrocyte-secreted synaptogenic factors to be identified via purified retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neuron cultures. Transgenic mice lacking two of the TSP isoforms (TSP1 and TSP2), which are expressed by astrocytes during early postnatal development, show decreased excitatory synaptic density in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christopherson et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>TSPs exert their synaptogenic effects via binding to their neuronal receptor, the calcium channel subunit α2δ-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eroglu et al., 2009</xref>), also known as the gabapentin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gee et al., 1996</xref>). α2δ-1 (<italic>Cacna2d1</italic>) is highly expressed by neurons throughout the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cole et al., 2005</xref>), with enrichment in cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. It is predicted to be a type I membrane protein consisting of an entirely extracellular α2 portion and a δ part that spans extracellular (ECD), transmembrane (TM), and cytosolic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davies et al., 2007</xref>). Both α2 and δ are translated from the same transcript but are proteolytically cleaved into two mature polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Jongh et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jay et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Douglas et al., 2006</xref>). α2δ-1, via its Von Willebrand factor A (VWF-A) protein–protein interaction domain, interacts with the synaptogenic fragment of TSP2 containing epidermal growth factor–like repeats to promote synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eroglu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>α2δ proteins are involved in the trafficking and function of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs; particularly the high voltage L-type channels) and influence presynaptic release probability and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Geisler et al., 2015</xref>). However, despite the importance of VGCCs to synaptic transmission and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catterall and Few, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2016</xref>), manipulation of channel expression or function does not affect TSP-induced synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eroglu et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, α2δ proteins were shown to have functions independent of their roles in regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kurshan et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we previously proposed that α2δ-1 acts as a surface receptor for TSP and, after TSP binding to the VWF-A domain of α2δ-1, triggers a downstream synaptogenic signaling cascade that promotes the formation of excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Risher and Eroglu, 2012</xref>). α2δ-1 is also the receptor for the drug gabapentin, which is used for the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gee et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Field et al., 2006</xref>). Gabapentin interferes with the binding of TSP to α2δ-1 and thereby inhibits synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eroglu et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that impairments in astrocyte signaling may underlie aberrant connectivity that drives neurological disease.</p><p>In this study, we have determined that dendritic α2δ-1 is crucial for the establishment of proper cortical synapse connectivity. In the absence of α2δ-1, intracortical excitatory synaptogenesis, synaptic function, and spinogenesis are greatly diminished. Furthermore, we found the small Rho GTPase, Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), to be a key component of the synaptogenic signaling cascade downstream of TSP–α2δ-1.</p></sec><sec id="s02" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>TSP receptor α2δ-1 is critical for cortical synaptic development</title><p>We observed via Western blot from mouse cortical and hippocampal lysates that α2δ-1 expression increases rapidly between postnatal days 5 (P5) and P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), corresponding with a period in which excitatory synapse formation is initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Semple et al., 2013</xref>). To determine whether α2δ-1 is required for proper synaptic connectivity in the cortex, we used a mouse line lacking α2δ-1 (i.e., α2δ-1 knockout [KO]; Fig. S1, A and B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Park et al., 2016</xref>). No α2δ-1 protein is detected in synaptosome lysates isolated from the α2δ-1 KO mice (Fig. S1 C). We focused our analysis on the Layer I (L1) synaptic zone (S/Z) of primary visual cortex (V1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), which receives dendritic projections from excitatory pyramidal neurons in cortical layers II and III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), and which has the highest α2δ-1 expression in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cole et al., 2005</xref>). We immunostained brain sections with pre- and postsynaptic marker pairs that label the two main classes of excitatory synapses in the cortex: (1) intracortical connections positive for presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) and (2) sensory pathway VGluT2<sup>+</sup> inputs from thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Colocalization of VGluT1 with postsynaptic PSD95 is severely decreased (−58.1%) in α2δ-1 KO mice compared with littermate WT mice at P21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>), indicating that loss of α2δ-1 disrupts intracortical synaptic connectivity. By contrast, thalamocortical synapses, quantified as the colocalization of VGluT2/PSD95, do not differ between WT and α2δ-1 KO at P21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). The colocalization of VGluT1/PSD95 puncta is not merely by chance, since randomization of puncta by rotating the channels out of alignment by 90° nearly abolished occurrence of colocalized puncta in both the WT and KO (Fig. S1, D and E). These results suggest that α2δ-1 is specifically required for the formation of intracortical synapses in V1.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Impaired synaptic connectivity in α2δ-1–deficient cortex.

The deficit in intracortical synapses becomes apparent between postnatal weeks 2 and 3, coinciding with peak α2δ-1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>): we found no significant differences between genotypes at P14 V1, but the synaptic growth that typically takes place between P14 and P21 failed to occur in the α2δ-1 KO mice (Fig. S1 H). We also observed a significant deficit in intracortical synapses in the KO at P40, indicating that the synaptic phenotype observed in α2δ-1 KOs is not merely a developmental delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p><p>The striking decrease in the number of intracortical synapses was not caused by a decrease in neurons (determined by NeuN<sup>+</sup> cell density and cortical thickness of V1 at P21; Fig. S1, I–K). However, overall neuronal complexity was significantly decreased in the KOs as quantified by Sholl analysis of Golgi-Cox–stained LII/III pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, G and H</xref>). There was also a trend toward a decrease in total dendrite length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>). Taken together, these results show that α2δ-1 is also required for dendritic elaboration, which is tightly linked with excitatory synaptogenesis during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cline and Haas, 2008</xref>).</p><p>We next tested whether the impaired synaptic connectivity in the α2δ-1 KO resulted in disrupted synaptic function. We performed electrophysiological recordings of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs; mEPSCs) from LII/III pyramidal neurons in P21 V1 of littermate α2δ-1 WT and KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In accordance with our histological findings, mEPSCs from α2δ-1 KO cortices showed a strong reduction in frequency and a small but significant decrease in amplitude, reflecting highly decreased synaptic density and mildly decreased synaptic strength, respectively (frequency: WT, 2.534 ± 0.3843 Hz; KO, 1.046 ± 0.1668 Hz [−58.72%]; amplitude: WT, 16.02 ± 0.8360 pA; KO, 14.63 ± 0.5270 pA [−8.68%]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B–D</xref>). On the contrary, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) showed no differences between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E–G</xref>). We next recorded evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs) to determine whether loss of α2δ-1 affected the glutamate receptor subtype composition of postsynapses. We found a significant decrease in the <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)/α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, H and I</xref>) in line with significantly decreased rise and decay times observed in the mEPSCs (Fig. S2, A and B) as NMDA receptors contribute to the slow component of synaptic waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lester et al., 1990</xref>). Paired-pulse ratio (PPR) recordings showed no difference between the WT and α2δ-1 KO, indicating that α2δ-1 is not required for the control of presynaptic release properties in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, J and K</xref>). Taken together, these results show that α2δ-1 is required for proper excitatory synapse function but dispensable for the function of inhibitory synapses in the developing cortex.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Lack of α2δ-1 results in decreased excitatory synaptic function.

The first mutant contains a point mutation in the VWF-A domain of the <italic>CACNA2D1</italic> gene of a human patient with autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Iossifov et al., 2014</xref>), changing a highly-conserved arginine 351 residue to threonine (R351T; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). We verified by heterologous expression in HEK293 cells that α2δ-1 R351T mutant protein expresses efficiently and migrates in SDS-PAGE at the same size as native α2δ-1 (Fig. S5, A and B). However, surface staining in HEK293 cells transfected with α2δ-1 R351T revealed that this mutant cannot reach the plasma membrane surface and/or cannot be stabilized there but is rather localized to a membranous organelle just beneath the outer plasma membrane (Fig. S5 C). Thus, this mutation precludes the ability of α2δ-1 to interact with extracellular ligands such as astrocyte-secreted TSPs or other secreted or cell surface molecules. In the second α2δ-1 mutant, we replaced the TM portion of α2δ-1 with a glycosylphosphotidylinositol (GPI) anchor to generate a protein (α2δ-1 ΔTM), which is effectively produced and transported to the cell surface yet incapable of interacting through its TM and cytoplasmic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figs. 8 B</xref> and S5, A–C). When expressed in cortical neurons, the ΔTM mutant localized primarily to dendritic spines, whereas the full-length α2δ-1 was found both on spines and dendritic shafts; α2δ-1 R351T showed little dendritic expression (Fig. S5 D). Neither α2δ-1 mutant was capable of rescuing spinogenesis or synaptogenesis phenotypes observed in organotypic slices from the α2δ-1 KOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, C and D</xref>).

We used a fast-cycling Rac1 mutant (FC Rac1) that allows Rac1 to quickly cycle between its active and inactive states without the need of upstream activation via GEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lin et al., 1999</xref>). Biolistic transfection of FC Rac1 rescued the spinogenesis phenotype in α2δ-1 KO cortical slices, but these spines did not fully recover excitatory contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, E and F</xref>). We speculated that the inability of Rac1 activation to rescue excitatory synapses was caused by the lack of critical interactions that α2δ-1 establishes through its extracellular regions. To test this, we coexpressed the α2δ-1 ΔTM mutant with FC Rac1 and fully restored both spine and synapse numbers in α2δ-1 KO dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, E and F</xref>), indicating that extracellular interactions established by α2δ-1 coupled with Rac1 activation are necessary and sufficient for excitatory synapse formation. Collectively, these results show that the binding of astrocytic TSP to neuronal α2δ-1 triggers the activation of Rac1, promoting synapse formation and maturation in the developing cortex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s08" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Most excitatory synapses in the cortex are made onto dendritic spines, which undergo a complex morphological transformation that occurs in parallel with synaptic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Harris and Kater, 1994</xref>). During this transition, immature dendritic filopodia, which are proposed to seek out appropriate axonal partners, give way to dendritic spines. Dendritic spines are more stable protrusions, containing an abundance of synaptic scaffolding proteins, neurotransmitter receptors, and an elaborate actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grutzendler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Korobova and Svitkina, 2010</xref>). In this study, we show that α2δ-1, the neuronal receptor for astrocyte-secreted TSPs, is critical for the formation and maturation of cortical spine synapses. We found that these functions of α2δ-1 are cell autonomous to neurons, requiring the postsynaptic expression of α2δ-1.</p><sec id="s09"><title>Establishment of cortical connectivity by α2δ-1</title><p>In the cortical S/Z, glutamatergic excitatory synapses fall under two main categories, intracortical and thalamocortical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>). Previously we found that astrocyte-secreted hevin controls the formation and maturation of thalamocortical synapses by bridging presynaptic neurexin-1α and postsynaptic neuroligin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Risher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we show that α2δ-1, the receptor for astrocyte-secreted synaptogenic TSPs, plays a predominant role in the formation of intracortical synapses and their localization onto dendritic spines. In agreement with our findings, TSP1/2 double null mice were shown to have a ∼30% reduction in their excitatory cortical synapses, determined by the colocalization of presynaptic protein bassoon and postsynaptic SAP102 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christopherson et al., 2005</xref>). In the same study, the numbers of SV2<sup>+</sup> axonal terminals were found to be significantly reduced in TSP1/2 KO mice as early as P8, whereas we found no significant changes in the numbers of excitatory synapses at ages earlier than P21. These results may indicate distinct roles of TSPs in axonal branching and elaboration versus their roles in synaptogenesis through signaling via postsynaptic α2δ-1.</p><p>Although α2δ-1 is not required for thalamocortical synaptogenesis, we previously found that overexpression of α2δ-1 under the Thy1 promoter in transgenic mice in a subset of cortical neurons dramatically increases VGluT2<sup>+</sup> thalamocortical synapses at P21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eroglu et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, in RGC cultures, TSPs induce the formation of excitatory synapses between these neurons, which exclusively express VGluT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fujiyama et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christopherson et al., 2005</xref>). Taken together with our results, these findings indicate that an increase in α2δ-1 abundance and its subsequent activation by TSPs is sufficient to increase the overall excitatory synapse numbers regardless of the presynaptic axonal partner identity.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Mechanisms of TSP–α2δ-1–induced synapse and spine growth</title><p>Based on our findings, we propose in this study a two-step model for the synaptogenic capabilities of α2δ-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>): (1) TSP binding to the extracellular domain of postsynaptic α2δ-1 on probing filopodia facilitates clustering of pre- and postsynaptic proteins to nascent synaptic sites, bringing these compartments in close apposition; and (2) the TM region and the C-terminal tail of α2δ-1 trigger intracellular signaling events such as the recruitment of GEFs Kalirin-7 and β-Pix to nascent synaptic sites within filopodia, inducing activation of Rac1 and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton to promote spine stabilization and growth.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig9" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for α2δ-1’s dual role in promoting synapse and spine development.</bold> Early on, α2δ-1 is present on filopodia seeking contact with axonal partners. Rac1 is predominantly bound to GDP, rendering it inactive. After TSP binding, (1) α2δ-1 at the postsynaptic surface brings together pre- and postsynaptic components to form synapses; and (2) the C terminus of α2δ-1 triggers intracellular signaling via GEFs to stimulate GTP binding to Rac1, promoting actin reorganization to facilitate spine maturation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_201802057_Fig9"></graphic></fig><p>In this study, we showed that overexpression of α2δ-1 fails to increase spine or synapse density when Rac1 function is abolished. Intriguingly, we were able to bypass the need for α2δ-1 in spinogenesis by directly stimulating Rac1, but Rac1 activation alone was unable to cluster pre- and postsynaptic machinery in the absence of the α2δ-1 ECD. Similarly, α2δ-1 ECD by itself could not induce synapse formation even though it was capable of localizing to dendritic spines. These results show that for synapse-containing spines to emerge, Rac1 activation should coincide with axon–dendrite matching and adhesion events. By virtue of its extracellular TSP-binding domain, its position within the plasma membrane, and its short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, α2δ-1 is ideally situated to coordinate the occurrence of synaptogenesis and spinogenesis by recruiting important components of the synaptogenic signaling complex.</p><p>What comprises this synaptogenic signaling complex? We previously found that blocking or overexpressing the α1-subunits of the postsynaptic L-type calcium channels Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3, the canonical interaction partners for α2δ-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cantí et al., 2005</xref>), did not affect TSP-induced synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eroglu et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we instead show that disruption of the obligatory NMDA receptor subunit, NR1, abolishes the synaptogenic ability of TSP. We also observed cell autonomous loss of synaptic NR1 in the α2δ-1 cKO dendrites as well as a decreased NMDA/AMPA ratio in the α2δ-1 global KOs. These results are in line with previous findings that TSP induces the formation of silent synapses containing NMDA but not AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christopherson et al., 2005</xref>). The binding of TSP to α2δ-1 may serve as an initiating event to recruit and stabilize NMDA receptors on the postsynaptic surface, which then coordinates the downstream signaling events that lead to spinogenesis. α2δ-1 may recruit NMDA receptors (NMDARs) to the synapses by a direct interaction through its C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), which we found to be required for the synaptogenic activity of α2δ-1. Alternatively, TSP–α2δ-1 interaction could recruit NMDARs through an intermediary such as the neuroligin class of cell adhesion molecules, known interactors of NR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Budreck et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, TSPs have previously also been shown to interact with neuroligin family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, α2δ family members have recently been found to bind directly to neurexins, the primary presynaptic interaction partners of neuroligins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsetsenis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tong et al., 2017</xref>). Possible cis-interactions between presynaptic α2δ-1 and neurexins would also provide an explanation for the enhanced TSP-induced synaptogenesis we observed when α2δ-1 was absent presynaptically. Presynaptic α2δ-1 may bind neurexins and prevent them from coupling transynaptically with neuroligins, which is important to stabilize newly formed synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Graf et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Although it is well established that dendritic protrusions undergo a maturational shift from highly motile filopodia to more stable spines, many of the molecular players underlying this transition have yet to be elucidated. The fact that both filopodia and spines are actin-rich structures means that cytoskeletal regulation is a critical mechanism underlying this morphological shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bilousova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Johnson and Ouimet, 2006</xref>). Small Rho GTPase proteins such as Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 differentially promote or inhibit cytoskeletal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hall, 1998</xref>). Interestingly, TSP1 was previously shown to induce cytoskeletal reorganization in nonneuronal cells in a Rac1/Cdc42-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Schwartz, 2000</xref>). One study showed that WT neurons cultured with TSP1-null astrocytes fail to develop mature spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garcia et al., 2010</xref>), indicative of problems with actin regulation. GEFs interact with NMDARs and other signaling molecules triggered by synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Xie et al., 2007</xref>); in particular, Kalirin-7 interacts with NR1 at excitatory synapses and promotes spine enlargement via Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Xie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ma et al., 2008</xref>), providing a potential link between α2δ-1 and Rac1 activation. Another GEF located in spines is β-Pix (Cool-1), which acts downstream of NMDAR to promote Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saneyoshi et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, shRNA-facilitated knockdown of either Kalirin-7 or β-Pix was sufficient to abolish TSP-induced synaptogenesis in a similar manner to knocking down Rac1 function directly.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Contributions of α2δ-1 dysfunction to disease</title><p>α2δ-1 is linked to neurological disorders including epilepsy, neuropathic pain, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Newton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Iossifov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vergult et al., 2015</xref>). The antiepilepsy, antineuropathic pain drug gabapentin (Neurontin) binds to α2δ-1, and by doing so, it prevents TSP-induced synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gee et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Field et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eroglu et al., 2009</xref>).

As we show in this study, the opposite situation is problematic as well, with too few synapses being formed and/or maintained as lack of α2δ-1 leads to a severe decrease in intracortical synapses. Reduced intracortical connectivity has been found in some patients with autism and was proposed to underlie the cognitive challenges faced by those individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Just et al., 2007</xref>). Although the mechanism of cortical synaptic impairment in those specific patients is unclear, we found that a previously identified autism-linked point mutation in α2δ-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Iossifov et al., 2014</xref>) diminished the effects of α2δ-1 on synaptic development and spine maturation. Our findings indicate that this single amino acid change in the extracellular VWF-A domain of α2δ-1 is sufficient to disrupt the localization of α2δ-1 to the cell surface, rendering it unavailable for binding TSP. Taken together, these findings underscore the importance of α2δ-1 for proper cortical development.</p><p>Our finding that Rac1 is downstream of TSP–α2δ-1 in mediating synapse and spine growth also provides a novel potential mechanistic insight into psychiatric illness and intellectual disability, where aberrant Rac1 signaling have been strongly implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Golden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zeidán-Chuliá et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tejada-Simon, 2015</xref>).

After two changes of straight Epon 3× 3 min in the microwave, slices were left to stand for 30 min and then embedded in 100% Epon resin at 60°C for 48 h. Ultrathin serial sections (45–50 nm) were cut from a small trapezoid positioned 50–100 µm below the pial surface, corresponding with the S/Z (a.k.a. layer I), which contains the dendrites of layer II/III neurons. Serial sectioning, processing, and photography were performed by the Electron Microscopy Core at Augusta University following a protocol adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harris et al.

Grids were stained with a series of solutions including filtered uranyl acetate and Reynold’s lead citrate, washed, and allowed to dry overnight. Stained grids were then loaded into a gimbal that was inserted into the rotational holder of a JEOL 1200 EX electron microscope. Using a cross sectioned dendrite of ∼1-µm diameter, a series of photographs was taken at 10,000× magnification of consecutive sections on the ribbons, taking care to maintain the same field of view/orientation from section to section. The images were then imported into Reconstruct software for alignment, tracing, and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fiala, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s21"><title>IUE and 3D analysis of confocally imaged synaptic structures</title><p>α2δ-1<italic><sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice were crossed with the B6.Cg-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</sup></italic>/J strain (Jackson Laboratory) to generate the α2δ-1<italic><sup>f/f</sup></italic>/RTm<italic><sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice that were used for IUE.

All analyses were done with NeuroExplorer (MBF Bioscience) software with analyst blinded as to genotype. Statistical ANCOVA took into account a categorical independent variable (i.e., genotype) and a continuous independent variable (i.e., radius of concentric circle generated for Sholl analysis).</p></sec><sec id="s34"><title>Whole-cell electrophysiology</title><p>Recordings were performed blinded as to genotype. The amplitudes of mEPSCs over 10 pA by peak detection software in pCLAMP10 (Molecular Devices) were included for this study. The amplitudes of mIPSCs over 20 pA were included. For EPSC experiments, NMDA and AMPA currents measured in these types of analyses are highly variable from cell to cell. Therefore, the ratio between the NMDA and AMPA currents are reported rather than the values for each. PPR was determined by calculating the ratio of the peak amplitude of the second EPSC to that of the first EPSC (at 50-, 100-, and 150-ms interstimulus intervals). Analysis was performed with a custom-written plugin for MatLab (MathWorks).</p></sec><sec id="s35"><title>ssEM</title><p>Series consisting of 100–150 consecutive micrographs each were blinded as to condition before analysis. Serial sections were aligned and synaptic structures were traced using Reconstruct software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fiala, 2005</xref>). Section thickness was calculated with the cylindrical method using the diameter of longitudinally sectioned mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fiala and Harris, 2001</xref>). Dendrites were chosen for analysis on the basis of (a) spanning at least 75 consecutive serial sections, (b) measuring between 0.4–0.8 µm in diameter in cross section (to exclude large, apical dendrites and only include secondary and tertiary dendrites), and (c) having at least one spine (to exclude aspinous dendrites from interneurons; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourne and Harris, 2011</xref>). PSD area was calculated by multiplying the 2D length on each section by average section thickness and the total number of sections on which the PSD appears. For classifying spines, spines with width (W) measurements ≥0.6 µm were considered mushroom spines; measurements of W &lt;0.6 µm, length (L) &lt;2.0 µm, and L:W ratio &gt;1 were considered thin spines. To measure dendritic shaft areas, the cross-sectional dendritic area was taken from 10 evenly distributed points along each dendrite.</p></sec><sec id="s36"><title>Confocal 3D dendrite reconstructions</title><p>Deconvolved confocal z stacks were imported into Imaris software. Dendrites were reconstructed in 3D using the FilamentTracer tool with the analyst blinded as to the condition. Briefly, the widest point in the dendritic shaft was used to generate the origin of the filament, with the minimum shaft diameter used to determine the entire dendritic outline. Erroneous connections were manually removed. Spines were automatically detected along the length of the rendered dendrite based on a minimum head width of 0.2 µm and maximum protrusion length of 4 µm. Spines were then categorized on the basis of their neck length, head width, and length:width ratio, with mature spines having either a head width &gt;0.45 µm or a head width &gt; spine length. Discrete pre-, post-, and colocalized synaptic puncta were resolved with the Spots tool after manual thresholding to detect discrete puncta without introducing noise. Puncta within 0.2 µm of dendrites were then isolated using the Find Spots Close to Filaments MatLab algorithm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s37"><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows design and further verification of the α2δ-1–null mouse.
