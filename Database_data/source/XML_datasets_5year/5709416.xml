In these genome-edited hESCs, an effect was seen on expression of <italic>TUNA</italic>, although not on neural differentiation potential.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of developing pre-implantation mouse or human blastocysts and are characterized by their ability for self-renewal and pluripotency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Since it’s shown that mouse pluripotent stem cells can also be derived from the mouse post-implantation blastocyst (epiblast stem cells, EpiSCs), two states of pluripotency are defined in mouse ESCs (mESCs) depicted as naïve and primed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Naïve mESCs represent a more ground state of pluripotency in embryonic development and resemble cells of the pre-implantation epiblast <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, EpiSCs resemble cells of the post-implantation epiblast, which is a later and already more advanced developmental stage, referred to as the primed state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Naïve and primed mESCs show differences in several aspects such as colony morphology and active signalling-dependent pathways to maintain the pluripotent state, reflected in different transcriptomic and epigenetic characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In addition, naïve mESCs are able to survive single cell passaging, show a higher proliferation rate and have a higher clonogenic ability, compared to primed mESCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">Although human ESCs (hESCs) are also derived from the pre-implantation blastocyst, they differ from naïve mESCs in morphology, culture requirements, molecular profile, differentiation behaviour and clonogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Instead, these cells show more similarities to the post-implantation EpiSCs and thus conventional derived hESCs are considered as primed pluripotent stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In mouse, primed EpiSCs can be converted to the naïve state either by overexpression of pluripotency associated transcription factors or by applying naïve culture conditions. Hanna <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> were the first to convert primed hESCs into mESC-like hESCs by ectopic induction of key pluripotency factors. Later, other groups defined different naïve media conditions to induce naïve pluripotency in conventional hESCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">The ability of human ESCs to differentiate into cells of the three germ layers makes them an attractive model system to study human development and disease <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. To study gene function and the underlying regulatory pathways, genome editing has been shown to be of great avail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The CRISPR/Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR associated proteins) Type II system is originally a prokaryotic RNA-mediated adaptive immune system used as a defense against invading foreign genomes and adapted for easy and efficient genome-editing in virtually every desired genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Almost any DNA sequence of interest can be targeted with the help of a customizable single guide RNA (sgRNA) containing 20 base pairs complementary to the target site. This target site needs an adjacent protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) for recognition by the sgRNA. The Cas9 endonuclease is guided by the sgRNA to the target locus and will induce a double-stranded break 3 base pairs (bp) upstream of the PAM sequence. Either these breaks will be repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) often leading to the formation of insertions/deletions (indels) near the breakpoints as this process is error-prone, or an exogenous DNA sequence can be inserted during homology-directed repair (HDR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. To avoid undesired off-target effects, caused by sequence homology between the sgRNA and off-target sites, a D10A Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs can be used to enhance specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">Compared to mESCs, conventional primed hESCs are more difficult to genetically manipulate and render some practical obstacles for efficient genome-editing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. A bottleneck with the culture of conventional hESCs is their low proliferation rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, their inability for single-cell passaging by trypsin digest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and the low single-cell cloning efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. These characteristics complicate fast expansion of the culture and clonal isolation and selection after transfection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. This low single-cell cloning efficiency will also have an influence on the targeting efficiencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Another disadvantage of primed hESCs is the heterogeneity in differentiation potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">On the contrary, the naïve state enables fast proliferation and single-cell passaging. These are favourable characteristics to increase target efficiency, indicating this state is preferable for efficient genome-editing. It has indeed been reported that the naïve state is more amendable to genome-editing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The study from Gafni <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> also suggests that HDR will be more efficient in naïve ESCs due to their more open chromatin state.</p>
<p id="Par7">In the present study, we show an optimized workflow for genome-editing of naïve hESC using the CRISPR/Cas9 system followed by neural differentiation. As a proof-of-principle we generated a knockdown with CRISPR/Cas9 of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) <italic>TUNA</italic> that has already been described to be involved in neural differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Since induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of patients with a (chromosomal) rearrangement involving a particular gene, are not always available or cannot be generated, this workflow can be used to study candidate genes involved in neural differentiation and/or functioning.</p>

<title>Efficient genome-editing in naïve hESCs with CRISPR/Cas9 system</title>
<p id="Par8">To investigate the editing efficiency and characteristics of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in naïve hESCs, we nucleofected Cas9 nuclease as well as Cas9 nickase expressing plasmids targeting the coding gene <italic>EMX1</italic> and non-coding genes <italic>TUNA</italic> and <italic>MEG3</italic> in hESCs. The workflow is presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>. Each target site was successfully edited by both Cas9 proteins, however, we see big differences in editing efficiency, ranging from 1 to 19%.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Optimized workflow for efficient genome-editing of naïve human embryonic stem cells. (<bold>a</bold>) Two sgRNAs were designed for each gene to allow double nicking and cloned in the pX335 plasmid. Both sgRNAs were also individually paired with the Cas9 nuclease (pX330 plasmid). The CRISPR plasmids were transfected in the naïve hESCs using nucleofection at day two after splitting. (<bold>b</bold>) To determine the overall editing efficiency of the CRISPR, DNA was extracted from the pool of transfected cells two days after nucleofection. After subsequent PCR and massive parallel sequencing (Illumina MiSeq), the overall editing efficiency and the detected indel variants were quantified with BATCH-GE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. (<bold>c</bold>) To obtain monoclonal genome-edited colonies, clonal isolation was performed two days after nucleofection, using limiting dilution (0.5 cells/100 µl). After 6–8 days, surviving clones were observed and DNA was extracted. After amplification and massive parallel sequencing of the target region, the sequencing reads were visualized in the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV, Broad Institute) to identify the genome-edited colonies.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e466" xlink:href="41598_2017_16932_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig>
</p>
<p id="Par9">For <italic>TUNA</italic>, the highest editing efficiency (19%) was accomplished with the Cas9 nickase, however, for <italic>EMX1</italic> and <italic>MEG3</italic> the highest editing efficiencies, respectively 8.4% and 7.8%, were generated using the nuclease combined with one sgRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). Based on these three loci and taken into account that there is a certain variation in sgRNA activity, both the wildtype Cas9 nuclease and mutant Cas9 nickase can edit the on-target site efficiently at similar editing rates.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>CRISPR/Cas9 works efficiently in naïve human embryonic stem cells.

<p id="Par10">Mali <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> described in HEK-293T cells that most indels resulting from NHEJ after Cas9 nuclease activity are present near the 3′ end of the target site, particularly ∼3–4 bp upstream of the PAM, consistent with the theoretical cleavage site of Cas9. Also in the naïve hESCs we see that most indels are located around this position after editing with Cas9 nuclease. For <italic>TUNA</italic>, <italic>EMX1</italic> and <italic>MEG3</italic> predominant indels of 1–6 bp are present 3–5 bp upstream of the PAM sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). Remarkably, the same predominant indels are also present in HEK-293T cells with similar editing efficiencies as in the naïve hESCs (Supplemental Figs <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Cas9 nuclease generates predominant indels near the cleavage site.

Length of indels are represented by the different colors. Predominant indels are indicated with an arrow. Only 1 replicate is shown.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e543" xlink:href="41598_2017_16932_Fig3_HTML"></graphic></fig>
</p>
<p id="Par11">For <italic>MEG3-</italic>sgRNA1 however, only a few variants are located near this expected cleavage site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>), suggestive of a none to very low active sgRNA in the naïve hESCs. Nonetheless in HEK-293T cells, the same sgRNA also shows low editing efficiency (2.2%), but a predominant indel is present at 3 bp upstream of the PAM sequence (Supplemental Figs <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par12">After editing with the Cas9 nickase, no predominant indels are seen. Here, approximately 60% of the indels for <italic>TUNA</italic>, <italic>EMX1</italic> and <italic>MEG3</italic> are present completely between or spanning both the cleavage sites and 70–90% of indels span at least one of the two sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>). This is also the case in HEK-293T cells (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). These data demonstrate that our CRISPRs, both the Cas9 nuclease as nickase, cut at the target site.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Majority of indels is present between both cleavage sites after editing with Cas9 nickase. Distance of the start position of each insertion or deletion to the theoretical cleavage site (=3 bp upstream of the PAM sequence) is presented on the x-axis, while the relative frequency of the indel is presented on the y-axis after editing with the Cas9 nickase. Length of indels are represented by the different colors. Only 1 replicate is shown. The majority of indels is present between the two theoretical cleavage sites (indicated by the black lines at position 0 (sgRNA1) and at positions 44 bp (<italic>TUNA</italic>), 25 bp (<italic>EMX1</italic>) and 38 bp (<italic>MEG3</italic>). Percentages of indels 1) within or spanning both the two cleavage sites and 2) indels spanning at least one of the two sites are shown below the graph. Replicate 2 of <italic>EMX1</italic> has an editing efficiency of 2.7% (compared to 5% for replicate 1), which can explain the lower percentage of indels located between the two cleavage sites.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e597" xlink:href="41598_2017_16932_Fig4_HTML"></graphic></fig>
</p>
<p id="Par13">After screening the top 4 highest ranked off-target sites for each sgRNA, no off-targets were detected for both sgRNAs for <italic>TUNA</italic> and <italic>MEG3</italic>. However, indels were present in one off-target region of <italic>EMX1</italic>-sgRNA2 in the cells cleaved with the Cas9 nuclease (12% editing efficiency), but not with the double nicking system (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Since these undesired indels are completely intronic (first intron of <italic>EXOC6)</italic>, this off-target is unlikely to have a functional effect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec4">
<title>Cas9 nickase generates larger indels compared to wildtype Cas9 nuclease</title>
<p id="Par14">Based on median deletion and insertion sizes, indels generated with the Cas9 nickase are larger compared to the wildtype Cas9 nuclease (Supplemental Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). This is due to the creation of two nicks in each other’s neighbourhood compared to only one break point with the Cas9 nuclease. Since both sgRNAs for <italic>EMX1</italic> overlap six base pairs, making the two cleavage sites closer to each other compared to <italic>TUNA</italic> and <italic>MEG3</italic>, there is a smaller difference in deletion size between the Cas9 nuclease and nickase for this gene. For the nickase, a median size of 3 and 7 bp (rep 1 and 2) is seen and for both sgRNAs combined with Cas9 nuclease a median size of 6–8 and 3 bp (rep 1 and 2). The largest deletions were generated for <italic>TUNA</italic> (median size nickase 17 and 21 bp (rep 1 and rep2)) and the largest insertions for <italic>MEG3</italic> (median size nickase 5 and 25 bp (rep 1 and rep2)). Interestingly, NHEJ generates more deletions than insertions both after editing with the Cas9 nuclease as well as the nickase (Supplemental Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Only for the Cas9 nuclease plasmids for <italic>TUNA</italic>, more insertions occur due to the predominant one base pair insertion at the cleavage site. The same indel characteristics are seen in HEK-293T cells (Supplemental Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).</p>

<sec id="Sec5">
<title>Successful generation of monoclonal genome edited naïve hESCs</title>
<p id="Par15">Lin <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> reported <italic>Tuna</italic>, a lncRNA, to play an important role in pluripotency and neural differentiation of mESCs. As a proof-of-principle for our workflow, consisting of genome-editing in naïve hESCs followed by neural differentiation, we generated genome-edited hESC lines for <italic>TUNA</italic> using the double nicking system, as this system generated the highest editing efficiency combined with larger indels. The latter can be important as in contrast to coding genes, the functional effect of a certain indel is unpredictable for non-coding genes.</p>
<p id="Par16">After transfection, the naïve hESCs were monoclonal isolated through limiting dilution in 96-well plates and a survival rate of 7% (7 out of 102 clones) was observed. The surviving clones were expanded and in the end, we obtained two monoclonal genome-edited <italic>TUNA</italic> colonies, one with a homozygous deletion and one with compound heterozygous deletions (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). To exclude that the latter is the result of a polyclonal colony, the clonal isolation was repeated and all resulting monoclonal colonies carry the same compound heterozygous deletions.</p>
<p id="Par17">To confirm the naïve state of pluripotency after genome-editing, expression of transcription factors associated with either naïve or primed pluripotency was examined through qPCR in both genome-edited hESCs and compared to the wildtype naïve and primed hESCs (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6a</xref>). We analyzed the expression of the naïve-specific pluripotency genes <italic>KLF2</italic> and <italic>TCL1B</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> in our primed and naïve stem cell lines and noticed a similar expression of both genes in the wildtype and genome-edited naïve hESCs and a trend of increased expression compared to primed hESCs. As expression analysis was performed on bulk cells, it is possible that certain naïve cells were already in a more differentiated state than others. This could explain the lower expression of <italic>KLF2</italic> and <italic>TCL1B</italic> in some biological replicates. No differences in expression of <italic>NANOG</italic> was seen between wildtype and genome-edited naïve hESCs, as well as between these naïve hESCs and their primed counterparts. This was however to be expected, as <italic>NANOG</italic> is a core-pluripotency factor with an important role in both the naïve and the primed state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Next to this, in mESCs a variable expression of <italic>Nanog</italic> can be seen due to some heterogeneity in the mESC population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. This supports the assumption that at the time of RNA collection, a subpopulation of already differentiated cells was present in the naïve hESCs. De novo methyltransferase <italic>DNMT3B</italic>, a marker for the primed state, was clearly higher expressed in primed cells compared to all naïve cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, we can conclude that no differences in expression of naïve markers between the wildtype and genome-edited naïve hESCs were observed in our culture conditions. Moreover, there was no difference in morphology observed between the wildtype and genome-edited naïve hESC colonies (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6b</xref>). These results indicate that the hESCs were still naïve after genome-editing.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par22">The naïve state of hESCs can offer a better alternative for efficient genome-editing as there is no labor-intensive maintenance of the stem cell culture and exhibit increased single-cell cloning efficiency, compared to primed hESCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Based on the three tested loci, the CRISPR/Cas9 system works efficiently in naïve hESCs both with the Cas9 nuclease as well as with the Cas9 nickase (up to 19% editing efficiency). The use of a plasmid based CRISPR approach already proved its effectiveness in pluripotent stem cells and the observed editing efficiencies are similar as described in literature for iPSCs (1–25% NHEJ in iPSCs, also without any selection steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>). Higher efficiencies are noticed when using a selection marker (up to 79% in iPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>). Next to this strategy, delivery of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) is reported as more efficient and with reduced off-target effects compared to plasmids expressing the Cas9 nuclease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. For example, Kim <italic>et al</italic>. reported an editing efficiency of 66% when using Cas9 RNP electroporation in H9 hESCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is of great interest to optimize this system in naïve hESCs and compare the editing efficiencies with the Cas9 plasmids. When only considering the off-target effects, these will also be minimized when using the double nicking system with the plasmid approach.</p>
<p id="Par23">Although we only screened four predicted off-target sites, for one sgRNA of <italic>EMX1</italic> one of the screened sites showed cleavage with the wildtype Cas9 nuclease and not with the Cas9 nickase. This confirms the higher specificity of the double nicking system, as described by Ran <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. It also stresses the importance of screening for off-target sites when using CRISPR-Cas9, especially for certain applications (e.g. gene or cell therapy). Therefore, one can screen all predicted off-targets sites or identify the off-targets empirically using methods like GUIDE-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, Digenome-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, SITE-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> and CIRCLE-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par24">In contrast to Miyaoka <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, for our sgRNAs we don’t see an effect of the chosen cell type on the efficiency of gene-editing (naïve hESCs and HEK-293T), however we do observe an influence of the used sgRNA and chosen target locus.</p>
<p id="Par25">For the three observed loci, the Cas9 nickase doesn’t generate predominant indels like the Cas9 nuclease does, but the indels are larger. The latter can be beneficial to perturb the function of a lncRNA, which is not as straightforward as for protein coding genes. It’s described that small deletions within lncRNAs are unlikely to disrupt their biological activity and hence larger deletions are preferred<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par26">Lin <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> described a highly-conserved region of ∼200 bp in the largest exon of <italic>TUNA</italic> that contains a functional motif. Therefore, we chose to target this motif with CRISPR/Cas9 to disturb its function. Because of the favorable characteristics of the naïve hESCs, no problems were experienced with the monoclonal isolation and we rapidly obtained two genome-edited hESCs colonies with (a) homozygous/compound heterozygous deletion(s) in this motif.</p>
<p id="Par27">The function of lncRNAs is probably related to their higher-order structures through interactions with partner proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. After in silico assessment with RNAplfold we see that both deletions cause a change in the local secondary structure of <italic>TUNA</italic>, compared to the wildtype structure. Since it’s shown by Lin <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> that <italic>Tuna</italic> modulates its function through its conserved functional domain by interacting with the RNA-binding proteins PTBP1 and hnRNP-K (but not NCL), it can be anticipated that the obtained alterations in secondary structure can have a functional effect.</p>
<p id="Par28">Recently, Lee <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> showed that naïve hESCs are intrinsically predisposed to differentiate towards the neural fate and have impaired mesoderm and endoderm differentiation capacity. They compared the neural differentiation potential of naïve and primed hESCs and noticed significantly more NPCs generated from the naïve hESCs. Our group also successfully differentiated wildtype and genome-edited naïve hESCs to NPCs, which has great potential for studying neurodevelopmental disorders. After differentiating the two genome-edited <italic>TUNA</italic> hESCs to NPCs, both showed a decrease in expression of <italic>TUNA</italic> during neural differentiation (significant for the homozygous deletion). Large differences between biological replicates can be noticed and hence the method by Willems <italic>et al</italic>. to standardize our expression data was implemented.</p>
<p id="Par29">A possible explanation why we don’t observe the same phenotype as Lin <italic>et al</italic>. might be the use of different mechanisms to generate the gene knockdown: shRNA interferes at the (post)transcript-level and CRISPR/Cas9 at the DNA-level. It might be that the generated indels with CRISPR/Cas9 are too small to generate a sufficient knockdown and subsequent a functional effect. Lin <italic>et al</italic>. achieves a knockdown of almost 90% in the mESCs, while only the hESCs with a homozygous deletion shows a knockdown of ~50%. It might be that only these hESC clones survived because these indels have limited effect on their pluripotency. It would be interesting to investigate whether genome-edited colonies with larger indels in the functional domain or even a deletion of the entire lncRNA will have a functional effect on pluripotency and neural differentiation and will repeat the phenotype as described in Lin <italic>et al</italic>.</p>
<p id="Par30">Combining pluripotent stem cells and genome-editing, in particular the CRISPR/Cas9 technology with its broad applications, will be a powerful tool for future research. The use of naïve hESCs in comparison to primed hESCs has several advantages, therefore, we optimized a general workflow for the CRISPR/Cas9 system in naïve human embryonic stem cells. Here we showed that the system works efficiently. Next to this, we also established neural differentiation starting from naïve hESCs. In future research, this workflow can be used to study candidate genes, both coding as well as noncoding, involved in neural differentiation.</p>

For each gene, two guide RNAs were designed to allow double nicking using the CRISPR/Cas9 design tool developed by the Zhang lab at MIT (crispr.mit.edu). For the selected sgRNA target sequence, the recognition site for BbsI was added to the sequence and the single stranded DNA molecules were ordered at Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Belgium): 5′-CACC-(G)-N<sub>20</sub>-3′ (forward) and 3′-(C)-N<sub>20</sub>-CAAA-5′ (reverse). If the target sequence does not start with a G, add a G and a C to respectively the forward and reverse oligonucleotide.
