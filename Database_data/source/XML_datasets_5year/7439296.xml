<p>This study reveals the contribution of gut bacteria to Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>The gut-brain axis is bidirectional, and gut microbiota influence brain disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β/asparagine endopeptidase (C/EBPβ/AEP) signaling spatiotemporally mediates AD pathologies in the brain via cleaving both β-amyloid precursor protein and Tau. We show that gut dysbiosis occurs in 5xFAD mice, and is associated with escalation of the C/EBPβ/AEP pathway in the gut with age. Unlike that of aged wild-type mice, the microbiota of aged 3xTg mice accelerate AD pathology in young 3xTg mice, accompanied by active C/EBPβ/AEP signaling in the brain. Antibiotic treatment diminishes this signaling and attenuates amyloidogenic processes in 5xFAD, improving cognitive functions. The prebiotic R13 inhibits this pathway and suppresses amyloid aggregates in the gut. R13-induced <italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> antagonizes the C/EBPβ/AEP axis, mitigating gut leakage and oxidative stress. Our findings support the hypothesis that C/EBPβ/AEP signaling is activated by gut dysbiosis, implicated in AD pathologies in the gut.</p>

<body><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disease with aging as the major risk factor. The pathological hallmarks include extracellular senile plaques that are mainly composed of aggregated polypeptide β-Amyloid 42 (Aβ42) and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), principally consisting of hyperphosphorylated Tau. Although intensive efforts have been made in this field, the key molecular mechanism dictating AD etiopathogenesis still remains unclear. The interaction between genetic and environmental factors contributes to AD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Gut microbiota regulate host brain functions and behavior via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. GF (germ-free) animals, antibiotics interference, probiotics intervention, pathogen infection, and dietary habits not only affect the composition of gut microbiota and physiological function of the gut but also impinge on host cognitive behavior and alter the risk of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota may play some role in mediating AD pathology. For instance 16<italic>S</italic> ribosomal RNA (16<italic>S</italic> rRNA) sequences from fecal samples reveal that the bacterial gut microbiome of AD patients differs taxonomically from that of controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>). The gut microbiota of patients with AD show reduced diversity and a distinct taxonomic composition, with decreased Firmicutes, increased Bacteroidetes, and decreased <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> compared to the microbiota of healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Most recently, Haran <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>) demonstrated that the microbiome of AD patients is associated with dysregulation of the anti-inflammatory P-glycoprotein pathway. The microbiome of aged AD patients shows a lower proportion and prevalence of bacteria with the potential to synthesize butyrate, as well as higher abundances of taxa that are known to cause proinflammatory conditions.</p><p>Many diseases have been correlated with variations in numbers and composition of gut microbiota, including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, autism, depression, and Parkinson’s disease (PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are two common gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. IBS is a functional GI disease related to changes in the microbiota-gut-brain axis, usually manifested in the case of stress or enteric infection. IBD is characteristic of increased intestinal permeability, disrupted gut microbiota, and inflammation. Patients with IBS and IBD show a decline in cognitive ability, suggesting the potential relationship between gut and cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>). A consistent association of brain amyloidosis with proinflammatory gut bacteria of cognitively impaired patients has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>). Furthermore, antibiotic-mediated perturbation in the gut microbiome modulates amyloid deposition in an AD mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). The microbiota diversity of APP/PS1 mice (containing mutations in both APP 670/671NL (Swedish) and PSEN L166P) decreases with increased age. The association of bacterial taxa with cerebral Aβ pathology observed in conventionally raised APP/PS1 mice indicates that specific microbes may be involved in the progression of cerebral Aβ amyloidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>).</p><p>Mammalian asparagine endopeptidase (AEP; also called legumain; gene name, <italic>LGMN</italic>) is a cysteine protease that specifically cleaves the substrates after asparagine (N) in a pH-dependent manner. AEP usually resides in the endolysosomes, and it is activated under acidosis. AEP is activated in human AD brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). It simultaneously cleaves both APP and Tau, promoting amyloid and NFT pathologies in AD mouse models. In addition, it cleaves both APP N585 and Tau N368 in human AD brains. Knockout of AEP from 5xFAD or Tau P301S mice mitigates senile plaques or NFT pathologies, restoring the cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>). Notably, Tau N368 is demonstrable in the cerebrospinal fluid of patient with AD, correlating with Tau positron emission tomography signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>). Recently, we reported that <italic>LGMN</italic> mRNA transcription is predominantly regulated by CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) in the brain in an age-dependent way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>). In addition to promoting the production of inflammatory mediators, C/EBP family members are themselves induced by the classical proinflammatory triad of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor–α (TNF-α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><italic>18</italic></xref>), all of which are substantially increased in pathologically affected regions of AD brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><italic>19</italic></xref>). Hence, there is a feedback loop between amyloid and neuroinflammation through activating C/EBPβ in microglia or astrocytes. Most recently, we reported that the C/EBPβ/AEP axis is spatiotemporally activated in 3xTg AD mouse brain, mediating AD pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20"><italic>20</italic></xref>).</p><p>In the current report, we provide extensive evidence demonstrating that gut dysbiosis occurs in 5xFAD mice in an age-dependent manner, associated with temporal activation of C/EBPβ/AEP pathway and amyloid pathology in the gut. Microbiota from the aged 3xTg but not aged wild-type (WT) mice accelerates AD pathology in young 3xTg mice, accompanied with active C/EBPβ/AEP signaling in the brain. Chronic antibiotic treatment represses this pathway, alleviates AD pathology, and rescues cognitive dysfunctions in 5xFAD. R13, a small molecular prodrug of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) that is a tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) agonist, acts as a prebiotic, blocks the C/EBPβ/AEP pathway in the gut, and reduces amyloidogenesis. R13-enriched probiotic decreases gut leakage and oxidative stress in 5xFAD mice.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Gut dysbiosis occurs in 5xFAD mice in an age-dependent manner</title><p>Previous studies have indicated an association between alterations in the intestinal microbial community and the development of AD pathologies in murine models. However, there is a scarcity of mechanistic knowledge on how dysbiotic gut microbiota affect amyloid pathology in the gut. Therefore, we first characterized the gut microbial community composition in the AD mouse model in an age-dependent manner, where we used a murine AD model, specifically 5xFAD mice and their WT littermates. For this purpose, the total DNA was purified from mouse fecal samples, which were collected from 3- or 6-month-old 5xFAD mice and their WT littermates. Bacterial 16<italic>S</italic> rRNA genes (V4 region) were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–amplified, and the amplicons were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing (HTS) platform. The microbiome analysis showed a remarkable alteration of the gut microbiota composition in 5xFAD mice, when we compared the microbial community structure with the 6-month-old WT mice. On the other hand, at 3 months of age, the microbial community structures remained mostly similar in both 5xFAD and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). At the phyla level, microbiota analysis revealed that the gut microbiota of both 3-month-old 5xFAD and WT mice consisted of a lower abundance of Firmicutes and a higher abundance of Bacteroidetes. However, microbiome analysis demonstrated a marked temporal shift in the taxonomic distribution of the gut microbiota at the age of 6 months in the 5xFAD and WT littermate mice, as evident from the dynamically altered abundance of the two dominant phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The microbiota community in the 6-month-old 5xFAD mice is characterized by the dynamic increase in the abundance of proinflammatory phyla, including Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and <italic>Deferribacteres</italic> (fig. S1A). At the genus level, 6-month-old 5xFAD mice also demonstrated the increase in the numbers of <italic>Helicobacter</italic>, <italic>Prevotella</italic>, and <italic>Sutterella</italic> compared with WT littermate mice (fig. S1B). In addition, the genus <italic>Helicobacter</italic>, which is a member of the phylum Proteobacteria, particularly showed more than a10-fold increase in the abundance in the stool of the 6-month-old 5xFAD mice in comparison with WT littermates (fig. S1C). Our analysis further indicated that <italic>Helicobacter bilis</italic> was significantly increased in the relative abundance in 6-month-old versus 3-month-old 5xFAD mice (fig. S1D). Furthermore, the dynamic alteration in the microbial community composition was also evident from the β-diversity analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), which demonstrated a marked temporal shift in the taxonomic distribution of the gut microbiota at the age of 6 months in the 5xFAD and WT mice. Moreover, the phylogenetic richness (α-diversity) at the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level significantly decreased in the 6-month-old 5xFAD mouse intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, C to E</xref>). Hence, these findings indicate age-dependent dynamic alterations in the gut microbiota of 5xFAD mice, which are characterized by a diminished microbial diversity, followed by a marked depletion of anti-inflammatory Firmicutes and temporal enrichment of proinflammatory Proteobacteria.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Microbiome analysis in 5xFAD mouse stool reveals an alteration in the microbial community.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative abundance of bacterial phyla determined by HTS analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 5 per group).

The microbiome analysis showed an alteration of the gut microbiota components in young 3xTg mice cohoused with aged 3xTg mice, as compared with those cohoused with aged WT mice. At 6 months of age, the microbial community structures displayed distinct differences between two groups of young recipient mice. Moreover, some similarities in microbial community structures were observed between the recipient 3xTg mice and their donor mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Notably, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–dextran assay indicated that receiving gut microbiome from aged 3xTg mice enhanced the gut leakage in young 3xTg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Immunoblotting revealed that introducing the gut microbiome from aged 3xTg mice increased both p-C/EBPβ and C/EBPβ levels in young 3xTg mice brains, resulting in higher activation of AEP. Subsequently, the downstream APP and Tau were pronouncedly augmented, leading to evident escalation of both APP N373/N585 and Tau N368 fragments. Notably, AT8 signals [phospho-Tau (Ser 202, Thr205)] were increased in young 3xTg mice cohoused with aged 3xTg, as compared to aged WT mice or to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). AEP enzymatic assays validated that gut microbiome from aged 3xTg mice triggered AEP activation in the brains of young 3xTg, while gut microbiome from healthy aged mice blocked the protease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Moreover, electron microscopy (EM) analysis revealed that the synapses were strongly reduced in young 3xTg mice brains upon receiving gut microbiome from aged 3xTg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>). Morris water maze (MWM) behavioral tests revealed significant cognitive defects in young 3xTg mice receiving the gut microbiome from aged 3xTg mice, compared to microbiome transplants from aged WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, H to K</xref>). Therefore, gut microbiome alteration in young 3xTg mice due to cohousing with aged 3xTg mice activates C/EBPβ/AEP signaling in the brains of young recipient mice, accelerating the onset of cognitive dysfunction.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Gut microbiomes from aged 3xTg mice activate C/EBPβ/AEP in young 3xTg mice brain, facilitating cognitive dysfunction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative abundance of bacterial phyla determined by HTS analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 5 per group).

To examine whether this pathway is also activated in the gut, as implicated in AD pathologies, we conducted immunofluorescent (IF) costaining on the colon sections from different ages of 5xFAD and their WT littermates. p-C/EBPβ/microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) costaining indicated that C/EBPβ phosphorylation in MAP2-positive ENS (enteric nerve system) neurons was slightly escalated in the WT gut in an age-dependent manner. Notably, MAP2 neuronal signals were reduced, suggesting enteric neuronal loss during aging. Notably, p-C/EBPβ was highly augmented in 5xFAD mice, while MAP2-positive neurons were evidently declined in the gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). To validate the specificity of p-C/EBPβ staining signals, we incubated the brain and colon slides from 6-month-old 5xFAD mice with control or anti–p-C/EBPβ, a well-characterized specific antibody for active C/EBPβ; we only observed the fluorescent signals from the samples incubated with p-C/EBPβ antibody (fig. S2A), indicating that the positive signals are from active p-C/EBPβ cells. Consistent with these findings, the downstream target AEP was strongly escalated during aging, as were the total levels of C/EBPβ in both WT and 5xFAD gut with the latter stronger than the former (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). These findings suggest that extensive inflammation occurs in the gut during aging with 5xFAD mice more strongly than with WT mice. Consequently, Aβ abundance was highly elevated in 5xFAD mice during aging, as was AEP-truncated Tau N368. Although Aβ signals were demonstrable in WT gut tissues, Tau N368 was barely detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). On the other hand, AEP-truncated APP C586 was also temporally increased in 5xFAD gut tissues, accompanied by escalating p-Tau AT8 activities. By contrast, APP C586 signals were much weaker in WT gut, and AT8 was not demonstrable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>C/EBPβ/AEP pathway is escalated in an age-dependent way in 5xFAD mice colon.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) IF staining of p-C/EBPβ and MAP2 in colon of 5xFAD mice.

As expected, C/EBPβ and AEP were demonstrable and temporally augmented in 5xFAD mouse brains (fig. S2C).

We used the regimens of antibiotics (a mixture of ampicillin, vancomycin, neomycin, gentamycin, and erythromycin) that are commonly used to disrupt the microbiota in mouse models of enteric infection and inflammation and evaluated their effects on Aβ deposition in the brains of 5xFAD mice and prepared the brain lysates and serial sections from each hemibrain from ABX- and vehicle-treated animals at 6.5 months of age. Immunoblotting revealed that chronic ABX treatment repressed both C/EBPβ and p-C/EBPβ levels, resulting in the reduction of AEP. Subsequently, the downstream substrates of APP and Tau proteolytic cleavage was pronouncedly attenuated upon ABX treatment, leading to APP N585 and N373, two truncated fragments from AEP cleavage of APP, and Tau N368 evidently decreased. Conversely, the full-length APP recognized by N-terminal (APP NT) antibody was escalated in ABX-treated 5xFAD brains. Notably, AT8 and AT100, two Tau phosphorylation antibodies, showed that Tau hyperphosphorylation was robustly mitigated in ABX-treated 5xFAD brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). AEP enzymatic assay with brain lysates validated that ABX significantly blocked its protease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).

We found that R13 decreased C/EBPβ in the gut of 5xFAD in a dose-dependent manner; subsequently, AEP was oscillated in the similar format. As a result, both APP N373 and Tau N368 cleavage by AEP was blunted in the gut of 5xFAD mice in a concentration-dependent manner by R13. Notably, full-length (APP FL) was also dose-dependently decreased by R13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).

To investigate whether R13 activates TrkB receptors in the brain involves any other mechanisms, in addition to direct agonistic activation by 7,8-DHF that is released after R13 hydrolysis, we conducted IF staining with anti-BDNF and ELISA quantification. We found that R13 up-regulated BDNF levels in the hippocampus of 5xFAD dose-dependently (fig. S5, C and D). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining with 4-HNE (4-hydroxynonenal), a biomarker for lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, showed that R13 progressively inhibits the oxidative stress in both the 5xFAD brain and gut (fig.

Approximately 95% of the symbiotic microbes are located in the gut, and they play a major role in human nutrition, digestion, neurotrophy, inflammation, growth, immunity, and protection against pathogen infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>). Dysbiosis and alterations of gut microbiome composition contribute to the development of several diseases in humans, including IBS, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27"><italic>27</italic></xref>). These changes are integral to gut homeostasis and to programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and thus play an important role in stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28"><italic>28</italic></xref>). In this study, we show that gut dysbiosis takes place in 5xFAD mice versus WT littermates in an age-dependent manner. Note that the gut microbial dysbiosis is intricately associated with a reduction in phylogenetic richness, especially in diseases that are characterized by intestinal inflammation and deregulated GI barrier integrity. For instance, <italic>Helicobacter</italic> is highly enriched in 5xFAD mice, compared to WT littermates at 6 months of age (fig. S1B). In particular, <italic>H. bilis</italic> showed a significant increase in both 3-month-old and 6-month-old 5xFAD mice (fig. S1D). Moreover, microbiota analysis also revealed that <italic>Prevotella</italic> species increased (~100-fold) at 6 months in 5xFAD mice (fig. S1B). <italic>Prevotella</italic> is the predominant genus in human colonic microbiota, and is genetically equipped to function as an efficient mucin degrader in the intestine. <italic>Prevotella</italic> has been reported to promote GI dysfunction in diabetes and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><italic>29</italic></xref>). Similarly, the genus <italic>Sutterella</italic> has been frequently associated with human diseases, such as autism, Down syndrome, and IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><italic>30</italic></xref>).</p><p>Gut microbiota may contribute to aging and influence brain disorders. In particular, a new connection between gut microbiota and PD has been reported in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><italic>31</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32"><italic>32</italic></xref>). The Aβ and NFT pathologies and associated neuroinflammation in AD brain cross-talk with the gut via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Conceivably, gut leakage due to gut dysbiosis in patients with AD may allow the endotoxins from bacterial metabolites such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to penetrate into the ENS system in the colon, where they may stimulate C/EBPβ activation and AEP up-regulation, resulting in the augmentation of Aβ and NFT pathologies in myenteric and submucosal nervous system. The aggregated Aβ or Tau fibrils might spread into the brain along the vagus nerve. For instance, previous studies show that α-Syn fibrils derived from patients with PD can transport into the brain along the vagus nerve after injection into the colon of the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33"><italic>33</italic></xref>). Most recently, we have reported that AEP-truncated α-Syn N103 and Tau N368 form compact fibrils, have higher neurotoxicity, and propagate from the colon into the brain, triggering PD pathologies and motor disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34"><italic>34</italic></xref>). A healthy gut microbiota is very important for maintaining normal brain development and function. Mounting evidence supports that the gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication that simultaneously applies to both the brain and the gut. Kim <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35"><italic>35</italic></xref>) reported that the transfer of healthy microbiota would reduce amyloid and Tau pathology in a different AD animal model, providing that a proof of concept of gut microbiota affects the brain. To further test this notion, we conducted a cohousing experiment using 3xTg mice, in which young 3xTg mice were either cohousing with aged 3xTg mice or aged WT mice from 1.5 to 6.5 months of age. This is an alternative for fecal microbiota transplant experiment. Our data suggest that microbiota from the aged 3xTg but not WT mice accelerate AD pathology in young 3xTg mice, associated with active C/EBPβ/AEP signaling in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>The C/EBPβ/AEP pathway is also temporally activated in the gut of 5xFAD mice, concurrent with the onset of amyloid pathology in the gut. Chronic antibiotic treatment represses C/EBPβ/AEP signaling and Aβ pathology, leading to the restoration of cognitive functions in 5xFAD mice. Notably, oral administration of a small molecular TrkB receptor agonist prodrug R13 that is metabolized into T1 and then into 7,8-DHF, which blunts C/EBPβ/AEP axis in the gut and antagonizes Aβ pathology (fig. S5, A and B). Thus, R13 acts as a prebiotic, in addition to the activation of BDNF/TrkB neurotrophic signaling via 7,8-DHF in the brain. <italic>H. hepaticus</italic> preferentially colonizes mouse small intestine, cecum, and colon and induces intestinal inflammation and colitis in the murine model of IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36"><italic>36</italic></xref>), and R13 treatment significantly repressed its expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Notably, fecal sample analysis reveals that the beneficial bacterium <italic>L. salivarius</italic> is selectively enriched after chronic R13 treatment in 5xFAD mice. Accordingly, long-term feeding of 5xFAD mice with <italic>L. salivarius</italic> probiotic attenuates gut leakage and inflammation and oxidative stress. However, probiotic treatment alone is not sufficient to reverse the cognitive deficits in 5xFAD mice, indicating that R13-induced <italic>L. salivarius</italic> probiotic contributes to a portion of the therapeutic efficacy of R13 in treating AD. Previous studies demonstrated that the probiotic <italic>L. salivarius</italic> ameliorates colonic damage and reduces mucosal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37"><italic>37</italic></xref>).</p><p>Previously, we have reported that the parent compound 7,8-DHF penetrates into the brain,binds TrkB receptors, and stimulates the neurotrophic signaling in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><italic>25</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>). Notably, we also found that R13 dose-dependently elevates BDNF production in the brains (fig. S5, C and D). Conceivably, R13 or 7,8-DHF exerts the therapeutic efficacy in AD via multiple mechanisms from the TrkB agonistic functions to the augmentation of BDNF production in the brains to the prebiotic actions in the gut microbiota. Note that treatment with antibiotics, R13, or probiotic in 5xFAD mice, C/EBPβ, a crucial proinflammatory cytokines transcription factor, is robustly diminished. Consequently, its downstream target AEP is repressed in the gut and the brain, leading to APP and Tau proteolytic fragmentation reduction and Aβ pathology inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Our previous study demonstrated that BDNF and C/EBPβ inversely regulate each other, providing a mechanistic link between BDNF/TrkB reduction, C/EBPβ up-regulation, δ-secretase (AEP) activation, and Aβ and Tau alterations in the murine brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>). In the current study, we found that R13 (7,8-DHF) also functions as antioxidant in the murine colon, leading to proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 decrease and suppression of C/EBPβ.</p><p>It has been shown that populating the gut microbiota can release significant amounts of amyloids and LPS, which might play a role in the modulation of signaling pathways and the production of proinflammatory cytokines related to the pathogenesis of AD. Nutrients have been shown to affect the composition of the gut microbiota and the formation and aggregation of cerebral Aβ, suggesting that modulating the gut microbiome and amyloidogenesis through specific nutritional interventions might be an effective strategy to prevent or reduce the risk of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><italic>40</italic></xref>).</p><p>Antibiotics seriously disrupt the gut microbiota. Long-term ABX administration in male mice leads to reduced Aβ deposition and associated gliosis and reduces Aβ deposition selectively in males but not in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). Transplants of fecal microbiota from age-matched APP/PS1-21 male mice into ABX-treated APP/PS1-21 male restore the gut microbiome and partially restore Aβ pathology and microglial morphology, thus demonstrating a causal role of the microbiome in the modulation of Aβ amyloidosis and microglial physiology in mouse models of Aβ amyloidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"><italic>41</italic></xref>). Accordingly, we showed that ABX treatment inhibits C/EBPβ/AEP pathway in the gut and the brain of 5xFAD mice and mitigates Aβ pathologies, attenuating AD cognitive disorders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, and figs. S3, S4, and S6).</p><p>Host gut microbiota also constantly control maturation and function of microglia in the CNS. Modulating the gut microbiome and restoring its diversity in the elderly through diet and nutrition intervention might improve the physical and mental health of the elderly. Dietary intake of some other antioxidant nutrients, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and flavonoids, is also considered to be related to decreased risk of AD. Chronic treatment with R13 also results in alleviation of gut dysbiosis in 5xFAD mice by increasing the beneficial bacteria and attenuating inflammatory bacteria, which is associated with AD pathology reduction in the gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> and fig. S5). Previously, we have reported that R13 dose-dependently activates TrkB signaling via its small molecular agonist 7,8-DHF in the brain and inhibits AEP via activated Akt-mediated phosphorylation, leading to escalation of synaptic plasticity and suppression AD pathologies in 5xFAD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><italic>25</italic></xref>). The metabolite 7,8-DHF is a flavonoid with multiple functions including TrkB agonistic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>), antioxidative effect (fig. S5), and prebiotic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), whose effects on gut microbiota might be independent of the effect in the brain as a TrkB agonist in alleviating AD pathogenesis. Accordingly, chronic treatment with R13-induced probiotic <italic>L. salivarius</italic> bacteria suppresses C/EBPβ/AEP signaling in the gut and the brain. Notably, it also significantly mitigates the gut leakage and displays the antioxidative effect in both the brain and the gut of 5xFAD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref> and fig. S7). Note that both ABX and R13 treatments reduce the proinflammatory bacteria such as <italic>Helicobacter</italic>. The abundance of anti-inflammatory <italic>L. salivarus</italic> remained unchanged or even increased after ABX or R13 treatment, respectively. Thus, our findings indicate that <italic>L. salivarus</italic> abundancy after both treatments remained beyond a certain level, which is associated with the regulation of signaling pathways. C/EBPβ/AEP signaling in both treatments was repressed compared with control (vehicle). However, R13 itself exerted the direct effect on the host as many flavonoids, in addition to physically activating TrkB receptors. It remains unclear exactly how gut microbiota alteration mediates brain BDNF levels. Presumably, R13 treatment decreases the inflammation in the brain and inactivates C/EBPβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), alleviating the repression by C/EBPβ on BDNF transcription.</p><p>After consumption, polyphenols, which are characterized by low bioavailability, need biotransformation by gut microbiota into bioactive metabolites, recognized as xenobiotics, and become readily absorbable. Therefore, to sufficiently obtain the health benefits and increase the bioavailability and activity of polyphenols, one may need healthy gut microbiota. The protective role of other antioxidants and nutrients may also depend on the balance of gut microbiota to some extent. We have reported that both 7,8-DHF and R13 are orally bioactive, and R13 improves 7,8-DHF oral bioavailability from 4.6 to 11% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><italic>25</italic></xref>). Currently, R13 is under phase 1 clinical trial for treating AD indication. Therefore, external environmental factors induce gut microbiota disturbance, and the influence of host genes on gut microbiota may interact together to determine disease susceptibility, including the risk of AD. Conceivably, R13 exerts its therapeutic efficacy toward AD via both direct TrkB receptor agonistic effect and beneficial modulation of gut microbiota.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mice</title><p>5xFAD (APP SwFlLon, PSEN1*M146L*L286V) mice were from the Jackson laboratory (stock number, 008169) and were bred in a pathogen-free environment in accordance with the Emory Medical School guidelines.

Each reverse PCR primer sequence contained the reverse complement of the 3′ Illumina adapter, the Golay barcode (each sequence contained a different barcode), the reverse primer pad, the reverse primer linker, and the reverse primer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42"><italic>42</italic></xref>). Three independent PCR reactions were performed for each sample, combined, and purified with AMPure magnetic purification beads (Agencourt). The products were quantified, and a master DNA pool was generated from the purified products in equimolar ratios. The pooled products were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. Bioinformatics analysis was performed using QIIME (Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology). Sequences were assigned to OTUs with UPARSE using 97% pairwise identity and were classified taxonomically using the RDP classifier retrained with Greengenes. After chimera removal, the average number of reads per sample was 21,511. A single representative sequence for each OTU was aligned using PyNAST, and a phylogenetic tree was then built using FastTree. The phylogenetic tree was used to compute the UniFrac distances.

Detection was achieved using a Fast SYBR Green Master mix according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The following reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) protocol was followed: 95°C for 15 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 66°C (bacteria-specific) and 50°C (universal) for 40 s, and 72°C for 30 s. A melting curve was performed after amplification to distinguish between the targeted and nontargeted PCR products. All reactions were performed in duplicate. Bacterial abundance was analyzed as genome equivalents. For quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses, the sample-specific relative abundance of bacteria was determined as genome equivalents amplified by bacteria-specific primers divided by genome equivalents amplified by universal primers. Absolute abundance per gram of stools was determined by adjusting for the dilutions performed during DNA extraction, normalization, and qPCR setup and dividing this concentration by the total grams of stools used for the original DNA extraction.

In this manner, experimental subjects needed to use extramaze cues to determine the platform’s location. At the beginning of each trial, the mouse was placed in the water maze with their paws touching the wall from one of four different starting positions (North, South, East, and West). Each subject was given 4 trials/day for five consecutive days with a 15-min intertrial interval. The maximum trial length was 60 s, and if subjects did not reach the platform in the allotted time, then they were manually guided to it.

After each trial, subjects were dried and kept in a dry plastic holding cage filled with paper towels to allow the subjects to dry off. The temperature of the water was monitored every hour so that the mice were tested in water that was between 22° and 25°C.
