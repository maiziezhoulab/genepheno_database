<abstract>
<p>Epigenetics, defined as ‘the study of mitotically and/or meiotically heritable
changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence’,
has emerged as a promissory yet controversial field of scientific inquiry over
the past decade. Scholars from many disciplines have formulated both optimistic
and cautionary claims regarding its potential normative implications. This
article provides a comprehensive review of the nascent literature at the
crossroads of epigenetics, ethics, law and society. It describes nine emerging
areas of discussion, relating to (1) the impact of epigenetics on the nature
versus nurture dualism, (2) the potential resulting biologization of the social,
(3) the meaning of epigenetics for public health, its potential influence on (4)
reproduction and parenting, (5) political theory and (6) legal proceedings, and
concerns regarding (7) stigmatization and discrimination, (8) privacy protection
and (9) knowledge translation. While there is some degree of similarity between
the nature and content of these areas and the abundant literature on ethical,
legal and social issues in genetics, the potential implications of epigenetics
ought not be conflated with the latter. Critical studies on epigenetics are
emerging within a separate space of bioethical and biopolitical investigations
and claims, with scholars from various epistemological standpoints utilizing
distinct yet complementary analytical approaches.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The term ‘epigenetics’ was used by Conrad H. Waddington from 1942 to designate the
‘[causal] mechanisms by which the genes of the genotype bring about phenotypic
effects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0306312719866007">Waddington,
1942</xref>: 18). In the early 1990s, Waddington’s concept gradually changed to
reflect a rise in investigations at the molecular level, which aimed to better
understand variations in gene expression, some of which were relatively stable in
time and thought to be influenced by the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0306312719866007">Jablonka and Lamb, 2002</xref>). Today,
epigenetics is defined as ‘the study of mitotically and/or meiotically heritable
changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0306312719866007">Russo et al., 1996</xref>: 1). It
has developed into an increasingly diversified field of scientific inquiry, with
researchers focusing on, for instance, associations between toxic exposures and
epigenetic modifications (e.g. DNA methylation, histone modifications), epigenetic
variants and diseases, or the possible inter-/transgenerational inheritance of
acquired epigenetic traits.</p>
<p>Scientific advances in epigenetics have recently captured the attention of a variety
of researchers and stakeholders. Interpretations have been formulated regarding the
field’s significance and possible impact on society at multiple levels, including
medical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306312719866007">Balasubramanian,
2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0306312719866007">Rutherford,
2015</xref>), philosophical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306312719866007">Hens and Van Goidsenhoven, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0306312719866007">Spears, 2017</xref>), judicial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0306312719866007">Hesman Saey, 2016</xref>),
political (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306312719866007">Goldberg,
2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0306312719866007">Smith,
2013</xref>) and commercial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306312719866007">GWG
Holdings, 2018</xref>). Exciting subfields such as environmental or social
epigenetics have been called ‘revolutionary’, because they could provide additional
grounds to revisit some gene-centric theories, long perceived by many as too
simplistic and reductionist of human identity, behavior and health. In this article,
we present the results of a comprehensive literature review of potential
epistemological and normative implications of epigenetics, as anticipated by
researchers in the social sciences and humanities over the past dozen years.</p>
<p>We characterize nine ‘areas of discussion’ at the crossroads of epigenetics, ethics,
law and society. We highlight the coexistence of optimistic and cautionary
appraisals of the potential consequences of epigenetic research, and of its foreseen
translations into health interventions and public policies. We also underscore the
coexistence of four distinct yet complementary analytical approaches – descriptive,
instrumental, dialectical and reflexive – employed by different authors from various
disciplines. We then argue that while studies of epigenetics are producing apparent
conflictual bioethical and biopolitical claims, the overall result is the production
of an increasingly nuanced and sophisticated corpus. We conclude with a call for
attention to additional burgeoning areas of discussion in the coming years.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0306312719866007">
<title>Search for publications</title>
<p>Two investigators (CD and KMS) independently searched Google Scholar for
publications that address (potential) ethical, legal and social implications
(ELSI) of epigenetics. Initial searches began in September 2016 using variations
and permutations of keywords such as ‘epigenetics’, ‘DNA methylation’,
‘histone’, ‘ethics’, ‘law’ and ‘society’. The two investigators also identified
articles using the snowballing method, by (a) iteratively scrutinizing the
references of selected papers for missing publications, and (b) continuously
searching for missing publications using the ‘cited by’ function in Google
Scholar, in conjunction with some of our most frequently cited entries (&gt;10
citations). The search ended in January 2018, when both investigators agreed
that saturation had been reached.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0306312719866007">
<title>Inclusion criteria</title>
<p>We included refereed articles, commentaries and editorials published in English
academic journals between 2000 and 2017 (inclusively). We considered the
publication of two seminal scientific articles, one in the field of ‘nutritional
epigenetics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0306312719866007">Waterland and
Jirtle, 2003</xref>) and the other in ‘social epigenetics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0306312719866007">Weaver et al., 2004</xref>),
to be at the origins of recent discussions regarding the ELSI of epigenetics.
Hence, we could predict with a reasonable degree of confidence that expanding
our search before the year 2000 would not generate additional relevant
publications. To be selected, a publication had to describe and/or discuss one
or more potential issues or implications related to the field of epigenetics. To
account for the diversity of issues and implications explored in the literature,
we included publications that touched on any ELSI in epigenetics, including
broader implications of the field – such as epistemological (e.g. gene-centric
views such as genetic essentialism and determinism) and methodological (e.g. for
social sciences and humanities, or political theory) implications – that may be
more descriptive and to some extent less normative/prescriptive.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0306312719866007">
<title>Exclusion criteria</title>
<p>We excluded publications whose content was mainly technoscientific or medical in
nature (e.g. focused on epigenetic mechanisms), and in which the authors only
superficially touched on the potential ELSI in epigenetics. Editorials or
introductory remarks were excluded when they were solely descriptions of the
content of an article in a special issue. Books, book chapters, governmental
reports and theses addressing the topics were excluded. Our final list of
selected publications included 99 peer-reviewed articles and 19 commentaries or
editorials (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0306312719866007">online Appendix</ext-link>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0306312719866007">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>All selected publications (<italic>n</italic> = 118) were independently
categorized by two investigators (CD and KMS) for journal type (research
discipline targeted), area of discussion, general tone (neutral, optimistic or
cautionary) and analytical approach (descriptive, instrumental, dialectical or
reflexive). We also flagged analyses based on the results of empirical studies.
The two investigators’ tables were subsequently compared and merged. We sought
to achieve consensus for every publication. In cases of first stance
disagreement, we openly discussed our individual analyses and reasoning, and
simultaneously scrutinized the papers again to reach consensus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0306312719866007">
<title>Areas of discussion</title>
<p>After reading all papers selected by July 2017 (<italic>n</italic> = 78) – that
is, six months before the search was ended – the two investigators agreed on
nine general areas of discussion, relating to:</p>
<list id="list1-0306312719866007" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>the traditional <italic>nature–nurture</italic> dichotomy;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the embodiment or ‘<italic>biologization</italic>’ of the social;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>public health</italic> and other preventive strategies;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>reproduction</italic>, parenting and the family;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>political theory</italic> (e.g. conceptual analyses of
responsibility and justice theories);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>legal proceedings</italic> (e.g. implications for ‘tort
law’);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the risk of stigmatization, <italic>discrimination</italic> or
eugenics;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>privacy protection</italic>; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>knowledge translation</italic> (including discourse
analyses).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Other discussions also emerged relating to, for instance, the appropriate
definition of the word ‘epigenetics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306312719866007">Greally, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0306312719866007">Thayer and Non, 2015</xref>), the various
origins of the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306312719866007">Haig,
2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0306312719866007">Jablonka
and Lamb, 2002</xref>) and the amount of evidence that has been accumulated
so far on transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306312719866007">Heard and Martienssen,
2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0306312719866007">Whitelaw,
2015</xref>). Although important, these scientific debates were not
considered areas of discussion in this review, as our intention was to focus on
the potential ELSI of epigenetics. We also found important overlap between these
debates and most of our areas of discussion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0306312719866007">
<title>General tone</title>
<p>All selected publications were categorized according to the general attitude of
the author(s) towards potential ELSI of epigenetics; that is, whether they
expressed largely neutral, optimistic or cautionary views. A publication was
considered <italic>neutral</italic> when the authors did not take a clear
position; that is, when they neither ‘promoted’ nor ‘warned against’ a specific
implication of epigenetics. A publication was considered
<italic>optimistic</italic> when the authors discussed some aspect of
epigenetics as representing an ‘opportunity’; that is, when they were
‘enthusiastic’ about its potential implications, and the overall focus of the
paper was on the potential ‘benefits’ of this new field of study. A publication
was considered <italic>cautionary</italic> when the authors discussed some
aspects of epigenetics as potential ‘threats’; that is, when they were
‘concerned’ about its potential implications, and the overall focus of the paper
was on the potential ‘risks’ of this new field of study. When publications
contained both optimistic and cautionary elements, we categorized the
publication based on overall tone of the paper – although defining the threshold
for when a paper becomes naïvely enthusiastic or disproportionally alarmist was
not the goal of this review. It is also important to note that we grant no
superior prima facie value to any of the neutral, optimistic or cautionary
analyses reported in this paper.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0306312719866007">
<title>Analytical approach</title>
<p>All selected publications were also categorized according to the main analytical
approach adopted by the author(s): descriptive, instrumental, dialectical or
reflexive. A publication was considered <italic>descriptive</italic> when the
authors reviewed a set of potential implications or issues but remained distant
about them. A publication was considered <italic>instrumental</italic> when the
author(s) presented emerging findings about epigenetic mechanisms as evidence to
persuade or convince the reader about an already existing claim (e.g. favoring
more interdisciplinary work or allocating more financial resources to preventive
public health initiatives). A publication was considered
<italic>dialectical</italic> when the authors identified
juxtaposed/contradictory arguments, depictions of epigenetic mechanisms or
implications. This argumentative approach, defined by focusing on the multiple
parts of an object or issue, considers these as results (synthesis) of
underlying forces in tension (thesis, antithesis) that may sometimes be
imperceptible at first glance. A publication was considered
<italic>reflexive</italic> when the authors engaged in an ‘analysis of the
analyses’ of the implications of epigenetics; that is, they considered the
context of the knowledge, the knowledge users, and how epigenetics and the ELSI
of epigenetics may be interpreted in certain circumstances. Finally, when
publications contained more than one type of analytical approach, we only
reported the most salient.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Over the past dozen years, discussions regarding the ELSI of epigenetics have emerged
from an impressively large diversity of disciplines. This may be explained by the
fields of environmental and social epigenetics standing at the intersection of human
health and broader societal concerns. Sociologists and Science and Technology
Studies scholars have been the most prolific so far, with an increasing number of
bioethicists and legal scholars recently contributing. Although a few foundational
papers were published between 2006 and 2012, starting in 2013, interest in
epigenetics increased. In fact, the year 2015 marked a significant rise in the
number of publications per year. Notably, two special issues devoted entirely to
ELSI of epigenetics were published for the first time in 2015: one coordinated by
philosopher of science Maurizio Meloni and published in the journal <italic>New
Genetics and Society</italic>, the other coordinated by psychiatrists Tracy D
Gunter and Alan R Felthous in <italic>Behavioral Sciences &amp; The
Law</italic>.</p>
<p>While the first years were dominated by neutral and optimistic analyses of the ELSI
of epigenetics, the past five years have witnessed a rise in cautionary analyses
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0306312719866007">Figure 1</xref>). The latter
have emerged most notably regarding the protection of privacy and confidentiality in
the collection, storage and sharing of epigenetic data, the risk of stigmatization
and discrimination based on individual epigenetic information, and the potential
impacts of epigenetics on reproduction and parenting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0306312719866007">Figure 2</xref>). Cautionary claims were also
prevalent in papers that investigated the translation of knowledge in epigenetics
from the bench to the clinic and/or policy making field, and by authors who
reflected on expectations and promissory discourses emerging with this new field of
study. In other areas of discussion, there were more optimistic expectations toward
epigenetics, including those related to its potential productive influence on the
development and implementation of preventive public health strategies, and its
anticipated positive impact on overdualistic views of the concepts of nature
(biology) and nurture (family and culture). Taken together, these cautionary
appraisals accounted for almost half of the papers published since 2013
(<italic>n</italic> = 47/96). While publications where authors enthusiastically
promoted the potential applications of the field persisted over time, the overall
proportion of these diminished over the past five years
(<italic>n</italic> = 35/96).</p>

<p>We also found a relationship between areas of discussion and the analytical approach
that the authors adopted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0306312719866007">Table
1</xref>). For instance, the meaning of epigenetics for political theory
(theories of justice and moral responsibility) appeared to stem from dialectical
analyses of the properties of the biology under scrutiny (the impact of intrinsic
contingencies). However, concerns about biologization, discrimination and knowledge
translation arose following reflexive inquiries; that is, when exploring the
possible effects of the broader context in which science is currently embedded (the
impact of extrinsic contingencies). Such distinct analytical approaches may be
related to the specific methods of studying the implications of science and
technology inherent to the scholars’ academic disciplines, and to their respective
main research interests.</p>

<title>Nature–nurture: Epigenetics as a bridge between disciplines, or ‘boundary
object’</title>
<p>Epigenetics has captured the attention of anthropologists, philosophers and
sociologists, because it has potential to bridge the traditionally opposed
concepts of ‘nature’ and ‘nurture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306312719866007">Guthman and Mansfield, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0306312719866007">Moore, 2017</xref>). By the
same token, many authors perceive epigenetics as a unique opportunity to bring
together researchers from long isolated disciplines into productive, joint
investigations at the intersection of biology and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0306312719866007">Meloni, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0306312719866007">Panofsky, 2015</xref>: 1106). According to
these authors, epigenetics should be seen as a ‘boundary object’ and serve as an
argument to promote interdisciplinary work and innovative forms of
‘co-laboration’. In other words, it should encourage researchers to acknowledge
the strengths and advantages of other research disciplines, and to recognize
limitations in the methods that they are most familiar with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0306312719866007">Niewöhner, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>On the one hand, epigenetics may serve as argument against gene-centric views of
human identity and health, often referred to as ‘genetic essentialism’ and/or
‘genetic determinism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306312719866007">Burbano, 2006</xref>: 861; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306312719866007">Canning, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306312719866007">Gonon and Moisan, 2013</xref>: 29; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0306312719866007">Kuzawa and Sweet, 2009</xref>:
11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0306312719866007">Lock, 2015</xref>: 152).
On the other hand, epigenetics may also serve as argument against controversial
claims that social and other environmental influences are more important for
individuality (e.g. personality, gender, health) than is biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306312719866007">Boniolo and Testa, 2012</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0306312719866007">Osborne, 2015</xref>).
Certain scholars propose the use of ‘co-productionist’ frameworks to provide
better accounts for the increasingly blurred line between ‘nature’ and
‘nurture’, and to bridge concepts and approaches that are seemingly
irreconcilable at first sight, such as positivist (or essentialist) and social
constructivist research methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0306312719866007">Klepfer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0306312719866007">Maller, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0306312719866007">Meloni, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0306312719866007">Meloni and Testa, 2014</xref>: 445).</p>
<p>For some authors, epigenetics represents a fertile ground for revisiting the
gene-centric ‘Modern Synthesis of Evolution’ (neo-Darwinism). According to these
authors, evolutionary theories should integrate higher levels of adaptation,
such as epigenetics, to theories of selection pressures. Rather than focusing
solely on competition for long-term survival between ‘selfish genes’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306312719866007">Dawkins, 1976</xref>), an
updated theory of evolution, consistent with epigenetics, should include
‘ecology-relevant’ accounts of heritability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306312719866007">Bossdorf et al., 2008</xref>). This would
include the role of altruism and cooperation between individuals organized in
society, such as the ‘prosocial view’ of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0306312719866007">Meloni, 2014</xref>: 594). In the
‘post-genomic era’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0306312719866007">Meloni,
2015</xref>: 129; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0306312719866007">Moore,
2017</xref>) the genome should be understood as ‘biosocial’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0306312719866007">Müller et al., 2017a</xref>),
and the gene, which had long been defined as a chemically stable, fixed entity,
should be reconceptualized as more ‘plastic’ and ‘reactive’ to its various
environments than originally depicted.</p>
<p>Although epigenetics may shed light onto the reductionism of gene-centric
theories, some authors are already concerned about the resurgence of Lamarckian
accounts of heritability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306312719866007">Gadjev, 2015</xref>). Indeed, it is important to acknowledge that so far,
there is only limited evidence of the transgenerational inheritance of a few
epigenetic variants in humans. This limits interpretations about the persistence
of acquired epigenetic traits across multiple generations. Additionally, there
are emerging concerns about new forms of determinism that may arise with
epigenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0306312719866007">Landecker and
Panofsky, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0306312719866007">Pickersgill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0306312719866007">Tolwinski, 2013</xref>). According to other
commentators, conceptualizing epigenetics as fundamentally ‘anti-determinist’ or
‘non-determinist’ could blind us to the potential rise of equally problematic
forms of ‘environmental determinism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0306312719866007">Landecker, 2010</xref>), or ‘epigenetic
determinism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0306312719866007">Mansfield and
Guthman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0306312719866007">Richardson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0306312719866007">Waggoner and Uller, 2015</xref>: 178).</p>

<title>Biologization: Epigenetics and the ‘molecularization of biography and
milieu’</title>
<p>The epistemic upheaval proposed by epigenetics seems to reside in a certain
valorization of the social, through a better understanding of its complex
interrelations with, and influences on, biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0306312719866007">Jablonka, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0306312719866007">Lerner and Overton, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0306312719866007">Meloni and Testa, 2014</xref>:
449). Following developments in this field, environmental and sociocultural
circumstances can be understood as external ‘signals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0306312719866007">Landecker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0306312719866007">Shields, 2017</xref>) which can be
‘mechanistically’ internalized into the body, thus actively producing long-term
biochemical changes and becoming an integral part of a person’s ‘epigenetic
history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306312719866007">Boniolo and Testa,
2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0306312719866007">Osborne,
2015</xref>). This ‘embodiment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0306312719866007">Thayer and Non, 2015</xref>) of a person’s
experiences and surroundings is conceptualized as the ‘molecularization of
biography and milieu’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0306312719866007">Niewöhner, 2011</xref>: 291).</p>
<p>According to some authors, the new ‘biologization’ of social space and time may
gain increasing traction. Eventually, it may become deeply integrated into
individual and social discourses and practices under a novel ‘somatic sociality’
based on knowledge about epigenetic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0306312719866007">Niewöhner, 2011</xref>: 292). On the one hand,
research in the field of epigenetics could contribute to the reconfiguration of
complex notions of social change and political movements into their
corresponding standardized, material metrics at the biological level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306312719866007">Chung et al., 2016</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306312719866007">Davis, 2014</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0306312719866007">Lloyd and Raikhel,
2018</xref>). Epigenetic markers could be mobilized by deprived individuals
or groups as proof of past exposure to unfair shares of social adversity, and as
an additional argument from the molecular level for greater social justice
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306312719866007">Jaarsma, 2017</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0306312719866007">Kuzawa and Sweet,
2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0306312719866007">Sullivan,
2013</xref>: 190–218).</p>
<p>On the other hand, there could be adverse effects from translating social
disparities into biological inequalities and reducing complex social problems to
molecular codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306312719866007">Blackman,
2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0306312719866007">Landecker

2017</xref>). As observed by a few authors, simplistic deterministic
thinking could be fueled, in the near future, by further evidence of (1)
associations between some epigenetic variants and genotypes, (2) the persistence
of epigenetic variants programmed during a child’s development, and (3) the
possible transmission of some epigenetic variants across generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0306312719866007">Mansfield, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0306312719866007">Stelmach and Nerlich,
2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0306312719866007">Waggoner
and Uller, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>As acknowledged by many scholars, we should learn from the history of biologizing
social phenomena (e.g. research in sociobiology) and remain cautious of its
potential pitfalls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0306312719866007">Müller
et al., 2017b</xref>). To prevent the resurgence of ‘somatic reductionism’
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0306312719866007">Lock, 2013</xref>) or
‘biological neo-reductionism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0306312719866007">Lock, 2015</xref>: 151), and to guide further
investigations in and of epigenetics, conceptual tools have been proposed, such
as ‘customary biology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0306312719866007">Niewöhner, 2011</xref>: 293–294), ‘localizing biology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0306312719866007">Niewöhner, 2015</xref>:
234–235) and ‘bio-objectification’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0306312719866007">Svalastog and Damjanovicova, 2015</xref>).
The notion of ‘<italic>bio</italic>habitus’, for example, is proposed as an
alternative to Bourdieu’s habitus, as it better accounts for the close
intertwining of social and biological capitals that recent research in social
epigenetics highlight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0306312719866007">Warin et al., 2015</xref>: 68–69). Such propositions may be related to the
rise of a larger conceptual framework, consistent with epigenetics, termed
‘embodied constructivism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0306312719866007">Meloni, 2015</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section13-0306312719866007">
<title>Public health: Epigenetics as an argument for better preventive public
policies</title>
<p>By allowing for a better mechanistic understanding of the developmental origins
of health and disease (DOHaD), epigenetics has been optimistically mobilized by
a number of authors to encourage policymakers towards using improved preventive
strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0306312719866007">Rial-Sebbag et
al., 2016</xref>). Environmental epigenetics, for instance, appears to some
commentators as instrumental in strengthening existing arguments in favor of
improved environmental policies and regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0306312719866007">Sagl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0306312719866007">Turker, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>By shedding light onto the close intertwining of the human body and its
surroundings, epigenetics has been described as presenting an opportunity to
question narrow, overly biomedical conceptions of the field of bioethics, to
expand its scope to environmental and public health concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306312719866007">Dupras et al., 2014</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0306312719866007">Vilas Boas Reis and
Torquato de Oliveira Naves, 2016</xref>). Borrowing from ecological
genetics, new techniques for analyzing epigenetic variations in populations may
help to gather the evidence needed to justify these changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306312719866007">Bäumen and Brand, 2010</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306312719866007">Bossdorf et al.,
2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Social epigenetics is also expected to provide new convincing arguments for
promoting social policies. For instance, it may demonstrate how early life
experiences can influence gene expression later in life, allowing for the
development of policies that could improve children’s future health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0306312719866007">McBride and Koehly,
2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0306312719866007">Park and
Kobor, 2015</xref>). Moreover, epigenetics may help to demonstrate the value
of social workers in public health, increasing the appreciation and funding of
the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312719866007">Combs-Orme,
2013</xref>). According to authors with these expectations, placing more
attention on the social determinants of health may help to prevent a wide
variety of health-related conditions, including anxiety and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0306312719866007">Lang et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>According to many authors, the potential heritability of some epigenetic variants
is increasing the stakes of these questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306312719866007">Drake and Liu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306312719866007">Kabasenche and Skinner,
2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0306312719866007">Vilas Boas
Reis and Torquato de Oliveira Naves, 2016</xref>). If epigenetic harm from
toxic exposures or social adversity is likely to also affect future generations,
then using preventive strategies may be more of an urgent priority than before.
The potential epigenetic inheritance of obesity-related diseases, for instance,
is now understood as a significant concern for public health in the light of
recent advances in epigenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0306312719866007">Niculescu, 2011</xref>). According to other
scholars, however, the significance of epigenetics to public health should not
be overstated, considering the still nascent state of the field. Additionally,
they argue that there is a current absence of compelling evidence of epigenetic
inheritance in humans and a high probability of confounding variables in
environmental and social epigenetics studies, and that there are important
meta-ethics questions relating to the degree of normative/prescriptive value
that should be granted to empirical findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306312719866007">Chung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0306312719866007">Huang and King, 2017</xref>;

<p>Scientific studies on the potential transmission of epigenetic risks from parent

<p>Many suggest, for instance, that assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) may
influence epigenetic programming in a way that affects the future health of the
children conceived. These studies raise important questions related to the
ethical tension between harm reduction in children and reproductive autonomy, as
ARTs can sometimes represent the only avenue for couples trying to conceive
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0306312719866007">Roy et al.,

now suggests that the genetic makeup and environment of a surrogate can
substantially impact gene expression in the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0306312719866007">Nicholson and Nicholson, 2016</xref>).
Consequently, some authors are worried that the ‘foregrounding of the maternal
body as an epigenetic vector’ could lead to increased manipulation and control
over the female body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0306312719866007">Richardson, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>A paucity of evidence on the implications of epigenetic modifications at
different points in the life cycle has compelled researchers to exercise caution
when making claims about emerging findings on DOHaD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306312719866007">Geronimus, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0306312719866007">Huang and King, 2017</xref>). Such concerns
are exacerbated by the challenges of translating findings from animal studies
into the implications for human reproduction. Specifically, some authors
expressed concerns that these studies are being inaccurately extrapolated to
human behavior in ways that reinforce existing sex stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0306312719866007">Kenney and Muller,
2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0306312719866007">Richardson,
2015</xref>). In fact, rat studies that examine maternal behavior and its
impact on their offspring are already being used to imply similar consequences
in human mother–child interactions. Moreover, by centering the discussions of
epigenetic programming on the mother’s body and behaviors, much of this research
largely ignores the role of fathers in terms of both inherited and child-rearing
epigenetic contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0306312719866007">Hens, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0306312719866007">Richardson, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Other scholars have nevertheless expressed optimism about new understandings of
the breadth of what can be considered ‘maternal exposure’. Taking into account
mothers’ lives <italic>prior</italic> to child-bearing, rather than focusing

<title>Political theory: Epigenetic perspectives on theories of justice and moral

<p>As mentioned, epigenetics has been used to show that the disproportionate
exposures of some groups to pollutants and/or social adversity can help explain
biological inequalities between persons, and possibly even between generations.
Moreover, it has been used as a tool to help claim that such unfair health
disparities could, and arguably should, be prevented through social policy.
These discussions have most often been framed, respectively, with the principles
of ‘environmental justice’ and ‘intergenerational equity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306312719866007">Butkus and Kolmes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0306312719866007">Rothstein et al.,

<p>Authors have consistently discussed the meaning of epigenetics for theories of
justice. For instance, some authors have questioned the traditional opposition
between Rawlsian approaches, focused solely on socially induced disparities in
life opportunities, and luck-egalitarian theories of justice, which also
consider innate/inherited biological inequalities that unfairly reduce life
opportunities immediately at birth. By shedding light on the ways that social
injustices are being embodied and even transferred to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306312719866007">Erwin, 2015</xref>: 670),
epigenetics would be blurring the line between the so-called ‘social lottery’
(i.e. socially induced endowments) and the ‘genetic lottery’ (i.e. biological
endowments). It would also, at the same time, blur the line between the two
abovementioned theories of justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0306312719866007">Lafaye, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0306312719866007">Loi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0306312719866007">Meloni, 2015</xref>).</p>

to a possible tension between collective and individual moral responsibilities

about to what extent, and under which circumstances, individuals have the
capacity to modulate their own and their child’s epigenetic risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306312719866007">Boniolo, 2013</xref>: 408).
However, many authors note the difficulty in determining with certainty
<italic>which</italic> epigenetic harms have been acquired or imposed on
others following voluntary actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306312719866007">Erwin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306312719866007">Gunter and Felthous, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0306312719866007">Niculescu, 2011</xref>: G23;

<p>Challenges also arise when attempting to identify ‘reference’ epigenomes and with
subsequently defining the ‘healthy’ epigenomes. In fact, it is not always easy
to distinguish between epigenetic variants that should be considered biological
disruptions leading to higher risks for some diseases, and those that are
advantageous biological adaptations to specific developmental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0306312719866007">Stapleton et al.,
2012</xref>: 135). Moreover, the variable stability and dynamism/reversibility
of diverse types of epigenetic modifications, in different cells and at
different periods of time, introduce additional difficulties in the attribution
of moral epigenetics responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306312719866007">Chadwick and O’Connor, 2013</xref>: 464; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306312719866007">Dupras and Ravitsky,

conundrum stemming from the meta-ethical question of whether it is possible to
harm someone who does not yet exist (i.e. preconception) – is also discussed as
a foreseeable limit to our duties toward the epigenetic health of future

<title>Legal proceedings: Epigenetic markers as evidence of causality in tort
law</title>
<p>According to some legal scholars, epigenetics research may affect legal
proceedings in the future, by providing additional evidentiary input into the
realm of civil liability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0306312719866007">Khan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0306312719866007">Turker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0306312719866007">Vandenbergh et al., 2017</xref>). ‘Tort law’ refers to situations where one
person’s ‘wrong’ causes another person’s loss or harm, resulting in legal
liability for the tortious act. This liability is calculated using three
components: act, injury and causation. Causation has been the most difficult
aspect to prove in the courtroom, where judges have generally been reluctant to
rely on population studies – which show statistically significant associations
between specific acts and observed injuries – as convincing evidence of
causation.</p>
<p>According to some authors, epigenetics may help to bridge this evidence gap by
providing information about the molecular mechanisms that link, for instance,
exposure to chemicals (e.g. pollutants, cosmetics, drugs) and the occurrence of
diseases. By so doing, epigenetic studies would be able to offer claimants
valuable complementary evidence of civil liability potentially admissible in
court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0306312719866007">Laubach,
2016</xref>). The ability to trace epigenetic harms directly back to their cause
presents new opportunities not only to provide compensation to victims of
environmental harms, but also in developing new regulatory schemes and policies
that better reflect our new understanding of the effects of toxins on the body
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0306312719866007">Turker, 2012</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0306312719866007">Vandenbergh et al.,

evidence of epigenetic harm due to negligent parenting could give rise to new
legal repercussions for preconception and periconception parental behaviors
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-0306312719866007">Wiener,
2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite overall optimism about the potential use of epigenetic evidence in toxic
torts, legal scholars recognize a number of barriers to its implementation
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0306312719866007">Khan, 2010</xref>).
First, the long latency period between the harmful act and the emergence of
symptoms from the harm may fall afoul of the statutes of limitations.
Additionally, lack of access to both the judicial system and the necessary
epigenetic evidence may impede vulnerable parties from making full use of these
innovations in tort law. Finally, the difficulty of quantifying epigenetic harm
with certainty will complicate the applications in the courtroom. All these
risks, however, may be mitigated by updating laws, regulations and policies to
recognize these new kinds of evidence, if necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0306312719866007">Khan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0306312719866007">Rothstein, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>So far, the potential implications of epigenetics for criminal law have not yet
received the same attention as for tort law, though this nevertheless is an area
where we can expect to see further implications unfold as the field progresses.
In advancing our understanding of the long-term neurological and psychological
impacts of trauma, for instance, epigenetic research may alter our understanding
of criminal responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306312719866007">Gunter and Felthous, 2015</xref>). In reconceptualizing conditions that
have been traditionally considered behavioral disorders (e.g. psychopathy,
sociopathy) as biological disorders caused by toxic exposures or adverse
experiences, or previous epigenetic harm, epigenetics could impact both criminal
risk prediction and the ways in which we punish, prevent and/or treat such
behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0306312719866007">Tamatea,

<title>Discrimination: Epigenetics as opportunity or risk for underserved
populations?</title>
<p>Some scholars have observed that epigenetic research may help us better
understand the biological pathways through which some of the negative effects of
unfair social structures and discrimination can persist over generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0306312719866007">Sullivan, 2013</xref>). For
instance, researchers suggest an epigenetic model of racial health disparities
with regard to the marked prevalence of premature birth and cardiovascular
illness among African-Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0306312719866007">Kuzawa and Sweet, 2009</xref>). This model has
been promoted as an opportunity for marginalized and underserved populations to
claim compensation for the harmful and long-lasting consequences of
disproportionate levels of toxic environmental exposures and social adversity
with which these communities battle.</p>
<p>New epigenetic understandings of social disparities, however, have led a few
authors to raise ethical issues inherent to making biological comparisons
between social groups. For instance, authors discuss the risks associated with
the reification of the idea that biological races exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0306312719866007">Pickersgill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0306312719866007">Saulnier and Dupras,
2017</xref>). Epigenetic research may offer new insights into the long-term
consequences of discriminatory attitudes, discourses, practices and/or social
structures on the biology and health of discriminated individuals and
populations. However, some fear that the emergence of reductionist and fatalist
views of embodiment could lead to increased ‘racialization’ and to the
interpretation that some vulnerable groups may be too epigenetically damaged to
be rescued through preventive public policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306312719866007">Katz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0306312719866007">Meloni, 2017</xref>). Heeding lessons from

stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306312719866007">Graham,

cautionary tone when measuring and discussing social disparities using
biological metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306312719866007">Guthman

<p>More specifically, research in epigenetics raises concerns regarding the
normalization of privileged bodies (e.g. measuring obesity based on norms seen
in white bodies). The potential for environmental epigenetics to allow the
measurement of biomarkers of social inequality in new ways underscores the
concerns raised across categories about the development of new measurements of
‘normality’. This could lead to preventive policies that target the health of
vulnerable populations in a form of ‘epi-eugenics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0306312719866007">Juengst et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly,
racialized populations, women, sexual minorities and socioeconomically
underprivileged individuals face the risk of more intense scrutiny and increased
blame for sociocultural practices or behaviors that deviate from the new
epigenetic norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306312719866007">Katz,

<p>Epigenetic evidence of the DOHaD is seen as promising for preventive public
policies. However, many fear that some of these policies may disproportionally

<title>Privacy protection: Adapting the degree of protection according to the risk
level</title>
<p>Some authors are concerned about the protection of privacy and confidentiality of
research participants involved in epigenetic research. Most of them associated
their concerns about privacy with the previously discussed issue of
discrimination, reflecting on their worry that epigenetic information, if not
treated with the necessary caution, could result in further stigmatization
and/or adverse differential treatment of groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306312719866007">Dyke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306312719866007">Erwin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0306312719866007">Terry, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0306312719866007">Thomas, 2015</xref>). In a
way, individual epigenetic data could prove to be even more ethically sensitive
than genetic data, considering that it can provide information not only about an
individual’s disease risk profile – and sometimes on the current disease status
– but also on the individual’s previous exposures and lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306312719866007">Backes et al.,

<p>Moreover, uncertainties persist about the applicability of epigenetics to
existing legal and normative frameworks that were designed to protect the
privacy of individual genetic information. It is unclear whether the differences
in biological properties between epigenetics and genetics necessitates new
ethical guidelines and legal frameworks, or whether already existing policies
could be sufficient or be adapted for the protection of individual epigenetic
data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0306312719866007">Rothstein,

cautionary in tone, there are disagreements regarding the level of protection of
epigenetic data required to protect the privacy of patients and/or research
participants.</p>
<p>Misconceptions about the identifiability of certain types of epigenetic
information may lead to an under- or overestimation of the associated privacy
risks. For instance, although it is commonly believed that the ‘inherent
temporal variability of microRNAs (miRNAs)’ protects the data from being tracked
and linked to an individual, a specific study found that miRNA expression
profiles in blood could in fact be matched to a specific individual with a
success rate of 90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306312719866007">Backes
et al., 2016</xref>). Reflecting on this same concern, another study showed
that certain sensitive information about research participants could be linked
to individuals using epigenetic datasets that were being shared online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0306312719866007">Philibert et al.,
2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Other authors, however, are concerned that overly restricting access to
epigenetic data, without appropriate assessments of the actual probabilities of
privacy breach (which may vary according to the specific dataset and context of
the study), could unreasonably hinder the progress of epigenetics research

should be commensurate with a fair evaluation of the risks. Epigenetic studies
on vulnerable populations, for instance, are generally thought to necessitate
special cautions, especially when the populations are associated with specific
geographical locations or ethnicities.</p>

responsibility in emerging problems related to knowledge transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306312719866007">Gonon and Moisan, 2013</xref>;

2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0306312719866007">Lappé,
2016</xref>). It thus appears important that scientists, health care
providers, governments and citizens engage with the new epigenetic knowledge
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306312719866007">Gesche, 2010</xref>),
and get involved in setting standards for adequate communication of epigenetic
information, for instance with patients and/or research participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306312719866007">Belrhomari, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0306312719866007">Rial-Sebbag et al.,

<p>Some authors also highlight the need to further investigate and address subtle
biases and barriers that may impede proper translation of scientific findings
into fair and effective health interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0306312719866007">Pickersgill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0306312719866007">2014</xref>). As such, the
subjective perspectives and different interests of stakeholders should be
acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0306312719866007">Sullivan,
2013</xref>). Among other types of possible influences, financial pressures
by private actors to commodify research findings and to commercialize clinical
applications of epigenetics could impede other types of translations of
epigenetics. For instance, they could impede collective preventive strategies
aimed at improving public health more directly by tackling environmental
injustices and social inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306312719866007">Dupras and Ravitsky, 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0306312719866007">Niewöhner, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article, we have provided a multidisciplinary landscape of the current
discussions about the ELSI of epigenetics. Aware of critics who have shed light on
the problems of narrow ELSI approaches, and inspired by more inclusive frameworks in
‘responsible research and innovation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306312719866007">Balmer et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306312719866007">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0306312719866007">Myskja et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-0306312719866007">Wickson and Carew, 2014</xref>), we chose to not
only place attention on consequentialist analyses traditionally included under the
umbrella of ELSI programs (e.g. framed by the four moral principles of respect for
autonomy, nonmalfeasance, beneficence and justice), but also to expand our analysis
to include hermeneutic analyses of foundational epistemic questions raised by
epigenetics in the post-genomic era (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306312719866007">Grunwald, 2017</xref>). We thus included, for
instance, discussions about the expected impact of epigenetics on the nature versus
nurture dualism, for their potential to influence interpretations of the meaning of
epigenetics for health and society.</p>
<p>In the same vein, we found it important to report all the potential
<italic>implications</italic> of the field, rather than focusing solely on
expected <italic>issues</italic>. This was to account not only for the potential
undesirable outcomes anticipated by some scholars, but also for enthusiastic
expectations towards epigenetics. This inclusion allowed us to characterize this
emerging field as a site of contestation, rich with a variety of disciplinary
perspectives and analytical approaches. We thus characterized nine recurrent ‘areas
of discussion’ and pointed to analyses in tension with one another, by different
authors arguing for different perspectives or positions between and within each of
these areas. In doing so, we revealed high heterogeneity in focus and interpretation
in this emerging field.</p>
<p>As we noted, early appraisals of the ELSI of epigenetics often led to analyses about
the opportunities this field may offer when contrasted with genetics, rather than
in-depth analyses of risks and tensions arising within the field. A rather simple
yet possible explanation for this could be that, at that time, discussions were
still in their infancy, and that it was too early for scholars to reflect on the
relevance, adequacy and pitfalls of previous interpretations of the implications of
epigenetics put forth by their peers. Another explanation, which we tend to lean
toward, is that the genetic era, and its exaggerated emphasis on the biological
sources of identity, behavior and health, had created some sort of vacuum for any
molecular-scale evidence that would reinvigorate the epistemic status of social
sciences and humanities. Paradoxically, social and political theories were
<italic>in need</italic> of biological support (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306312719866007">Dupras, 2017</xref>), in order to be able to
counterstrike ongoing geneticization and biomedicalization processes on the same
epistemic battlefield (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306312719866007">Dupras et al., 2016b</xref>); this is what epigenetics was finally
offering.</p>
<p>At first glance, epigenetics can appear as the perfect ‘anti-genetics’ instrument. As
many authors later noted, however, it may not be all so simple. Since 2013, we have
witnessed an increasingly sophisticated body of literature, with a growing number of
publications beginning to adopt a cautionary tone regarding scientific developments
in epigenetics and emerging claims about the field’s epistemological and normative
significance. The growing diversity in tone and analytical approach was observed not
only across publications and according to the main area of discussion of a paper,
but also, within publications themselves, sometimes with the same author(s) stating
both potential opportunities and risks associated with scientific developments in
epigenetics.</p>
<p>We would like to argue that the coexistence of descriptive, instrumental, dialectical
and reflexive analyses of the potential implications of a new scientific field or
biotechnology is a sign of sound interdisciplinary conversations. Instrumental
analyses of epigenetics have been portrayed as exaggerated and overly enthusiastic.
While this may sometimes be the case, we believe that instrumental analyses are
sometimes necessary to fill pre-existing gaps in scientific knowledge, and to
rectify related epistemic injustices that such gaps had created, affecting different
groups of stakeholders in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306312719866007">Dupras et al., 2017</xref>). Sometimes a vacuum
has built, and it must be filled. This is possibly what scholars claiming a
‘post-genomic’ era <italic>for</italic> the social sciences and humanities have been
attempting to achieve.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, new discussions have emerged, for example regarding when and
how scientifically valid and clinically actionable epigenetic information should be
communicated to patients or returned to research participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312719866007">Dyke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0306312719866007">Rial-Sebbag et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0306312719866007">Roy et al., 2017</xref>). In this
article, these recent concerns were categorized under the area of discussion
‘knowledge translation’. However, discussions in the future about such issues could
be categorized under another area specific to ‘communication and counseling’.
Indeed, a set of implications that was found to be largely absent from the reviewed
literature relates to questions about consent to epigenetic interventions or
research. This is surprising, considering the prominent place that has been granted
to the principle of respect for autonomy in genetics and in the bioethics literature
more generally over the past 50 years.</p>
<p>Such discussions could become more prevalent in the coming years, as the clinical and
public health utility of interventions building on epigenetic data are
scientifically validated, and as the field’s implications become recognized as
diverging in some regards and to some extent from those of genetics. It will be
interesting, for instance, to investigate further whether the content of consent
forms in epigenetics research should be adapted to account for the specificities of
epigenetic mechanisms and information. Recently, private companies such as
Yousurance<sup>TM</sup> (for life insurance underwritings) and
Chronomics<sup>TM</sup> (for recreational purposes) have started to advertise
and offer epigenetic tests directly to consumers online. It remains to be seen
whether these companies are offering adequate support to their consumers to promote
free and informed consent when they decide to undergo these tests. Potential
(mis)use of the results of epigenetics tests by both private companies (e.g.
insurance) and public agencies (e.g. forensics, immigration) will also deserve close
ethical and legal scrutiny in the coming years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306312719866007">Dupras et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>It should appear evident following this review that it is the multidisciplinary
nature of the emerging ELSI literature that is at the source of a rich and nuanced
body of discussion around the significance of epigenetics for health and society.
These discussions can be sometimes portrayed as conflictual oppositions between
authors from different epistemological standpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0306312719866007">Panofsky, 2015</xref>), and with different sorts
of relationships with normativity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306312719866007">Chiapperino, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0306312719866007">Huang and King, 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, we
argue that it is the cumulated effect of descriptive, instrumental, dialectical and
reflexive analyses of the potential implications of science and technology which
ultimately produces sophistication in this new and exciting field of study at the
crossroads of epigenetics, ethics, law and society.</p>
<p>Of course, it is crucial to keep in mind that the current epigenetics ELSI literature
is mostly anticipatory and speculative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0306312719866007">Juengst et al., 2014</xref>). With further
developments in epigenetics, it will be important to validate or invalidate the
different hypothetical scenarios with more empirical evidence from both biological
and social sciences. Interdisciplinary studies that recognize the coexistence of
distinct analytical approaches and celebrate their complementary contributions to
the richness of social sciences and humanities will be key to assessing and
addressing the ELSI of epigenetics in the coming years.</p>
