<abstract>
<p>It is well-known that hyaluronic acid (HA) as a component of brain extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a pivotal role in the nervous system and is involved in synaptic plasticity changes in vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. HA breakdown is a feature of the acute stage of stroke injury and may be detrimental through enhancement of the inflammatory response. Recent studies have shown that knockout mice lacking hyaluronic acid synthetase demonstrates epileptic phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic> and removal of HA leads to delayed development of epileptiform activity in cultured hippocampal neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here, we studied whether digestion of hyaluronic acid in the hippocampus in early postnatal period can trigger seizures. Hyaluronidase (Hyal) (5 U/μl) was bilaterally injected into C57BL/6j mice (P17) CA1 field of hippocampus using the stereotaxic method to remove hyaluronan-based ECM. Transcriptome analysis of hippocampal tissue 2 h after enzymatic digestion of hyaluronan-based brain ECM revealed increased gene expression of proteins involved in inflammation reactions (TLR2, CCL2,3,5), neuroinflammation, axonal guidance and ephrin receptor signaling, versus the vehicle group. Mice injected with hyaluronidase exhibited delayed audiogenic seizures and improvement in working memory 72 h after injection, while there were no changes in locomotor activity, anxious level and exploratory behavior due to the open field test. The obtained results point to a link between the activation of neuroinflammation by enzymatic digestion of hyaluronan-based brain ECM during the neonatal period and their subsequent reactivity to seizures, which may play an important role in the functional features of the developing brain, including its seizure propensity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Brain extracellular matrix (ECM) is a multicomponent complex. Members of the lectican family, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) such as neurocan, brevican, versican, and aggrecan with tenascins are anchored on hyaluronic acid (HA) backbone. HA is a unique non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan. It has a lot of physiological and biochemical properties including providing biomechanical integrity, altering tissue hydration and facilitating tissue assembly which are dependent on its size, concentration, and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">George and Geller, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Hyaluronic acid is distributed throughout the ECM but the highest density of HA is detected around neuronal bodies and myelinated fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Perkins et al., 2017</xref>). ECM in the brain has two main states: (1) diffuse ECM, which is represented throughout the brain, and (2) densely packed matrix, forming so-called perineural networks (PNNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">George and Geller, 2018</xref>). In the adult brain, PNNs generally surround parvalbumin-expressing GABA-ergic neurons by forming a lattice structure around synapses on the body and proximal dendrites, which may affect the development and stabilization of synapses in neonatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">McRae et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, depending on the proteoglycan component, PNNs prevent the formation of new synaptic connections by inhibiting axonal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Ueno et al., 2019</xref>). There is evidence that PNNs can also protect neurons from oxidative stress and glutamate-stimulated excitotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Ueno et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The formation of PNNs is a long activity-dependent process. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that formation of PNNs requires the activity of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors and L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-VDCC). During the period from the second to the third week after birth, the expression of crucial molecules of immature ECM such as tenascin-C and neurocan decreases, whereas expression of CSPGs such as aggrecan, brevican, versican V2, phosphacan, as well as tenascin-R and hyaluronan-binding protein Hapln1, are increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Song and Dityatev, 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Rowlands et al. (2018)</xref> recently found that mice with knock-out of a gene responsible for aggrecan synthesis (<italic>Acan</italic>) has a significantly lower level of aggrecan, as well as phosphacan, neurocan, brevican, versican, and tenascin-R together with the reduced density of PNNs. This finding points to the crucial role of aggrecan in the formation of functional perineuronal nets.</p>
<p>Hyaluronic acid plays a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity during vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Dityatev et al., 2009</xref>). Extracellular remodeling is a common response to different types of injuries and diseases. Upregulation of HA synthases (Has1 and 2) and hyaluronidases (Hyal1 and 2) in the cells from both stroke and peri-infarcted regions of the brain were demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Sherman et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies have shown that knockout mice lacking hyaluronic acid synthase demonstrates epileptic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Arranz et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>For most types of epilepsy, it is unknown how the hippocampus becomes hyperexcitable and how hyperexcitable cells integrate into a pathological circuit, resulting in the generation of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Subsequent transcriptional and translation alterations can induce changes in neuronal circuits, which predispose to development of seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Assessing the role of particular genes and pathways through the analysis of genome-wide gene expression is a promising tool to identify key trigger genes or pathways of epileptogenesis and other neurologic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Younus and Reddy, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Previously, we have found that enzymatic digestion of hyaluronic acid by exogenous enzyme Hyal leads to the delayed development of epileptiform activity in cultured hippocampal neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Vedunova et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we performed behavioral tests to identify seizure-like activity following Hyal intrahippocampal injections in C57BL/6j mice (P17). The ability for learning was assessed with a fear conditioning test. Open field exploratory test was used to estimate locomotor activity, anxiety and exploratory behavior. Transcriptome analysis of hippocampal tissue was carried out 2 h after enzymatic digestion of hyaluronan-based brain ECM to reveal changes in gene expression of different proteins. Immunohistochemical staining with anti-aggrecan antibodies was carried out to assess the integrity of PNNs.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="S2.SS1">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Animals were housed in a specific pathogen-free animal facility at 20 ± 2°C with 60% humidity, a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle, and <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and tap water until the surgery procedures. Animals were transferred into animal cages after surgery and maintained at the same environment with their male-littermates for 2–9 days. All experiments were carried out with an effort to minimize the number of animals used and the suffering caused by study procedures.</p>
<sec id="S2.SS1.SSS1">
<title>Ethics Statement</title>
<p>All animals were treated in strict accordance with ethical animal research standards defined by the Russian law and approved by the Ethical Committee on Animal Health and Care of Lobachevsky State University and Privolzhsky Research Medical University of the Nizhny Novgorod.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS1.SSS2">
<title>Hyaluronidase Injection</title>
<p>17-day-old C57BL/6J mice were divided among two groups: hyaluronidase-treated (Hyal) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) treated (Vehicle). Animals were deeply anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane and the scalp was incised. For hyaluronidase injection, a 1 mm diameter portion of the skull was removed with a drill bit at stereotactic coordinates −2.06 mm anterio–posterior, 1.89 mm medio-lateral relative to bregma. 1.25 mm diameter glass capillary with open tip 5–10 μm diameter were used for injections. The glass capillary tip was placed 1.8 mm dorso-ventral to the skull surface. The speed of the liquid flow was maintained at 3–4 nl/s. The coordinates of the injection were calculated individually for each animal based on the ratio of the distance between bregma and lambda from those mentioned above. Animals in the experimental group (Hyal) were injected with 1 μl of Hyaluronidase from bovine testis (Sigma) diluted in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 5 U/μl. Animals in vehicle group were injected with equal volume of 0.1 M PBS.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS2">
<title>Behavioral Tests</title>
<p>All the behavioral tests (<italic>n</italic> = 10/group) were carried out on second and third days after hyaluronidase injection.</p>
<sec id="S2.SS2.SSS1">
<title>Open Field Exploration Test</title>
<p>Mouse was placed in an open field chamber or arena (PanLab, Spain) and allowed to explore freely for 5 min. The locomotor activity (such as mean and max speed and traveled distance) in the whole arena was monitored and analyzed by an automated system (Smart v.3.0, PanLab, Spain). The distance traveled and the time spent in different parts of the arena (center and periphery) were estimated in a same way.</p>
<p>Anxiety (the duration of rearing and grooming in both compartments) was made in open field test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS2.SSS2">
<title>Passive Avoidance Test</title>
<p>The short-term memory of experimental animals was evaluated by Passive Avoidance test (PanLab, Spain). The Passive Avoidance test is a behavioral model of conditioned reflex, consisting of the stages of training and reproduction of the reflex. The equipment was “Shuttle Box” divided into a dark and light compartment. Assessment of acquisition and retention of the passive avoidance task was carried out using identical illuminated and non-illuminated compartments containing a 50 W bulb. In brief, the animals underwent two separate trials: an acquisition trial and a retention trial, conducted 24 h after the acquisition trial. For the acquisition trial, the mouse was initially placed in the light compartment; the door between the two compartments was opened. When the mouse entered the dark compartment, the door automatically closed and an electrical foot shock (0.5 mA, 3 s) was delivered through the grid floor. The time before entering the dark room (latency) was registered. For the retention trial, the mice were placed in the light compartment as well as in acquisition trial and the time taken to enter the dark compartment was recorded again. If the mouse did not enter the dark compartment within 180 s, it was assumed that the mouse remembered the foot shock from the acquisition trial. The difference in time spent by an animal before entering dark chamber during retention and acquisition trials (delta time) was calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS2.SSS3">
<title>Audiogenic Stimulus Assay</title>
<p>The animals were placed individually in the chamber (a glass cylinder 15 cm diameter, 25 cm height and video camera were placed a sound-proofing box) and were habituated for 5 min. Audiogenic stimulus was performed by a bell sound (100 dB) inside of box∼15 cm above the test subject. The stimulus lasted 60 s or until tonic-clonic seizure was observed visually. The behavior of the animal was recorded in three categories: wild running, tonic-clonic seizures, and death. If an animal displays the single wild run bout and stopped, thus displaying the low intensity fit score (Krushinsky–Molodkina, or KM, arbitrary unit “1”). The last stage of seizures goes through wild run which is followed first by clonic and then by tonic/clonic and tonic “full” seizure with extension of extremities and death (KM arbitrary unit “6”).</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<sec id="S2.SS3.SSS1">
<title>Staining</title>
<p>The animals were transcardially perfused with 0.1 M PBS (pH = 7.4) at 2 h, 2 and 3 days after surgery, and subsequently followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were then removed and fixed overnight in PFA, washed in PBS and dehydrated through a series of graded ethanol baths, and then infiltrated with paraffin; infiltrated tissues were embedded into paraffin blocks. Sections from paraffin blocks 5 um thick were made with semi-automated rotary microtome (Leica Biosystems, Germany). Every third slice was placed on an adhesive slide and dried. Paraffin sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, treated with antigen retrieval buffer and washed in tris-buffered saline (TBS) (pH = 7.4). Permeabilization were made with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma 93443-100ML) solution in TBS and was followed by blocking in 10% fetal cow serum (FCS), 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS for 2 h. After that, sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. The next day, sections were incubated with the appropriate species-specific fluoroconjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 647 and Alexa Fluor 488; 1:400; Abcam) for 1 h. Primary antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal anti Aggrecan (ab36861; 1:100; Abcam), and chicken polyclonal anti NeuN as a neuronal marker (266006; 1:100; Synaptic Systems). The secondary antibody was goat polyclonal secondary antibody to rabbit IgG – H&amp;L (Alexa Fluor<sup>®</sup> 488) (ab150077; 1:400; Abcam) and goat polyclonal secondary antibody to chicken IgY – H&amp;L (Alexa Fluor<sup>®</sup> 647) (ab150171; 1:400; Abcam). Stained sections were mounted using Fluoroshield Mounting Medium with DAPI (ab104139, Abcam) and examined by fluorescence microscopy using a ZEISS LSM 880. Images were acquired controlling for equal exposure times using Zen 2.1 SP3 software. 1.2 Pl-Apo objective, pinhole 0.8 μm. Data from three channels (DAPI 405, Alexa Fluor 488, and Alexa Fluor 647) were collected by sequential scanning. Single confocal planes were analyzed to determine co-localization of signals in tissue sections.</p>
<p>We assessed the fluorescence intensity of anti-aggrecan antibody to assess the integrity of PNNs in four 212.5 × 212.5 μm fields of view from each slice. The average cell area and average area of extracellular space was also estimated using ImageJ. <italic>N</italic> = 3 animals/group, three slices from each animal.</p>

<sec id="S2.SS4">
<title>RNA Extraction</title>
<p>For RNA extractions, hippocampi were dissected on ice 2 h after injections and immediately frozen via liquid nitrogen with subsequent transfer into −80°C freezer.</p>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from hippocampi of animals from both Hyal and Vehicle groups. RNA extraction was performed with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, United States). A NanoDrop<sup>®</sup> NP-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, United States) was used to measure the quantity of the RNA samples. The quality of the RNA samples was checked using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, United States), RNA integrity of each sample was assessed using ratio of 18S/28S RNA and RNA integrity number (RIN).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS5">
<title>Agilent Microarray Analysis</title>
<p>The synthesis of cDNA followed by the synthesis of cRNA with fluorescent labels was performed using the Agilent Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, United States). 3-CTP or 5-CTP nucleotides with fluorescent labels (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, United States) were used for detection.</p>
<p>After determining the concentration of cRNA and evaluating the efficiency of fluorescent labels incorporating, the samples (750 ng each) were mixed in one tube and fragmented using reagents from the <italic>in situ</italic> Hybridization kit-plus kit (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, United States). After the end of fragmentation, 500 μl of the mixture was applied to Sure Print G3 Mouse Gene Expression v2 8 K× 60K Microarray Kit (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, United States) expression chips. These microchips contain 60,000 of 60 nucleotide probes immobilized on a glass and designed to analyze gene expression of the complete mouse genome (annotated genes with known and unknown function) in a given volume. Hybridization was performed in a rotary incubator (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, United States) at 65°C for 17 h. The chips were washed in an SSC buffer with the addition of Triton X102 according to the protocol of the manufacturer, then chips were scanned on a G2505B confocal laser scanner (Agilent) with a resolution of 10 μm. Extraction of DNA chip data and their primary processing were performed using the Feature Extraction 9.1 (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, United States) program.</p>
<p>The background signal was calculated and the fluorescence intensity in the red and green channels was calculated for each sample (spot). After determining the background signal level, all genes which are not expressed both in the Vehicle and Hyal samples were excluded from further analysis. Finally, the degree of difference in the signal of certain genes in different samples was evaluated (Vehicle, <italic>n</italic> = 4; Hyal, <italic>n</italic> = 4).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS6">
<title>Microarray Analysis</title>
<p>A microarray analysis was performed using BRB-ArrayTools<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote1">1</xref></sup> to identify probe intensity values developed by Dr. Richard Simon and the BRB-ArrayTools Development Team that were significantly affected by hyaluronan digestion. Intra-array LOWESS normalizations were performed. The BRB-ArrayTools “Random Variance Model” option was used.</p>
<p>To identify the direct effect of hyaluronidase injection we compare Vehicle and Hyal groups. For this analysis two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test were used and <italic>q</italic>-value was 0.05 this resulted in 25 genes passed this filter (0.089%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2.SS7">
<title>Pathway Analysis</title>
<p>Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA, Qiagen, Valencia, CA, United States) was used to perform “Core Analysis” to discover biological pathways that were significantly affected by hyaluronidase treatment. Data from microarray analysis were first uploaded into Qiagen’s IPA system for core analysis and then overlaid with the global molecular network in the Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge Base (IPKB).</p>
<p>Ingenuity pathway analysis was performed to identify canonical pathways, functions, upstream regulators that are most significant to microarray outcomes and to categorize differentially expressed genes in pathways and upstream regulators.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Epilepsy is a most common neurological disorder all around the world. There are a lot of people suffering secondary epilepsy after brain infections or non-infectious (sterile) inflammatory response, traumatic brain injury or brain tumors (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Lowenstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Vezzani et al., 2016</xref>). There is a large amount of mechanisms leading to seizure appearance and lots of it needs further investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Klein et al., 2018</xref>). The reasons for seizure occurrence in early postnatal development is the less studied subject in the field.</p>
<p>Brain ECM was shown to affect the maturation of central nervous system during early developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">McRae et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Ueno et al., 2019</xref>). We assumed that the destruction of ECM molecules during the early postnatal period may lead to the occurrence of some pathological states. Indeed, it was shown that 40 and 50% of animals after bilateral intrahippocampal hyaluronidase injections at the 48 and 72 h time points, respectively, exhibited seizures. The mechanism of epileptogenesis after ECM digestion during early development is not known so we decided to make a full transcriptomic analysis to unveil the possible pathways and detect target molecules for a further correction. Our transcriptomic analysis with further analysis of interacting genes/proteins revealed activation of a number of genes implicated in inflammatory responses (as far as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway was activated) in the Hyal group. Enzymatic digestion of hyaluronan produces a lot of low molecular weight fragments (&lt;500 kDa), which can trigger an inflammatory response. During the inflammation, chemokines such as CCL2, CCL3, and CCL 5 can activate pathways leading to status epilepticus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Arisi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Cerri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Tian et al., 2017</xref>). In the current study, transcriptomic analysis showed the activation of the chemokine pathway due to upregulation of TLR2. Activation of TLR2 by short fragments of hyaluronan and disruption of CD44 can induce an inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>). Signals from these receptors can be transmitted through NF-κB transcription factor upregulating the expression of chemokines (CCL2,3,4,5,7,10,12, CXCL 1,10), which can act through ERK<sub>1</sub><sub>,</sub><sub>2</sub> enhancing the production of TNF and activating CREB1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bose and Cho, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Cekanaviciute and Buckwalter, 2016</xref>). Activation of CREB and glial-mediated production of TNF-α may led to enhancing the release of glutamate. Imbalance of glutamate production can cause excitotoxicity and seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Li and Ransohoff, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Vezzani et al., 2016</xref>). These findings coincide with the opinion that at least 40% of all epilepsies have structural or metabolic causes as a consequence of diverse brain injuries and the most common risk is inflammation during infections and sterile inflammation during stroke and autoimmune encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Vezzani et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>However, animals in the Hyal group didn’t show any differences in locomotor activity and anxiety level. This finding correlates with the previously made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Hosseini et al. (2018)</xref> where the overexpression of inflammatory factors didn’t affect the activity of animals in open field test, although the chronic inflammation can lead to a memory loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, we demonstrate that hyaluronidase-treated animals showed elicited ability for learning. At the time point of 48 h after surgery, 90% of animals in Hyal group learnt aversive stimuli versus 60% of animals in Vehicle group. The percentage of animals that learnt the task 72 h after surgery was 100 and 70, respectively, although Mann–Whitney test revealed the significant difference in delta time only at the 72 h time point. According to transcriptome analysis, this memory improvement might be due to an activation of <italic>BCL3</italic> and <italic>IRF1</italic> genes directly interacting with CREB, which is tightly connected with long-term potentiation and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Silva et al., 1998</xref>). Facilitation of working memory can also be explained by the fact that ECM modification leads to the formation of a new structural and functional connections between neurons, changes the ratio of inhibitory and excitatory neurons leading to changes of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Morellini et al., 2010</xref>). It had also been shown that some matrix proteins have a particular importance for the behavior, spatial, and contextual memory. For example, decreased expression of reelin is a common characteristic among neurological and mental disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Ferrer-Ferrer and Dityatev, 2018</xref>), and knock-out mice lacking aggrecan demonstrated improvement in memory in spontaneous object recognition test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Rowlands et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>There are pathways activated after several types of cerebral insults, which are associated with epileptogenesis or epilepsy progression such as Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) and mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex (mTORC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Klein et al., 2018</xref>). These signaling pathways mediate cellular physiological mechanisms that are critical for memory formation, long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP). The JAK/STAT pathway is activated after many types of epileptogenic injuries in experimental models, including TBI, SE and stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Satriotomo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Lund et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). It regulates expression of genes critical for multiple essential functions including cell proliferation, differentiation, neurogenesis, learning and memory. We found the elevation in <italic>NFKBIZ</italic>, <italic>IRF1</italic>, and <italic>BCL3</italic> genes, which tightly interact with members of the JAK/STAT pathway. Structural or dysplastic lesions associated with infantile spasms in rodents or humans also demonstrate overactivation of the mTORC1 pathway in the epileptogenic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Galanopoulou et al., 2012</xref>). We found an upregulation of TNF, which is involved in this pathway and TLR2, TNFAIP3, and CD14, which directly interact with other members of mTORC1 signaling pathways.</p>
<p>Brain tumors are the other pathological process that can cause seizures. One of the factors which contribute to peritumoral seizures is glioma-released glutamate, which presumably acts through chronic overactivation of neuronal glutamate receptors enhancing the excitatory drive in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Buckingham et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Yuen et al., 2012</xref>). A recent study demonstrates that seizures can appear as a result of the loss of fast-spiking interneurons concomitant with a significantly reduced firing rate of those that remain due to the degradation of PNNs that surround fast-spiking interneurons, resulting in alterations of its membrane capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Tewari et al., 2018</xref>). It also should be noted that treatment with a GM6001, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of MMPs, leads to retention of the PNN’s structure and, most importantly, membrane properties of FSNs in GM6001-treated mice were essentially identical to the control group. The alteration of membrane capacities may also contribute to epileptogenesis after hyaluronidase injections.</p>
<p>There is an idea that seizures appearing in mice with ECM deficiency are linked with the reduction of ECS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Arranz et al., 2014</xref>). However, our immunohistochemical analysis didn’t reveal any significant differences in ECS area and in average neuronal body area at all time points, which means that seizures appeared after digestion of HA during postnatal stages were not a result of changes in osmotic parameters of cell environment.</p>
<p>Brain ECM is known to play a pivotal role in the functioning of the nervous system, especially during ontogenesis, but some of mechanisms by which it regulates neuronal activity are still hidden from the scientist’s eye. Therefore, our study provides new insight into the mechanisms of epilepsy development in early postnatal period, showing the role of hyaluronic acid in the stabilization of morphology and neural network activity. These mechanisms can become potential targets for the correction of seizures during early postnatal development. Proteomic analysis is needed to reveal the precise mechanism of epileptogenesis in neonatal animals after ECM digestion. It also remains unknown how long the hyperexcitable state of the brain is preserved after hyaluronan digestion.</p>
