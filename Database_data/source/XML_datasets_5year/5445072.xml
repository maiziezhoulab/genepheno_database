<abstract id="Abs1">
<p>The human growth hormone (<italic>hGH</italic>) minigene used for transgene stabilization in mice has been recently identified to be locally expressed in the tissues where transgenes are active and associated with phenotypic alterations. Here we extend these findings by analyzing the effect of the hGH minigene in TgC6hp55 transgenic mice which express the human TNFR1 under the control of the mesenchymal cell-specific CollagenVI promoter. These mice displayed a fully penetrant phenotype characterized by growth enhancement accompanied by perturbations in metabolic, skeletal, histological and other physiological parameters. Notably, this phenotype was independent of TNF-TNFR1 signaling since the genetic ablation of either <italic>Tnf</italic> or <italic>Tradd</italic> did not rescue the phenotype. Further analyses showed that the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene was expressed in several tissues, also leading to increased hGH protein levels in the serum. Pharmacological blockade of GH signaling prevented the development of the phenotype. Our results indicate that the unplanned expression of the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene in CollagenVI expressing mesenchymal cells can lead through local and/or systemic mechanisms to enhanced somatic growth followed by a plethora of primary and/or secondary effects such as hyperphagia, hypermetabolism, disturbed glucose homeostasis, altered hematological parameters, increased bone formation and lipid accumulation in metabolically critical tissues.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Early during the development of transgenic technologies in mice it was realized that homologous and heterologous intronic sequences and polyadenylation signals are essential for the stabilization and efficient expression of the transgene of interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. It was in the early 1990s when scientists, for this exact purpose, started using the so-called <italic>hGH</italic> minigene which consists of the entire human growth hormone coding region, including introns and a polyadenylation signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. At that time and for many years afterwards, it was believed that since the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene was the second cistron in the transgene-encoded mRNA, it would not be expressed. Therefore this technique was widely used in the generation of new transgenic lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, especially in mice designed to express the Cre-recombinase. The number of mice that carry the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene nowadays exceeds 200<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> (indicatively, only the different pancreatic β-cell specific transgenic mice are at least 22 as reported by Brouwers <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>However, during the last years there has been an increasing number of publications reporting the expression of this minigene with subsequent effects on the mouse phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. For example the expression of the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene specifically in the pancreatic β-cells of the mouse negatively affects β-cell physiology as well as glucose and insulin homoeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Additionally, the expression of the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene in the mouse brain (either in the hypothalamus or in the pituitary) leads to growth defects and metabolic deregulations through its interaction with the endogenous GHRH-GH-IGF1 axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The finding that hGH can bind to and activate both the mouse GH receptor and the mouse prolactin receptor (PRLR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> adds another level of complexity in the effects of the unplanned <italic>hGH</italic> minigene expression.</p>
<p>Unfortunately though, in the vast majority of the 200 transgenic mice mentioned above, the authors did not examine whether the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene was expressed, and if they did, they did not examine whether the produced hGH was functional<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the publications that described the production and functionality of the hGH (coming from the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene) examined only the local effects at the tissue-site of expression and did not assess the possible systemic effects of circulating hGH occurring through less predictable mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Therefore, the ‘safety’ and/or suitability of using mice containing this specific minigene is still debatable since only now we have started discovering the pitfalls related with this technique which has been in use for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>We have previously shown that TNF signaling through its receptor 1 (TNFR1) in the mesenchyme is sufficient to drive pathogenesis in mouse models of Rheumatoid Arthritis and Crohn’s-like Inflammatory Bowel Disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. From the two receptors of TNF, named TNFR1 and TNFR2, human TNFR1 can recognize mouse TNF and vice versa, while this is not the case for TNFR2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In order to study the role of TNF-TNFR1 signaling in the mesenchyme in a humanized background, we generated the TgC6hp55 transgenic mice which, additionally to the mouse <italic>Tnfr1</italic>, express the human TNFR1 specifically in the mesenchymal compartment under the control of the Col6a1 (simply CollagenVI or ColVI) promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. It has been previously shown in transgenic embryos that the CollagenVI promoter is active in mesenchymal cells in many different tissues like skin insertions of the superficial aponeurosis, joints, nerves, intervertebral discs, vibrissae, skeletal muscle, meninges, tendons, subepidermal mesenchyme, heart, blood vessels, adipose tissue, cartilage, central nervous system and retina (ectopic expression), while there are some hints for expression in other tissues like lungs, intestine, kidney, periosteum, perichondrium, serosae, bladder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here we show that the expression of the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene in the CollagenVI expressing mesenchymal cells in various tissues can lead to previously undescribed alterations in mouse physiology. The extensive phenotypic characterization of the transgenic mice TgC6hp55 discovered no signs of spontaneous inflammation and/or autoimmunity but revealed a variety of perturbations in many different aspects of their physiology including somatic growth, skeletal characteristics, as well as histological alterations in the liver and adipose tissue that suggested enhanced lipid storage. Many findings resemble effects of transgenic systemic growth hormone overexpression. Our molecular analysis uncovered the expression of the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene in different tissues and our pharmacological experiments confirmed the causal relation between the produced hGH and the observed phenotype. Our findings describe for the first time the plethora of local and/or systemic effects that the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene can have when expressed in the mesenchymal compartment.</p>

<title>Generation of the TgC6hp55 transgenic mice and assessment of transgene expression</title>
<p>For the generation of the TgC6hp55 mice, a 1.5 kb fragment encompassing the <italic>hTNFR1</italic> coding DNA sequence (CDS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> was inserted downstream of the 7.5 kb 5′-flanking region of the <italic>CollagenVI</italic>(<italic>a1</italic>) promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, followed by a 2.1 kb <italic>hGH</italic> minigene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A</xref>). Transgenic integration was confirmed by PCR analysis. One male mouse that was found to carry the transgene was used for the establishment of the TgC6hp55 mouse line (Founder 1) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1B</xref>). Next, following the same procedure, we generated a second mouse carrying the same transgene (Founder 2). The mouse lines were backcrossed to a C57BL/6J background for more than 8 generations. Q-PCR analysis of the transgene copy number showed the insertion of 2 copies into the mouse genome of the first founder and of 14 copies into the mouse genome of the second founder. Despite the difference in copy number between the two founders, the two transgenic mouse lines exhibited exactly the same body weight, suggesting that the difference in copy number does not have a different effect on the gross phenotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1C</xref>). Therefore, in order to avoid extra complications due to the increased copy number described in the second founder, we focused our main analysis to the first founder.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>TgC6hp55 mice express the human TNFR1 under the CollagenVI promoter and show increased body size. <bold>(A)</bold> The construct used for the generation of the TgC6hp55 mice. <bold>(B)</bold> Macroscopic comparison of male and female transgenic mice versus their wild type littermates at the age of 3 months. <bold>(C)</bold> Comparison of the body weights of the two founders and the transgenic mice coming from them.

</p>
<p>Q-PCR analysis in different tissues of the TgC6hp55 mice confirmed human TNFR1 expression from the transgene. High expression levels were found in skeletal muscle and spleen, followed by lower levels of expression in abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) and heart, expression at detection levels in lung, kidney, brown adipose tissue (BAT), brain, ileum and colon and no expression (or expression below detection levels) in the liver (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1D</xref>). Skeletal muscle, heart and intestine are typical sites of CollagenVI expression, while lung, kidney, liver, brain and adipose tissue have also been reported to express CollagenVI in some cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. As for the spleen, although it is not regarded as a typical CollagenVI expressing tissue, we have recently shown that there are cells in the spleen that express CollagenVI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore the expression pattern of the transgene is in agreement with the mesenchymal expression of CollagenVI in different tissues.</p>

<title>TgC6hp55 transgenic mice show enhanced somatic growth accompanied by alterations in various parameters of their physiology</title>
<p>The phenotypic characterization of the TgC6hp55 mice in collaboration with the German Mouse Clinic (GMC) included macroscopic examination as well as examination regarding bone/skeletal morphology, hematological and biochemical blood parameters, immunology, neurology, nociception, allergies, cardiovascular system and eye morphology/function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. (The phenotyping pipeline used is described in detail in the Materials and Methods section).</p>
<p>TgC6hp55 mice showed by 3 weeks of age an increased body weight as compared to their wild type littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2A</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>) and an increased body length as assessed in three different time points (1 month, 3 months and 11 months old) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2B</xref>). MicroCT analysis of the right femur showed that TgC6hp55 mice also had increased bone length (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2C and D</xref>). At the same time points, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2E</xref>, most of the organs from the transgenic mice were heavier than their controls’. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2F</xref>, the normalized weights of these organs did not differ significantly from their controls’, indicating a generally enhanced somatic growth. Only white adipose tissue’s (WAT) normalized weight was increased in the transgenic mice hinting towards an additional obesity-like phenotype. A whole body composition analysis at the age of 13 weeks (also repeated at 19 weeks) using quantitative Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (qNMR) showed an increase in both lean and fat mass in the transgenic mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). When normalized according to total body weight, the fat mass was found to be increased in the TgC6hp55 mice while the lean mass slightly decreased (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). Analysis using linear regression analysis of the fat tissue mass weight in correlation to body weight (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2G</xref>) according to Packard and Boardman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> confirmed that the normalized total fat tissue weight in the TgC6hp55 mice is bigger than in wt.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>TgC6hp55 mice show enhanced somatic growth with some additional obesity-like characteristics. <bold>(A)</bold> Body weight curve performed in wt (n = 10) and TgC6hp55 (n = 10) mice coming from Founder 1 from the age of 3 weeks till the age of 72 weeks. <bold>(B)</bold> Comparison of the body length of wt and TgC6hp55 mice at the age of 1, 3 and 11 months.

</p>
<p>A 2-days indirect calorimetry analysis including monitoring of food uptake revealed that TgC6hp55 mice are both hyperphagic (increased energy uptake) and hypermetabolic (increased energy expenditure) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>) with their total daily energy surplus (daily energy uptake of metabolizable energy minus daily energy expenditure) being positive and increased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3A</xref>). Additionally, examination of the glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity using an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipGTT) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3B</xref>), an intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (ipITT) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3C</xref>) and a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp [including glucose infusion rate (GINF) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3D</xref>) and insulin sensitive suppression of endogenous hepatic glucose production (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3E</xref>)] revealed that the TgC6hp55 mice were insulin resistant. Nevertheless, they stayed normoglycemic under steady-state conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3F</xref>) due to the hyperinsulinemia they were exhibiting accompanied by an enhanced glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3G</xref>) which both resulted in normal glucose uptake from the skeletal muscle and the WAT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3H</xref>). This enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion can also explain the decreased blood glucose levels observed in the TgC6hp55 mice during the ipGTT shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3B</xref>. Finally, the 2-days indirect calorimetry uncovered an interesting increase in carbohydrate utilization by the transgenic mice during the night (the time when nocturnal animals like mice have increased energy demands), while lipid oxidation was unaffected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3I</xref>). In agreement to the above described metabolic characteristics of the TgC6hp55 mice, histological analysis detected a progressive lipid accumulation in the liver of the TgC6hp55 mice which developed into a moderate macrovesicular hepatic steatosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4A</xref>) accompanied by decreased hepatic glycogen storage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4B</xref>) as well as increased white adipocyte size (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4C</xref>). Furthermore and in correlation with these findings, gene expression analyses performed in the liver of the TgC6hp55 mice revealed the regulation of genes functionally associated with metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins, metabolic diseases like obesity and inflammatory processes (GSE95345).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>TgC6hp55 mice show increased energy surplus and are normoglycemic despite perturbed insulin sensitivity. <bold>(A)</bold> Comparison of the daily energy surplus between wt and TgC6hp55 mice (n = 15 wt and 11 TgC6hp55). <bold>(B)</bold> Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (ipGTT) performed in wt (n = 16) and TgC6hp55 (n = 13) mice. <italic>p</italic> value represents the comparison between the Area Under the Curve for the wt versus TgC6hp55 mice. <bold>(C)</bold> Intraperitoneal Insulin Tolerance Test (ipITT) performed in wt (n = 16) and TgC6hp55 (n = 13) mice. <italic>p</italic> value represents the comparison between the Area Under the Curve for the wt versus TgC6hp55 mice. <bold>(D)</bold> Comparison of the Glucose Infusion Rate needed in order to retain euglycemia in the mice during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (n = 7 wt and 6 TgC6hp55 mice). <bold>(E)</bold> Comparison of the Insulin-Sensitive Suppression of the Endogenous Hepatic Glucose Production during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in n = 8 wt and n = 7 TgC6hp55 mice. <bold>(F)</bold> Blood glucose levels during the basal period of the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. <bold>(G)</bold> Measurement of the Glucose Stimulated Insulin Secretion during the ipGTT shown in Fig. 3C.

<title>The phenotype of the TgC6hp55 mice is TNF-, TNFR1- and transgene insertion-independent</title>
<p>To examine how the incorporation of the CollagenVI promoter-driven hTNFRI transgene in the genome led to the above-described phenotype first we aimed to verify that this phenotype depends upon TNF/TNFR1 signaling. For this purpose we crossed TgC6hp55 mice with mice in which either TNF (<italic>Tnf</italic>

<sup><italic>D/D</italic></sup> mice, TRADD which is a major component of most of the signaling cascades downstream TNFR1 (including apoptosis and NFkB activation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> is missing, so after the activation of (mouse or human) TNFR1, these downstream signaling cascades cannot be activated.</p>
<p>To our surprise, both TgC6hp55<italic>Tnf</italic>

Additionally, their normalized, as a % of body weight, organ weights didn’t show any major differences apart from normalized WAT weight that was still increased (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>). Finally, in the histological examination, they displayed lipid infiltrations in their liver and increased adipocyte size in their WAT (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>).

<p>Another scenario we had to take into consideration was that of a transgene insertion locus effect. Using the Targeted Locus Amplification technique (TLA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, we managed to identify the single insertion site of the transgene to be located in Chromosome 10 and specifically in the area Chr10:77533719-77533707. Additionally, the insertion was found to interrupt the genes of Icoslg and Dnmt3l that lie adjacent to this region by deleting some of their exons and therefore, in order to verify that the insertion of the transgene in the specific position and the local disturbances it caused to the native DNA were not the cause of the TgC6hp55 phenotype, we generated a second founder (as described previously). This founder also exhibited the same phenotype of increased body size as the first founder (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S8</xref>), confirming that the TgC6hp55 phenotype is not secondary to an insertion effect.</p>

<title>The <italic>hGH</italic> minigene is expressed in the TgC6hp55 mice leading to local and systemic hGH production and downregulation of endogenous GH</title>
<p>Since there seemed to be no other possible explanation for the TgCh6p55 phenotype, we decided to investigate whether the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene was expressed. Indeed the hGH protein was detected in the serum of TgC6hp55 mice at levels of around 1.6 ng/mL as assessed by ELISA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6A</xref>). Analysis with qPCR in different tissues detected high levels of the <italic>hGH</italic> mRNA in the brain (both in the whole brain and in the pituitary and the hypothalamus) and also expression in the heart and the skeletal muscle. The rest of the tissues tested (lung, kidney, spleen, WAT, BAT, ileum and colon) showed very low expression levels of hGH while no expression was detected in the liver (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6B</xref>). As explained before, the skeletal muscle and the heart are two tissues were the CollagenVI promoter is expected to be active while its expression, especially the ectopic expression in the brain, has also been described in the rest of the tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. These results indicate that the expression of our <italic>hGH</italic> minigene is controlled by the CollagenVI promoter. The fact that the expression pattern of the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene is not identical with that of the TNFR1 could be explained by the potentially differential regulation of the hTNFR1 and hGH RNAs in the different tissues. For example while hTNFR1 RNA is known to be minimally regulated at the mRNA stability level, evidence suggests that hGH mRNA follows more complex patterns of regulation e.g. in brain tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Detection of the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene expression in the TgC6hp55 mice. <bold>(A)</bold> Detection of the human growth hormone in the serum of TgC6hp55 mice using ELISA (n = 10 wt and n = 10 TgC6hp55 mice). <bold>(B)</bold> Q-PCR analysis for the detection of the <italic>hGH</italic> mRNA in different tissues of 3 TgC6hp55 mice.

<title>Pharmacological inhibition of the GH signaling reverses most of the TgC6hp55 phenotypic characteristics</title>
<p>To examine whether hGH expression is causally involved in the development of the TgC6hp55 phenotype, we used a growth hormone receptor antagonist (pegvisomant or PegV), an antibody which pharmacologically inhibits the growth hormone signaling by binding to the GH receptor and blocking the binding of the GH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Initially, we separated the mice into 4 different groups: wt mice treated with PegV (wt+PegV), wt mice treated with saline (wt+saline), TgC6hp55 mice treated with PegV (TgC6hp55+PegV) and TgC6hp55 mice treated with saline (TgC6hp55+saline). Starting at 20 days of age (just before the TgC6hp55 mice begin to show a difference in body weight), the mice were injected 3 times per week following a preventive administration scheme. In order to validate the effectiveness of Pegvisomant in blocking GH signaling we measured the levels of serum IGF-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> in all 4 groups. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7A</xref>, both groups treated with PegV showed a decrease in the circulating levels of IGF-1, confirming its effectiveness. After the 4-weeks treatment, the TgC6hp55+PegV mice were similar to the wt+saline mice in terms of body weight and body length and were significantly smaller than the TgC6hp55+saline mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7B,C</xref>). As for the raw and normalized organ weights (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7D,E</xref>), the results were not conclusive, since some organs (like liver or lungs) did not grow as much after the PegV treatment as compared to the saline treatment, while others (like WAT) did grow more. Probably at that early age at which we examined the mice the differences are yet not so big and also the treatment might need a longer duration in order to affect organ size substantially. However we cannot exclude the small probability that the effectiveness of PegV and/or some hGH-independent parts of the TgC6hp55 phenotype could be attributed to other mechanisms like the activation of the prolactin receptor or the expression and action of the TNFR1 transgene or some complex insertion effects. Finally, GH inhibition in the TgC6hp55+PegV mice prevented the increased hepatocyte lipid storage in their livers which appeared completely normal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7F</xref>). In the WAT, the adipocytes of these mice, despite being bigger than the ones of the wt+saline group, they were significantly smaller than those of the TgC6hp55+saline group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7G,H</xref>). Collectively all these data confirm that the development of the main phenotypic characteristics of the TgC6hp55 mice are prevented by the blockade of growth hormone signaling, indicating that the hGH is a key player in the development of the TgC6hp55 phenotype.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Pharmacological inhibition of the GH signaling reverses most of the TgC6hp55 phenotypic characteristics. 4 groups of mice: 8 wt received saline, 8 wt received pegvisomant (PegV), 8 TgC6hp55 received saline and 8 TgC6hp55 received PegV. <bold>(A)</bold> Serum levels of Igf-1 in all 4 groups. <bold>(B)</bold> Body weight curve. *Represent comparison between TgC6hp55+saline versus TgC6hp55+PegV. <bold>(C)</bold> Body length comparison. <bold>(D)</bold> Comparison of liver, abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT), lung (both lungs), kidney (both kidneys) and spleen weight among 4 groups. <bold>(E)</bold> Comparison of the normalized organ weights from (7D) expressed as % of the mouse body weight. <bold>(F)</bold> Histopathological assessment of the lipid accumulation in the livers of all 4 groups (H/E staining). <bold>(G)</bold> Histopathological comparison of the adipocyte size from the abdominal white adipose tissue of all 4 groups (H/E staining). <bold>(H)</bold> Quantification of the adipocyte size shown in Fig. 7F.

</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is well known that GH can act both locally in an autocrine/paracrine way and systemically either directly or indirectly through IGF-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Therefore we used the circulating IGF-1 levels as an indicator of the possible systemic effects of the hGH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. As shown again in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7A</xref>, the transgenic mice had the same levels of serum IGF-1 as their wt controls. This finding means that the circulating hGH is effective either independently of the liver-produced IGF-1 or through local production and action in different tissues or both.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although this is not the first time that the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene has been found to be expressed in a transgenic mouse line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, in this work we provide original evidence for the effects of this expression when it is driven by the mesenchymal CollagenVI promoter.

</p>
<p>In some of the studies referred in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>, local expression of the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene in the mouse pituitary and hypothalamus led to decreased somatic growth due to downregulation of the endogenous mouse Gh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, while in the rest, where the minigene was not expressed in the brain, no alterations in body size were found<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. An important issue not clarified in most of these studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> is whether the locally produced hGH makes its way into the circulation or not. The 2 studies that looked into this issue did not detect any hGH in the circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Interestingly though, the TgC6hp55 mice exhibited increased body size with unchanged systemic Igf-1 levels, in spite of an almost 50% downregulation of the endogenous Gh. This phenotype could be attributed either to the local or to the systemic effects of the hGH or both. On the one hand, it has been shown that GH can act both locally and systemically without affecting the serum Igf-1 levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. On the other hand, locally produced GH, even if it accesses the circulation, may still exhibit no systemic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Most of the tissues examined in the TgC6hp55 mice scored positive for hGH expression, which suggests local activity. Additionally, the circulating levels of hGH appear not high enough to increase systemic Igf-1 levels, but they still seem to drive systemic effects as for example in the liver where hGH is not locally produced. Therefore, the most probable explanation in the TgC6hp55 mice is that hGH acts mainly locally with some extra effects being attributed to its systemic action. Of course all these hypotheses would be interesting to be further addressed in the future.</p>
<p>Another interesting characteristic of the TgC6hp55 mice which we studied and described thoroughly is the perturbed insulin sensitivity and carbohydrate metabolism. Transgenic mice expressing the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene have also exhibited analogous effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, these mice were expressing the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene in the pancreatic islets or specifically in β-cells, making it much easier for the hGH to directly interact in an autocrine/paracrine way with the insulin production. Moreover, it is known that hGH can bind to and activate also the prolactin receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and therefore mimic the effects of lactogens on mouse β-cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In correlation with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, we also found increased serotonin expression in the pancreatic islets of the TgC6hp55 mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S9</xref>). Since serotonin is used as a marker of prolactin receptor stimulation in the pancreas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, this finding suggests that at least in the pancreas of the TgC6hp55 mice hGH binds to and activates the prolactin receptor. Therefore some of the effects described regarding the carbohydrate metabolism could be explained by this mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, the activation of the prolactin receptor by the hGH could also explain some other phenotypic characteristics of the TgC6hp55 mice such as hepatomegaly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, while it is contradictory to other findings in these mice like the increased bone mineral density and the increased adipose tissue mass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. However, the fact that the pharmacological blockade of the growth hormone receptor reversed most of the main phenotypic characteristics of the TgC6hp55 mice (enhanced somatic growth, hepatic steatosis, increased adipocyte size etc.), suggests that the major actions of the hGH in mediating the TgC6hp55 phenotype are through this receptor, while the activation of the prolactin receptor plays a more secondary role. Nevertheless, it would be interesting in future studies to address this question in more detail.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the TgC6hp55 mice also exhibited an interesting phenotype of increased food intake in conjunction with increased metabolic rate and a preference in mobilizing carbohydrates in order to cover their increased energy demands during night, that has not been previously described in correlation with the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene.</p>
<p>The <italic>hGH</italic> minigene-expressing transgenic mice with a reduced endogenous Gh production and a reduction in body growth described above<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> also show perturbations in lipid metabolism (increased triglycerides, increased adipose tissue mass, liver steatosis and deregulated genes that take part in lipid metabolism) similar to our findings, despite the increased body size of the TgC6hp55 mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. However, the same features have been previously described in the context of insulin resistance and/or obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, like in the transgenic mice overexpressing bovine GH in their central nervous system causing hyperphagia-induced obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. This mechanism of hyperphagia-induced obesity could explain the findings of increased adipose tissue mass in the TgC6hp55 mice and it could present a new secondary ‘side-effect’ of the <italic>hGH</italic> minigene expression in the brain. Of course we cannot exclude an additional effect of the locally (even in very small amounts) produced hGH on WAT, since the existing literature regarding such an issue is still debating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Finally, the rest of the alterations observed in the skeletal, biochemical and hematological examination of the TgC6hp55 mice have also never been described before in conjunction with the hGH minigene expression.</p>
<p>Altogether the results from our analysis show that the unplanned expression of the hGH minigene, if/when it happens and depending on the context in which it acts, can have a plethora of effects that are or are not always restricted to the specific tissue of expression. More specifically, we have shown that the local expression of this minigene in the CollagenVI expressing mesenchymal cells can affect various aspects of the mouse physiology not only locally but also systemically. However, we cannot safely distinguish which of the phenotypic characteristics described in the TgC6hp55 mice can primary be attributed to the hGH minigene expression and which are secondary to the generally enhanced growth. The results of our study along with other recent studies underline that it is crucial for all using the hGH minigene in our mouse models to examine if it is expressed or not and the possible effects it might have to the described phenotypes, as the lack of visible growth changes does not necessarily mean that the minigene is not expressed. Finally, it would be important to examine these mice more systemically and to not only focus locally because, as we have shown in the present work, the ‘side-effects’ of the hGH minigene expression might not always be confined to a local level.</p>

<title>Generation of TgC6hp55 transgenic mice</title>
<p>The procedure for the generation of the TgC6hp55 mice has been described in the Results section. Pronuclear injection of the transgene into fertilized (C57BL/6JXCBA/J)F2 oocytes was performed in the BSRC Alexander Fleming Transgenesis Facility. The CollagenVI(a1) promoter was kindly provided by G. Bressan (University of Padova, Padova, Italy)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The hTNFR1 CDS was kindly provided by D. Wallach (The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The hGH minigene was kindly provided by R. Perlmutter (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Washington, Washington, USA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. For the genotyping of the mice, the primers that we used were: Forward: AGGAAATGGGTCAGGTGGAG and Reverse: CTCAATCTGGGGTAGGCACA. The conditions of the PCR were as following: annealing for 30 seconds at 66 °C declining by 1 °C per cycle until 57 °C and then at 57 °C for 30 more cycles; elongation for 1 minute at 72 °C.

<title>Copy number calculation</title>
<p>For the calculation of the number of copies that were inserted into the genome of each founder and his ancestors we isolated genomic tail DNA using phenol:chlorophorm extraction. All the samples were diluted to a final concentration of 12, 5 ng/μl and 2 μl from each sample were used in each reaction. For the multiplication of the transgene we used primers that detect the exon 3 of the hTNFR1 while MAP3K8 was used as a reference gene for normalization. Finally, the human <italic>p55</italic> knock-in mouse was used as a control that contains 2 copies of the human p55<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. The primer sequences were: hTNFR1 exon3F: 5′-TAC AAT GAC TGT CCA GGC CCG-3′, hTNFR1 exon3R: 5′-GCA TTT GGA GCA GCT GAG GC-3′, MAP3K8F: 5-TCC AGG CCT GTT TCC GGC-3′, MAP3K8R: 5′-CCT CCC TCG CCG GCT TCC-3′. The Q-PCR conditions were: annealing at 59 °C for 30 sec, elongation at 72 °C for 30 sec. The reactions were performed using the Quantitect Real-time PCR kit from Qiagen (Cato No. 204143).</p>

<p>After the mice were sacrificed, the tissues of interest (heart, lung, kidney, spleen, liver, muscle, brain, ileum, colon, abdominal white adipose tissue, interscapular brown adipose tissue, testis, pituitary and hypothalamus) were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The total RNA was isolated and DNAse treated using the Absolutely RNA Miniprep Kit from Agilent Technologies (Cat. No. 400800). Reverse transcription was performed using the M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase from Promega (Cat. No. M1705). Samples were normalized to B2M (B2M F: 5′-TTC TGG TGC TTG TCT CAC TGA-3′; B2M R: 5′-CAG TAT GTT CGG CTT CCC ATT C-3′). The primers for hTNFR1 were purchased from Qiagen (QT00216993).

<title>ipGTT</title>
<p>Mice were used for the glucose tolerance test after a 16–18 hours-lasting overnight food-withdrawal. In the beginning of the test, the body weight of mice was determined. For the determination of the fasting blood glucose level, the tip of the tail was scored using a sterilized scalpel blade and a small drop of blood was analyzed with the Accu-Chek Aviva glucose analyzer (Roche/Mannheim). Thereafter mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2 g of glucose/kg body weight using a 20% glucose solution, a 25-gauge needle and a 1-ml syringe. 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes after glucose injection, additional blood samples (one drop each) were collected and used to determine blood glucose levels and insulin levels (30, 60 min) as described before. Repeated bleeding was induced by removing the clot from the first incision and massaging the tail of the mouse. After the experiment was finished, mice were placed in a cage with plentiful supply of water and food<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Insulin levels were determined by ELISA (Mercodia, Sweden).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec20">
<title>Insulin tolerance test</title>
<p>The insulin tolerance test was conducted in the early afternoon after 6 hours food deprivation that began in the early morning. Insulin (0.7 U per kg body mass) was injected intraperitoneally after measurement of baseline blood glucose from blood samples taken from the tail vein. Further blood samples were taken 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after injection. Glucose levels were determined using a handheld glucometer (ACCU CHECK Aviva, Roche Diagnostics/Mannheim, Germany).</p>

<sec id="Sec21">
<title>Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp</title>
<p>As a preparatory step, a permanent jugular vein catheter was implanted in anesthetized experimental mice 6–7 days before the clamp study. For the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, mice were food deprived for 6 hours beginning in the early morning. Mice were unrestrained and conscious during the procedure but placed in oversized rat restrainers and warmed by warming pads. To administer solutions catheters were connected to syringes in CMA402 pumps (Axel Semrau, Sprockhoevel, Germany). After 110 minutes of primed-continuous [3-<sup>3</sup>H] glucose infusion (1.85 kBq/min), a blood sample was collected to determine plasma insulin, glucose and [3-<sup>3</sup>H] glucose concentrations to calculate basal endogenous glucose production. Thereafter, a [3-<sup>3</sup>H] glucose infusion (3.7 kBq/min) containing insulin (15 pmol·kg<sup>−1</sup>·min<sup>−1</sup>; HumulinR, Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) begun. Blood glucose concentrations were monitored in intervals of 10 minutes. Target glycemia was achieved by adjusting glucose infusion rates. 120 minutes after beginning of the experiment, 2-[<sup>14</sup>C] deoxyglucose (370 kBq) was injected intravenously to assess rates of tissue specific glucose uptake. After conclusion of the experiment, mice were euthanized by intravenously injected overdose of ketamine/xylazine. Mice were dissected, tissues were collected, immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Blood was also collected at culling and plasma <sup>3</sup>H and <sup>14</sup>C radioactivity was determined in deproteinized plasma before and after <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O evaporation to estimate glycolysis rates. In hepatic lysates 2-[<sup>14</sup>C] deoxyglucose-6-phosphate was separated from 2-[<sup>14</sup>C] deoxyglucose via ion-exchange columns (Poly-Prep AG1-X8, Bio-Rad, Germany). Glucose uptake rates were calculated by multiplying mean plasma glucose between 120 and 140 min (mmol/ml) by 2-[<sup>14</sup>C] deoxyglucose tissue content (dpm/100 g tissue), divided by 2-[<sup>14</sup>C] deoxyglucose plasma AUC in the same period of time. Source of radioisotopes: Perkin Elmer; samples were measured in Ultima-Gold scintillation cocktail (Tri-Carb2910TR, Perkin-Elmer, Weissenstein, Germany). Whole body glucose disposal (M value) was calculated from the tracer infusion rate, specific activity of [3-<sup>3</sup>H] glucose and body weight.</p>

<title>Indirect calorimetry</title>
<p>A 48-hours indirect calorimetry trial was conducted in single caged mice having free access to food and water (32-cages PhenoMaster with activity &amp; drinking/feeding monitoring, TSE Systems GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany). Four data points were collected per hour (oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, respiratory exchange ratio, metabolic rate) resulting in a total of 192 data points. From gas exchange data we calculated oxidation rates of carbohydrates and lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In parallel to energy expenditure, food consumption was carefully monitored. Food consumption was converted into metabolizable energy uptake using a factor of 13.047 kJ per gram food (Altromin 1324, Altromin, Lage, Germany) that was determined before the indirect calorimetry trial based on bomb calorimetric combustion of diet and feces samples.</p>

<title>FACS Analysis of Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL)</title>
<p>PBLs were isolated from the cell pellet of 500 μl whole blood samples after centrifugation. The cell pellet is dissolved in 600 μl NH4Cl-based, Tris-buffered erythrocyte lysis solution, and 150 μl transferred into 96-well micro titer plates. After subsequent washing steps with FACS staining buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.02%sodium azide, pH 7.45), PBLs were incubated for 20 min with Fc block (clone 2.4G2, PharMingen, San Diego, USA). Cells were then stained with fluorescence-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (PharMingen). After the antibody incubation, propidium iodide was added for the identification of dying/dead cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, which might bind antibodies unspecifically, and/or loose specific antigens upon apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Samples were acquired from 96 well plates and measured in one of our two threelaser 10-color flow cytometers (LSRII, Becton Dickinson, USA; Gallios, Beckman Coulter, USA). A total number of 10.000–30.000 living CD45+ per sample is reached. For analysis, intact cells are first identified by their FSC/SSC profile. These cells were gated on the basis of their propidium iodide/PE signal (compensated parameters), allowing the dead cells to be gated out. Living cells were then gated using their SSC/CD45 signal, gating out remaining erythrocytes, thrombocytes and debris<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.

<p>The IHC was performed using the streptavidin-peroxidase method with an automated immunostainer (DiscoveryXT; Roche, Penzberg, Germany) in paraffin-embedded tissue. After heat-induced antigen retrieval with EDTA (pH 8), we used the primary antibody anti-serotonin (5-HT) ABIN617893 from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.antibodies-online.com/antibody/617893/anti-5-Hydroxytryptamine">https://www.antibodies-online.com/antibody/617893/anti-5-Hydroxytryptamine</ext-link> in a dilution 1:100. We repeated the procedure two times with an appropriate positive control (neuroendocrine cells in murine gut) and a negative control (without the primary antibody) to confirm the specificity of the staining. Secondary antibody and blocking against nonspecific binding was performed according to antibody information. DAB and hematoxylin as contrast were used for visualization of the reaction peptide-hormone-antibody. Cytoplasmic staining was considered a positive reaction.
