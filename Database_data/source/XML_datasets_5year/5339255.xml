<abstract>
<p>Much effort has been devoted to assess disease risk based on large-scale protein-protein network and genotype-phenotype associations. However, the challenge of risk prediction for complex diseases remains unaddressed. Here, we propose a framework to quantify the risk based on a Voronoi tessellation network analysis, taking into account the disease association scores of both genes and variants. By integrating ClinVar, SNPnexus, and DISEASES databases, we introduce a gene-variant map that is based on the pairwise disease-associated gene-variant scores. This map is clustered using Voronoi tessellation and network analysis with a threshold obtained from fitting the background Voronoi cell density distribution. We define the relative risk of disease that is inferred from the scores of the data points within the related clusters on the gene-variant map. We identify autoimmune-associated clusters that may interact at the system-level. The proposed framework can be used to determine the clusters that are specific to a subtype or contribute to multiple subtypes of complex diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Rapid advances in exome sequencing technology combined with the development of novel genomic annotation approaches in the last two decades have provided important vistas for assessing the risk of complex disorders (McCarthy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2008</xref>; Majewski and Pastinen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2011</xref>). Understanding the genotype-phenotype interactions <italic>via</italic> genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and large-scale protein-protein network and functional pathways, has been the focus of much research in risk assessment (Leiserson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2013</xref>; van der Sijde et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">2014</xref>). Complex diseases, however, are tightly associated with rare variants, often with a low minor allele frequency but high-penetrance (Fearnhead et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2005</xref>; Bodmer and Bonilla, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2008</xref>; Manolio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2009</xref>), which challenges the current GWAS, focusing on common variants (Satake et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2009</xref>; Jia et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2010</xref>). Understanding the combinatory effects of variants on complex disorders and the interactions between them are critical in disease risk modeling (Okser et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2013</xref>). Therefore, the inclusion of both common and rare variants in the network, based on their association with the disease, is essential to modeling and quantifying the risk of complex disorders.</p>
<p>Several network and systems biology approaches have recently been developed to infer the risk of disease based on the integration of genome-wide expression data (Parikshak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2015</xref>), identification of disease-causative variants <italic>via</italic> large-scale genome-wide analysis (Krawczyk et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2010</xref>; Gratten et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2014</xref>), mapping protein-protein interaction information (Rual et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2005</xref>; Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">2012</xref>), statistical inference on the connectivity between molecular nodes (Goh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2007</xref>; Gilman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2012</xref>; Chang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2015</xref>), and functional annotation using pathway databases (Parikshak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2013</xref>). Such databases include Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genome Elements (KEGG) (Ogata et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">1999</xref>; Kanehisa and Goto, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2000</xref>) and Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2000</xref>). However, these approaches mainly deal with network analysis at the gene level without specifically considering the disease-associated scores of variants in clustering or risk assessment.</p>
<p>On the gene level, complex diseases are affected by various perturbations in the genetic architecture that integrates the functional pathways and interactions between genes (Carter et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2013</xref>). Substantial efforts have been made to identify critical genes clusters as the potential causes of disease development. These include predicting protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and subnetworks using Markov cluster algorithm (Rual et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2005</xref>; Stelzl et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">2005</xref>; Sun et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">2011</xref>), or using background network based on the likelihood of genetic interactions and phenotype association to identify functional clusters associated with disease-related <italic>de novo</italic> CNVs (Gilman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2012</xref>). However, integrative approaches that incorporate the contribution of both genes and variants to infer disease risk quantitatively are still lacking.</p>
<p>In an attempt to develop such an approach, we integrated databases of disease-associated genes and variants scores and applied the well-established method of Voronoi tessellation in the Euclidean coordinate for clustering and network analysis (Ebeling and Wiedenmann, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">1993</xref>; Ramella et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2001</xref>; Edla and Jana, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2011</xref>). Given a set of data points, a Voronoi diagram is a partition of the space into cells, where a cell corresponding to a given data point is a locus of all points of space closest to this data point. Voronoi tessellation is commonly used in various fields of natural and medical sciences (Okabe et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2000</xref>; Aurenhammer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1993</xref>; Ebeling and Wiedenmann, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">1993</xref>; Ramella et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2001</xref>; Dupanloup et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2002</xref>; Wieland et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">2007</xref>; Bishnu and Bhattacherjee, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2009</xref>; Kao et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2010</xref>; Edla and Jana, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2011</xref>), and in geographic information systems to define the partition cell, or catchment areas containing individual sites by their influence (Okabe et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in using Voronoi-based clustering for biological data. For instance, Edla et al. (Edla and Jana, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2011</xref>) presented Voronoi clustering algorithms that filtered the Voronoi neighbors of biological data points based on the distance between neighbors. Bishnu (Bishnu and Bhattacherjee, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2009</xref>) used Voronoi tessellation to cluster centroids following initial clustering <italic>via K</italic>-means method. Ramella et al. (Ebeling and Wiedenmann, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">1993</xref>; Ramella et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2001</xref>) determined the threshold of clustering for biological data by using Kiang distribution fitted to the background Voronoi cell density distribution. Building on the previous literature, in this study, we propose a framework to quantitatively infer disease risk based on the clusters identified by Voronoi tessellation and network analysis of a score-based gene-variant map.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>To develop our quantitative method, we parsed distinct databases and integrated the information necessary for clustering based on genes and variants scores. To identify the clusters, we applied Voronoi tessellation network analyses, which have been widely used for data aggregation and clustering (Wieland et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">2007</xref>; Balcan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2009</xref>). Here we propose the relative risk using a Voronoi network algorithm that identifies disease-associated clusters containing genes, whose Voronoi cell densities were above a certain threshold, obtained from the Chi-square distribution fitted to the background data.</p>
<sec>
<title>Integration of databases on genes and variants</title>
<p>The disease associated information of variants was obtained from the integration of various databases. These databases contained information on the clinical relevance of the variants from ClinVarFullRelease_00-latest.xml file in ClinVar<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0001"><sup>1</sup></xref><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0002"><sup>2</sup></xref>, and the functional scores of the variants from SNPnexus (Chelala et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2009</xref>; Dayem et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2013</xref>). The xml file from ClinVar was parsed <italic>via</italic> customized scripts using ElementTree in open source software Python<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0003"><sup>3</sup></xref>. The phenotypes for each variant were obtained from “Trait/Name” under “TraitSet” from the ClinVar database, including the preferred or alternative disease descriptions with various degrees of association for the variants (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>, Supplementary Information). We used rsID from dbSNP<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0004"><sup>4</sup></xref> as the identifier to extract the disease terms for the variants from ClinVar, SIFT, Polyphen scores, and the genes associated with the variants from SNPNexus (Chelala et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2009</xref>; Dayem et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2013</xref>). A higher score of 1-SIFT or Polyphen suggests a higher damaging effect of the variants (Chelala et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2009</xref>; Dayem et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2013</xref>). Due to the possibility of multiple variations at some variant loci, we compared various methods to integrate the variant scores for a particular locus, specifically using 1-SIFT or Polyphen scores in combination with the range or the mean score for each variant locus. The gene-variant map with the mean score was applied in the Voronoi-based network analysis to obtain autoimmune associated clusters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Supplementary Information).</p>

<p>The disease terms for subtypes of autoimmune were obtained from the American Autoimmune Related Disease Association (AARDA)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0005"><sup>5</sup></xref>, and the autoimmune diseases fact sheet<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0006"><sup>6</sup></xref>, while some were manually curated from the ClinVar<sup>1,2</sup> and DISEASES (Pletscher-Frankild et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2015</xref>) databases. The scores for variants were normalized as the ratio of the sum of the disease-related scores of variants for each chosen gene, divided by the sum of the scores for all variants of the gene. The gene scores were normalized by their maximum scores, which were derived from a single database, i.e., DISEASES (Pletscher-Frankild et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2015</xref>). We performed the analysis using open source software Python<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>We selected 1,383 autoimmune associated genes with Z-scores from the DISEASES database, based on the disease terms of autoimmune and subtypes (Supplementary Information) (Pletscher-Frankild et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2015</xref>). A total of 1,037 variants with descriptive terms associated with autoimmune from ClinVar<sup>1, 2</sup> were selected (Supplementary Information). The integrated database contains 85 genes, in which the gene and variant scores reflect the degree of association with autoimmune (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>, Supplementary Information).</p>

<title>Voronoi tessellation and voronoi cell density</title>
<p>Autoimmune related genes, ranked by disease association (Pletscher-Frankild et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2015</xref>), and the variants for each gene were plotted in the x-y coordinates of the Voronoi diagram. Normally distributed mock data were used to test the Voronoi tessellation and clustering method (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">S2</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">S4</xref>, Supplemental Information). Built-in Voronoi functions in Matlab<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0007"><sup>7</sup></xref> were used to create tessellation of data, which returned the indices of the Voronoi cells and vertices.</p>
<p>A Voronoi cell represents an area of influence of the data point it contains, and thus the local density in the proximity of a given point can be determined as the inverse of the cell area. This provides a direct precise measurement of the local density. Clusters were identified based on the neighboring Voronoi cells with densities above a certain threshold. Polyarea, a built-in function in Matlab<sup>7</sup>, was used to calculate the area for each Voronoi cell, except for the cells on the boundary of the map with infinite areas. For Voronoi tessellation with <italic>n</italic> (finite number of) cells, the normalized Voronoi cell density (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>~</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>) was calculated as the ratio of the cell density (inverse of cell area) over the inverse of the average cell area (Ebeling and Wiedenmann, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">1993</xref>)

Parameters were obtained by fitting the Chi-square distribution to 80% of the normalized Voronoi cell density distribution (Ebeling and Wiedenmann, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">1993</xref>). We obtained the threshold for clustering at the significance level of 90% from the fitted Chi-square distribution (Ramella et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Identifying clusters of voronoi cells</title>
<p>For the partitioned Voronoi cells, clustering was initiated from a random Voronoi site (data point) <italic>p</italic>, with a normalized Voronoi cell density above the threshold. Then the algorithm visited the neighbors of that random point. Each pair of Voronoi sites was connected by an edge of the Delaunay triangulation. A pair of Voronoi sites was considered as the nearest neighbors if the middle point of the connecting edge was closer to either site from this pair than any other Voronoi sites. Delaunay triangulation <italic>via</italic> the built-in DelaunayTri function in Matlab<sup>7</sup> was applied to determine the nearest neighbors of the data points. The point <italic>p</italic> and its closest neighbors were included in the neighbor list as a reference for future visit.</p>
<p>A neighbor without prior visit was included in the cluster if its normalized Voronoi cell density was above the threshold. Once visited, the point <italic>p</italic> and its neighbors were added to the visited list and eliminated from the neighbor list. The process was repeated until all the direct or indirect neighbors of the point <italic>p</italic> were exhausted. The entire algorithm was rerun for another random data point without any prior visit until all the data points were exhausted (Edla and Jana, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Voronoi-based disease risk</title>
<p>The risk of disease was inferred from the scores of the data points and their corresponding clusters on the gene-variant map. The cluster score was defined as the sum of Voronoi cell densities for all the cells within the cluster. For each gene within a cluster, we considered the product of its cell density and the cluster score, and defined the relative risk as the ratio of the corresponding products for different disease-associated genes. For two data points (corresponding to candidate genes from patients <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>), the relative risk is thus expressed as

<title>Breast cancer associated genes-variants map</title>
<p>We mapped 15 breast cancer genes with disease association gene Z-scores and the normalized variant scores on the gene-variant map (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">S1</xref>, and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">S3</xref>, Supplementary Information). The localization of the genes at the top-right corner of the gene-variant map suggests a high level of association with the disease at both gene and variant levels, implying the relevance to cancer (i.e., high gene scores suggest the relevance to cancer in general) as well as the specificity to breast cancer (i.e., high variant scores). The spatial localization of BRCA1, BRCA2 (Miki et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">1994</xref>; Hofmann and Schlag, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2000</xref>), RAD51 (Martin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2007</xref>), agrees with the known specificity of these genes to breast cancer, and physical or predicted interactions with each other (Warde-Farley et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">2010</xref>; Zuberi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">2013</xref>). TP53, the tumor suppressor (Baker et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">1989</xref>; Rivlin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">2011</xref>), PIK3CA kinase (Karakas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2006</xref>), and the epidermal growth factor receptor ErbB-2 and EGFR (Tebbutt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">2013</xref>), reported in multiple subtypes of cancer, are localized at the bottom right corner of the gene-variant map, suggesting the contribution of these genes to cancer in general with lower specificity to breast cancer compared to BRCA1 and BRCA2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This map illustrates a spatial segregation of the data points (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), which may implicate the localization of disease-specific genes. The currently available data pertinent to breast cancer are inadequate for the network analysis of Voronoi tessellation proposed in this study.</p>

<title>Voronoi based clustering of autoimmune data</title>
<p>We mapped 85 autoimmune genes and their associated variants based on the Z-scores and normalized 1-SIFT scores (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>, Supplementary Information). We performed Voronoi tessellation and used 80% of the normalized Voronoi cell densities that were lower than or equal to 5.3 as the background distribution (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>, Supplementary Information). Voronoi cells with densities above the threshold 3.96 were considered as the candidates for clustering (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This threshold was obtained by fitting the Chi-square distribution <inline-formula><mml:math id="M5"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> to the background distribution at the significance level of 90%.

<p>Four clusters associated with autoimmune diseases were detected on the gene-variant map by the Voronoi tessellation network analysis. In cluster 1, the normalized variant and gene (V,G) scores for PRF1, WAS, SLC4A1, AIRE were (0.28,0.41), (0.27,0.43), (0.21,0.4), and (0.23,0.39), respectively. CRYAB, TCAP were found in cluster 2 with normalized (V,G) scores of (0.52,0.46), (0.52,0.45), respectively. The normalized (V,G) scores for FOXP3 and MYL3 in cluster 3 were (0.52,0.56) and (0.51,0.61). In cluster 4, the (V,G) scores for GLA, TMPO, MYPN, JUP, TINF2 were (0.07,0.42), (0.03,0.47), (0.13,0.38), (0.15,0.36), and (0.04,0.41), respectively (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>, Supplementary Information). The cluster scores for clusters one to four were 39.41, 16.97, 13.63, and 40.06, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>, Supplementary Information). The localization of cluster 4 on the left bottom corner of the gene-variant map suggests that this cluster contributes less significantly to autoimmune compared with cluster 1, which may in part be explained by its indirect association with autoimmune (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref>).</p>

<title>Risk assessment framework</title>
<p>The multiplication of the normalized Voronoi cell density and its corresponding cluster score provides a disease risk score, from which the risk between patients could be compared (Equation 2). For instance, if a patient with a risk score of 112.71 [identified with mutations in CRYAB, a gene associated with multiple sclerosis (Chauhan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2013</xref>)] is compared with another patient who has a risk score of 506.11 [with mutations in TINF2, a gene associated with Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Donahoe et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2015</xref>)], the relative risk of the former to the latter is 0.22 (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>, Supplementary Information). This suggests that the risk of autoimmune diseases would be approximately 5 times higher in the second patient compared with the first patient.</p>
<p>Since the disease association in the gene-variant map is reflected at both gene and variant levels, the contribution of genes identified within a cluster to autoimmune could be calculated as the multiplication of the gene score and the variant score (Equation 3). For instance, the relative risk associated with autoimmune of CRYAB in cluster 2 with the score of <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>G</italic><sub>1</sub></sub> × <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>V</italic><sub>1</sub></sub> = 0.24, compared to TINF2 in cluster 4 with the score of <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>G</italic><sub>2</sub></sub> × <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>V</italic><sub>2</sub></sub> = 0.02 is 12 (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>, Supplementary Information), suggesting a higher relative autoimmune association of CRYAB.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Quantifying the risk of developing a disease based on network analyses of the associated genes, has received much attention over the past two decades. Still, the heterogeneity of complex diseases and synergistic interactions across the network pose enormous challenges for the risk assessment of complex diseases, such as autoimmune. GWAS studies, which mainly focused on common variants, suffer from the shortcomings of missing causal rare variants with low allele frequencies and moderate effects in complex diseases (Bodmer and Bonilla, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2008</xref>; Mitchell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2012</xref>). The method of Voronoi tessellation proposed here does not apply any filtering on the frequency of variants available in the databases, and therefore includes both common and rare variants in the score-based clustering. A network analysis that focuses on physical protein-protein interactions or gene co-expressions (Rual et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2005</xref>; Bettencourt et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2016</xref>) generally lacks sufficient information on the system-level interactions, which are critical to the understanding of complex diseases.</p>
<p>In this study, we provided a new approach to integrate disease association databases at both gene and variant scales to assess the risk of disease at the system-level, in addition to detecting the associated clusters <italic>via</italic> a Voronoi tessellation analysis. Previous studies on protein-protein network analyses (Ideker and Sharan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2008</xref>; Kuzmanov and Emili, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2013</xref>), integrated with GO annotation and biomedical literature mining (Sam et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">2007</xref>), shed lights on the molecular interactions and underlying pathways essential to disease occurrence. GWAS have also been widely used to identify disease-associated variants (Leiserson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2013</xref>; van der Sijde et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">2014</xref>). Furthermore, network analyses on protein-protein interactions have been applied with a scoring algorithm to quantitatively analyze the association between diseases (Suratanee and Plaimas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">2015</xref>). Therefore, the current surge of interest in quantifying the risk of disease builds on these studies with methods of score-based clustering at the molecular level. Here, we integrated the information available for gene and variant scores with disease association from various repositories and databases to generate a gene-variant map with a spatial gene segregation, in which disease related clusters were identified by a Voronoi tessellation network analysis. For example, the localization of cluster 1 in the center of the map in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> implies a close association of genes in cluster 1 with autoimmune, corroborating biological pathways (Warde-Farley et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">2010</xref>; Zuberi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">2013</xref>). This spatial separation of the clusters can provide additional information for comparisons between clusters and their association with the disease, which is critical for the risk assessment.</p>
<p>GeneMANIA suggests that the members of cluster 1 are related to a very tight network, contributing to the Fc receptor signaling pathway and the immune response regulation (Warde-Farley et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">2010</xref>; Zuberi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">2013</xref>). Cluster 1, localized in the middle of the gene-variant map, implies that its contribution to autoimmune depends on both gene and variant scores (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref>). CRYAB was found to be expressed predominantly in multiple sclerosis lesions, suggesting its close association with autoimmune (Ousman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">2007</xref>). This gene was also identified in cluster 2 containing TCAP (Hayashi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2004</xref>), which corroborates previous findings on the co-expression of the two genes (Warde-Farley et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">2010</xref>; Zuberi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">2013</xref>). GeneMANIA also suggests that cluster 4 belongs to a network functioning in telomere maintenance, recently found to be associated with autoimmune, such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus caused by the delayed death of white cells (Jeanclos et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">1998</xref>; Hohensinner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2011</xref>). As complex diseases are highly affected by the system-level interactions, our study proposes a network analysis method to identify genes that could potentially contribute to a disease. This presents an important vista for future directions in the field of disease biology network analysis, which currently focuses mainly on direct physical interactions (Bader et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2004</xref>; Goehler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2004</xref>; Gandhi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2006</xref>; Chatr-aryamontri et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2007</xref>; Goh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2007</xref>). Furthermore, using the framework presented in this study, the association of genes with different disorders could be modeled by bipartite graph (Goh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2007</xref>; Liu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2015</xref>) to unravel the contribution of gene clusters to various diseases. While our study aimed to develop a framework that could be used for the disease risk assessment, further investigation is needed to address specificity and sensitivity of the proposed method, given the availability of sufficient amount of patient data (Husmeier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2003</xref>). Nevertheless, our results for clustering autoimmune associated genes presented here show that the method is useful for extracting biologically relevant information.</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations, highlighting the need to improve databases with information of disease association at the variant level. The ambiguous definition of disease terms classified as autoimmune poses a particular challenge for obtaining the associated genes and variants. We obtained such variants from descriptive terms in the xml file (Trait section) of the ClinVar database<sup>1, 2</sup>, in which only a subset of the variants are identified as pathogenic for clinical significance. Further investigations on the association of variants with diseases are needed to provide more accurate variant scores. With improved data quality, our framework could identify clusters associated with various diseases more accurately, which could be used to predict the relative risk based on the proposed network analysis. Depending on the nature of databases and the number of data points, a limitation of our approach, shared with other methods, is identifying the threshold for clustering based on the distribution derived from the selected background data. For example, were a larger amount of data points for genes and variants associated with breast cancer available, our analysis could be used to cluster and segregate data points on the score-based gene-variant map. Furthermore, we have only considered Voronoi cells with finite areas, disregarding possible clustering of data points on the boundary of Voronoi diagram. Despite these limitations, our study highlights the importance of integrating variant scores to the network analysis to identify the contribution of both rare and common variants to disorders. Moreover, the spatial segregation of genes associated with breast cancer from genes related to multiple subtypes of cancer in the Voronoi diagram (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) suggests that the framework could be used to distinguish subtype-specific genes of complex diseases. These considerations merit further investigation, and our study presents the first step in this direction.</p>
