<abstract>
<p id="P1">Recently, it was suggested that neurons can release and transfer damaged
mitochondria to astrocytes for disposal and recycling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. This ability to exchange mitochondria
may represent a potential mode of cell-cell signaling in the central nervous
system (CNS). Here, we show that astrocytes can also release functional
mitochondria that enter into neurons. Astrocytic release of extracellular
mitochondria particles was mediated by a calcium-dependent mechanism involving
CD38/cyclic ADP ribose signaling. Transient focal cerebral ischemia in mice
induced astrocytic mitochondria entry to adjacent neurons that amplified cell
survival signals. Suppression of CD38 signaling with siRNA reduced extracellular
mitochondria transfer and worsened neurological outcomes. These findings suggest
a new mitochondrial mechanism of neuroglial crosstalk that may contribute to
endogenous neuroprotective and neurorecovery mechanisms after stroke.</p>

<body>
<p id="P2">Astrocytes play broad roles in the CNS, and are involved in the regulation of
neurodevelopment, neurotransmission, cerebral metabolism and blood flow <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Normal astrocytes protect neurons against oxidative stress and
excitotoxicity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In contrast, unhealthy astrocytes may release
deleterious factors that damage neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Healthy mitochondria
may be essential for these neuroglial protective mechanisms because inhibition of
astrocytic mitochondria makes neurons vulnerable to cell death <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Mitochondria comprise the intracellular cores
for energetics and viability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, but
under some conditions mitochondria might also be released into extracellular space
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. For instance, retinal
neurons may transfer mitochondria to astrocytes for disposal and recycling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, and bone-marrow derived stromal cells
may transfer mitochondria into pulmonary alveoli to suppress acute lung injury
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P3">In this study, we asked whether astrocytes can produce functional extracellular
mitochondria to support neuronal viability after ischemic stroke. Electron microscopy
confirmed the presence of extracellular particles containing mitochondria in conditioned
media from rat cortical astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). qNano analysis revealed that
astrocyte-derived mitochondria particles following FACS isolation spanned a range of
sizes from 300 to 1100 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig.
1b–d</xref>), and included populations that were positive for
β1-integrin (79%) and CD63 (43%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Mitotracker-labeling suggested that these
extracellular mitochondria may still be functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.
1b</xref>), and filtration of astrocyte conditioned media through 0.2 μm
filters depleted the amounts of functional mitochondria and reduced measurements of
mitochondrial ATP, membrane potential and oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b–e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P4">An important question at this point is whether extracellular mitochondria
represent active signals or merely cellular debris. To address this question, we asked
whether stimulated astrocytes could actively produce extracellular mitochondria. CD38
catalyzes the synthesis of a calcium messenger, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) in
mitochondrial membranes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In brain, CD38 is mainly expressed in glial
cells, and may have a role in neuroglial crosstalk since astrocytes increase CD38
expression in response to glutamate release from neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Based on this background literature and the
fact that most actively secreted cellular events involve calcium regulation, we decided
to assess CD38-cADPR-calcium signaling as a candidate mechanism for the astrocytic
production of extracellular mitochondria. First, we confirmed that rat cortical
astrocytes expressed CD38 protein and CD38/cADPR cyclase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f, g</xref>). Then, we tried two methods to modify this
pathway. When astrocytic CD38 was upregulated using CRISPR/Cas9 activation plasmids,
functional endpoints of extracellular mitochondria were significantly increased in
conditioned media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h–k</xref>). When
astrocytes were stimulated by cADPR to activate CD38 signaling, extracellular
mitochondria were increased in conditioned media along with enhancement of functional
endpoints in a calcium-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.
1l–n</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>).
Stimulation with cADPR did not appear to damage astrocyte viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1o</xref>), suggesting that this release of extracellular
mitochondria was not due to nonspecific cytotoxicity.</p>
<p id="P5">If astrocytes can produce functional extracellular mitochondria, then is it
possible that these signals may affect adjacent neurons? When rat cortical neurons were
subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation, intracellular ATP levels fell and neuronal
viability decreased, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.
2a–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). When
astrocyte-conditioned media containing extracellular mitochondrial particles was added
to neurons, ATP levels were increased and neuronal viability was recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). But when extracellular mitochondria were removed from
the astrocyte-conditioned media, neuroprotection was no longer observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data
Fig. 4</xref>). Similar results were obtained with immunostaining-based cell counts
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). As a control, ATP-liposomes were not
significantly protective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), suggesting that
the astrocytic mitochondria entry into neurons may generate additional benefits beyond
ATP energetics per se. Fluorescent microscopy confirmed that astrocyte-derived
mitochondria appeared to be present within treated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P6">Beyond the prevention of acute neuronal death, delayed neuroplasticity is also
important for stroke outcomes. CD38 may be important for brain plasticity because
CD38-deficient mice show worsened recovery after brain injury <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and CD38 mutations may comprise risk factors for
behavioral dysfunction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Hence, we
asked whether CD38-mediated astrocyte-into-neuron mitochondrial transfer may also
influence neuroplasticity. Neurons were labeled with CellLight Mitochondria-GFP and
astrocytes were separately labeled with Mitotracker Red CMXRos, and then the two cell
types were co-cultured together for 24 hours. Confocal microscopy indicated that
astrocyte-derived mitochondria were detected within soma and axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), and in these co-culture conditions, astrocytes
supported neuronal survival after serum/glucose starvation in a CD38-dependent manner
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). When astrocytic
mitochondria were made dysfunctional via inhibition of mitochondrial aconitase,
cADPR-stimulated astrocytes no longer supported neuronal survival and axonal extension
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). To further assess our
hypothesis, we asked whether this ability of astrocytes to transfer mitochondria could
in fact enhance neuroplasticity under pathological conditions. Control or CD38-silenced
astrocytes were co-cultured with surviving neurons after oxygen-glucose deprivation
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). siRNA suppression of CD38 in
astrocytes reduced mitochondria transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>)
and dendrite regrowth after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">Taken together, these cellular findings appear consistent with the overall
hypothesis that CD38 signaling may help astrocytes transfer mitochondria into neurons
and promote survival and plasticity after injury. But does this mechanism work in vivo?
To answer this question, we turned to a mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia. First,
primary mouse cortical astrocyte cultures were labeled with MitoTracker Red CMXRos and
extracellular mitochondria particles were collected. Then mice were subjected to focal
cerebral ischemia, and 3 days later, extracellular mitochondria particles were directly
injected into peri-infarct cortex. After 24 hrs, immunostaining suggested that
transplanted astrocytic mitochondria were indeed present in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Next, we turned to FVB/N-Tg (GFAPGFP)14Mes/J
transgenic mice where astrocytes are fluorescently labeled. When these mice were
subjected to focal cerebral ischemia, fluorescent mitochondrial particle signals
appeared within adjacent neurons at 24 hours post-stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Neurons that were collected from ischemic peri-infarct cortex via
flow cytometry showed a general upregulation of cell survival-related signals such as
phosphorylated Akt and Bcl-xl along with an increase of the mitochondria marker TOM4
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">Finally, we attempted loss-of-function experiments to ask whether blocking CD38
signaling results in worsened outcomes after stroke. In our mouse models of focal
cerebral ischemia, CD38 was upregulated in the peri-infarct cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>). At 5 days post-stroke, CD38 siRNA or
control siRNA were injected into cerebral ventricles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.
4a</xref>). By 2 days after siRNA injections, total CD38 expression in the
peri-infarct cortex was successfully downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8b</xref>). There were no clear differences in infarct area nor
the total levels of GFAP-positive reactive astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b, c</xref>), but astrocyte subsets that expressed CD38 were significantly
decreased without affecting the number of other CD38 expressing cells such as CD8 T
cells and microglia/macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 8c–g</xref>). To assess the levels of extracellular
mitochondrial particles in this in vivo model, flow cytometry was used to analyze
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). GFAP-positive mitochondria were detected in CSF, and CD38
siRNA injections appeared to reduce this extracellular population of astrocyte-derived
mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). At the same time, flow
cytometry was used to quantify levels of MAP2 neuronal mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>). Brains treated with CD38 siRNA showed a
significant reduction in neuronal mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.
4e</xref>), suggesting that interfering with CD38 signaling may have suppressed
endogenous astrocyte-to-neuron mitochondrial transfer. These effects were accompanied by
a reduction in peri-infarct GAP43 (a surrogate marker of neuroplasticity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f, g</xref>) as well as worsened neurologic outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h, i</xref>). Furthermore, CD38 suppression
significantly decreased oxygen consumption measurements in CSF-derived extracellular
mitochondrial particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j</xref>), and neurologic
outcomes seemed to be negatively correlated with these functional endpoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4k, l</xref>), suggesting that CSF mitochondrial
function may be a potential biomarker of neuroglial signaling after stroke.</p>
<p id="P9">Taken together, these findings suggest that astrocytes may release extracellular
mitochondrial particles via CD38-mediated mechanisms that enter into neurons after
stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4m</xref>). But there a few caveats and the
detailed mechanisms and generalizability of these proof-of-concept findings should
warrant further investigation. First, the dynamics of extracellular mitochondria release
and entry into neurons as well as quantitative thresholds for functional benefit remain
to be fully defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig.
10a–i</xref>). A second caveat relates to mitochondrial entry mechanisms. In
neurons, endocytosis may be regulated by dynamin/clathrin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> or integrin pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In our models, integrin-mediated src/syk
signaling may be involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig.
10j–m</xref>). How integrin-mediated mitochondrial transfer is modulated
under different disease conditions requires further study. Third, CD38 is also expressed
in immune cells. In this study, CD38 suppression with siRNA in vivo did not appear to
affect T cells or microglia/macrophages, but the balance between potentially beneficial
CD38 signals in astrocytes versus deleterious CD38 signals in immune cells should be
carefully considered. A fourth caveat is whether other glial cells may participate.
Microglia, oligodendrocytes and pericytes are activated after stroke <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, so their potential roles in mitochondrial exchange warrants
further investigation. Finally, astrocytes can produce many factors for protecting and
restoring neurons, including tPA, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), extracellular
microvesicles containing VEGF and FGF-2, and various microRNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. How mitochondrial particles may interact with these other
extracellular signals should be explored.</p>
<p id="P10">Non-cell autonomous signaling is vital for CNS recovery after injury or disease
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. In the context of cerebral ischemia, the present study
suggests that astrocytes may release extracellular mitochondrial particles that enter
into neurons to support cell viability and recovery after stroke.</p>

<title>Mitochondria membrane potential measurement</title>
<p id="P20">To monitor mitochondrial health, JC-1 dye (invitrogen, T-3168) was used
to assess mitochondrial membrane potential. Rat cortical astrocytes or media
were incubated with JC1 (5 μM or 1 μM) for 30 min at 37
°C. JC1 dye exhibits potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria,
indicated by fluorescence emission shift from green (Ex 485 nm/Em 516 nm) to red

astrocytes (70–80% confluent cells/well/100 μL ) or
particle fraction (100μL; 25-fold concentrated astrocytic conditioned
media) were prepared in non-coated regular 96 wells, and O2 sensor probe (10

<title>Electron microscopy analysis</title>
<p id="P22">Rat cortical astrocytes or pellets from astrocyte-conditioned media were
fixed in 2.0% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4
(Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) for one hour at room temperature on
a rocker. They were rinsed in cacodylate buffer, gently scraped and pelleted and
post-fixed in 1.0% osmium tetroxide in cacodylate buffer for one hour on
ice. They were rinsed in buffer and stabilized with a small amount of 2%
agarose in PBS to hold them together. They were then dehydrated through a graded
series of ethanol to 100%, followed by propylene oxide, 100%.
They were infiltrated with Epon resin (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) in a 1:1 solution
of Epon:propylene oxide overnight on a rocker at room temperature. The following
day they were placed in fresh Epon for several hours and then embedded in Epon
overnight at 60 C. Thin sections were cut on a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome,
collected on formvar-coated grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate
and examined in a JEOL JEM 1011 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV.
Images were collected using an AMT digital imaging system (Advanced Microscopy

mitochondrial entry into neurons following oxygen-glucose deprivation. Rat
cortical neurons (1×10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) were prepared in
24-well culture plate. ACM or cADPR-ACM (each 1 mL) was co-incubated with
neurons for 18 hours. Mitochondrial entry into neurons were calculated by
mitochondrial intensity measured before and after washing cells with PBS.
Phenol red free culture media were used to decrease back ground signal. Back
ground signal was subtracted from fluorescent intensity obtained from each
sample. <bold>f,</bold> Oxygen-glucose deprivation for 2 hours decreased
approximately 50% of mitochondria in neurons after 18 h
reoxygenation (n=4). <bold>g,</bold> All data are expressed as
relative values, with total neuronal mitochondria after 2 h OGD/18 h
reoxygenation being 100%. Mitochondrial entry into neurons was
slightly higher in cADPR-ACM treatment (18%) compared to ACM
treatment (11%), although there was no statistically significance
(n=4). <bold>h,</bold> There was no difference in the percentage of
mitochondrial entry between ACM treatment and cADPR-ACM treatment

viability better than ACM treatment (n=4). <bold>j,</bold>
Co-culture between rat cortical astrocytes in the upper chamber and rat
cortical neurons in the lower chamber was performed for 18 hours following
oxygen-glucose deprivation for 2 hours in neurons. Then, mitochondrial entry
into neurons was measured. <bold>k,</bold> Immediately after oxygen-glucose
deprivation, dynasore (5 μM), RGDS peptide (50 μg/ml), or
MNS (1 μM) was initially added in neurons for 30 min, then astrocyte
co-culture was performed for 18 hours. The data are expressed as relative
values, with astrocytic extracellular mitochondria plus entered mitochondria
into neurons being 100%. RGDS peptide and MNS significantly
decreased mitochondrial entry into neurons, but dynasore did not inhibit the
entry. <bold>l,</bold> MNS treatment significantly decreased
astrocyte-mediated neuroprotection (n=4). <bold>m,</bold> Dynasore
(5 μM), RGDS peptide (50 μg/ml), or MNS (1 μM) did
not affect neuronal viability after 2 h oxygen-glucose deprivation

suggest that astrocyte into neuron mitochondrial particle entry may involve
integrin-mediate src/syk mechanisms. However, we acknowledge that these
pathways may be multifactorial and deeper analyses are warranted to dissect
entry mechanisms under various physiologic and pathologic conditions.</p>

<title>Astrocytic mitochondria and neuroplasticity after ischemic stress</title>
<p><bold>a,</bold> Confocal microscopy revealed that astrocytic mitochondria (red,
Mitotracker Red CMXRos) may be transferred into neural soma (a) and axon (b),
and some may fuse with neuronal mitochondria (c, green, Cell-light Mito-GFP).
<bold>b,</bold> Experimental schematic for co-culture studies.
<bold>c,</bold> Soma size was unchanged but astrocytic mitochondrial density
in neuronal soma was significantly decreased when CD38 was suppressed in
astrocytes (n=54 or 41 soma were counted). Scale: 20 μm.
<bold>d,</bold> Quantification of dendrite elongation (MAP2 staining)
(n=5 or 6). <bold>e,</bold> Male C57Bl6 mice were subjected to 60 min
transient focal ischemia. Three days later, astrocyte mitochondria particles
(1,000 particles/2μl, MitoTracker Red CMXRos) were infused into cerebral
cortex. Confocal images showed transplanted astrocytic mitochondria (red) within
peri-infarct neurons at 24 hrs. <bold>f,</bold> FVB/N-Tg (GFAPGFP)14Mes/J
transgenic mice with fluorescently labeled astrocytes were subjected to 30 min
transient focal ischemia. Immunohistochemistry at 24 hrs suggested that GFP
(GFAP)-positive particles co-stained with mitochondrial TOM40 were present in
MAP2-positive neurons in peri-infarct cortex. <bold>g,</bold> Western blot
indicated that GFP-positive neurons upregulated cell survival-related proteins
(phospho-Akt, Bcl-xl) but not apoptosis-related proteins (caspase 3, AIF) along
with an increase of mitochondrial TOM40 (n=3). Isolated neurons
expressed mature (neurofilament) but not neural stem cell markers (nestin)
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 7f</xref>). All values

<title>Effects of CD38 siRNA in focal cerebral ischemia</title>
<p><bold>a,</bold> Male C57Bl6 mice were subjected to transient 60 min focal
ischemia and control siRNA or CD38 siRNA was injected into lateral ventricles at
5 days post-stroke. Immunostaining showed that CD38 siRNA decreased HMGB1
astrocytes in peri-infarct cortex. <bold>b,</bold> Nissl staining showed no
difference in infarct size (n=8 or 10). <bold>c,</bold> Immunostaining
demonstrated that astrocytic CD38 was diminished by CD38 siRNA. <bold>d,</bold>
Astrocytic CD38 suppression with siRNA reduced GFAP-positive mitochondria in CSF
at 7 days (n=6). <bold>e,</bold> Neuronal mitochondria were decreased by
CD38 siRNA (n= 8 or 5). <bold>f,</bold> CD38 siRNA attenuated
peri-infarct GAP43 immunostaining. <bold>g,</bold> Western blot confirmed a
