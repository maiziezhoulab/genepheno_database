<abstract>
<p>Host genetic variation modifying HIV-1 acquisition risk can inform development of HIV-1 prevention strategies. However, associations between rare or intermediate-frequency variants and HIV-1 acquisition are not well studied. We tested for the association between variation in genic regions and extreme HIV-1 acquisition phenotypes in 100 sub-Saharan Africans with whole genome sequencing data. Missense variants in immunoglobulin-like regions of <italic>CD101</italic> and, among women, one missense/5’ UTR variant in <italic>UBE2V1</italic>, were associated with increased HIV-1 acquisition risk (p = 1.9x10<sup>-4</sup> and p = 3.7x10<sup>-3</sup>, respectively, for replication). Both of these genes are known to impact host inflammatory pathways. Effect sizes increased with exposure to HIV-1 after adjusting for the independent effect of increasing exposure on acquisition risk.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Antiretroviral drugs for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or treatment significantly reduce risk of HIV-1 acquisition and transmission, but face challenges of increasing access, maintaining high adherence, and selecting viral resistance. Improved understanding of the molecular determinants of HIV-1 sexual transmission could provide new public health HIV-1 prevention interventions. Factors proven to impact sexual HIV-1 transmission risk include epidemiologic exposure (e.g., level of virus in the transmitting partner and frequency of unprotected sex), presence of genital inflammation, and host genetic variants common in the population. Rare or intermediate frequency genetic variants are an increasingly recognized reservoir of complex human disease-causing factors, but are not well studied in HIV-1 infection. However, the low frequency of these variants reduces statistical power to detect disease associations. Aggregating variants in a common biological domain (e.g., a gene) can increase power for identifying variants with a common direction of effect. We report comparison of whole genome sequences from HIV-1 exposure extremes—highly-HIV-exposed individuals who remained HIV-uninfected and lower-exposed individuals who became HIV-infected. We discover and replicate associations between HIV-1 risk and aggregate variation in two genes, <italic>CD101</italic> and <italic>UBE2V1</italic> that increase directly with the level of HIV-1 exposure. These genes may modulate host inflammation thereby identifying molecular mechanisms linking genital inflammation to HIV-1 infection, possibly leading to novel candidate host-directed HIV-1 prevention interventions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The discovery of the protective deletion variant, <italic>CCR5</italic>-delta32, in the chemokine receptor 5 gene, encoding a HIV-1 co-receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref003">3</xref>], generated great enthusiasm to search for additional host genetic variants and pathways associated with HIV-1 acquisition as a means of identifying targets for new HIV-1 prevention and treatment strategies. This enthusiasm was further enhanced by documentation of HIV-1 exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals who had very high exposure and lacked <italic>CCR5</italic>-delta32, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref007">7</xref>] suggesting existence of additional genetic factors that alter the risk of sexually transmitted HIV-1 infection (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] phenotype #609423) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref008">8</xref>]. At least one <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment supports the hypothesis of a strong genetic component to infection risk, reporting 50% heritability in cellular susceptibility to HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref009">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to date searching for such genetic risk factors for HIV-1 infection risk have met with limited success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Most GWAS have had moderate (~80%) average power to detect common variants, very low power to detect variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) = 5% (approximately 1% power for an OR = 2) and even less power to detect associated rare variants (RVs) (MAF≤1%). Additionally, susceptibility to HIV-1 can only be assessed among individuals who are exposed to the virus. While some assessment of HIV-1 exposure was used for most HIV-1 GWAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref017">17</xref>], exposure measurement error and/or exposure misclassification, including that related to lack of information about the HIV-1 infected partners’ plasma HIV-1 RNA level(s), can result in lower statistical power than anticipated. Furthermore, out of necessity, some studies have been forced to attempt replication across different ancestral/racial groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref010">10</xref>]. However, risk variants might differ between such groups, thereby lessening the power for replication. Hence, major gaps in HIV-1 genetic association studies still exist, and focus on power to detect rare associated variants employing high accuracy in HIV-1 exposure measurements is warranted. The contribution of rare variants to risk of HIV-1 acquisition is of particular interest because effect size is generally inversely correlated with MAF when an association does exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref018">18</xref>] and large effects can be expected to translate to strong interventional impact (e.g., HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and familial hypercholesterolemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref019">19</xref>]).</p>
<p>With these issues in mind, we undertook an association study of HIV-1 acquisition using whole genome sequencing (WGS) of extreme phenotypes sampled from two large clinical trials and one observational study of African HIV-1 serodiscordant couples (stable heterosexual couples with one partner HIV-1-infected and the other partner HIV-1-seronegative at enrollment) (n = 8,593 couples). These studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s012">S1 Table</xref>) had similar clinical follow-up, including quarterly risk assessments, PCR-verification of HIV-1 infection, reports of protected and unprotected sexual activity from both partners, measurement of the infected partner’s plasma HIV-1 RNA level and molecular confirmation of transmission linkage through viral sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref022">22</xref>].</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The study was conducted in two stages, Discovery and Replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). In the Discovery stage we compared variation in genic regions from WGS data for 50 of the most highly HIV-1 exposed seronegative individuals (controls) to that for 50 of the most extreme low-exposure seroconverting individuals (cases; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Materials and methods</xref>). In the Replication stage, we employed a prospective design to test for association between time to seroconversion and candidate regions/variants passed on from the Discovery stage. Compared to other HESN not selected for the Discovery sample, the controls had higher average HIV-1 exposure scores, with higher enrollment plasma HIV-1 RNA level in the infected partner (4.9 vs 4.2 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL), a higher proportion of visits with unprotected sex reported by either partner (0.5 vs. 0), a lower percentage of circumcised men (33% vs. 54%) and longer follow-up time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006703.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

Furthermore, control participants had comparable or higher exposure characteristics, including monthly exposure score, as compared to cases.

A group with higher-than-expected risk that nevertheless remains seronegative will, on average, comprise individuals with risk modifiers that are not accounted for in the calculated expectation, including genetic factors when they exist. Conversely, case participants, who acquired HIV-1 despite low estimated risk, were more likely than other participants to have factors, including genetic variants that predispose to HIV-1 infection risk.</p>

The RVT1 test (“rare variant test 1”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref024">24</xref>], a statistical test designed specifically for rare variant association studies, was used to test the difference between extremes in functional variant burden (defined as the total number of minor alleles (aggregated variant scores) by gene comparing cases and controls; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Materials and methods</xref>) for each of 18,354 genic regions, including 284,632 functional variants in the tests.

<title>Replication plan based on Discovery results</title>
<p>Based on the FDR results showing &gt;80% chance of a true positive, the <italic>CD101</italic> and <italic>UBE2V1</italic> regions were moved forward to the Replication stage for testing in a longitudinal analysis. Test regions from the Discovery stage almost certainly include variants significantly associated, as well as, variants not significantly associated (i.e., noise) with outcome. The benefits, and perhaps even necessity, of using biological knowledge to increase signal-to-noise ratio for rare variant replication is well recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref028">28</xref>]. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio and increase power, we prioritized and grouped variants (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Materials and methods</xref>) in <italic>CD101</italic> and <italic>UBE2V1</italic> for Replication stage testing. Fourteen functional variants in <italic>CD101</italic> were designated as “primary replication variants” (PRVs) based on a direction of effect consistent with that for the Discovery result (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s015">S4 Table</xref>) and their degree of significance in by-variant tests (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). These variants were subdivided into four sub-groups for replication testing (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Materials and methods</xref>): (1) five missense variants in regions encoding extracellular <italic>CD101</italic> immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) protein domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref029">29</xref>], (2) five missense variants in the <italic>CD101</italic> cytoplasmic domain, (3) two 3’-UTR variants and (4) two splice site variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006703.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s003">S3A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s015">S4 Table</xref>). Creating four separate <italic>a priori</italic> replication test groups increases the multiple-testing penalty, but is expected to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio within some of these variant test groups. Similarly, 11 of 15 predicted functional variants in <italic>UBE2V1</italic> were designated as PRVs, and these were divided into two groups: (1) six 5’-UTR and (2) five 3’-UTR variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006703.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s003">S3B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s016">S5 Table</xref>). One of the 5’-UTR variants, rs6095771, is identified as a missense variant in the canonical transcript, and as a 5’-UTR for other transcripts. It was grouped with the 5’-UTR variants due to low predicted power to replicate a single variant with MAF = 0.02. Three of these variants were novel and another six are not found among Kenyans in the 1kG database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref030">30</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s016">S5 Table</xref>). Furthermore, two of the functional <italic>UBE2V1</italic> Discovery variants that are indexed in the ESP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref031">31</xref>] or ExAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref032">32</xref>] databases are extremely rare and found in ESP only among individuals of African descent (rs187204768, MAF = 4/4046 and rs6095771, MAF = 20/4400) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s016">S5 Table</xref>).

<p>Across these three HIV-1 serodiscordant couples cohorts, the pool of participants who were available for the Replication stage had varying amounts of reported sexual exposure. Because inclusion of individuals with no or little HIV-1 exposure could reduce power, we identified and excluded these individuals using a Protected-sex Index (PI). PI is defined as the proportion of study visits for which only abstinence or 100% condom use was reported; we considered this our measure of baseline behavior tendency. PI predicted overall HIV-1 seroconversion rates among the three HIV-1 cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006703.g002">Fig 2</xref>), indicating reasonably low measurement error and a high signal-to-noise ratio for PI. Simulation studies predicted that power would be maximized when only individuals with PI ≤0.6 were included in the Replication analysis, despite a larger sample size when individuals with lower exposure are included (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Materials and methods</xref>). Accordingly, the Replication cohort was restricted to the 261 individuals HIV-1 uninfected at baseline, who each had PI ≤ 0.6 and were not selected for the Discovery stage analysis.</p>

<title>Time to seroconversion by Protected sex Index (PI) and tertiles of partner HIV-1 viral load distribution.</title>
<p>The protected sex index (PI) is the proportion of visits at which the female partner reported always having protected sexual intercourse with the HIV-1 infected partner (= 1 –proportion of interviews with reported unprotected sex by the female partner.) The figures show time to seroconversion stratified by tertiles of plasma viral load of the HIV-1 infected partners in log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL: Low = (0, 3.8], Medium = (3.8, 4.5], and High = (4.5,8]. Panels show this relationship for by PI strata: Panel A: PI = (0, 0.3], Panel B: PI = (0.3 to 0.6], Panel C: PI = (0.6 to 1.0), and Panel D: PI = 1.0. PI shows reasonable accuracy in predicting overall risk of seroconversion, indicating this variable can be used to eliminate individuals with probably little or no exposure from the study samples although a few more highly exposed individuals might also be dropped from the analysis.</p>

<title>CD101 exploratory results</title>
<p>For comparison with the Replication Cox model results for <italic>CD101</italic>, we applied the Cox model to the same <italic>CD101</italic> Ig-like variant group in the Discovery stage sample and found a similar result: HR = 3.4 (95% CI = [1.8–6.1]; p = 7.3x10<sup>-5</sup>). While the primary replication was limited to variants found in the Discovery stage, we performed exploratory analyses on all <italic>CD101</italic> variants in the Replication stage and found that when assessed individually, three of the Ig-like PRVs found in the Replication sample had FDRs &lt; 0.05 (rs17235773, rs3754112, rs12093834; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) with HRs of 3.1 (p = 0.002), 3.1 (p = 0.002) and 2.0 (p = 0.02), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s018">S7A</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s020">S9</xref> Tables). Among the 13 <italic>CD101</italic> variants annotated by the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref034">34</xref>] as either missense or regulatory, and which were identified among individuals in the Replication Sample, the two most significant in this by-variant analysis (rs17235773 and rs3754112) pass a Bonferroni bound for significance (p &lt; 0.0038), providing additional strong evidence for the association of <italic>CD101</italic> variants with HIV-1 acquisition. A fourth Ig-like missense variant found only in the Replication sample (rs140567712) also had an individual-variant level FDR &lt; 0.05 with HR = 6.9 (p = 0.009) and CADD score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref035">35</xref>] = 16.9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006703.g002">Fig 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s019">S8 Table</xref>).</p>

<p>Association with the <italic>UBE2V1</italic> 3’-UTR PRV group was not significant. However, among the six 5’-UTR variants present in the Discovery sample, the only one identified in the Replication sample (rs6095771) was significantly associated with increased risk in women after adjustment for the two PRV group tests and testing within sex groups (HR = 6.4, nominal p = 9.5x10<sup>-4</sup>, adjusted p = 3.7x10<sup>-3</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006703.g003">Fig 3B &amp; 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006703.t003">Table 3</xref>.) This also is the only <italic>UBE2V1</italic> Discovery variant that is missense in some transcripts; it has a very high CADD score and is predicted to have a moderate to deleterious impact on function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s016">S5 Table</xref>). Because there are only 4 women with this variant in the Replication sample, the reliability of the Cox model p-value (an asymptotic, not exact p-value) is uncertain. Hence, we also tested the association between seroconversion and this variant using Fisher’s exact test. Given a total of 122 women in the Replication sample, 22 of whom seroconverted, the probability under the null hypothesis (of no association with seroconversion) that all 4 who carry the rare rs6095771 variant are found among the 22 seroconverters is only 0.001 (≤ 0.004 after correction for 4 tests), providing substantial evidence for a true association between this variant and higher risk of seroconversion in females. None of the six males carrying this variant in the Replication sample seroconverted.</p>

<title>Dose-response and modeling of sexual exposure</title>
<p>To test for further evidence of a true positive association between HIV-1 acquisition risk in women and Ig-like <italic>CD101</italic> variants or <italic>UBE2V1</italic> rs6095771, we augmented the Replication data with variant data from the auxiliary sample and tested for an interaction between the reported PI score and each PRV score to ascertain whether a dose-response relationship was present. “Dose” here is HIV-1 virus exposure quantified in terms of frequency of unprotected sex with a partner with the average plasma HIV-1 RNA in the Replication sample partners. For <italic>UBE2V1</italic> rs6095771, this increased the number of women with 5’-UTR PRVs in the analysis from 4 to 28 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s018">S7B Table</xref>).</p>
<p>We found strong dose-response relationships for both genes, indicating that the association between variant scores and HIV-1 risk is positively related to the frequency of unprotected sex: p = 5.0x10<sup>-8</sup> for the <italic>CD101</italic> Ig-like dose-response and p = 8.2x10<sup>-6</sup> for the <italic>UBE2V1</italic> rs6095771 dose-response, with exposure assessed through the PI score and modeled on a log-scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006703.g004">Fig 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Because the model is adjusted for PI, these significant associations with increasing dose are in addition to the effect of decreasing PI. Overall model significance levels including the variant and dose-response variables were marked at p = 5.1x10<sup>-12</sup> and p = 1.7x10<sup>-12</sup>, respectively, for <italic>CD101</italic> and <italic>UBE2V1</italic> in explaining variation in HIV-1 seroconversion risk (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006703.t004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006703.t005">5</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that aggregates of host genetic variants, including variants with MAF&lt;10%, can have a strong and replicated association with HIV-1 acquisition risk. Our replication of <italic>CD101</italic> Ig-like variants showed an HR for HIV-1 infection of 4.3 (95% CI = [2.1–8.9], p = 6.4x10<sup>-5</sup>); and replication of association of <italic>UBE2V1</italic> rs6095771 with HIV-1 acquisition risk showed an HR of 6.4 in women (95% CI = [2.1, 19.1], p = 9.5x10<sup>-4</sup>). Two <italic>CD101</italic> missense/regulatory variants reached individual statistical significance after adjustment for multiple testing, four had individual FDRs &lt; 0.05, and a strong dose-response relationship with the frequency of unprotected sex collectively strengthened evidence that association with HIV-1 acquisition is real. While many of these variants were <italic>individually</italic> rare or infrequent, nearly 18% of Kenyans evaluated in the 1K Genomes Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref030">30</xref>] had one or more of the three most common <italic>CD101</italic> Ig-like HIV-1 risk variants (rs17235773, rs3754112, rs12093834). Hence, these variants or others in <italic>CD101</italic> and <italic>UBE2V1</italic> could have a substantial impact on the population-based HIV-1 infection risk.</p>
<p><italic>CD101</italic> and <italic>UBE2V1</italic> are both biologically plausible candidates for influencing HIV-1 acquisition. <italic>CD101</italic> is expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, dendritic cells and monocytes, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref039">39</xref>] and appears to alter CD4+/CD25+/FOXP3+ T regulatory cell (Treg) function based on both a murine graft-versus-host disease model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref040">40</xref>], and through IL10 secretion from human dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref041">41</xref>]. Monoclonal antibody ligation of <italic>CD101</italic> reduces T cell proliferation through a Ca<sup>2+</sup> and tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway possibly by preventing translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and IL-2 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref042">42</xref>]. Recent experiments using a murine model of chronic colitis demonstrate that adoptive transfer of CD101<sup>-/-</sup> Tregs is associated with Th17 cell proliferation and more severe colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref043">43</xref>]. <italic>CD101</italic> expression is also strongly associated with the immune suppression function of Tregs in humans. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref044">44</xref>] Reduced expression of CD101 on mucosal CD8+ T cells has been associated with increased tissue inflammation in studies of human intestinal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref045">45</xref>], and pulmonary mucosa. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref046">46</xref>] Given that local inflammation and CD4+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref047">47</xref>] and CD8+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref049">49</xref>] T cell immune activation have been associated with increased HIV-1 acquisition risk, and reduced immune activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref051">51</xref>] or immune quiescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref052">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref053">53</xref>] have been associated with natural resistance to HIV-1 in HESN, our results support the idea that <italic>CD101 gene</italic> variants may modify HIV-1 heterosexual acquisition risk through altered levels of genital mucosal inflammation.</p>
<p>The finding that <italic>CD101</italic> risk variants are associated with lower plasma IL1R1 levels, but not with HIV-1 RNA set point, suggests that these variants have systemic immunological effects in the seronegative partner while not directly acting on HIV-1 replication. Recent studies in mouse models indicate that IL1 may inhibit Treg and enhance Th17 differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref054">54</xref>]. However, it is unclear at this point how variants in <italic>CD101</italic>, specifically those identified in <italic>CD101</italic> Ig-like domains, might modify either IL1 or IL1R1 levels. The <italic>IL1R1</italic> rs2234650 genotype has been reported to be associated with HIV-1 acquisition in infants of HIV-1 infected mothers with modification of risk by <italic>IL1</italic> gene family haplotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref055">55</xref>]. In addition to <italic>CD101</italic> being associated with increased Treg function, <italic>IL1R1</italic> expression has been associated with increased Treg and anti-inflammatory IL10 secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref044">44</xref>]. Combining these prior data with our findings, we hypothesize that <italic>CD101</italic> Ig-like variants reduce Treg function with associated reductions in IL1R1 levels and an enhanced pro-inflammatory environment, which leads to increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition. While efforts to test this hypothesis and to develop a more detailed understanding of <italic>CD101</italic> function are underway, our results suggest that targeting <italic>CD101</italic> activity could be a novel approach to host-directed, HIV-1 prevention.</p>
<p>UBE2V1 associates with TRIM5-α, a host restriction factor involved with HIV-1 capsid uncoating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref056">56</xref>]; however, rare and uncommon <italic>UBE2V1</italic> variants have not previously been studied in association with HIV-1 acquisition risk. Previous GWAS without rare variant burden/aggregation tests cannot adequately assess the <italic>UBE2V1</italic> association observed here because of the rarity of the variants found to be associated with HIV-1 acquisition risk in this study. <italic>UBE2V1</italic> forms an ubiquitin-conjugating complex generating unattached polyubiquitin chains that may stimulate NF-κB activation and consequent pro-inflammatory cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref057">57</xref>]. This complements reports of reduced systemic immune activation associated with resistance to HIV-1 acquisition in Kenyan sex workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref058">58</xref>]. Of note, <italic>UBE2V1</italic> is one of only 23 genes differentially down-regulated by HIV-1 trans-activator of transcription (TAT), an HIV-1 protein that is required for efficient replication of the HIV-1 virus and potential escape from the host immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref059">59</xref>].</p>
<p>Distinguishing between a group carrying variants protecting against HIV-1 acquisition versus a group carrying risk-increasing variants requires that both groups are exposed to HIV-1, i.e. to assess susceptibility to HIV-1 in any given individual, that individual must be exposed to HIV-1. This translates directly to a mathematical proof that statistical power to detect a significant association with HIV-1 acquisition risk is increased by selectively identifying individuals with sustained high levels of HIV-1 exposure. Indeed, the success of this study was dependent on our ability to quantify HIV-1 exposure with relatively high accuracy to identify exposed individuals. Given that the overall per-contact probability of heterosexual HIV-1 transmission is intrinsically low (estimated at ~1/1000 for vaginal intercourse among the study population) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref060">60</xref>], our findings suggest that inclusion of individuals with lesser HIV-1 exposure may explain, in part, why it has been difficult to identify and/or validate genetic risk factors for HIV-1 acquisition.</p>
<p>The use of the extreme phenotypes design is another strength of this study. The discovery of CCR5-delta32 was based on the observation that extreme resistance phenotypes existed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref062">62</xref>] leading to case-control studies to identify the CCR5-delta32 variant among candidate genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref003">3</xref>], including extreme hemophiliac controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref001">1</xref>] and the others employing just two to four extreme resistant controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref003">3</xref>]. Identifying individuals with phenotypes that represent the extremes of risk of HIV-1 acquisition has been challenging because few studies are able to assess both the behavioral and biologic dimensions (e.g. frequency of unprotected sex, and plasma HIV-1 RNA level in the HIV-1 transmitting partner) that contribute to exposure. Our use of data from both partners added accuracy to the phenotypes we used in this study—e.g., plasma HIV-1 RNA level contributed by the HIV-1 infected partner, reported frequency of unprotected sex from both partners, and epidemiologic data from the HIV-1 uninfected partner (e.g., male circumcision status) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref023">23</xref>]. Further improvements in accurate exposure quantification could increase power even more and perhaps very extreme phenotypes can be identified that provide superb power with small samples but lead to generalizable treatments. Recent examples that underscore the value of the extreme phenotype analysis approach include discovery using a sample size of a dozen individuals of a human antibody to a malaria protein that prevents death and provides a promising new malaria vaccine target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref063">63</xref>], and discovery of the protective effect of <italic>PKC9</italic> loss of function variants against cardiovascular disease in a small group of extreme individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref064">64</xref>], leading to the development of PKC9 inhibitors for lowering LDL cholesterol.</p>
<p>Our analysis identified variants in <italic>CD101</italic> and <italic>UBE2V1</italic> associated with increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition, but we did not identify variants associated with reduced risk of HIV-1 acquisition. Statistical power is lower to identify protective variants than it is to identify risk variants (of the same magnitude but inverse) when the outcome has low incidence. Discovery of protective variants for HIV-1 infection in a population with average sexual contact and some use of protection against transmission would require extended observation time to detect differences in the survivor rates (“rates of non-seroconversion,”) while differences in rates of seroconversion of the same magnitude can be detected statistically within a shorter time period.</p>
<p>A limitation of these results is that confounding cannot be ruled out with certainty as the source of the associations. This is true for any observational study, though observational studies remain a fundamental part in building a step-wise scientific case for causal association for many exposures that cannot be tested experimentally in humans (including exposure to genetic variants, the epidemiological exposure being tested here), with smoking as a cause of lung cancer being a prime example. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref065">65</xref>] We have guarded against confounding to the extent possible by evaluating for known potential confounders, including ancestry group (which likely includes HLA), BV, age, cohort, ethnic group affiliation and spatially isolated ancestry. The next general step in establishing causal association is replication by different groups and functional studies. We are currently engaged in the latter and encourage validation of our results in genetic association studies with HIV-1 exposure measurement as well as functional studies by others of the variants/genes discovered and replicated here.</p>
<p>In summary, we used quantitative measures of HIV-exposure to select individuals with extreme HIV-1 acquisition phenotypes and thereby optimize our power to detect genes associated with risk of HIV-1 acquisition. We identified variants, including rare variants, in <italic>CD101</italic> and at least one in <italic>UBE2V1</italic> that are significantly associated with increased HIV-1 acquisition risk. More detailed dissection of the molecular basis for this association may identify unique interventions that use these pathways to improve public health prevention of HIV-1.</p>

<title>Discovery stage participant selection</title>
<p>An extreme phenotypes case-control design was employed for the Discovery stage. The extreme phenotypes design provides the greatest statistical power for a fixed Discovery sample size of 100 individuals (with power increasing as the percentiles of phenotype become more extreme in the two arms). Hence, individual phenotype was a primary consideration in Discovery stage participant selection. Extreme cases here comprise individuals with relatively low estimated exposure who seroconverted during the study, especially those who converted early in the study. Extreme controls comprised individuals with high estimated risk who remained seronegative over the full observation period with follow-up for at least nine months. Highly-exposed HIV-1 exposed seronegative control individuals with longer follow-up time were considered more extreme based on cumulative exposure scores across all study visits. Cumulative exposure score to rank extremes was calculated as previously described using plasma HIV-1 RNA level of the infected partner, frequency of unprotected sex and male circumcision status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref023">23</xref>], with the modification that all participants must have reported unprotected sex by at least one partner in the couple to be eligible for the Discovery stage sample. It is possible for an individual to have a fairly high exposure score in this model even if no unprotected sex is reported, because the original risk score is based on <italic>empirical</italic> estimates of risk of seroconversion given the variable values, and some participants who reported no unprotected sex did seroconvert with plasma HIV-1 genomes matching those of their infected partners. Hence, the risk among the group that <italic>reported</italic> “never unprotected sex” is not zero. Nevertheless, the latter risk is smaller than that for those who report unprotected sex, all else equal, and the risk rises as the proportion of reports with unprotected sex rises (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Seronegative individuals from couples that did not report unprotected sex were excluded for statistical power reasons: including unexposed individuals lowers the statistical power to the point where a p-value of 6.3x10<sup>-5</sup> in the Replication stage (N = 261)(<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006703.t003">Table 3</xref>) becomes p = 0.03 (N = 1229) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006703.t004">Table 4</xref>; replication stage methods below). Given these exposure scores/conditions defining the extremeness of phenotype within the potential cases and controls, we then incorporated both gender balance within-group and pairwise ethnicity/sex matching between-groups to this design to avoid happenstance confounding by differing proportions of sex or ancestry in the relatively small samples. The potential impact of ancestry-confounding in this subpopulation was largely unknown when the Discovery stage was designed, and we opted to take this precaution against confounding.</p>
<p>Specifically, seroconverter (SC) “cases” were selected from the Partners in Prevention HSV/HIV Transmission Study and COS cohorts among couples with laboratory confirmed linked HIV-1 transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref067">67</xref>], who were HIV-1 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative at enrollment and had the lowest exposure scores, conditional on relatively equal numbers of males and females. Individuals from the Partners PrEP cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s012">S1 Table</xref>) were not available for Discovery stage sampling because the trial had not come to complete closure with data available for ancillary studies at that time. For selection of Discovery stage controls, we excluded from consideration: SC individuals (with either linked or unlinked transmissions), couples in which HIV-1 infected partners reported use of any antiretroviral therapy (ART), couples with no reported unprotected sex during the study and couples with less than nine months follow-up time. After these exclusions, for each selected case, all HESN of matching sex and self-reported ethnicity were identified, and from these matched individuals, the HESN individual with the highest cumulative exposure score was selected as the matching control. A total of 65 case-control pairs were identified in this manner, with identification of low exposure (extreme) cases being the highest selection priority, followed by ethnicity/sex matching for controls, followed by criteria for high exposure among the matching controls.</p>
<p>We quality controlled these case-control pairs for gender check, cryptic relatedness and genetic heterogeneity across multiple longitudinal whole blood DNA samples, using a custom Illumina Goldengate chip with 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These test SNPs were selected as being the most predictive of ancestry clusters and individual identity from a principal component analysis (PCA) on data from a previous genome-wide association study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref014">14</xref>] that included samples from these same cohorts. Specifically, we first performed a PCA on a pruned set of 133,991 SNPs from that GWAS that had low linkage disequilibrium. The first five PCs for this analysis were effective at distinguishing participants from East and southern Africa, by country (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, South Africa and Botswana) and by self-reported ethnicities reported in &gt;2% of participants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Using the first five PCs, we then assigned all participants to one of nine ancestry clusters based on model-based clustering, which has previously been shown to reduce population stratification bias. Subsequently, we used the Random Forests algorithm to identify 357 SNPs that were most predictive of geographic region (East Africa versus southern Africa) and the nine ancestry clusters. These 357 SNPs were collectively able to differentiate the ancestry clusters but were much less important for predicting ancestry than self-reported ethnicity and geographic region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). The final Goldengate SNP chip included the 357 ancestry SNPs along with 27 SNPs that maximized the probability that all participants had a different genotype at one or more loci in order to ensure that DNA samples came from unique individuals.</p>
<p>The genotyping chip was used on DNA from 65 potential case-control pairs. After eliminating samples that failed QC (1 case failed cryptic relatedness, and longitudinal samples from 2 controls suggested potential sample heterogeneity), verifying matching on ancestry cluster and identifying controls with highest cumulativeHIV-1 exposure scores over all visits, 50 case-control pairs were selected for complete genome sequencing for the Discovery analysis (24 male cases with matched controls, and 26 female cases with matched controls). When characterized by the two strongest components of the exposure score, namely mean plasma HIV-1 RNA and proportion of follow-up visits where no-condom use was reported, the Discovery stage controls were verified as sampled from the highest exposure strata (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006703.t001">Table 1</xref>). Cases also had a median time to HIV-1 seroconversion of 11.8 months, while the median duration of follow-up without seroconversion for controls was 22.8 months.</p>

Annotations used for this rare SNV analysis included non-synonymous protein coding sequence, 3’- and 5’-untranslated regions, and splice donor/acceptor sites with exon/intron boundaries identified through the University of California-Santa Cruz (UCSC) refFlat database. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref069">69</xref>]</p>
<p>To validate WGS sequence data we identified 8 SNVs in the WGS data that lacked an rsID in dbSNP and were identified in either of the two genes targeted for replication analysis (<italic>CD101</italic> and <italic>UBE2V1)</italic>. SNVs not previously reported to dbSNP have a higher probability of being false positives than the bulk of SNVs in dbSNP, so these provide “tough” test cases for the CGI calls for validation of true positive rare variants. These SNVs were Sanger sequenced from the individual genomes originally used to generate the WGS. All 8 were successfully validated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s014">S3 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Discovery stage statistical methods</title>
<p>Prior to analysis, each SNV was classified as “functional” or not, based on CGI annotation indicating that the SNV either (1) altered protein coding, (2) was at a splice-site or (3) in a UTR sequence region. Only these genic categories of functional polymorphisms were included in this analysis. Case-control comparison of SNVs aggregated by genic region (“variant burden”) was accomplished through logistic regression analyses with burden scoring derived specifically for rare variant analysis by Morris and Zeggini with the p-value based on the likelihood ratio test (their RVT1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref024">24</xref>] The Wald test p-value was found to be unreliable—much too conservative—for genic regions with high imbalance between cases and controls, which are exactly the situations we seek to find. Although cases and controls were matched by ethnic origin, the first 3 principal components (PC) in the logistic regression of each genic region were used to control for potential residual population stratification. To focus on less common or rare variants and higher effect sizes, the RVT1 ignores variants with MAF above a specified cutoff (&gt;0.125 in our analysis). The MAF cut-off of 0.125, which is somewhat higher than typically considered rare, was used to allow for random variation in the observed MAF for rare SNVs in the population, as well as to allow for enrichment of rare SNVs in the sample due to the selection of extremes. Because the study participants are sub-Saharan Africans, external estimates of MAFs for the observed SNVs were not available. This testing prioritization strategy resulted in 18,354 genic regions tested (each region with an RVT1 p-value produced for the null hypothesis of no difference in variant burden within the region between cases and controls) and included a total of 284,632 functional variants in these tests. Principal components created by LD-pruning variants with MAF &gt; 0.03 were used to adjust the RVT1 tests. Genic regions with the lowest p-values were considered for replication. These also have the lowest False Discovery Rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref070">70</xref>] (FDRs). Based on FDR analysis, the two most significant regions had a probability of 0.83 that at least one was a true positive (not a false discovery). These two regions were moved forward to the MIPs Replication stage based on this high probability of having a true positive result.</p>

<sec id="sec018">
<title>Replication analysis plan and criterion for significance taking into account Discovery results</title>
<p>We planned and implemented a formal frequentist p-value-based criterion for declaring significance of the replication of <italic>CD101</italic> and <italic>UBE2V1</italic> genic region variants contributing to the aggregate scores in the Discovery stage. We broke the variants into smaller aggregates for the replication analysis (four aggregates for <italic>CD101</italic>, two for <italic>UBE2V1</italic>) in an <italic>a priori</italic> attempt to further enrich at least some of these aggregates with a higher proportion of true positive variants. This reflected the fact that Discovery stage test regions include both variants that are significantly associated with outcome (i.e., signal) and those not significantly associated with outcome (i.e., noise). If sub-groups of the originally aggregated variants can be enriched for truly associated variants having a common direction of effect, the statistical power for replication of such an enriched sub-group can be increased considerably relative to the larger, noisier aggregate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref028">28</xref>] despite the need for a multiple-test correction due to increasing the number of tested aggregated variant groups. Based on statistical reasoning, variants with large effect sizes and the same direction of effect are most likely to be driving the Discovery finding. To formulate sub-groups prior to the Replication analysis, “by-variant” association results were tabulated and examined for size and direction of effect. Confidence intervals are wide for these by-variant results due to the low MAF/low-power issue, but they are not completely uninformative. To complement these results, we also compared by-variant results to genome and protein maps of the regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006703.g001">Fig 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s015">S4</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s016">S5</xref> Tables). Sixteen of 24 predicted functional variants in <italic>CD101</italic> had by-variant estimates with increased risk (HRs&gt;1), which is the direction of effect for the aggregate RVT1 <italic>CD101</italic> result that we seek to replicate. Fourteen of these were designated as PRVs based on significance of by-variant tests (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). These 14 <italic>CD101</italic> PRVs were divided into Ig-like (N = 5 PRVs), cytoplasmic (N = 5), 3’-UTR (N = 2) and splice site domain (N = 2) subgroups. Similarly, 11 functional variants in <italic>UBE2V1</italic> identified as PRVs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s003">S3B Fig</xref>) divided into 5’-UTR (N = 6) and 3’-UTR (N = 5) subgroups.</p>
<p>Although a fairly common strategy in replication of rare variant results is to include all rare variants within a region in the replication test whether or not these variants were among those identified in the Discovery stage. For example, such a strategy would be used to study low-density lipoprotein receptor (<italic>LDLR</italic>) variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref028">28</xref>] (OMIM #606945), given that the structure and function of <italic>LDLR</italic> is well-known, providing reasonably high confidence that novel missense or truncation RVs in particular sub-regions of the <italic>LDLR</italic> gene will have a deleterious association. In this study, we elected not to include in replication tests any variants seen only in the Replication stage and not in the Discovery stage for four reasons: (1) identification of individual variant contributions is important at this point to identify variation in any specific structural protein components affecting the outcome (and point toward mechanism); (2) identification of individual variant contributions for variants that are only modestly rare makes it feasible to use genotype tests for presence of individual risk variants in future studies or risk assessments; (3) addition of new variants in the tests at the Replication stage obscures the contribution of variants from the Discovery stage alone; and (4) we did not expect a large contribution from new/novel/rare variants in the Replication stage because of the sample size limitations at this point, and therefore were not concerned by potential loss of statistical power via this choice.</p>
<p>In addition to the primary replication tests that include subsets of variants identified in the Discovery stage (four tests planned for <italic>CD101</italic> and two for <italic>UBE2V1</italic>), we performed exploratory testing on all additional variants found in the Replication stage to take the most advantage of these findings while limiting the formal replication tests as above. All exploratory statistical test results are reported by nominal p-value and FDR to provide some quantification of evidence for association, but no formal multiple test correction is given for these findings given their often highly correlated nature (making a Bonferroni correction misleading) and due to the <italic>post hoc</italic> character in some cases.</p>

<title>Replication stage sample selection</title>
<p>We measured sexual exposure behavior defining Protected-sex Index (PI) as the proportion of study visits for which only abstinence or 100% condom use was reported. Simulation studies showed that statistical power was highest when the Replication cohort included individuals with PI ≤0.6 while individuals with higher levels of protected sex were excluded. We set the Replication cohort to be the 262 baseline uninfected individuals each having PI ≤ 0.6 who remained after the Discovery stage. Due to the economy of sequencing multiple individuals using multiple inversion probe sequencing (MIPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref033">33</xref>] and the intention to demonstrate proof of principle in our power calculations, we successfully sequenced an additional 986 individuals (thirteen 96-well plates). This set of 1248 individuals was balanced on sex and ethnicity relative to seroconverters and non-seroconverters at a 1:6 ratio, a typical sampling strategy. These additional 986 individuals had higher exposure scores than the average participant in the serodiscordant couple cohorts based on high plasma HIV-1 RNA levels of their infected study partner, but many reported low levels of or no unprotected sex. Therefore, this group of additional participants was not considered by itself. There were 19 individuals failing the MIPs procedure due to low DNA concentration, resulting in 1229 individuals with 261 in the Replication sample and 968 in the auxiliary sample.</p>

<title>Replication stage sequencing, quality control and annotation</title>
<p>MIPs can be used for targeted sequence capture, followed by massively parallel sequencing of captured products. This strategy is efficient and cost-effective for sequencing multiple candidate genes in modest to large sample sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref033">33</xref>]. MIPs were designed to target all coding exons plus 10 additional base pairs of intron/exon flanking sequence for <italic>CD101</italic> (RefSeq NM_004258), and <italic>UBE2V1</italic> (RefSeq NM_021988). In total, 74 MIPs (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) were designed and pooled in equimolar ratios and a test library of 24 African control samples from Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) and 23 Caucasian in-house control samples was produced and evaluated. For MIPs that failed to produce the minimum required average sequence depth of 60X in the test library, their concentration in the final pool was increased according to their level of under-performance in order to increase coverage above the average threshold. The optimized MIP pool (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s023">S12 Table</xref>) was then used to generate libraries and targeted sequence from the ethnically-matched Replication Sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec021">
<title>Methods for MIPS library preparation</title>
<p>The MIP pool was phosphorylated with T4 Polynucleotide kinase and T4 Ligase Buffer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The reaction was held at 37°C for 45 minutes and then de-activated at 65°C for 20 minutes. For the majority of samples (N = 1096), 100ng of genomic DNA per sample was used in a capture reaction with a 200:1 MIP to gDNA ratio. For samples with less than 100ng of DNA available (N = 228), a range of 40ng to 100ng was used in the capture. During a 24-hour reaction at 60°C, HemoKlen Taq (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) was used to capture the target regions and Ampligase (Epicentre, Madison, WI) was used to circularize constructs. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> Exonuclease I and Exonuclease III (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) were used to enzymatically clean capture reactions. The reactions were held at 37°C for 30 minutes and then de-activated at 95°C for 2 minutes. Captured products were amplified using iProof HF Master Mix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) during 20–22 cycles of PCR. This PCR was performed using a generic forward primer and reverse primers containing a generic portion along with a unique 8bp molecular tag used to barcode the captured products for each sample. Between 40 and 96 barcoded samples were pooled into each library and the libraries were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) magnetic beads in the ratio 0.9:1 beads to samples. Libraries were eluted into EB buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and quantified via the Broad Range Quant-iT dsDNA Assay Kit (Life Tech, Waltham, MA) using a SpectraMax Gemini XPS Fluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Libraries were then pooled and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq using 300 cycle paired end (v2) reagents (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Custom oligonucleotides complementary to sequences in the MIP constructs were used. Each run contained between 136 and 192 samples. Libraries were diluted and denatured according to Illumina’s standard procedure with final loading concentrations ranging from 8 to 10pM.</p>
<p>Individual fastq files were generated by the MiSeq Reporter Software (v2.5). The resulting fastq files were aligned to Hg19 with the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA v0.5.9-r16), and a multi-sample variant call file was generated using the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK v2.4-9-g532efad). Annotated was performed using Variant Effect Predictor v82 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep">http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep</ext-link>). The average sequencing depth per sample across all sites was 198X. A total of 1229 individuals’ sequences passed quality control. Given that a subset of these samples (N = 138) had less than 100ng of total DNA and therefore could have yielded high variant missingness in these samples but with good data quality in the remainder of samples, we set the threshold of 12% missingness for excluding a variant from the Replication stage tests below (compared to a conventional GWAS threshold of 5% missingness). A total of 314 variants passed quality control including a Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium test cut-off of p&gt;3.18x10<sup>-5</sup>.</p>

<sec id="sec022">
<title>Replication stage statistical methods</title>
<p>Testing for association between genomic variation and HIV-1 acquisition risk in the Replication stage was performed using straightforward, standard censored data methods, since follow-up time in the three cohorts was variable with most observations being censored. This provides greater statistical power than using a subset of individuals who have reached a minimum follow-up time or the outcome to create a case-control sample, as it allows all follow-up time to contribute to the estimated risk associations. Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox proportional hazards models were used. We performed the primary replication tests by scoring the aggregate risk variable as 1, if an individual carried a minor allele for any of the variants in the aggregate, and 0 otherwise. This variable was tested for association with time-to-seroconversion via the Cox model. Risk variables were tested jointly in the Cox model, as well, and results were checked for possible confounding by sex, cohort, age, country/ethnic group (five countries with Kenya broken into three major ethnic groups plus others, a surrogate for ancestry, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006703.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Principal components that were available on the subset of Replication individuals from the GWAS also were checked as potential confounders/adjustment variables on this subset. Because we and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref071">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref072">72</xref>] have found bacterial vaginosis (BV) to be associated with increased risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection, BV is a potential confounder if associated with either <italic>CD101</italic> or <italic>UBE2V1</italic>. BV assessment (as we have previously defined it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref073">73</xref>]) was available on a subset of Replication individuals and was tested as a potential confounder on this subset.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec023">
<title>Cytokine measurements and statistical methods for variant association</title>
<p>Cytokine levels at baseline entry to the cohorts were measured in a nested case-control subset of individuals from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref037">37</xref>], wherein laboratory methods are described in detail. We assessed for differences in these cytokine levels among <italic>CD101</italic> variant carriers and non-carriers. This analysis includes all individuals who had both baseline cytokine measurements performed and were among the individuals included in the Replication stage MIPS sequencing or Discovery stage WGS in order to determine their <italic>CD101</italic> variant genotypes. Three <italic>CD101</italic> missense variants with increased-risk in the Discovery stage data also had high increased-risk in the Replication stage data and were all in the Ig-like aggregate that replicated overall (chr1:117554421, chr1:117560058, chr1:117568500). We separated individuals with cytokine measurements into individuals with any minor allele for any of these three variants and individuals without any of the three alternate variants. Individuals in the second group might have other <italic>CD101</italic> variants, but it is impossible to separate individuals with certainty into those with and without any <italic>CD101</italic> causal variants; but this grouping will result in a <italic>conservative</italic> estimate of the difference between groups, as some individuals with causal <italic>CD101</italic> variants might be included in the group “without causal” variants and diminish the difference between groups. (That is, any misclassification here will not produce false positive results but attenuate differences instead.) We then compared cytokine measurement distributions between these two groups. Since more than half of the cytokines had median values at the limit of detection in the overall group, we compared the two groups for a difference in the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile rather than the median. This test assesses for a difference in the cytokine distributions primarily using information from those values that are above the limit of detection. (Five cytokines measured in the original report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006703.ref037">37</xref>] had 75<sup>th</sup> percentile values that were at the lower limit of detection and were not included in this analysis). Specifically, logistic regression was employed with the outcome being an indicator of whether a cytokine measurement was above the overall 75<sup>th</sup> percentile for both groups combined. The independent variable was the <italic>CD101</italic> carrier status indicator and the regression was adjusted for the panel (batch) for each measurement. Several batches had significantly different means for some cytokines, and adjusting for batch generally increased the significance of the difference between gene variant groups. Mean differences in cytokine levels also were compared between groups to ensure that the logistic regression results were consistent with differences in means, though the latter will be affected by the large number of ties at the lower limit of detection.</p>

In regard to use of PCs for adjustment, on a subset of N = 87 individuals with PCs available (and PI ≤ 0.9 in order to increase the sample size), the HR unadjusted for PCs is HR = 3.84 (p = 0.01) while HR = 4.78 (p = 0.009) after adjustment for the most significant three PCs. In other words, there is no evidence of confounding by major ancestral group.</p>

Association with IL1R1 distribution was significant after adjustment for multiple testing (OR = 0.19 for achieving the 75th percentile IL1R1 value, 95% CI = [0.07, 0.54], p = 1.7x10<sup>-3</sup>; adjusted p = 0.04), indicating significantly lower levels of IL1R1 among those with the Ig-like missense variants. Shown are the distributions of log(IL1R1) after adjustment for panel/batch for individuals in the cytokine analyses with and without these Ig-like primary replication missense variants.</p>

<p>All variants that had no rsID in dbSNP at the time of WGA sequencing in genes moved forward for replication were Sanger sequenced from the same original DNA sample used for WGS. Given these are not previously verified sites of variation, these variants have a higher likelihood of being sequencing errors. All eight variants with the highest probability of having false-positive calls were replicated by Sanger sequencing.</p>

Odds ratios (ORs) here are defined as the ratio of odds of having a cytokine value in the top quartile given that one of these three variants is present versus the odds given that all PRVs are absent. This method of testing for distributional differences was used due to large numbers of values below the limit of detection (averages are not meaningful in this situation) along with right-skewing of higher values (making a quantile approach appropriate).</p>
