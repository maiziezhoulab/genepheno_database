<abstract>
<p>Hemizygous deletion of a 1.5- to 3-megabase region on chromosome 22 causes 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), which constitutes one of the strongest genetic risks for schizophrenia. Mouse models of 22q11DS have abnormal short-term synaptic plasticity that contributes to working-memory deficiencies similar to those in schizophrenia. We screened mutant mice carrying hemizygous deletions of 22q11DS genes and identified haploinsufficiency of <italic>Mrpl40</italic> (mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit protein 40) as a contributor to abnormal short-term potentiation (STP), a major form of short-term synaptic plasticity. Two-photon imaging of the genetically encoded fluorescent calcium indicator GCaMP6, expressed in presynaptic cytosol or mitochondria, showed that <italic>Mrpl40</italic> haploinsufficiency deregulates STP via impaired calcium extrusion from the mitochondrial matrix through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. This led to abnormally high cytosolic calcium transients in presynaptic terminals and deficient working memory but did not affect long-term spatial memory. Thus, we propose that mitochondrial calcium deregulation is a novel pathogenic mechanism of cognitive deficiencies in schizophrenia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a catastrophic disease that affects approximately 1% of the world’s population and is characterized by multiple symptoms that include cognitive abnormalities such as deficits in working memory, executive function and learning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Mechanisms of cognitive symptoms of SCZ are poorly understood, partly because only weak associations have been identified between any single gene and the disease, and valid animal models have been lacking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Mouse models of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) are among the few animal models that replicate abnormalities associated with SCZ. The 22q11DS is the most common multigene syndrome in humans and is considered a genetic risk factor for SCZ. The 22q11DS is caused by the hemizygous deletion of a 1.5- to 3-megabase region on the q arm of chromosome 22, resulting in the haploinsufficiency of multiple genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Approximately 30% of children with 22q11DS experience SCZ during late adolescence or early adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> Symptoms of 22q11DS-related SCZ are indistinguishable from those of the idiopathic disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> suggesting that the biological mechanisms involved in SCZ arising from the 22q11 deletion are similar to those involved in non-deletion-related SCZ.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of SCZ usually includes positive symptoms (i.e., disorderly thinking, hallucinations and delusional ideas), negative symptoms (i.e., low levels of emotional arousal or social activity) and cognitive symptoms (i.e., deficits in attention, working memory, executive function, and learning and memory). Recognition of cognitive deficits as a core feature of SCZ and 22q11DS is increasing, as these deficits better predict disease progression than do the other symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Many cognitive symptoms of SCZ are thought to originate in the hippocampus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> a key brain region involved in learning and memory. Spatial working-memory deficits occur in patients with 22q11DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> and are also seen in 22q11DS mouse models. Mouse models of 22q11DS exhibit abnormal hippocampal short- and long-term synaptic plasticity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> which is consistent with the notion that synaptic plasticity is a cellular mechanism of learning and memory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Short-term synaptic plasticity in the form of short-term potentiation (STP) acting on the millisecond-to-minute time scale is believed to underlie reliable information transfer between hippocampal excitatory synapses in an activity-dependent manner,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> working memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> and decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> STP predominantly occurs in presynaptic neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Several studies have shown that presynaptic abnormalities can be attributed to dysregulation of presynaptic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>). For example, altered STP resulting from deregulated presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> is seen in models of neuropsychiatric diseases such as FMRP-related autism, Alzheimer disease and 22q11DS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Because 22q11DS is a multigene deletion syndrome, more than one gene may affect STP. Initially, STP dysregulation in <italic>Df(16)1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> models of 22q11DS was linked to haploinsufficiency of the microRNA-processing gene <italic>Dgcr8</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> which is mapped to a proximal part of the microdeletion. Depletion of microRNAs <italic>miR-185</italic> and <italic>miR-25</italic> leads to presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation and abnormal STP through the abnormal elevation of (sacro)endoplasmic reticulum ATPase type 2 (Serca2), the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump that extrudes Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> SERCA2 is also elevated in the hippocampus of schizophrenic patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> and the most comprehensive genome-wide association study to date linked the <italic>ATP2A2</italic> gene, which encodes SERCA2, with SCZ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> Other genes that affect STP remain unknown.</p>
<p>Here we report results of our STP screening of the distal region of the 22q11DS microdeletion, which encompasses six genes: <italic>Cldn5</italic>, <italic>Cdc45l</italic>, <italic>Ufd1l</italic>, <italic>2510002D24Rik</italic>, <italic>Mrpl40</italic> and <italic>Hira</italic>. Using mutant mice carrying hemizygous deletions of individual genes, we discovered that haploinsufficiency of <italic>Mrpl40</italic> (mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit protein 40, also known as <italic>Nlvcf</italic>) causes abnormal STP and short-term memory deficits via Serca2-independent deregulation of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Using two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> expressed either in the presynaptic cytosol or in mitochondria, we showed that <italic>Mrpl40</italic> haploinsufficiency hindered the extrusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the mitochondrial matrix through an impaired mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). This leads to abnormally high levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presynaptic cytosol and elevated STP. Our data implicate <italic>Mrpl40</italic> as a 22q11DS gene, the haploinsufficiency of which contributes to cognitive deficits in microdeletion-related SCZ.</p>

<p>Mature (16–20 weeks) mice of both sexes were used. Production and genotyping of <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup>, <italic>Dgcr8</italic><sup>+/−</sup>, <italic>Cldn5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and <italic>Hira</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice were previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> To generate <italic>Cdc45/</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and <italic>Ufd1l</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, we obtained SIGTR embryonic stem (ES) cell clones containing gene-trap disruptions of the pGT01Lxr vector for <italic>Cdc45l</italic> (cell line AJ0425) and a <italic>Ufd1l</italic> allele (cell line AW0532) from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center (University of California, Davis. CA, USA). The AJ0425 ES cell line carries a Genetrap insertion in exon 3 of the <italic>Cdc45l</italic> gene. Offspring were genotyped using the following primers: Cdc45lF: GCTGGGTACCTGAGTGTCATTG, Cdc45lR: CGAGACTGGTATGTGTGTGTGTG, and the betageo primer 2: ATTCAGGCTGCGCAACTGTTGGG, producing a 353-bp wild-type (WT) amplicon and a 309-bp mutant amplicon. The AW0532 ES cell line disrupts the <italic>Ufd1l</italic> gene in the first intron. This line was genotyped with the following primers: Ufd1lF: GTTGACGCTAACGTCCAGTCAC, Ufd1lR: GAAGCAGCGGTACTGCGTGGAG, and the Betageo primer: ATTCAGGCTGCGCAACTGTTGG, producing a 612-bp WT amplicon and a 304-bp mutant amplicon.</p>
<p>To generate the <italic>Mrpl40</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, we obtained sperm from the C57BL/6 strain carrying the <italic>Mrpl40</italic><sup>tm1(KOMP)vlcg</sup> allele of the <italic>Mrpl40</italic> gene from the trans-NIH Knock-Out Mouse Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.komp.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.komp.org</ext-link>). Sperm was used to produce <italic>Mrpl40</italic><sup>+/−</sup> offspring via <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization. <italic>Mrpl40</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice were genotyped using the following primers: Mrpl40F: CAGGCACACGTCAGACACA, Mrpl40R: GAGATCCCAGAAGGCCAGTAAG, and LacZR: CCCACCAGAGAGCTTC, producing a 102-bp WT amplicon and a 387-bp mutant amplicon. To expand the colony, we bred <italic>2510002D24Rik</italic><sup>+/−</sup>, <italic>Mrpl40</italic><sup>+/−</sup>, <italic>Ufd1l</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and <italic>Cdc45l</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice harboring the disrupted alleles to C57BL/6 J mice in the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (St. Jude) Animal Resource Center.</p>
<p>All mouse strains in this study were back-crossed onto the C57BL/6 J genetic background for at least five generations. Individual experiments were conducted in age-matched and sex-matched animals. The care and use of animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at St. Jude.</p>

<title>Brain slice preparation</title>
<p>Mouse brains were quickly removed and placed in cold (4 °C) dissecting artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 125 m<sc>m</sc> choline-Cl, 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> KCl, 0.4 m<sc>m</sc> CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 6 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 m<sc>m</sc> NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 m<sc>m</sc> NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 20 m<sc>m</sc> glucose (295–300 mOsm), under 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and acute transverse hippocampal slices (400-μm-thick) were prepared. After dissection, slices were incubated for 1 h in ACSF containing 124 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> KCl, 2 m<sc>m</sc> CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 m<sc>m</sc> NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 m<sc>m</sc> NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 10 m<sc>m</sc> glucose (285–295 mOsm), under 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 32–34 °C and then transferred into the submerged recording chamber and superfused (1.5–2 ml min<sup>−1</sup>) with ACSF. Long-term potentiation experiments were performed as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Because the bath temperature is crucial for STP experiments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> all electrophysiology and imaging experiments were conducted in a perfusion chamber maintained at near physiological temperature (33–34 °C, measured at the center of the bath) by using both inline and bath heaters.</p>

<title>Whole-cell electrophysiology</title>
<p>Electrophysiological data were acquired using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10/20 kHz using a Digidata 1440 digitizer (Molecular Devices) controlled by Clampex acquisition software (Molecular Devices). All offline analyses of electrophysiological data were done in Clampfit. To evoke excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in CA1 neurons, we stimulated Schaffer collaterals with a concentric bipolar stimulating electrode (125 μm outer diameter; 12.5 μm inner diameter) connected to a Master 8 stimulator and an Iso-Flex stimulus isolator (both A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel) with 100-μs pulses. Stimulating and recording electrodes were separated by at least 350–400 μm. For STP experiments, a cut was placed between the CA3 and CA1 regions to avoid recurrent stimulation. Recording electrodes were borosilicate glass capillaries pulled in a P-1000 puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA) and had resistances approximately 3.5–5 MΩ. CA1 neurons were whole-cell voltage-clamped using electrodes filled with 130 m<sc>m</sc>  K gluconate, 10 m<sc>m</sc> KCl, 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> EGTA, 2 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 2 m<sc>m</sc> ATP-Na<sub>2</sub>, 0.4 m<sc>m</sc> GTP-Na, 10 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES and 10–25 μ<sc>m</sc> Alexa 594 (pH 7.35,~290 mOsm). EPSCs were recorded by holding the cells at –74 mV (accounting for a liquid junction potential of ~14 mV). Access resistance was monitored using a –5 mV step before each recording (range, 25–50 mΩ), and cells that displayed unstable access resistance (variations &gt;20%) were excluded from the analyses. All EPSC recordings for STP experiments were done in the presence of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist picrotoxin (100 μ<sc>m</sc>) to prevent inhibitory responses and the NMDA receptor antagonist <sc>d</sc>-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (D-AP5, 50 μ<sc>m</sc>) to avoid induction of long-term synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p>STP components were separated using an adapted procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> A baseline of stable EPSCs was established to evoke 150- to 200-pA EPSCs. Stimulation intensities ranged from 30 to 60 μA and were held constant for each cell throughout the experiment. Stimulation intensity did not differ significantly between slices from WT and mutant littermates (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05). The stimulation protocol consisted of the following: 5 pre-train pulses (0.2 Hz), a high-frequency train (100 pulses, 80-Hz), 24 pulses at 5 Hz (to measure recovery from depression) and 24 pulses at 0.2 Hz (to measure augmentation). The 80-Hz (100 pulses) train was chosen because it induced both strong depression and augmentation on the basis of STP induced by trains of different frequencies (data not shown). EPSCs during and after the train were normalized to the average of the five pre-train EPSCs (shown as a single baseline point), and the amplitudes are reported as normalized EPSC peak amplitudes. For each cell, we averaged the data from 3 to 4 trials by using this stimulation protocol. To measure the EPSC amplitudes during the train, we resorted to a binning procedure, instead of the template waveform-based subtraction protocol, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> The measured EPSC train of 1250 ms (80 Hz × 100 pulses) was divided into 100 equal bins of 12.5 ms, and the peak amplitude within each bin was graphed as the normalized EPSC amplitude during the train. This procedure was sufficient to separate EPSCs in the train.</p>
<p>Augmentation, the slowest component of STP, has negligible contamination from depression and facilitation and is reported as measured without corrections. Statistical comparisons of augmentation were made using the measured peak augmentation at 5 s after the 80-Hz train, instead of the extrapolated augmentation at 0 s. Recovery from depression (200–4800 ms) after the 80-Hz train was contaminated by augmentation and some residual facilitation. Because the EPSCs measured during the recovery phase had an interstimulus interval of 200 ms, the contamination by facilitation was minimal and corrected only for overlying augmentation. To that end, the measured augmentation decay curve (5–120 s after the 80-Hz train) was extrapolated from 200 to 4800 ms after the train by using a standard exponential fit in Clampfit. The normalized EPSCs during the recovery phase were then corrected for the overlying extrapolated augmentation for each time point. Facilitation was measured in separate experiments by using paired pulses at interstimulus intervals of 20–1000 ms.</p>
<p>To measure excitability, we held CA3 neurons in current clamp mode and added D-AP5 (50 μ<sc>m</sc>) and picrotoxin (100 μ<sc>m</sc>) to the external ACSF bath to avoid possible long-term effects. Action potential (AP) parameters were estimated by clamping the cell at –65 mV using automatic slow-current injection. Input resistance, AP threshold, rheobase (intensity of current reached at threshold) and number of APs (evoked by holding at the minimum current needed to reach threshold) were measured by injecting 1-s steps of 25-pA current (12 steps from –25 pA to 250 pA). To measure AP widths, we evoked APs by injecting five short current steps (1500–2000 pA, 1-ms duration, 0.2 Hz). AP durations were calculated as the time interval between the up-stroke and down-stroke of the AP waveform at –10 mV. AP duration during the 80-Hz train was normalized to the AP duration at baseline, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Electrophysiology experiments were done without blinding.</p>

<title>Generation of plasmids and viruses</title>
<p>To generate adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) expressing cytoplasmic GCaMP6f (GCaMP6) and mitochondrial-targeted GCaMP6f (mitoGCaMP6), we used PCR to amplify the human synapsin promoter (hSyn) from pAAV-6P-SEWB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> The pAAV-GFP (Addgene plasmid 32395) was cut with <italic>Sna</italic>B1 and <italic>Sac</italic>1 to replace CMV with hsyn (pAAV-hsyn-GFP). <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Bam</italic>HI were used to replace GFP with mCherry to generate pAAV-hsyn-mCherry. To generate pAAV-hSyn-mCherry-2A-GCaMP6, oligonucleotides containing the coding sequence for the 2A peptide were used for PCR amplification of GCaMP6 from pGP-CMV-GCaMP6 (Addgene plasmid 40755). To generate pAAV-hSyn-mCherry-2A-mitoGCaMP6, oligonucleotides containing the coding sequence for the 2A peptide and the mitochondrial-targeting sequence (MSVLTPLLLRGLTGSARRLPVPRAKIHSL) were used for PCR amplification of GCaMP6 from pGP-CMV-GCaMP6 (Addgene plasmid 40755). To generate AAV-<italic>Slc25a4</italic> OE, we used PCR to amplify the open reading frame of <italic>Slc25a4</italic>. Drd2 open reading frame from AAV-CamKIIα-Drd2 OE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> was replaced with the <italic>Slc25a4</italic> open reading frame using <italic>Hin</italic>dIII. DNA sequencing was used to verify the absence of PCR-induced mutations. Lentivirus vector siRNA plasmids (control shRNA, 5′-TACGTCCAAGGTCGGGCAGGAAGA-3′ <italic>Slc25a4</italic> shRNA1, 5′-GCAAGGGATCTTCCCAGCGAGAATTCAAT-3′ <italic>Slc25a4</italic> shRNA2, 5′-CGTTTGACACTGTTCGTCGTAGGATGATG-3′ <italic>Slc25a4</italic> shRNA3, 5′-GCACATTATCGTGAGCTGGATGATTGCCC-3′) were generated by Applied Biological Materials (Richmond, BC, Canada).

<title>Two-photon imaging of presynaptic calcium and <italic>in vivo</italic> injections</title>
<p>Two-photon laser-scanning microscopy was performed using an Ultima imaging system (Prairie Technologies, Middleton, WI, USA), a Ti:sapphire Chameleon Ultra femtosecond-pulsed laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and × 60 (0.9 NA) water-immersion IR objectives (Olympus, Center Valley, PA, USA). Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) transients in presynaptic terminals were recorded using GCaMP6 expressed in the CA3 hippocampal neurons.</p>
<p>To express GCaMP6, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (2% for induction and 1.5% for maintenance) in 100% oxygen, and their heads were restrained on a stereotaxic apparatus. An approximately 1-cm midline incision was made centered about 0.25 cm behind bregma. Viruses were injected into three locations within the CA3 region, in one or both hemispheres. The stereotaxic coordinates for the three injections were as follows, in relation to the bregma: (1) –1.5 mm anteroposterior, 1.8 mm lateral, and 1.7 mm deep; (2) 2.2 mm anteroposterior, 2.3 mm lateral and 1.8 mm deep; (3) 2.5 mm anteroposterior, 2.8 mm lateral and 2.2 mm deep. Craniotomy holes were drilled at these locations, and 200 nl of AAVs was slowly (20 nl min<sup>−1</sup>) injected via a 33G cannula. After each injection, the cannula was left in place for 2–3 min before being retracted. Following injections, the skin was sutured, and the mice were allowed to recover before returning to the holding cages. Imaging experiments were performed 4–7 weeks after AAV injections. During each experiment, care was taken to limit the differences in post-injection durations to a maximum of 2–3 days across experimental groups to avoid substantial differences in the levels of AAV expression.</p>
<p>To visualize GCaMP6 or mitoGCaMP6, we used brain slices prepared from AAV-injected mice. Schaffer collaterals were stimulated via field stimulation using bipolar stimulating electrodes, as in STP experiments. In addition to D-AP5 and picrotoxin, the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX (3 μ<sc>m</sc>) was added to the bath ACSF to prevent excitation of postsynaptic neurons. GCaMP6 was visualized at 940 nm, and mCherry was visualized at 1040 nm by two Ti:Si lasers. Presynaptic boutons were identified in a 34 μm × 34 μm region of interest by activity-dependent increase in GCaMP6 fluorescence during time-series scans. Line-scans through identified boutons were then used for experiments. Boutons from 4 to 8 regions of interests in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 area were imaged for each mouse. In some experiments, we used whole-cell recordings from CA3 neurons and filled the cells with Alexa Fluor 594 (30 μ<sc>m</sc>) and Fluo 5 F (300 μ<sc>m</sc>) at 820 nm to visualize presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Axons emanating from the cell bodies were identified based on their morphology and lack of spines. Presynaptic terminals were identified as boutons in secondary and tertiary axonal branches. Those axons could not be tracked beyond 200 μm from the CA3 cell bodies due to the limitation of the approach. APs were evoked by holding the cells at –70 mV (current clamp mode) and injecting depolarizing current (3.5–4.0 nA, 500 μs). We recorded Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in line-scan mode from 3 to 7 boutons per cell. For GCaMP6 or mitoGCaMP6 experiments, the baseline fluorescence (<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>) was used to calculate the change in signal (Δ<italic>F/F</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>). For Fluo 5F experiments, fluorescence changes <italic>(</italic>Δ<italic>G/R</italic>) were quantified as an increase in Fluo 5F fluorescence (Δ<italic>G</italic>) normalized to the respective Alexa 594 fluorescence (<italic>R</italic>). Imaging experiments were done without blinding.</p>

<title>Two-photon glutamate uncaging</title>
<p>For two-photon glutamate uncaging (TGU), MNI glutamate (2.5 m<sc>m</sc>) was added to the recording ACSF. The timing and intensity of glutamate uncaging were controlled by TriggerSync (Prairie Technologies). In typical experiments, 0.2-ms pulses from a second Ti:sapphire Chameleon Ultra laser (720 nm) were delivered to the vicinity of a targeted dendritic spine, and TGU-evoked EPSCs (uEPSCs) were recorded. The duration and intensity of illumination of the uncaging laser were then adjusted to induce responses that mimicked spontaneous miniature EPSCs, which were recorded in CA1 neurons and averaged 10–15 pA. After the uncaging parameters (i.e., site, laser duration and laser intensity) were adjusted for a single spine, the parameters remained constant for the STP experiments on the particular spine. An 80-Hz train of 100 TGU pulses was delivered to a single dendritic spine to measure TGU-induced STP.</p>

<title>Electron microscopy</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized with ethyl carbamate (1.5 g kg<sup>−1</sup>, 25% solution, intraperitoneal) and perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline for 1–2 min and then a fixative (2.5% gluteraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.2 <sc>m</sc> sodium cacodylate). Brains were isolated, stored at 4 °C overnight in the same fixative and sagittal sections (100-μm-thick) were prepared on a vibratome (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). Smaller regions (~500 μm × 500 μm) containing the stratum radiatum of the CA1 hippocampal region were processed for three-dimensional (3D) scanning electron microscopy. The samples were stained with a modified heavy-metal-staining method, processed through a graded series of alcohol and propylene oxide, and then embedded in Epon hard resin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> Sections (0.5-μm-thick) were cut to determine the correct area and then coated with iridium in a Denton Desk II sputter coater (Denton Vacuum, Moorestown, NJ, USA). The 3D EM images were collected on a Helios Nanolab 660 Dualbeam system (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA). From the 3D stacks of electron micrographs (10 × 10 × 10 nm voxel size, 250–260 sections of 10-nm thickness and approximately 30 × 20 μm area), synapses were identified based on the presence of postsynaptic densities and presynaptic vesicles. The mitochondria in presynaptic terminals were identified and counted manually.</p>
<p>For transmission electron microscopy, 100-μm-thick vibratome sections containing the CA1 stratum radiatum region were prepared as described above and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 <sc>m</sc> sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Sections were post fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1<sc> m</sc> sodium cacodylate buffer with 0.3% potassium ferrocyanide for 1.5 h. After rinsing in the same buffer, the sections were dehydrated through a series of graded ethanol and propylene oxide solutions, infiltrated and embedded in epoxy resin, and polymerized at 70 °C overnight. Thin sections (0.5 μm) were stained with toluidine blue for examination by light microscopy. Ultrathin sections (80 nm) were cut and imaged using a Tecnai F 20 FEG Electron Microscope (FEI) with a XR41 Camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Woburn, MA, USA).</p>

<title>Mitochondrial DNA quantification</title>
<p>RNA was isolated from the hippocampus of 4-month-old mice by using the mirVana RNA isolation kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA). The SuperScript III reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) was used to synthesize cDNA from 1 μg RNA. The following primers were used in the qPCR experiments: COI (5′-GCCCCAGATATAGCATTCCC-3′ and 5′-GTTCATCCTGTTCCTGCTCC-3′); ND2 (5′-CCCATTCCACTTCTGATTACC-3′ and 5′-ATGATAGTAGAGTTGAGTAGCG-3′); 18 S (5′-TAGAGGGACAAGTGGCGTTC-3′ and 5′-CGCTGAGCCAGTCAGTGT-3′). The ratio of mitochondrial (CO1 and ND2) transcripts to the nuclear 18S transcript was used to quantify relative mitochondrial DNA.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial respiration</title>
<p>Mice were decapitated, and their brains were dissected immediately in cold (4 °C) dissecting ACSF. Hippocampi were removed and washed in a mitochondrial isolation buffer containing 250 m<sc>m</sc> sucrose, 1 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> bovine serum albumin, 5 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA and 10 m<sc>m</sc> Tris-HCl at pH 7.4. A crude mitochondrial fraction was then isolated by differential centrifugation. Briefly, the hippocampal tissue was finely minced on a pre-chilled glass dish, washed several times, resuspended in 1 ml mitochondrial isolation buffer and homogenized in a 2-ml Dounce homogenizer (glass/glass, 5–7 runs in an ice bath). The homogenized tissue was centrifuged at 700 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min; the supernatant was then transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube and centrifuged at 7000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The resulting pellet was washed in 1 ml mitochondrial isolation buffer and resuspended in 30 μl mitochondrial isolation buffer. The protein concentration in the pellet was typically 25–35 mg protein ml<sup>−1</sup>. The mitochondrial integrity was tested by measuring the glutamate/malate-dependent respiratory control ratio (i.e., State III/State IV of respiration). The resulting mitochondrial samples were used immediately to measure respiration (mitochondrial oxygen consumption) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-retention capacity.</p>
<p>Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was measured using a Clark-type electrode (Hansatech Instruments, Norfolk, UK) in a thermostatically controlled chamber equipped with a magnetic stirring device and a gas-tight stopper fitted with a narrow port for additions via a Hamilton microsyringe. Isolated mitochondria were placed in the respiration chamber at 37 °C in 0.4 ml respiration buffer (250 m<sc>m</sc> sucrose, 1 g l<sup>−1</sup> bovine serum albumin, 10 m<sc>m</sc> KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.7 m<sc>m</sc> KCl, 3 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 40 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES, 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> EGTA, pH 7.1) to yield a final concentration of 0.5 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>. State III respiration was stimulated by the addition of 2 m<sc>m</sc> ADP. Respiratory control ratios were obtained by dividing the rate of oxygen consumption in the presence of ADP (state III) by that in the absence of ADP (state IV). The measurement protocol involved sequential addition (with 5-min intervals) of 5 m<sc>m</sc> glutamate, 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> malate (activating the CI–CIII–CIV span), 1 μ<sc>m</sc> rotenone, 10 m<sc>m</sc> succinate (activating the CII–CIII–CIV span), 1 μ<sc>m</sc> antymicin A, 10 m<sc>m</sc> ascorbate, 0.4 m<sc>m</sc> TMPD (activating the CIV span) and 5 m<sc>m</sc> KCN. The rates of oxygen consumption were calculated online, as first derivatives of the dioxygen-content changes by manufacturer-provided software.</p>

<title>Mouse behavior</title>
<p>Mature animals (16–20 weeks) were used for all behavior experiments.</p>
<sec>
<title>Morris water maze</title>
<p>One hour prior to testing, animals were brought into the testing room and allowed to habituate. Testing was performed during the animal’s inactive phase under dim-light conditions. Mice were allowed to navigate in the maze, and swim patterns were recorded with a video camera tracking system (HVS Image, Buckingham, UK) mounted above the pool. Animals learned to find a hidden, clear platform by using the standard spatial version of the Morris water maze task for four successive days. Each day, animals were given four 1-min trials from each starting position with an intertrial latency of 60 s. The order of the starting locations was counterbalanced each day by using a Latin-square design. A spatial learning (probe) trial was administered 1 h after the completion of spatial training. A spatial memory (probe) trial was administered 48 h after completion of the spatial learning. During both probe trials, the platform was removed, and the mice received a single 1-min trial in which the animals tried to find the escape platform. These trials originated from the starting location that was the farthest from the platform’s location throughout training. Mice also completed a nonspatial learning task at least 7 days after completion of the spatial protocol. In that task, mice were trained to find a black visible platform for two successive days. During day 1, the escape platform was located in the same position used during spatial training. The next day, the escape platform was moved to a new quadrant. Each day, the mouse was given four 1-min trials in the same manner that occurred during spatial training. To avoid hypothermia, immediately after each round of training and testing trials, animals were dried with paper towels and placed in warmed holding cages.</p>

<sec>
<title>Delayed non-matched-to-position task</title>
<p>To motivate mice to complete the delayed non-matched-to-position task, they were subjected to water restriction for 2 days prior to testing. Specifically, mice were allowed 2 h of free access to water per day. Mice were weighed daily to ensure that weight decrease during deprivation did not surpass the recommended 20% loss. One hour prior to testing, animals were brought into the testing room and allowed to habituate. Testing was performed during the animal’s inactive phase under well-lit lighting conditions. The testing apparatus consisted of a Y-maze (Clever Sys, Reston, VA, USA) with a start arm (20 cm × 16 cm × 7 cm; <italic>l</italic> × <italic>w</italic> × <italic>h</italic>) leading to two goal arms (20 cm × 16 cm × 7 cm). Mice were allowed to habituate to the maze and were given a positive reinforcer (i.e., Chocolate Yoohoo) before behavioral testing. To achieve this, mice were allowed to investigate the Y-maze baited with Yoohoo for 15 min. Maze habituation was performed for two consecutive days.</p>
<p>After maze habituation was complete and the animal had consumed the food rewards, we conducted a test of spatial working memory. First, the mouse was constrained in the start arm with a guillotine door. Next, a sample arm was determined at random and the choice arm was closed off with a guillotine door. There was a limit of two consecutive same-side sample arms in a 10-trial test. Both arms were then baited with 20 μl Yoohoo. The mouse was released from the start chamber and allowed to run to the sample arm and consume the reward. The mouse was then returned to the start arm and the guillotine door to the nonsample arm was removed. All efforts were made to keep the intratrial interval at 5 s. The mouse was again released from the start chamber and allowed to run to either the previously entered sample arm or new choice arm to consume the reward. A return to the sample arm was counted as an incorrect response. Incorrect responses resulted in no reward and return to the start arm. A total of 10 trials were given.</p>

<title>The Y-maze spatial recognition</title>
<p>The maze was shaped like a ‘Y’, with three equally spaced arms (20 cm × 7 cm × 16 cm) radiating from a triangular center section. The Y-maze was constructed from blue opaque plastic to aid in video detection. The maze was located in a lit room with abundant extra-maze cues. The procedure consisted of an acquisition and a recognition session. During the acquisition session, the mouse was placed facing the distal end of an arm (start arm; determined semirandomly) and allowed to freely explore the maze for 15 min. During acquisition, the mouse was allowed to freely explore two of the three arms (determined semirandomly). After completing the acquisition session, the mouse was returned to its home cage for 1 h. Next, the mouse was given a 2-min recognition session, where all three arms were available for the mouse to freely explore. Time spent in each arm and the triangular center section and the total distance traveled during each trial were automatically recorded using TopScan software (Clever Sys). Mice prefer novelty; therefore, if a mouse recognized and remembered which arms were familiar during the recognition session, the mouse would spend more time in the novel arm (expressed as a percent of total arm time) than would be expected by chance.</p>

<sec>
<title>Acoustic startle and prepulse inhibition</title>
<p>Each day before testing, the mice were allowed a 1-h habituation in the testing room after being transported from the animal housing room. Before experiments were initiated, the mice were allowed to acclimate to the Plexiglas restraint chamber (6 cm × 6 cm × 4.8 cm) for 20 min. Acoustic startle and prepulse inhibition (PPI) tests were performed in ventilated, sound-attenuated chambers (Med Associates, St. Albans City, VT, USA). For acoustic-startle experiments, the mice had a 5-min acclimation period to a 65-dB background white noise, which played throughout the session. Three startle pulses (8 kHz, 120 dB, 40 ms) were then delivered at 15-s intertrial intervals.</p>
<p>For PPI experiments (conducted on different days than acoustic-startle experiments), mice had a 5-min acclimation period to a 65-dB background white noise, which played throughout the session. Three acoustic startles (broadband white noise click, 120 dB, 40 ms) were then delivered separated by a 15-s intertrial interval. The testing session consisted of 39 trials of 5 trial types: pulse alone, in which the startle pulse was presented; the combination of a 40-ms prepulse of 74, 82 or 90 dB preceding the startle pulse by 100 ms; and no stimuli. Trials were separated by 15 s and presented in a pseudo-random order. PPI was calculated as follows: 100 × (pulse-alone response−prepulse + pulse response)/pulse-alone response. All mouse behavior experiments were performed in a blind manner in respect to mouse genotypes.</p>

<p>AAV5-<italic>hSyn-mCherry-2A-mitoGCaMP6f</italic> or AAV5-<italic>hSyn-mCherry-2A-GCaMP6f</italic> viruses were injected <italic>in vivo</italic> into the mouse hippocampus as described above. Four weeks after injections, mice were killed and dorsal hippocampi were isolated at 4 °C for fractionation into nuclear/cell debris, cytoplasm and crude mitochondrial fractions. Freshly extracted hippocampi from each mouse were homogenized in isolation buffer (250 m<sc>m</sc> sucrose, 75 m<sc>m</sc> mannitol, 1 m<sc>m</sc> EGTA and 5 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES, at pH 7.4) by using a glass-teflon tissue homogenizer on ice. Homogenized hippocampi were centrifuged twice at 1400 <italic>g</italic> for 3 min at 4 °C to separate nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 17 200 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C to separate cytosol and crude mitochondria. Ice-cold RIPA buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas TX, USA) with protease inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was added to the mitochondria but not the cytoplasmic fraction, and both were briefly sonicated. Samples were centrifuged at 17 200 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was kept at −80 °C for protein quantification. Protein quantification was performed using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For loading-sample preparation, we used NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>
<p>The western blot experiments were performed similar to a previously described method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> Briefly, NuPAGE 10% Bis-Tris gels and MES-SDS running buffer (Life Technologies) were used to load mitochondria and cytoplasmic fractions (10 μg total protein/well) and run the gels. The primary antibody used to detect GCaMP6 was rabbit-anti-GFP (1:1000; Abcam, 6556, Cambridge, MA, USA). We also used rabbit-anti-Prohibitin 1 (1:1000; Thermo Scientific, PA5-12274) and mouse-anti-β-actin (1:10 000; Sigma-Aldrich, 5316, St. Louis, MO, USA) primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies were Odyssey goat–anti-rabbit IRDye-680LT (1:40 000; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA, 926-68021) or Odyssey donkey–anti-mouse IRDye-800CW (1:15 000, LI-COR Biosciences, 926-32212).

<title>Subcellular localization of mitoGCaMP6 and GCaMP6</title>
<p>Neuro-2a (N2a) mouse neuroblastoma cells (ATCC, CCL-131, Manassas, VA, USA) were plated in four-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek 177399, Thermo-Fisher Scientific) at 1.25 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well and maintained in culture using Eagle’s medium essential media (ATCC) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (heat inactivated; Life Technologies) and 1 × PenStrep (Life Technologies) in an incubator at 37 °C and 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Following a 24-h incubation, cells were transfected with <italic>hSyn-mCherry-2A-mitoGCaMP6f</italic> or <italic>hSyn-mCherry-2A-GCaMP6f</italic> plasmids (0.5 μg DNA/well) using Fugene HD transfection reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) (Ration Fugene HD/DNA 1:4) in serum-free Eagle’s medium essential media. Twenty-four hours later, cells were supplemented with additional fresh complete media, and 48 h later, they were incubated in complete media with Mitotracker DeepRed (1:2000, Life Technologies) for 15 min at 37 °C. Next, Mitotracker was washed out and replaced with fresh complete media, and cells were placed back to the incubator for 15–20 min. Cells were then washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Following fixation, cells were washed three times for 5 min with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with 10% normal goat serum and 0.1% TritonX-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. We used the following antibodies: chicken-anti-GFP to detect GCaMP6 or mitoGCaMP6 (1:1000; Abcam, 13970) and goat-anti-chicken-Alexa-488 (1:1000; Life Technologies, A11039).

<title>Abnormal presynaptic augmentation underlies aberrant STP in <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice</title>
<p>To determine whether haploinsufficiency of distal genes in the 22q11DS region contributes to hippocampal pathophysiology, we used <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup><italic>+/</italic>−</sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> carrying a hemizygous deletion of six genes: <italic>Cldn5</italic>, <italic>Cdc45l</italic>, <italic>Ufd1l</italic>, <italic>2510002D24Rik</italic>, <italic>Mrpl40</italic> and <italic>Hira</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Similar to the late onset of SCZ symptoms, synaptic plasticity abnormalities in mouse models of 22q11DS do not appear until later in life;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> thus, we used 4- to 5-month-old mice for these experiments. <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice developed normally and had no visible gross morphologic abnormalities (data not shown).</p>
<p>Using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique, we recorded excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) at glutamatergic synapses between CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus (CA3–CA1 synapses) by electrically stimulating Schaffer collaterals. Basal synaptic transmission measured as the input–output relation between stimulation intensity and EPSCs in <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice was comparable to that of WT littermates (F<sub>(1,12)</sub>=1.435, <italic>P</italic>=0.231) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). EPSC kinetics, such as rise time (<italic>t</italic><sub>(19)</sub>=0.442, <italic>P</italic>=0.663), half-width (<italic>U</italic>=51, <italic>P</italic>=0.805) and decay time (<italic>t</italic><sub>(19)</sub>=0.0377, <italic>P</italic>=0.970) were also normal between mutants and controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). However, an 80-Hz train (100 stimuli) applied to Schaffer collaterals evoked a substantially larger STP (<italic>t</italic><sub>(16)</sub>=2.196; <italic>P</italic>=0.010) in <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Because STP is not a unitary process but rather consists of several temporally and mechanistically distinct components (e.g., facilitation, augmentation and depression of presynaptic transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup>), we measured STP components individually.</p>
<p>The STP increase in <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants could arise from the increased facilitation/augmentation, decreased short-term depression or a combination thereof.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> To differentiate among these possibilities, we used an established protocol to separate STP components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> and assess their individual contributions to the STP increase in <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice. First, using the paired-pulse ratios of two consecutive EPSCs, we found no significant difference (F<sub>(1,5)</sub>=2.142, <italic>P</italic>=0.146) in facilitation between <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We then examined whether the increased STP in <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice resulted from reduced short-term depression. We examined the recovery from depression by using a 5-Hz stimulus train applied during the first 5 s after the 80-Hz train of Schaffer collateral stimuli. Because recovery from depression overlaps with the decay of augmentation during those 5 s, the actual EPSC peak amplitude reflects the net effect of the two processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> To isolate the depression component, we corrected the synaptic responses for contribution from augmentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Methods</xref>).

<p>Next, we assessed the role of augmentation, which is the longest-lasting component of STP and operates on a time scale of tens of seconds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Using a previously reported approach,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> we isolated augmentation by applying a single stimulus to Schaffer collaterals every 5 s for 2 min, starting 5 s after the 80-Hz train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).

This increased augmentation in <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice was maximal at the onset and decayed to normal values after 20 s. Elevated augmentation in <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mutants was not sensitive to the Serca inhibitor thapsigargin (4 μ<sc>m</sc>) (without thapsigargin: <italic>t</italic><sub>(16)</sub>=4.404, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; with thapsigargin: <italic>t</italic><sub>(10)</sub>=1.954, <italic>P</italic>=0.0396) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2a</xref>).

To ensure that the STP increase in <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice originated from the presynaptic CA3 neurons, we examined the role of the postsynaptic component by performing TGU (100 TGU pulses, 80 Hz) to activate individual dendritic spines on CA1 neurons, the postsynaptic sites of CA3 inputs. Because TGU focally releases exogenous glutamate from inactive (caged) glutamate (MNI glutamate), thereby bypassing the release of endogenous neurotransmitter from CA3 terminals, this method tests only postsynaptic mechanisms of synaptic transmission and plasticity. TGU-induced STP did not differ (<italic>t</italic><sub>(25)</sub>=–0.405, <italic>P</italic>=0.689) between <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and WT littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3a</xref>), suggesting that the causative locus of the abnormal STP increase in <italic>Df(16)5</italic> mutants resides in the presynaptic CA3 neurons. CA3 pyramidal neuron recordings revealed that presynaptic neurons had normal resting membrane potential (<italic>t</italic><sub>(18)</sub>=–1.621, <italic>P</italic>=0.122), input resistance (<italic>t</italic><sub>(18)</sub>=0.978, <italic>P</italic>=0.341) and depolarization-induced APs (rheobase: <italic>t</italic><sub>(18)</sub>=0.451, <italic>P</italic>=0.658; AP width: <italic>t</italic><sub>(18)</sub>=0.384, <italic>P</italic>=0.706) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3b</xref>).

<title>Dysregulation of activity-dependent presynaptic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in <italic>Mrpl40</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice</title>
<p>Because mitochondria also regulate presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, we measured activity-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in response to the 80-Hz stimulation of Schaffer collaterals in presynaptic CA3 terminals in the hippocampal stratum radiatum (CA1 area). To this end, we took advantage of the highly sensitive genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6f (GCaMP6).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> After infecting the CA3 area of the hippocampus <italic>in vivo</italic> with recombinant AAVs encoding mCherry and GCaMP6, we observed high expression of fluorescent proteins in neuronal cell bodies in the CA3 area but not in the CA1 area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In the stratum radiatum we observed fluorescent boutons, which responded to 80-Hz electrical stimulation (10 pulses) of Schaffer collaterals with GCaMP6 fluorescence transients with fast rise and decay (rise time<sub>20–80%</sub>, 100.46±4.03 ms; decay time (<italic>τ</italic>), 222.71±9.40 ms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). These activity-dependent kinetics of GCaMP6 fluorescence were similar to those observed in CA3 presynaptic terminals in which the inorganic Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Fluo 5F was used (data not shown), suggesting that GCaMP6 reliably measures cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in presynaptic terminals. The activity-dependent increase in GCaMP6 fluorescence during the 80-Hz train of stimulations was substantially higher (<italic>U</italic>=537, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) in <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice than in their WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), which is consistent with the notion that higher presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels lead to elevated augmentation and STP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>To directly measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the mitochondria of CA3 axons and terminals, we expressed GCaMP6 with a mitochondrial-localization signal (mitoGCaMP6) in the CA3 area using recombinant AAVs and imaged in the CA1 area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). We verified the specific localization of mitoGCaMP6 to mitochondria using subcellular fractionation followed by western blotting and co-immunolocalization with mitochondrial markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). We also verified that the activity-dependent increase in mitoGCaMP6 fluorescence was sensitive to an inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter Ru360 (10 μ<sc>m</sc>) (<italic>U</italic>=15, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>). An 80-Hz train (10 pulses) applied to the Schaffer collaterals induced an activity-dependent increase in mitoGCaMP6 but with substantially slower kinetics compared with cytosolic GCaMP6 (mitoGCaMP6: rise time<sub>20–80%</sub>, 210.21±27.03 ms, decay time&gt;1 s; GCaMP6: rise time<sub>20–80%</sub>, 100.46±4.03 ms; decay time (<italic>τ</italic>), 222.71±9.40 ms; <italic>U</italic>=540, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Similar to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> was elevated (<italic>U</italic>=889, <italic>P</italic>=0.020) in <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice in response to the 80-Hz synaptic stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).

<title>Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>-extrusion deficit underlies STP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> phenotypes in <italic>Mrpl40</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice</title>
<p>The abnormally high increase in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced by the 80-Hz synaptic stimulation in <italic>Mrpl40</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice coincided with the enhanced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase. A role for slow mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion in STP has been implicated in the crayfish neuromuscular junction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> and led us to hypothesize that our results in the hippocampus could also be explained by impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion from mitochondria. Two major mechanisms extrude Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytoplasm: mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers and the mPTP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> The selective antagonist of the mitochondrial Na<sup>+</sup>–Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger, CGP 37157 (5 μ<sc>m</sc>), had no effect on STP or augmentation in WT mice (STP: <italic>t</italic><sub>(18)</sub>=0.999, <italic>P</italic>=0.333; augmentation: <italic>t</italic><sub>(18)</sub>=1.007, <italic>P</italic>=0.330), suggesting that this Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion mechanism is not required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling by mitochondria during 80-Hz-induced synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S11</xref>). However, BKA (2 μ<sc>m</sc>), a non-selective inhibitor of the adenine nucleotide (ADP/ATP) translocases (ANTs),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> which are required for sensitivity of mPTP to calcium,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> significantly increased STP and augmentation (STP: <italic>U</italic>=14, <italic>P</italic>=0.005; augmentation: <italic>t</italic><sub>(19)</sub>=–3.169, <italic>P</italic>=0.005) in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures S12a and c</xref>).

AAV-<italic>Slc25a4</italic> OE expressed in the CA3 area of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) rescued STP and augmentation in <italic>Mrpl40</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice (STP: <italic>U</italic>=15, <italic>P</italic>=0.005; augmentation: <italic>t</italic><sub>(22)</sub>=2.543, <italic>P</italic>=0.019) but did not affect WT littermates (STP: <italic>t</italic><sub>(16)</sub>=0.566, <italic>P</italic>=0.578; augmentation: <italic>t</italic><sub>(16)</sub>=–0.654, <italic>P</italic>=0.522) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S16</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm that the BKA-induced reduction in mPTP function mimics the <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> phenotype, we downregulated Slc25a4 by using the shRNA approach. To that end, we injected lentiviruses encoding three different shRNAs against <italic>Slc25a4</italic> into the CA3 area of the hippocampus. STP and augmentation of synaptic transmission at CA3–CA1 synapses increased in WT mice infected with all three <italic>Slc25a4</italic> shRNAs compared with the control shRNA (shRNA1 STP: <italic>t</italic><sub>(13)</sub>=–1.882, <italic>P</italic>=0.041; augmentation: <italic>U</italic>=9, <italic>P</italic>=0.029; shRNA2 STP: <italic>t</italic><sub>(15)</sub>=–1.910, <italic>P</italic>=0.04; augmentation: <italic>t</italic><sub>(17)</sub>=−2.757, <italic>P</italic>=0.014; shRNA3 STP: <italic>U</italic>=9, <italic>P</italic>=0.02; augmentation: <italic>t</italic><sub>(13)</sub>=−2.475, <italic>P</italic>=0.028) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S17</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Approximately 30% of patients with 22q11DS meet the diagnostic criteria for SCZ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Cognitive symptoms of SCZ include deficits in working memory, attention, executive function, and learning and memory; these symptoms have a more prognostic value than do the positive or negative symptoms of the disease, and they contribute more to the patients’ functional disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> The mechanisms underlying the cognitive deficits in SCZ and 22q11DS are still debated. Here we presented evidence that 22q11DS affects working memory and STP through a novel pathogenic mechanism––abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling by mitochondria. We also elucidated several features of this pathogenic mechanism: (1) By screening mice carrying hemizygous deletions of individual genes mapped within the distal part of the 22q11 microdeletion, we identified <italic>Mrpl40</italic> as a culprit gene that causes abnormal STP. (2) We identified that the augmentation component of STP is specifically affected. (3) <italic>Mrpl40</italic> haploinsufficiency led to abnormal STP through mitochondria-mediated deregulation of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. (4) We pinpointed a functional abnormality in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion through the mPTP as a pathogenic mechanism caused by <italic>Mrpl40</italic> haploinsufficiency. (5) <italic>Mrpl40</italic> haploinsufficiency led to deficits in working memory but not in long-term plasticity or long-term memory.</p>
<p>The hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and interactions between these brain regions all contribute to working memory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref></sup> Deficits in working memory in patients with SCZ and/or 22q11DS are well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> STP, an associative, short-lived synaptic strengthening, is considered a cellular correlate of short-term memory, a term often used synonymously with working memory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> Consistent with this notion, deficits in STP are well established in animal models of SCZ and 22q11DS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because symptoms of SCZ typically appear during late adolescence or early adulthood, age appears to be an important variable in synaptic plasticity phenotypes associated with 22q11DS mice. In our experiments, we used mice that were older than 4 months. At this age, STP and long-term potentiation at CA3–CA1 synapses are substantially increased in <italic>Df(16)1</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mouse models of 22q11DS, whereas at younger ages, both forms of synaptic plasticity are normal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> These experiments led to the identification of the microRNA-processing gene <italic>Dgcr8</italic> as the culprit gene residing in the proximal part of the microdeletion affecting both short- and long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Deletion of one allele of <italic>Dgcr8</italic> causes depletion of <italic>miR-185</italic> and <italic>miR-25</italic> and post-transcriptional upregulation of Serca2 in the forebrain of older but not younger mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because 22q11DS is a multigene syndrome, it is extremely likely that more than one gene is involved in STP abnormalities. Our present work showed that deletion of one allele of <italic>Mrpl40</italic> residing in the distal part of the microdeletion, which is outside of the <italic>Df(16)1</italic> genomic region, caused <italic>Dgcr8</italic>-independent deficits in STP and working memory in 22q11DS. First, we identified the STP increase in <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, which were hemizygous for genes that mapped distally to <italic>Dgcr8</italic>. The STP screen revealed that only <italic>Mrpl40</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice replicated the <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> phenotype. Furthermore, the <italic>Mrpl40-</italic>related STP increase was mechanistically distinct from the STP increase identified in <italic>Dgcr8</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice. <italic>Dgcr8</italic> haploinsufficiency elevates the Serca2 protein,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> but in the <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, Serca2 levels were normal, and the Serca inhibitor thapsigragin did not rescue the STP defect.</p>
<p><italic>Mrpl40</italic> was originally identified as a nuclear gene involved in mitochondrial function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref></sup> Mitochondrial dysfunction has been strongly implicated in SCZ pathophysiology,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup> though the exact connection between SCZ pathogenesis and mitochondria has not been established. For instance, the gene encoding DISC1 (disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1) has been localized to mitochondria and is involved in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and regulating mitochondrial transport.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup> Several mitochondrial genes, including <italic>Mrpl40</italic>, are mapped within the 22q11.2 locus and expressed in the brain throughout development, thus implicating mitochondria in the pathogenesis of 22q11DS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup>
<italic>Mrpl40</italic> haploinsufficiency does not affect the mitochondrial ultrastructure and does not reduce mitochondrial numbers in presynaptic terminals or total mitochondrial DNA, which is consistent with the view that SCZ is not a neurodegenerative disease. This is also consistent with our observations that <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> or <italic>Mrpl40</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice develop normally and have normal gross brain morphology.</p>
<p>Mitochondria provide energy through oxidative phosphorylation and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics during synaptic transmission in neurons. Because of the mitochondrion’s high capacity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, it acts as a rapid buffering system during periods of intense synaptic activity, then slowly releases Ca<sup>2+</sup> when activity subsides. This rapid uptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into mitochondria occurs through channels (i.e., voltage-dependent anion channel VDAC1) in the outer membrane and the mitochondrial calcium uniporter in the inner membrane. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is slowly released from the mitochondria through the calcium exchangers and via the mPTP. mPTP has been shown to open during high-frequency stimulation in mammalian neurons, and that transient activation of the mPTP may play a role in the normal contribution of mitochondria to STP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>Oxidative phosphorylation appeared to be normal, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in presynaptic terminals was substantially altered in <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and <italic>Mrpl40</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice. Our two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in presynaptic terminals revealed that synaptic high-frequency stimulation that induces STP evokes enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in both the presynaptic mitochondrial matrix and presynaptic cytosol of mutant mice. These data argue for a problem with mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion rather than with mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. Indeed, if <italic>Mrpl40</italic> haploinsufficiency reduced the Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake into mitochondria, we would expect to see increased amplitudes of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients but <italic>decreased</italic> Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients within mitochondria. Our data are more consistent with a model for a reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion from mitochondria. Impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion from mitochondria will result in Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in the mitochondrial matrix, and this will contribute to the fast rise in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> that we observed with mitoGCaMP6. This will then reduce the effective mitochondrial buffering capacity and lead to enhanced cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that we observed with the cytoplasmic GCaMP6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Moreover, slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion from mitochondria (evident from extremely slow decay times of mitoGCaMP6) is an unlikely contributor to fast cytosol Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that occur during high-frequency synaptic activity.</p>
<p>Because inhibition of mPTP but not the mitochondrial Na<sup>+</sup>–Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger increased presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in WT mice, we concluded that the main route of Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion from mitochondria during STP is mPTP. In WT mice, the pharmacological or molecular inhibition of mPTP with BKA or <italic>Slc25a4</italic> shRNA, respectively, mimicked the STP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transient phenotypes we observed in <italic>Df(16)5</italic><sup>+/−</sup> and <italic>Mrpl40</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice. Moreover, AAV-<italic>Slc25a4</italic> OE rescued the STP abnormality in <italic>Mrpl40</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, indicating that deletion of one allele of <italic>Mrpl40</italic> causes mPTP deficiency and STP increase.</p>
<p>Although our experiments demonstrated that <italic>Mrpl40</italic> haploinsufficiency leads to abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling by mitochondria during STP, the exact connection between Mrpl40 and mPTP function remains unclear. Some pharmacological agents that affect mPTP function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref></sup> can be beneficial adjuvants to antipsychotics to alleviate SCZ symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref></sup> However, because mPTP is involved not only in Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion from mitochondria but also in ATP transport, we cannot rule out the possibility that impaired mPTP regulation leads to the abnormal production of ATP in presynaptic terminals, which in turn could result in abnormal presynaptic function. This theory could be addressed using a novel ATP probe that visualizes ATP dynamics in the presynaptic terminals of neurons in culture, but those experiments have not yet been tailored for acute brain slices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, we report that haploinsufficiency of <italic>Mrpl40,</italic> a gene mapped within the 22q11.2 microdeletion associated with SCZ, causes deficient working memory. This behavioral abnormality, which typically manifests in patients with SCZ, is associated with abnormal STP changes in synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and caused by elevated presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion from mitochondria.</p>
