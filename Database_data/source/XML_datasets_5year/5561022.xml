<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Over the past decade, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as critical regulatory elements in brain development and function. Different classes of ncRNAs with important roles in synaptic development, maturation and plasticity have been identified, including microRNAs and long ncRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The primate ncRNA <italic>BC200</italic> (Brain Cytoplasmic 200) has been implicated in neurodegenerative and neoplastic processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, while the rodent <italic>BC1</italic> RNA was shown to affect susceptibility to audiogenic seizures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, exploratory behavior, and anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, the understanding of how these ncRNAs regulate brain function and behavior is still very limited.</p>
<p id="Par4">
<italic>BC1</italic> RNA was initially identified from rat brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and is highly expressed in the cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. <italic>BC1</italic> RNA localizes in both axons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and dendrites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, where it forms ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) with different protein partners, including the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, poly(A) binding protein 1 (PABP1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, the eukaryotic initiation factor 4 A (eIF4A)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and eIF4B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Some of these <italic>BC1</italic>-containing RNPs are involved in neuronal translational control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In particular, the FMRP-<italic>BC1</italic> complex represses translation of a defined subset of FMRP target mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and helps recruit additional factors such as cytoplasmic FMRP interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1), which are responsible for translation inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This function is of particular relevance at synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, where a fine-tuned regulation of local protein synthesis is crucial for spine structure and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">While <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice show no gross abnormalities in regional brain morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, they exhibit abnormal synaptic transmission in the striatum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, altered neuronal excitability in specific hippocampal regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and mild deficits in place learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a study performed in an outdoor open field revealed that absence of <italic>BC1</italic> RNA negatively impacts the survival rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, suggesting that this ncRNA could contribute to the plastic changes of neuronal connectivity in the neocortex required for the adaptive modulation of behavior. Yet, the involvement of <italic>BC1</italic> RNA in cortical physiology and plasticity is largely unknown.</p>
<p id="Par6">Here we explore the role of <italic>BC1</italic> RNA in the barrel cortex, a brain area that processes sensory input from the whiskers and is well-defined in terms of functional organization and developmental plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In the absence of <italic>BC1</italic> RNA, we observe an increased number of spines and an enlargement of the postsynaptic density (PSD), along with increased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic responses both ex vivo and in vivo. Furthermore, structural plasticity following sensory input deprivation and behavior requiring sensory processing are impaired in <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice.</p>

<title><italic>BC1</italic> RNA regulates dendritic complexity and spine formation</title>
<p id="Par7">Dysregulation of molecules involved in dendritic and spine patterning leads to diverse neuropsychiatric disorders, including Fragile X syndrome (FXS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Given the presence of <italic>BC1</italic> RNA in several messenger RNPs involved in synaptic development and function, the lack of <italic>BC1</italic> could have a detrimental impact on dendrite elaboration and spine formation. Dendritic complexity was analyzed in cultured cortical neurons transfected with EGFP and found to be reduced in neurons lacking <italic>BC1</italic> RNA (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a, b</xref>). Dendritic length was also decreased by ~ 20% in <italic>BC1</italic> KO neurons as compared to wild type (WT) neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). Next, we analyzed spine density in EGFP-transfected neurons from both genotypes. Remarkably, <italic>BC1</italic> KO neurons have ~ 50% more spines than WT neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). Thus, absence of <italic>BC1</italic> RNA causes robust effects on spine density and dendritic complexity, resembling alterations observed in neurons lacking FMRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> or with decreased levels of CYFIP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>

<p id="Par8">We next used the barrel cortex, a well-established model to study neuronal connectivity and plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, to investigate the role of <italic>BC1</italic> RNA in vivo. In situ hybridization on brain sections containing the barrel region revealed that <italic>BC1</italic> RNA is expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of barrel cortex neurons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Neurons from young adult mice, after the critical period of circuit formation and early developmental plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, were labeled using Golgi staining and subdivided into pyramidal neurons from layers 2/3 and 5 and stellate cells from layer 4 in the barrel region of the somatosensory cortex. Both apical and basal dendrites were analyzed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>). <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice displayed significantly higher spine density than WT mice in principal neurons from layers 2/3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref>) and in stellate neurons from layer 4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>). In contrast, no genotype differences were observed in layer 5 pyramidal neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref>).</p>

Remarkably, <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice have abnormally large spine heads as compared to WT mice (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a, b</xref>; WT: median 0.701 ± 0.27 µm, 25/75% percentiles, 0.431/0.917 µm, <italic>n</italic> = 1303; <italic>BC1</italic> KO: median 0.836 ± 0.27 µm, 25/75% percentiles, 0.539/0.971 µm, <italic>n</italic> = 2747). Given the bimodal distribution of spine head size (with peaks at 0.4 and 0.8 µm for WT and <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice, respectively; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>), spine heads were classified as either large or small (see Methods). <italic>BC1</italic> KO neurons showed a significantly higher proportion of spines with large head as compared to WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). Spine morphology was further analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) from high-pressure frozen sections containing the barrel cortex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>). Frequency distribution of the observed PSD length (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>, see Methods) revealed that <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice possess more spines with long PSD (24.9 vs. 31.1% for WT and <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice, respectively; <italic>χ</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = 4.22, *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), whereas WT animals have a greater proportion of spines with short PSD (24.9 vs. 17.4% for WT and <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice, respectively; <italic>χ</italic>
<sup>2</sup> = 8.11, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, the PSD was significantly longer in <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice (324.9 ± 4.5 nm) than in WT mice (307.7 ± 5.5 nm) (*<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test). We also performed a staining with phosphotungstic acid, which allows a better visualization of the PSD with TEM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). Consistent with the data obtained with high-pressure frozen preparations, the PSD length was significantly increased in <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice as compared to their WT littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>). Likewise, the thickness of the PSD was also enhanced in mice lacking <italic>BC1</italic> RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g</xref>). In addition, there was a modest but significant increase in the length of the active zone (255.5 ± 11.3 and 287.8 ± 9.8 nm; <italic>n</italic> = 99 and 83 for WT and <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice, respectively; **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test). Furthermore, serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) imaging followed by three-dimensional reconstruction of barrel cortex synapses confirmed the presence of abnormally large spine heads and PSDs in <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2h</xref> and Supplementary Movies <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>

<title><italic>BC1</italic> KO pyramidal neurons have increased spontaneous activity</title>
<p id="Par10">To investigate whether the observed alterations in spine number and morphology correlate with concomitant changes in synaptic function, spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were measured from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the barrel cortex. Biocytin-labeled cells were recorded simultaneously (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). No changes were found in basic active or passive electrophysiological properties such as resting membrane potential, action potential threshold/half-width or input resistance between WT and <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). The amplitude of sEPSC was significantly enhanced in <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice as compared to WT age-matched littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>). In contrast, no differences were found in sEPSC frequency (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>). sEPSC decayed faster in <italic>BC1</italic> KO neurons than in WT neurons, but the difference was not significant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>). The increased sEPSC amplitude observed ex vivo could result in more cells reaching spiking threshold, thereby leading to enhanced cortical activity. In vivo juxtasomal recordings were therefore performed from layer 2/3 barrel cortex neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>). Pyramidal neurons from <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice showed a higher average spontaneous spiking activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3f</xref>). The variability in spiking frequency was quantified by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV), which was also notably higher in <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice (CV = 59 and 109% for WT and <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice, respectively). Overall, our findings suggest that the increased in vivo spontaneous activity in <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice could result from sub-threshold changes of sEPSC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>

<p id="Par11">Because alterations in spontaneous activity can affect cortical processing of tactile information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, we investigated stimulation-evoked cortical responses. Facial whiskers provide input to the mouse somatosensory barrel cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, one whisker at a time was deflected using a piezo wafer while recording the activity in the corresponding or adjacent barrel column (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>). There was no significant difference in the average response to principal whisker (PW) stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3g</xref>). We found, however, that the variability in the average response to PW stimulation was higher in <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice as compared to WT mice (CV = 41 and 73% for WT and <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice, respectively). We also analyzed the cortical response when stimulating the first-order surrounding whiskers (SW). Similarly to PW stimulation, no significant differences were found in the average response rate to SW stimulation between genotypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3h</xref>), but the variability of the average response to SW stimulation was higher in <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice (CV = 59 and 129% for WT and <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice, respectively). In summary, the changes in synaptic properties caused by the absence of <italic>BC1</italic> RNA observed ex vivo, were manifested as an increase in the variability of the cortical activity recorded in vivo.</p>
<p id="Par12">The increased sEPSC amplitude (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>) and spontaneous activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3f</xref>) suggest an overall increase in cortical neuronal activity in <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice. To further investigate this observation, background metabolic activity was assessed using cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry. Indeed, CO staining was significantly increased in the barrel cortex of <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice as compared to WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3i</xref>), indicating that <italic>BC1</italic> KO barrel cortex neurons have a higher basal metabolic rate.</p>

<title><italic>BC1</italic> KO mice have increased glutamate receptors levels</title>
<p id="Par13">Lack of <italic>BC1</italic> RNA resulted in enhanced sEPSC in the somatosensory cortex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). However, whether this reflects overall changes in glutamate receptors (GluRs) expression or alteration in their synaptic localization is currently unknown. We then analyzed the postsynaptic expression of different GluR subunits and associated scaffold proteins in PSD-enriched preparations from the cortex of WT and <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>, see Methods). Expression of both GluR1 and GluR2 was increased in postsynaptic membranes from <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). Likewise, mGluR5 and NR2B, but not NR2A, levels were higher in <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice as compared to WT mice. Of note, expression of these GluR subunits remained unchanged in whole-cortex lysates from <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice as compared to WT mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3b</xref>). Interestingly, the levels of PSD-95 were also significantly enhanced in PSD-enriched fractions from <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice, whereas Homer, Gephyrin or the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit α1 levels did not. Other proteins that regulate GluR trafficking or mRNA translation (i.e., Arc, FMRP and eIF4E) did not change in the PSD-enriched preparations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). A biotinylation assay in primary cortical neurons confirmed that levels of membrane-associated NR2B, GluR1 and GluR2 are higher in <italic>BC1</italic> KO compared to WT neurons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3c</xref>). Because αCaMKII has been implicated in GluR synaptic delivery and it is also an FMRP target regulated by <italic>BC1</italic> RNA in intact synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, we examined αCaMKII levels in postsynaptic membrane preparations from WT and <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice. While total expression of αCaMKII was slightly increased, the levels of phosphorylated αCaMKII (pT286) were markedly enhanced in PSD-enriched preparations from <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice as compared to WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>), indicating that <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice have higher levels of active, membrane-associated αCaMKII at synapses.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>

NR2B levels were increased in <italic>BC1</italic> KO synaptoneurosomes as compared to WT; the effects were not affected by neither a specific inhibitor of cap-dependent translation (4EGI) nor the general translation inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>), possibly due to the slow turnover rate of the receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In contrast, GluR1 expression was not different between genotypes and remained unchanged under all experimental conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>). The levels of mGluR5 in <italic>BC1</italic> KO synaptoneurosomes were elevated compared to WT mice, and while 4EGI only partially reduced mGluR5 expression in <italic>BC1</italic> KO synaptoneurosomes, cycloheximide completely reversed it (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>). None of the inhibitors modified basal mGluR5 expression in WT synaptoneurosomes <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>). Considering that the expression of GluRs in whole-cortex lysates was not different between genotypes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>), these results suggest that <italic>BC1</italic> RNA regulates dendritic translation of <italic>mGluR5</italic> and <italic>NR2B</italic> but not of <italic>GluR1</italic> mRNA.

As reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, sensory deprivation altered spine density in both apical and basal dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons and layer 4 spiny stellate cells in rodents; interestingly, here we find that in deprived WT mice spine density of layer 2/3 neurons was significantly increased in the ipsilateral side, while layer 4 neurons showed reduced number of spines in the contralateral but not the ipsilateral hemisphere, as compared to non-deprived (control) mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>).

<p id="Par24">Perturbations in ncRNAs, including <italic>BC1</italic> and its human orthologue <italic>BC200</italic>, are associated with a number of neurological diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. <italic>BC1</italic> functions in part through its association with FMRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, the protein absent or mutated in FXS, which is the major hereditary cause of intellectual disability and also the most prevalent monogenic factor of ASD. Here we show that the absence of <italic>BC1</italic> RNA leads to alterations in spine density and morphology in the rodent barrel cortex, increased postsynaptic levels of GluRs, and enhanced spontaneous neuronal activity ex vivo and in vivo. Furthermore, we provide evidence that experience-dependent plasticity and learning are impaired in <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice.</p>
<p id="Par25">Defects in the regulation of activity-dependent spine formation and maturation are common features associated with mutations in genes implicated in intellectual disabilities and ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Significant alterations in spine number and morphology have been extensively described in mouse models for neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Absence of <italic>BC1</italic> RNA resulted in increased spine density and decreased dendritic complexity, similar to mice deficient for FMRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> or its binding partner CYFIP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Conversely, <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice had larger spine heads than WT mice, as opposed to what has been observed in mouse models of FXS and ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, but similar to observations in animal models of Down Syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that dendritic elaboration and spine formation may be affected by the absence of the FMRP-CYFIP1-<italic>BC1</italic> complex, whereas spine head and PSD size could be under the control of alternative <italic>BC1</italic>-containing complex/es. In support of this hypothesis, <italic>BC1</italic>-mediated regulation of protein synthesis, neurotransmission and behavior can occur via FMRP-dependent or FMRP-independent mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Interestingly, overexpression of PSD-95 increases the number and size of spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> to a similar extent as observed here in mice lacking <italic>BC1</italic> RNA. Spine growth and stabilization require activity-dependent PSD-95 expression and local translational activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. In the <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice, the observed elevated PSD-95 levels in PSD-enriched fractions and the loss of activity-regulated PSD-95 synthesis in synaptoneurosomes could therefore contribute to the observed spine abnormalities. Likewise, the increase in phosphorylated αCaMKII at <italic>BC1</italic> KO synapses could also be involved in their spine phenotype, as the overexpression of constitutively active αCaMKII increases both spine size and density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par26">
<italic>PSD-95</italic> mRNA is a well-characterized FMRP target that is rapidly translated after synaptic stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. The underlying mechanisms and regulatory proteins implicated in <italic>PSD-95</italic> mRNA translation appear to differ between brain regions; while FMRP modulates <italic>PSD-95</italic> mRNA stability in the hippocampus, it represses PSD-95 translation at cortical synapses (for review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>), the latter probably involving CYFIP1 and <italic>BC1</italic> RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> as well as the microRNA 125a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>). The interaction between CYFIP1 and FMRP is stabilized by <italic>BC1</italic> RNA, an important event for translational regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Furthermore, <italic>BC1</italic> associates with FMRP-containing RNPs which translocate to spines in response to mGluR1/5 activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Our findings suggest that <italic>BC1</italic> RNA participates in FMRP-mediated translational control of PSD-95 and possibly other GluRs. Thus, we propose a model in which absence of <italic>BC1</italic> RNA releases the inhibition of protein translation, and as a result PSD-95 and specific GluR subunits are locally synthesized at high rates, leading to exaggerated synaptic targeting of GluRs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>). This, in turn, would cause augmented sEPSC as well as enlargement of PSDs and spine heads, which could account for the enhanced spontaneous activity and response variability to whisker stimulation found in vivo. This sequence of events is consistent with the notion that changes in spine morphology are not intrinsic to certain neurological diseases only but may be a consequence of alterations in excitatory synaptic input<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>

These different ribonucleoprotein complexes mediate activity-regulated translational control of <italic>PSD-95</italic> mRNA. Absence of <italic>BC1</italic> RNA causes exaggerated local synthesis of PSD-95 and enhanced synaptic delivery of ionotropic glutamate receptors to the postsynaptic density (PSD).

<p id="Par27">Previous studies have reported abnormal mGluR-dependent transmission in the striatum and hippocampus of <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, whether these alterations result from changes in mGluR expression and/or membrane localization or enhanced receptor activity has not yet been elucidated. Here, we found that <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice have increased mGluR5 expression in postsynaptic membranes, suggesting that the upregulation of type-I mGluR-mediated transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> might be due to changes in synaptic mGluR5 levels. In addition, membrane-associated expression of NR2B, GluR1 and GluR2 were also increased in <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice in vitro and ex vivo conditions, a finding consistent with the observed enhancement of sEPSC. Previous studies have shown that mRNAs encoding for GluR1, GluR2, and NR2B are FMRP targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Because the overall GluR1 expression in cortical lysates and synaptoneurosomes remained unchanged between WT and <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice, <italic>BC1</italic> RNA likely regulates GluR1 trafficking to the postsynaptic membrane rather than its synthesis. In this regard, the increase in PSD-95 levels, a well-known scaffolding protein of ionotropic GluR, together with the enhanced αCaMKII phosphorylation at synapses (which is known to regulate GluR trafficking) might be sufficient to drive GluR delivery to the PSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. In contrast, our data indicated that expression of NR2B and mGluR5 was enhanced in <italic>BC1</italic> KO synaptoneurosomes, an effect reversed by protein synthesis inhibitors in the case of mGluR5. Furthermore, the sequence complementarity prediction between <italic>BC1</italic> RNA and <italic>NR2B</italic> and <italic>mGluR5</italic> mRNAs supports the involvement of this ncRNA in local translation of these GluR subunits.</p>
<p id="Par28">Spine morphology is heavily influenced by changes in neuronal activity via synaptic GluRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Our findings are in agreement with this model, showing that there is a correlation between the spine phenotype, synaptic GluR levels and glutamatergic synaptic responses. This notion is further supported by our whisker trimming data in WT mice, where a decrease in spine density in the contralateral barrel cortex was associated with reduced NR2A levels as compared to the ipsilateral hemisphere. In line with this observation, previous studies have found similar changes in spine density and synaptic NMDA receptors in layers 2/3 and 4 of the somatosensory cortex after whisker deprivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Notably, NR2A expression in the cortex is strongly regulated by synaptic activity and sensory experience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. A previous study reported that whisker trimming attenuates spine loss in layer 5 pyramidal neurons compared to non-deprived mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>, indicating a diverse regulation of structural plasticity in different neuronal populations.</p>
<p id="Par29">Of note, a large-scale mass spectrometry study found accumulation of proteins and enzymes involved in protein degradation at deprived synapses of the barrel cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, which could be responsible for the decrease in NR2A expression observed here. The exaggerated synaptic levels of PSD-95 in <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice could prevent NMDA receptor degradation induced by whisker trimming, thereby resulting in enhanced spine density. Consistently, interaction with PSD-95 blocks NMDA receptor internalization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>, a necessary step for its degradation. Furthermore, reduced PSD-95 ubiquitination has been described to hamper activity-dependent synapse elimination in neurons lacking FMRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>, an effect that could also contribute to the increase in spine density and NR2A levels observed in <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice following sensory deprivation. Interestingly, similar alterations in spine turnover have been found in the barrel cortex of FXS mice after unilateral whisker trimming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>, suggesting a common mechanism for FMRP and <italic>BC1</italic> RNA in the modulation of sensory experience-dependent spine dynamics.</p>

Given that alterations in spontaneous neuronal activity can affect cortical processing of whisker-dependent tactile information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, we hypothesize that the increased spiking variability observed in the barrel cortex of <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice could contribute to deficiencies in texture recognition, a whisker-dependent discrimination task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>, as well as in sociability.

Cell identity was re-confirmed and post-hoc spine analysis carried out in a selection of these cells that were filled with biocytin (0.2%) and processed further with chromogen 3,3′diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) using the avidin–biotin–peroxidase method.

<p id="Par34">For recording sEPSCs, cells were held in voltage-clamp and recorded for between 4–12 min at −70 mV. GABAergic synaptic currents were not pharmacologically blocked but the intracellular chloride concentration was adjusted such that it did not differ significantly from the chloride reversal potential at the membrane holding potential so all downward current events were due to excitatory synaptic currents. All recordings were acquired at 10 kHz, filtered at 3 kHz, and acquired using Clampex 9.2 software. Basic cell properties and synaptic currents were analyzed in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, OR, USA) and Mini Analysis (Synaptosoft, NJ, USA) with event detection levels for synaptic currents set at 8 pA.</p>

<title>In vivo electrophysiology</title>
<p id="Par35">Each animal was pre-anesthetized with isoflurane. Next, an intraperitoneal injection of a Urethane/Acepromazine Maleate mix was delivered to anesthetize the animal for the electrophysiological procedures (70% of 1.0 g/kg dosage titrated based on animal weight). During the recordings, animal temperature was maintained and kept stable at 36.5–37.5 °C. Animal’s condition was sustained by constantly providing oxygen, while the depth of anesthesia was checked regularly and supplemented by additional doses of anesthetics, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. In short, to maintain anesthesia at similar depth in all the recordings, breathing rate and spontaneous whisker movements were monitored along with hind leg withdrawal and corneal (blinking) reflexes that were checked every 15–30 min. Recordings were collected only in the medium range of anesthesia in order to avoid deep and light states of anesthesia. Furthermore, when supplementing anesthesia (10% of initial dosage), recordings were continued no earlier than 15 min after the injection. A piezo-electric stimulator was used to move single whiskers mechanically while simultaneously recording cortical responses (25 deflections at 1 Hz) with patch pipettes (resistance 4–8 MΩ). Juxtasomal recordings from layer 2/3 pyramidal cells were performed in the barrel column corresponding to the PW. The PW is defined as the whisker that elicits the highest number of spikes per stimulation. In addition to the PW, the spiking activity evoked when stimulating the first-order SW was also recorded. This was done both as a control to determine which whisker is PW and also to compare the whisker evoked response from the different whiskers. Whisker-stimulation-evoked responses were recorded from the same pyramidal cells that were used for the spontaneous activity recordings. Statistical comparisons between genotypes were done using unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test with Welch’s correction, as variances were significantly different.</p>

The brains were rapidly removed and immediately frozen in 2-methylbutane (Merck, Overijse, Belgium) at −40 °C and stored at −80 °C until sectioning. Series of 25-μm-thick coronal sections were prepared on a cryostat (Microm HM 500 OM, Walldorf, Germany), mounted on 0.1% poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) coated slides and stored at −20 °C until further processing.</p>

Sections of WT and KO animals were stained in batch to guarantee identical staining conditions. Adjacent serial cryostat sections were Nissl counterstained (cresyl violet 1%, Fluka Chemika, Sigma-Aldrich) according to standard procedures.

<title>Golgi staining</title>
<p id="Par38">Golgi staining was performed using a previously described protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Spine density was measured on pyramidal neurons located in layer 2/3 and layer 5 and on spiny stellate cells located in layer 4 of the barrel cortex of 7-week-old WT and <italic>BC1</italic>-KO mice. In some experiments, unilateral whisker trimming was performed in 6-week-old mice, and 1 week later spine density was analyzed. Neurons were first identified with a light microscope (Leica DMLB) under low magnification (×20, NA 0.5) and were chosen by first locating, among all the stained sections, the regions of interest in their respective coronal sections. Four neurons in each layer showing at least fourth-order branches for both apical and basal dendrites were selected. Since no significant interhemispheric differences were observed in control WT or <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice, measurements were pooled, so that eight neurons per layer (24 neurons per brain) were studied in each animal. Only neurons which satisfied the following criteria were chosen for analysis in each of the experimental groups: (1) presence of untruncated dendrites; (2) all dendrites showed a consistent and dark impregnation along their entire extent; and (3) relative isolation from neighboring impregnated neurons to avoid interference and ensure accuracy of dendritic spine counting. Subsequently, dendritic spines were analyzed under a higher magnification (×63, NA 0.75). Series of sequential photomicrographs of dendritic segments were generated on a computer screen by means of a video camera connected to the microscope. These photomicrographs were acquired using at least five serial focal planes (2–3 μm apart) by focusing in and out with the fine adjustment of the microscope to create a stack of sequential images. This ensured the accurate reconstruction of entire dendritic segments and enabled counting of these segments with all their visible spines on two-dimensional (2D) images. To further minimize any missing of spines, both apical and basal dendrites of the selected segments had to be observed as much as possible in the series of focal planes selected for counting. Spines were counted on secondary and tertiary branches of apical (layer 2/3 and layer 5 cells) and basal (layer 2/3, layer 4 and layer 5 cells) dendrites. On each neuron and for each dendrite category, five 20 μm dendritic segments were randomly selected using a 2D sampling grid made of 20 μm squares to generate values of spine density. In some cases, segments were from the same branch. Segments were sampled 50 μm (apical dendrites) or 25 μm (basal dendrites) away from the soma in order to exclude the spine-depleted zone, which arises from the cell body. Only protuberances with a clear connection to the shaft of the dendrite were counted as spines. Since this method has proven to provide reliable results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>, no attempt was made to introduce a correction factor for hidden spines. As no difference in spine counts was observed between secondary and tertiary branch segments for each group, data were pooled for each dendrite category (basal and apical) to generate the final spine density results. An experimenter blind to the experimental conditions performed all measurements.</p>

<p id="Par71">Somatosensory cortex from each hemisphere (ipsilateral and contralateral) of WT and <italic>BC1</italic> KO mice was micro-dissected and homogenized in lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 1 mM dithiothreitol, 30 U/ml RNasin, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM Na-orthovanadate, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 10 mg/ml Sigma protease inhibitor cocktail), incubated 5 min on ice, and centrifuged at 12,000 <italic>g</italic> for 8 min at 4 °C. Ten μg of the supernatants were loaded into 4–12% SDS–PAGE. The following antibodies were used: vinculin (1:1000; Sigma; V9131), NR2A (1:1000, Millipore, #07-632), anti mGluR5 (1:1000, Millipore, AB5675), GluR1 (1:1000, Millipore, MAB2263). The secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Amersham) were used 1:5000. The signal, detected using an ECL plus or advanced detection system (Amersham), was captured by a Fujifilm LAS-3000 digital camera and quantified by means of Aida software (Raytest Isotopenmeßgeräte GmbH).</p>

<sec id="Sec32">
<title>Behavior</title>
<p id="Par72">Six-to-15-week-old <italic>BC1</italic> WT and KO (C57Bl/6 background) male mice were used for behavior. Animals were housed in groups of 2–4 per cage in a flow-cabinet with controlled temperature and humidity. Food and water was provided <italic>ad libitum</italic> and cotton cylinders or tissue were used as cage basic enrichment for nest building. The dark-light cycle was normal (with lights on from 7.00 to 19.00 hours and off from 19.00 to 7.00 hours). Before the start of the behavioral experiments, all mice were allowed to habituate for 1 week to the flow-cabinet. Testing took place in a room next to the housing room outside the flow-cabinet.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec33">
<title>Novel object recognition test (NORT)</title>
<p id="Par73">An extended NORT consisting of two test phases (i.e., visual and texture NORT) was performed according to a previously published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. During the first 2 days of behavioral testing, mice were subjected to 10-min sessions in an open field arena with opaque walls (45 × 45 × 45 cm) to habituate the animals to the environment before the tests. The bottom of the arena was covered with bedding material. Mice activity was tracked with Ethovision software (Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands). Distance traveled and time spent in the center area of the arena was measured. Between each mouse, the bedding material was thoroughly mixed to avoid scent trails guiding subsequent animals.</p>
<p id="Par74">On the third day, a standard NORT (i.e., visual NORT) was implemented which consists of two phases. In the first phase, the mouse was released at the edge of the arena, and equidistant from two identical objects (Familiar; two 50 ml Falcon tubes containing water). The objects were placed equidistant from the center of the arena, and equidistant from the arena walls. Each mouse was allowed to freely explore the objects for 10 min. Animals were afterwards removed from the test arena for 5 min. During this retention period, one object was replaced with a new object, which was visually distinct from the other object (Novel; 50 ml Falcon tube wrapped in red paper). In the second phase, the mouse was placed back into the test arena and allowed to freely explore the objects for 10 min. The time that each mouse spent physically exploring the objects was measured during both phases. The location of the novel object was counter-balanced among animals.</p>
<p id="Par75">On the fourth day, a texture-based NORT was implemented. During the first phase, the mouse was allowed to freely explore two objects that were identical in texture (Familiar; two 50 ml Falcon tubes wrapped with sandpaper gradient 80) for 10 min. After 5 min retention period, the mouse was reintroduced in the test arena. During the second phase, one of the objects was replaced by a visually identical but texturally different object (Novel; 50 ml Falcon tube wrapped with sandpaper gradient 100) and mouse exploration behavior towards the two objects was measured. The location of the novel object and the texture of the familiar object was counter-balanced among animals. The novelty preference index was calculated as: Time<sub>novel</sub> / (Time<sub>familiar</sub> + Time<sub>novel</sub>). Animals that did not explore the two objects for at least 5 s were not included in the analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec34">
<title>Sociability/social novelty</title>
<p id="Par76">Sociability and social memory were evaluated using the three-chamber test. The set-up consists of a rectangular transparent plexiglass box divided into three compartments, separated by two partitions. These partitions contain a small passage in the middle to allow the mouse to move between compartments and can be closed by small sliding doors. During the habituation phase, mice are allowed to explore the empty central compartment for 5 min. At the start of the test, both sliding doors are closed and each of the outer compartments are equipped with a wired cage (about 10 cm Ø, 15 cm high), one empty and the other containing a mouse, now referred to as ‘stranger1’. These cages are used to avoid inter-male fighting but allow visual and olfactory contact between mice. The tested mouse is placed in the closed middle compartment and the sliding doors are removed to allow the mouse to move through the test freely. After 10 min of free exploration, the mouse is placed back into an empty cage for 5 min. ‘Stranger 1’ mouse becomes the familiar mouse during the social novelty paradigm. Another unfamiliar mouse is placed under the second wired cage, now referred to as ‘stranger 2’. Again, the sliding doors are removed and the mouse is allowed to explore for 10 min. Location of ‘stranger 1’ and ‘stranger 2’ mouse was counter-balanced between animals and the box was cleaned with soapy water after each animal. All stranger mice used were of the same sex as the tested mouse and had never been housed in the same animal room. Mice were recorded with a camera and their heads tracked using ANY-Maze software (Stoelting Europe). Time spent in close proximity ( &lt; 2 cm) to the cages was monitored and manually scored by an experimenter blind to the genotype. Preference index was calculated as: Time<sub>stranger1</sub>/(Time<sub>stranger1</sub> + Time<sub>empty</sub>) and Time<sub>stranger2</sub>/(Time<sub>stranger1</sub> + Time<sub>stranger2</sub>) for sociability and social memory, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec35">
<title>Self-grooming</title>
<p id="Par77">Animals were individually placed in a clear observation cylinder (13 cm in diameter, 20 cm height), and self-grooming activity monitored using one top and one front cameras for 5 min. Time spent grooming was manually scored by two independent experimenters blind to the genotype. Each experimenter analyzed videos recorded with different cameras, and data obtained from both cameras was averaged for each animal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec36">
<title>Marble burying test</title>
<p id="Par78">The set-up consisted of a large cage (45 × 22 cm) with filter tops filled with 5 cm of fresh and compact bedding and containing 24 marbles (~ 1.5 cm diameter each) equally distributed along the walls (at 2 cm distance). Mice were placed in the cage and left undisturbed for 30 min. At the end of the test, the number of marbles buried more than 2/3 of their volume were counted by an experimenter blind to the genotype.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec37">
<title>Nest building test</title>
<p id="Par79">Animals were housed individually and provided with three cotton cylinders (0.6 g each) and left undisturbed for 24 h. Unused cotton cylinders were weighed and nest quality was scored by an experimenter blind to the genotype according to a previously described protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec38">
<title>Automated tube test</title>
<p id="Par80">The automated tube test was performed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>, with minor modifications. Mice (5–6 week old) were housed in WT/KO pairs. Experiments started few weeks later (i.e., when mice were 12–15 week old). Matches were performed between all mice regardless of the genotype and home-cage origin. A match was considered completed when both mice entered the goal box relative to the winner (or starting box relative to the loser) with all four paws.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec39">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p id="Par81">Comparisons between the two groups were performed using unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test or non-parametric Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. One-way or two-way analysis of variance followed by a post-hoc Newman-Keuls or Bonferroni’s multiple comparison tests were used when more than two groups were compared. Distributions were analyzed using the Pearson’s chi-square (χ<sup>2</sup>) test. For molecular/electrophysiological studies, sample size was not estimated prior to the experiments, we believe it is adequate to measure the effect size based on the literature. For behavioral studies, we estimated requiring a total sample size of 9 mice per genotype based on power analysis (power equal to 80%, alpha equal to 0.05 and effect size equal to 1.5 x SD, based on previous behavioral studies from our laboratory). Results were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (s.e.m.) from the indicated number of independent experiments and expressed as fold of the indicated control. <italic>P</italic> values &gt; 0.05 were regarded as not significant. Data points lower or higher than 1.5 x IQR (interquartile range) were considered outliers and kept in the figure but excluded from the statistical analysis. Samples were generally randomized according to the tag number code of the animals or a simple number code for in vitro experiments.</p>
