<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">We investigated fibroblast growth factor 12 (FGF12) as a transcript enriched in the inner ear by searching published cDNA library databases. FGF12 is a fibroblast growth factor homologous factor, a subset of the FGF superfamily. To date, its localisation and function in the inner ear have not been determined. Here, we show that FGF12 mRNA is localised in spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and the vestibular ganglion. We also show that FGF12 protein is localised in SGNs, the vestibular ganglion, and nerve fibres extending beneath hair cells. Moreover, we investigated FGF12 function in auditory and vestibular systems using <italic>Fgf12</italic>-knockout (FGF12-KO) mice generated with CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Our results show that the inner ear morphology of FGF12-KO mice is not significantly different compared with wild-type mice. However, FGF12-KO mice exhibited an increased hearing threshold, as measured by the auditory brainstem response, as well as deficits in rotarod and balance beam performance tests. These results suggest that FGF12 is necessary for normal auditory and equilibrium function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Hearing loss is a common problem in people of all ages. The World Health Organization reports that 360 million people worldwide have hearing loss, with 32 million being children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Hearing loss is a major sensory defect, as prelingual hearing loss affects oral language acquisition. As over 50% of prelingual hearing loss is genetic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, it is therefore necessary to identify and determine the function of causative genes for hearing loss. Recent studies of transcripts enriched in the inner ear have provided novel insight into hereditary hearing loss and normal auditory function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In this study, we focused on fibroblast growth factor 12 (FGF12) as an inner ear-enriched transcript and performed experiments to investigate its localisation and function.</p>
<p id="Par3">FGF12 is a member of the FGF superfamily, which has 23 FGF members identified to date. FGF11–14 are intracellular non-secreted proteins known as intracellular FGFs or fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Whereas other FGFs work by binding to FGF receptors (FGFRs), FHFs do not bind to FGFRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Although reports are limited and much is unknown about FHF function, recent studies have revealed that FHFs bind to and regulate voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav channels)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. For example, Wittmack <italic>et al</italic>., reported colocalisation between FGF13 and Nav1.6 at nodes of Ranvier in dorsal root axons. Moreover, cell lines in which both proteins were coexpressed showed increases in peak current amplitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Further, Goldfarb <italic>et al</italic>. overexpressed FGF12 and reported colocalisation with Nav channels in cultured neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. They also reported that FGF12 single-knockout (KO) mice showed no phenotype, while FGF12/FGF14 double-KO mice exhibited severe ataxia and decreased excitability of cerebellar granule neurons, thereby concluding that FGF12 played an important role together with FGF14 in neuronal action potentials. However, there are no reports showing abnormalities in the auditory or equilibrium function of FGF12-KO mice, and FGF12 function in the inner ear remains to be determined.</p>
<p id="Par4">In this study, we investigated FGF12 expression and localisation in murine inner ear tissue. Additionally, auditory and vestibular function was examined in the FGF12-KO mice that we generated. Consequently, this is the first report to show FGF12 function in the inner ear, and our findings provide novel insight into the contribution of FHF to normal auditory and vestibular function.</p>

<title>FGF12 mRNA is abundantly expressed in the inner ear</title>
<p id="Par5">We hypothesised that transcripts enriched in the inner ear play a key role in normal hearing and vestibular function. Consequently, investigation of these transcripts will aid understanding of the causes of hereditary hearing loss. cDNA libraries encompassing different tissues contain expression sequence tag (EST) information that enables mRNA expression levels to be compared. Accordingly, we compared GenBank EST clones from inner ear cDNA libraries to those of other tissues. We identified 13 candidate genes specifically expressed in the inner ear. Next, we performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on murine inner ear to confirm that these 13 candidate genes are specifically and abundantly expressed in the inner ear. Among these genes, we found that FGF12 mRNA was abundantly expressed in the cochlea and vestibular ganglion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). β-Actin was used as an internal control.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Expression of FGF12 mRNA in the inner ear.

<p id="Par6">To examine the specificity of FGF12 mRNA expression in the inner ear compared with other tissues, we performed quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). FGF12 mRNA levels were compared in each tissue relative to β-actin as an internal control. FGF12 mRNA levels were highest in the vestibular ganglion, and relatively high in the brain and cochlea. Weak expression was also detected in the eye and testis, with virtually no expression detected in the other tissues examined.</p>

<sec id="Sec4">
<title>FGF12 mRNA is localised in spiral and vestibular ganglia</title>
<p id="Par7">To examine FGF12 mRNA localisation, we performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation in the inner ear using an FGF12-specific complementary RNA (cRNA) probe. FGF12 mRNA expression was abundantly detected in the spiral and vestibular ganglia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a–c</xref>). Further, FGF12 mRNA was expressed in both the superior and inferior regions of the vestibular ganglion. Staining intensity in the vestibular ganglion was stronger compared with the spiral ganglion, confirming our qPCR finding showing that FGF12 mRNA expression is more abundant in the vestibular ganglion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). No FGF12 mRNA signal was detected in other parts of the inner ear, i.e., hair cells, supporting cells, stria vascularis, or spiral ligaments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). We also performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation using the sense probe as a negative control, with no staining detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d,e</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Localisation of FGF12 mRNA and protein expression in the inner ear.

<sec id="Sec5">
<title>FGF12 protein is localised in the spiral ganglion, vestibular ganglion, and peripheral nerve fibres of the cochlea and vestibular organ</title>
<p id="Par8">To examine FGF12 protein localisation, we performed immunohistochemistry in inner ear tissue using an anti-FGF12 antibody. FGF12 protein was expressed in the spiral ganglion and superior and inferior regions of the vestibular ganglion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f,g</xref>). This expression pattern corresponded with FGF12 mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). In addition, higher magnification images of the cochlea showed that FGF12 protein was expressed in nerve fibres (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2h</xref>, white triangles) extending from the spiral ganglion to immediately beneath the inner and outer hair cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2h,i</xref>). FGF12 protein was also expressed in nerve fibres of the saccule, extending from the vestibular ganglion through the supporting cell layer to below the hair cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2j</xref>). To confirm the specificity and immunoreactivity of the utilized anti-FGF12 antibody, we performed immunohistochemistry on inner ear tissue from FGF12-KO mice. Using the same exposure times, no fluorescent signal was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2k</xref> [cf. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>]).</p>

<sec id="Sec6">
<title>Generation of FGF12-KO mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 system</title>
<p id="Par9">To examine the contribution of FGF12 function to auditory and vestibular function, we generated FGF12-KO mice using the C57BL/6 J strain and clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology. We generated KO mice with a one base-pair (bp) deletion in FGF12 exon 2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a,b</xref>). To confirm FGF12-KO, we performed western blotting using inner ear tissue. In the inner ear of wild-type (WT) mice, a FGF12 band was detected at 20 kDa, which was not present in KO mouse inner ear (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>). β-Actin bands were detected as an endogenous control. This result indicated that the single base deletion produced by the CRISPR/Cas9 system could lead to frame shift in FGF12 gene, resulting in deletion of FGF12 protein. In rare cases during genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9 system, the gRNA can recognize another genome sequence similar to the target sequence, thus creating the potential for unexpected genome mutations to occur, known as off-target mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. To eliminate the possibility of off-target mutations in FGF12-KO mice, we selected three candidate genomic sites with a similar sequence to the small guide RNA (sgRNA). PCR amplification and sequencing of these sites confirmed there were no off-target mutations present in FGF12-KO mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Generation of FGF12-knockout mice by CRISPR/Cas9 technology.

<title>Normal cochlear morphology in FGF12-KO mice</title>
<p id="Par10">FGF12-KO mice seemed to have normal appearance, but exhibited decreased body weight compared with WT mice at 7 weeks of age (KO, 19.69 ± 0.53 g, n = 14; WT, 21.76 ± 0.24 g, n = 17, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, FGF12-KO mice seemed to have a normal lifespan, because almost all lived to over 18 months.</p>
<p id="Par11">To examine the impact of FGF12 deletion on cochlear development, we compared cochlear morphology in FGF12-KO mice with WT mice. First, we examined cochlear midmodiolar sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin, but detected no obvious differences in spiral ganglion morphology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a–f</xref>). Next, we compared the density of spiral ganglion cells within Rosenthal’s canal area in FGF12-KO and WT mice, but again found no significant difference (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g</xref>). We also examined the morphology of outer and inner hair cells in whole mounts prepared from cochlear tissue of each mouse genotype. Hair cell morphology in FGF12-KO and WT mice was similar from the apical turn to the basal turn of the cochlea (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4h–m</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Morphology of FGF12-knockout cochlea.

<title>FGF12-KO mice exhibit increased auditory brainstem response thresholds and deficits in rotarod and balance beam performance tests</title>
<p id="Par12">To examine auditory function, we compared auditory brainstem responses (ABR) in WT and FGF12-KO mice. FGF12-KO mice exhibited increased thresholds in the range of 8 to 32 kHz (4 kHz; <italic>p</italic> = 0.1; 8 kHz; <italic>p</italic> = 0.08; 16 kHz, <italic>p</italic> = 0.008; 24 kHz, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04; 32 kHz, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). As FGF12 mRNA and protein are expressed in the spiral ganglion, we compared evoked waveforms using click stimuli.

<p id="Par13">Moreover, we hypothesised that FGF12-KO mice may have a defect in vestibular function because strong FGF12 expression was detected in the vestibular organ. To investigate this, we performed the open field test, rotarod test, and balance beam test on WT and FGF12-KO mice. During the open field test, FGF12-KO mice exhibited normal movement. Further, the entire distance covered was similar to WT mice (<italic>p</italic> = 0.07) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>).

<title>mRNA expression and localisation of other FHFs in the inner ear</title>
<p id="Par14">FHFs (FGF11–14) share common domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and might compensate for each other. Thus, we performed RT-PCR and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation of other FHFs (FGF11, FGF13, and FGF14) in WT mice. RT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a,b</xref>) revealed FGF11 mRNA expression in the cochlea and vestibular ganglion, while FGF13 mRNA was expressed in the vestibular ganglion, but only faintly in the cochlea. FGF14 mRNA expression was only faintly observed in both the cochlea and vestibular ganglion. Among other FHFs, FGF11 mRNA was expressed in the spiral and vestibular ganglia similar to FGF12 expression. In addition, FGF11 was also expressed in sensory hair cells and Reissner’s membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c–f</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par15">Here, we focused on FGF12 as an enriched inner ear transcript. We found that FGF12 mRNA is abundantly expressed in the inner ear (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>) and localised in the vestibular and spiral ganglia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). Further, we show that FGF12 protein is expressed in both ganglia and peripheral nerve fibres in the cochlea and vestibular organ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>). We also investigated FGF12 function using FGF12-KO mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>) and found increased ABR thresholds and behavioural test deficits in these animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>). Altogether, our data suggest that FGF12 plays a key role in auditory and vestibular organs.</p>
<p id="Par16">In this study, we generated FGF12-KO mice using CRISPR/Cas9 technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. FGF12 protein consists of 181 amino acids and its open reading frame contains 546 bases. FGF12 mRNA contains 5 exons, with the functional domain spanning from exon 2 to exon 4, thus including the 13<sup>th</sup> amino acid (threonine) to the 136<sup>th</sup> amino acid (phenylalanine)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. FGF12-KO mice used in this study have a single base deletion of the 92<sup>nd</sup> base (thymine) in the open reading frame of 546 bases. This point mutation results in a frameshift in protein translation, as well as the appearance of a stop codon following the 45<sup>th</sup> amino acid of the entire FGF12 protein; thus, protein translation stops at this point. As a result, the mutated protein contains only a small part of the functional domain, which comprises the first 18 of 124 amino acids. Moreover, it disrupts the three-dimensional structure of FGF12 protein, which consists of twelve β-trefoils located from exon 2 to exon 4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, as the mutated protein has only two of the twelve β-trefoils of native FGF12 protein. Thus, we propose that with only two β-trefoils, FGF12 could not form its functional three-dimensional structure. Notably, although we could not completely deny the existence of premature FGF12 protein, which contains only exons 1 and 2, the premature protein lacks almost all of the functional domain, suggesting that the premature protein does not have FGF12 function.</p>
<p id="Par17">Mammalian SGNs transmit sound stimuli from hair cells to the brain. SGN cell bodies lie within Rosenthal’s canal in the cochlea, with their peripheral processes extending to the organ of Corti to form synapses with hair cells. Alternatively, SGN central processes project to the auditory nerve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. SGNs are the first neurons of auditory neural pathways and many studies have shown that proteins expressed in SGNs are responsible for hearing loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. For example, Salehi <italic>et al</italic>. reported that neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) is localised in SGN cells, with the cochlea of <italic>Nrp1</italic> conditional-KO mice showing significantly lower SGN density and aberrant axons. <italic>Nrp1</italic> conditional-KO mice also exhibited increased ABR thresholds compared with WT mice. Similarly, in this study, FGF12-KO mice showed increased ABR thresholds, but almost the same SGN density and cochlear morphology as WT mice.</p>
<p id="Par18">In a recent study, FGF12 single-KO mice showed no phenotype, while FGF12/FGF14 double-KO mice developed severe ataxia and decreased neuronal excitability. In our study, FGF12-KO mice showed a shift in ABR threshold within 15 dB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>), as long as FGF12 was abundantly expressed in the spiral ganglion and neural fibres of the organ of Corti. To examine the ability of other FHFs to compensate for FGF12, we examined mRNA expression of other FHFs (FGF11, FGF13, and FGF14) using RT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a,b</xref>), as well as localisation by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c–j</xref>) in WT and FGF12-KO mice tissue. Our results indicated that FGF11 mRNA was localized in the spiral and vestibular ganglia where FGF12 mRNA was localized (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c–j</xref>); thus, it might be possible that FGF11 could compensate for reduced or lost FGF12 function in the inner ear. Further investigation of FGF11 function in the inner ear is needed, for example, experiments using FGF12 and FGF11 double-KO mice.</p>
<p id="Par19">In terms of auditory function, each part of the ABR waveform represents neuronal excitement of a specific part of the auditory pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Peak I is generated in the spiral nerve, peak II in the cochlear nucleus, and peaks III–IV in the more central pathway. Generally, if the auditory central pathway is significantly impaired, waveforms of peaks II–V would be different. In this study, peak II–V waveforms of FGF12-KO mice and WT mice looked similar (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). Therefore, we predicted that loss of FGF12 does not dramatically affect the auditory central pathway. However, the possibility for participation of the central pathway is not completely excluded. Further investigation of auditory function in the central nervous system of FGF12-KO mice is needed. We also performed rotarod and balance beam performance tests using FGF12-KO mice, and found deficits in both behavioural tests. FGF12 is abundantly expressed in the vestibular ganglion and neural fibres beneath hair cells. Therefore, deficits may be present in the peripheral vestibular system of FGF12-KO mice. Nonetheless, deficits in the rotarod and balance beam performance tests may occur when mice have insufficient visual or cerebellar function; thus, other experimental systems and electrophysiological analysis are necessary to determine the exact pathology. Moreover, further investigation is needed to determine vestibular function in FGF12-KO mice. Such results could provide novel insight into diseases involving dizziness, especially congenital dizziness.</p>
<p id="Par20">In this study, we showed that FGF12 mRNA and protein are expressed in auditory and vestibular peripheral neurons, and that FGF12-KO mice exhibit elevated ABR thresholds and deficits in the rotarod and balance beam performance tests. However, further studies are needed to determine the underlying mechanisms that cause these changes. Nonetheless, our results will aid understanding of hereditary hearing loss and dizziness diseases.</p>

<title>Cochlea dissection</title>
<p id="Par25">The entire inner ear tissue (including the cochlea and vestibular apparatus) was dissected from the skull of adult mice. Cochlea dissection and tissue preparation for cryosections were performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Cochleae were decalcified for 7 days. Cochleae used for <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation and immunostaining with anti-Pan-Nav antibody were decalcified for 3 days to enable RNA probe and antibody reactivity. Frozen cochlea compounds were cut into 10-µm sections using a cryostat and then adhered to slides (PRO-01; Matsunami, Osaka, Japan).</p>
<p id="Par26">For whole mount cochlea preparations, adult mice cochleae were isolated from the temporal bones and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight, then decalcified in PBS containing 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for 7 days. Otic capsules were microscopically removed with forceps and a scalpel in PBS.</p>

<title>Generation of FGF12-KO mice</title>
<p id="Par33">FGF12-KO mice were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology with the assistance of NPO Biotechnology Research and Development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. An sgRNA targeting FGF12 exon 2 was synthesised <italic>in vitro</italic>. C57BL/6 female mice were superovulated, then oocytes were collected from ampullae and co-incubated with sperm from C57BL/6 male mice. Pronuclear stage eggs were injected using a micromanipulator with pX330 plasmid containing hCas9 and sgRNA (5′-CATCCAGATGGTACCATTGATGG-3′) at 5 ng/µl. Fertilised eggs were transferred into the oviducts of pseudopregnant ICR females. F0 offspring were genotyped by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. Altogether, 12 of 28 offspring carried non-mosaic genomic mutations, while five carried mosaic genomic mutations. One F0 mosaic mutant mouse was bred with a C57BL/J mouse to derive F1 heterozygous non-mosaic mutant mice. Homozygous mutant F2 offspring carrying a 1-bp deletion were bred from F1 heterozygous parents. Next, homozygous mutant F2 offspring were backcrossed to each other. FGF12 homozygous-KO female mice generated few newborn mice, and therefore KO offspring from heterozygous female mice were also used. All neonatal mice were genotyped by PCR and Sanger sequencing using the following primers: 5′-CCGAGTGCTGGAAGTAAAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATTGCAAGTAGCTGGCGTTC-3′ (antisense), which produced a 454-bp product. For off-target analysis, the CRISPR direct website<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> was used to identify candidates for off-target sites.

<title>Auditory brainstem response</title>
<p id="Par35">Mice were anaesthetised by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), and placed into a sound-isolated chamber. Subcutaneous needle electrodes were inserted into the pinna and vertex, with a ground electrode near the hip. Responses to click stimuli and tone pip stimuli at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 32 kHz were recorded using a Power Lab 2/25 (AD Instruments, Sydney, Australia) and TDT Auditory Workstation (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL, USA). The duration of tone bursts was 1 msec. The sound level was raised in 5-dB steps from 0 dB to 100 dB. Overall, 500 responses were amplified and averaged.

<title>Rotarod test</title>
<p id="Par37">The rotarod test (MK-610A; Muromachi Kikai, Tokyo, Japan) was used to assess balance, grip strength, and motor coordination. The apparatus consisted of a rotating rod that accelerated from 4 to 30 rpm over 5 min, and then continued for a further 5 min. Two trials were tested at 30 min intervals during daytime.
