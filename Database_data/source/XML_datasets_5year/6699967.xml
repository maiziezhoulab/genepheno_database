<p>The BTBR <italic>T<sup>+</sup> Itpr3<sup>tf</sup></italic>/J (BTBR) mouse strain is a
widely used model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The BTBR mice display behavior
consistent with the three diagnostic categories of ASD. However, the behavioral phenotypes
of the BTBR mice in a long-term group housing setting are largely unknown because
conventional behavioral tests for ASD model mice are designed for use under simplified
artificial conditions over a short observation period. In this study, we applied a newly
developed assay system, the Multiple Animal Positioning System (MAPS), to quantify
behaviors under group housing conditions over four days of continuous observation. Using
MAPS, we showed that in a group housing condition, the BTBR mice exhibited lower activity
levels in the dark phase and alteration of social behavior in comparison with the C57BL/6J
mice. The phenotypes of the BTBR mice were affected by co-housing with the C57BL/6J mice
for four days, but the influence was weak and limited. Our results by MAPS differ from
those obtained using conventional behavioral tests. The present study demonstrated that
MAPS would be useful for evaluating the usual/natural behaviors of various animal models
in detail and under more ethological conditions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired
social interaction and communication and repetitive behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. To elucidate the biological basis of ASD and develop treatments for
its symptoms, not only clinical research, but also experimental basic research using animal
models, is required. The inbred BTBR <italic>T<sup>+</sup> Itpr3<sup>tf</sup></italic>/J
(also known as BTBR <italic>T<sup>+</sup> tf</italic>/J) mouse strain is a widely used model
of ASD. The BTBR <italic>T<sup>+</sup> Itpr3<sup>tf</sup></italic>/J strain is derived from
the inbred strain BTBR (Black and Tan BRachyury). L.C. Dunn developed the BTBR
<italic>T<sup>+</sup> Itpr3<sup>tf</sup></italic>/J from stock obtained from
Dobrovolskaia-Zavadskaia, and inserted <italic>tufted
</italic>(<italic>Itpr3<sup>tf</sup></italic>) as a marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. The BTBR <italic>T<sup>+</sup> Itpr3<sup>tf</sup></italic>/J
(hereinafter referred to as BTBR) mice carry a deletion of the <italic>Disc1
</italic>(disrupted in schizophrenia 1) gene, which is a candidate gene for schizophrenia
and other major mental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. BTBR mice
lack a corpus callosum, show a reduction in hippocampal commissure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>], and display behaviors consistent with the three diagnostic
categories of ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Previous studies using
conventional behavioral tests have indicated that the BTBR mice exhibit reduced social
interactions, unusual vocalizations, and increased repetitive behaviors in comparison with
other inbred strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. However, conventional behavioral tests for ASD model mice are
designed for use under simplified artificial conditions over a short observation period
(i.e., several minutes). Consequently, the behavioral phenotypes of the BTBR mice in group
housing settings over a long-term observation period are largely unknown.</p>
<p>There are some reports of long-term behavioral analyses among multiple animals in natural
group settings. Moy <italic>et al.</italic> showed that the BTBR mice built nests from
nesting materials, slept together in huddles, and did not display any unusual levels of
activity or fighting during the home-cage observation periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. On the other hand, Pobbe <italic>et al.</italic> reported that the
BTBR mice showed reductions in all interactive behaviors and an increase in self-grooming
and time spent alone in comparison with the C57BL/6J (B6) mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. The inconsistent results among these studies can be attributed to
the timing and/or period of observation used for behavioral scoring. The traditional human
observation-based approaches are limited in the number of possible observation periods per
day because they require tremendous amounts of work and time to conduct. To solve the
problem of the temporal coverage of observation periods and produce a high-throughput
analysis system, we recently developed a video-based behavioral analysis system for multiple
small animals, called the Multiple Animal Positioning System (MAPS), to monitor behaviors of
mouse models over a long-term period under group housing conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. The first aim of the present study was to characterize the behaviors
of the BTBR mice for several days under group housing conditions using MAPS.</p>
<p>In our previous study, MAPS revealed that mice subjected to social isolation after weaning
exhibit impaired social proximity in adulthood. The phenotype of these socially isolated
mice was partially rescued by cohabitation with group-housed mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, we showed that social isolation after weaning causes
alterations in prefrontal cortex function and myelination that do not recover following
re-socialization with socially isolated mice, but that can be restored by re-socialization
with group-housed mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. These findings indicate that the housing condition of the mice that
socially isolated mice re-socialize with is a key determinant for restoring behavioral and
neurobiological phenotypes. In the BTBR mice, Yang <italic>et al.</italic> reported that
cross-rearing with the B6 mice after weaning significantly resolved sociability deficits
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. Recently, we showed that the BTBR mice
exhibit thinner myelin in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and that co-housing with the
B6 mice after weaning increased the myelin thickness in the mPFC of the BTBR mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Therefore, the second aim of the present study was
to validate if co-housing with the B6 mice can change the behavior of the BTBR mice.</p>

<title>Animal experiments</title>
<p>The Animal Care Committee of Nara Medical University approved the animal experimental
protocols used in this study. Mice were housed in the animal facility at a temperature of
22–25°C and humidity of 40–60% on a 12/12 h light/dark cycle (lights on: 8:00–20:00) with
free access to food and water. Breeding pairs of the C57BL/6JJcl (B6) and BTBR
<italic>T<sup>+</sup> Itpr3<sup>tf</sup></italic>/J (JAX stock No. 002282; BTBR)
inbred strains of mice were purchased from CLEA Japan (Tokyo, Japan) and Charles River Lab
Japan (Yokohama, Japan), respectively, and bred in the animal facilities at Nara Medical
University. The day of birth was defined as postnatal day 0 (PD 0). Male pups were weaned
at PD 21 and group-housed with same-sex siblings (2–5 pups/cage) until the experiments
were conducted.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Behavioral experiments using MAPS</title>
<p>To quantify behavior under group housing conditions, we applied our newly developed assay
system, the Multiple Animal Positioning System (MAPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>], which is now distributed by O’Hara &amp; Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). MAPS is a
video analysis-based system that can automatically obtain precise individual mouse
localization in X-Y coordinates under group housing conditions. MAPS takes infrared images
(1 frame per s; fps) under infrared illumination and performs automated pattern
matching-based ID identification. In experiments using MAPS, a mouse ID occasionally
disappears from the image during long-term group housing (e.g., when mice overlap or their
bodies are tilted). When MAPS loses a mouse ID, the lost X-Y coordinate is supplemented
with previous data from the coordinates at which the ID was last identified.</p>
<p>Before the behavioral experiments, each mouse was marked with a unique symbol (mouse ID;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic of the Multiple Animal Positioning System (MAPS). Adult male mice were
individually tagged with a mouse ID (‘uniform number’) on their backs. An infrared
camera took an image each second; the software analyzed the images using a pattern
recognition technique. The software recognized the ID of each mouse and recorded the
X-Y coordinates. If the ID of a mouse could not be recognized, the coordinates of
when the ID was last recognized were used. The coordinate data were exported as .csv
files and used for analyzing the behavior of each mouse.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="expanim-68-319-g001"></graphic></fig>) on its back using an elastic string while under chloral hydrate anesthesia (400
mg/kg, intraperitoneally). The mouse was given a period of time to habituate to the ID,
which continued until the mice huddled together. For the behavioral tests, four adult male
mice that had not previously been exposed to one another were placed in an experimental
cage (30 × 30 × 25 cm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>) from 14:00 to
15:00 on Day 1 and observed continuously for 4 days by MAPS. In the experiments, three
combinations of mice, i.e., four B6 mice (B6-only), four BTBR mice (BTBR-only), and two B6
mice and two BTBR mice (B6-BTBR-mix), were used. Behavioral experiments began when the
mice were 8–24 weeks old. Age-matched animals were used within an experimental cage for
both the B6 and the BTBR mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Data collection for MAPS experiments</title>
<p>The positioning data from each mouse were exported in comma-separated values (.csv) form
from MAPS. Data processing was carried out using Microsoft R Open 3.4.3
(https://mran.microsoft.com/open).</p>
<p>Locomotor activity: Locomotor activity was measured as the total distance traveled (m).
In the novel environment, the total distance traveled was calculated during the first 60
min after the introduction of the mice to MAPS. In the familiar environment, the total
distance traveled was quantified each hour or 12 h after the beginning of the dark phase
(20:00) on Day 1.</p>
<p>Social behavior: We defined a social interaction area for each mouse as a circle 60 mm in
radius surrounding the center of the mouse ID. ‘Alone’ was defined as a lack of other mice
in the social interaction area. The ‘percent alone’ was calculated as the ratio of time
that a mouse spent alone. The ‘duration of social interaction’ was defined as the total
time when inter-individual distance was less than 60 mm, i.e., the time that two
individuals stayed within the social interaction area.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conventional behavioral experiments</title>
<p>We performed three conventional behavioral tests: the open-field test, the object
investigation test, and the social investigation test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Behavioral
experiments began when the mice were eight weeks old. All behavioral indexes were analyzed
using TopScanLite 2.00 (CleverSys Inc., Reston, VA, USA).</p>
<p>Open-field test: Mice were tested for 20 min in an open-field apparatus. The apparatus
consisted of a square arena (39 × 39 × 34 cm), with a light gray floor and wall. At the
beginning of the test a mouse was gently placed in a corner square. Total distance
traveled (pixel) was calculated for every 5 min time period. The center area was defined
as the center 50% of the apparatus. The ‘time spent in center area (%)’ was calculated as
the ratio of time that a mouse spent in the center area in each 5 min time period.</p>
<p>Object investigation test: To examine behavioral responses to a novel object, the day
after the open-field test mice were tested for 10 min in the open-field apparatus in the
presence of an object stimulus, which was a clear Plexiglas cylinder (Mouse Cylinder SIOT,
O’Hara &amp; Co., Ltd.) with a white cover made by a 3D printer (Dreamer, FlashForge
Corporation, Zhejiang, China) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). The floor of the apparatus was
hypothetically divided into nine square sections. The cylinder was placed in one corner
section, defined as the object corner. At the beginning of the test a mouse was gently
placed in a corner next to the object corner. The ‘time spent in the object corner (%)’
was calculated as the ratio of time that a mouse spent in the object corner. This object
investigation test also serves as an acclimation phase for the social investigation
test.</p>
<p>Social investigation test: To examine behavioral responses to a social stimulus, four
hours after the object investigation test, mice were tested for 10 min in the open-field
apparatus. Social investigation behaviors were assessed by exposure to a cylinder
containing an unfamiliar adult male mouse that was the same strain as the subject mouse.
The cylinder was placed in one corner of the open field apparatus (social corner). At the
beginning of the test a mouse was gently placed in a corner next to the social corner. The
‘time spent in the social corner (%)’ was calculated as the ratio of time that a mouse
spent in the social corner.</p>

<title>Decreased locomotor activity during the dark phase in the BTBR mice</title>
<p>Four adult male mice that had not previously been exposed to one another were introduced
in one of the experimental MAPS cages between the hours of 14:00 and 15:00 during the
light phase of Day 1. The behavior of the mice was recorded continuously for 4 days using
MAPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). The first experiment was designed
to detect the behavioral differences between the B6 and BTBR mice for each of two
combinations of mice, i.e., four B6 mice (B6-only) and four BTBR mice (BTBR-only) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2A</xref><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Activity of B6 and BTBR mice in the B6-only and BTBR-only housing conditions. (A)
Experimental design for the B6-only and BTBR-only housing conditions. Four B6 or
four BTBR mice (all previously unexposed to one another) were housed per chamber
(B6: total n=12; BTBR total: n=16). (B–I) The total distance traveled in the first
60 min after introducing the mice to Multiple Animal Positioning System (MAPS)

60 min starting at the beginning of the dark phase (20:00) on Day 1. Data are
presented as mean ± SE.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="expanim-68-319-g002"></graphic></fig>). The locomotor activity of the BTBR mice was comparable to that of the B6 mice in
the novel environment after the introduction of the mice to MAPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2B</xref>) and during the light phase on Days 2–4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Figs. 2</xref>C–E). In contrast, the BTBR mice exhibited
significantly decreased locomotor activity in comparison with the B6 mice during the dark
phase on Days 1–4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Figs. 2</xref>F–I). However, the
locomotor activity of the BTBR mice peaked just after the beginning of the dark phase
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2J</xref>), suggesting that the BTBR mice
maintained a normal circadian rhythm.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Altered social behavior in the BTBR mice under a group housing condition</title>
<p>Next, we quantified the time spent alone as an index of social behavior in the B6-only
and BTBR-only housing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>The amount of time B6 and BTBR mice spent alone in the B6-only and BTBR-only

shown as mean ± SE and were analyzed using a Welch two-sample

***<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="expanim-68-319-g003"></graphic></fig>). In the novel environment, the ratio of time that the BTBR mice spent alone was
lower than that of the B6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3A</xref>).
Thereafter, we did not observe any significant differences in the amount of time spent
alone until Day 4. The B6 mice showed a tendency to gradually decrease the amount of time
spent alone during the light phase. The pattern was reversed during the dark phase, with
an increase in time spent alone observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). In contrast, the BTBR
mice did not show continually changes in the amount of time spent alone in the light and
dark phases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Therefore, the difference between the two mice groups
increases with time, and might become significant on the fourth day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Effects of co-housing with the B6 mice on the behavior of the BTBR mice</title>
<p>To validate whether the behavior of the BTBR mice was affected by the properties of their
cage mates, we examined behavior in the B6-BTBR-mix housing condition, in which two B6 and
two BTBR mice were placed in the same experimental cage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig. 4A</xref><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig_004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Activity of B6 and BTBR mice in the B6-BTBR-mix housing condition.

in the B6-BTBR-mix condition, except on Day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Figs.

groups during the light phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Figs. 4</xref>B–E).
Additionally, the circadian rhythm of the locomotor activity of both strains of mice
remained normal under the B6-BTBR-mix condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_004">Fig.

<p>In the B6-BTBR-mix housing condition, the amount of time spent alone by the BTBR mice was
comparable to that of the B6 mice, with the exception of in a novel environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig. 5</xref>). We also examined whether individual animals
exhibited a social preference by analyzing the time spent with B6 or BTBR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_006">Fig. 6A</xref><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig_006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p>The amount of time B6 and BTBR mice spent in social interaction in the B6-BTBR-mix

<title>Correlation analyses of mouse age and behavioral phenotypes</title>
<p>As shown above, the BTBR mice exhibited lower activity levels in the dark phase and
alterations in their social behavior in comparison with the B6 mice. As we used a wide
range of animal ages in this study (8–24 weeks, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), we investigated
whether the phenotypes of the BTBR mice were affected by the age of the mouse using data
from all three housing conditions (B6-only, BTBR-only, and B6-BTBR-mix housing
conditions). There was no significant correlation between mouse age (weeks) and total
distance traveled (meters) in the B6 mice during the dark phase on Days 1–4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary
Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Likewise, in the BTBR mice, no significant correlation
between mouse age (weeks) and total distance traveled (meters) was detected during the
dark phase, except on Day 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary Fig. 3B and Supplementary Table 2</xref>).
Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between mouse age (weeks) and time spent
alone (%) in the B6 mice during the light phase. Similarly, no significant difference was
found in the BTBR mice during the light phase, except on Day 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary Fig. 4 and
Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The significant correlation on Day 2 in the BTBR mice cannot
explain the phenotype of BTBR mice observed in this study. In the comparison of age
between groups, there were no significant differences between the BTBR and B6 mice in the
B6-only and BTBR-only housing conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>), or the B6-BTBR-mix
housing conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Behavioral phenotypes of the BTBR mice, assessed by conventional behavioral
tests</title>
<p>Our findings obtained by MAPS under a long-term group housing condition are very
different from those observed in previous studies using the conventional open-field test
and three-chamber test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. To investigate these
differences, we assessed the behavioral phenotypes of the BTBR mice by conventional
behavioral tests (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). The open-field test results showed that BTBR mice
exhibited higher locomotor activity than the B6 mice, consistent with previous studies
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary Fig. 6A</xref>). Interestingly, locomotor activity of the BTBR mice peaked just
after the beginning of the open-field test and then gradually decreased over time,
eventually reaching a level comparable with that of the B6 mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary Fig. 6A,
6C, 6D</xref>). No difference in time spent in the center was found between the B6 and BTBR mice
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary Fig. 6B</xref>). These results suggest that the higher activity of the BTBR mice
measured by the open-field test is an instantaneous and transient phenotype.</p>
<p>We next examined the behavioral responses of the BTBR mice to novel object and social
stimuli. The BTBR mice showed a significant increase in the time spent in the object
corner compared to the B6 mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary Fig. 7A</xref>). In contrast, no difference in the
time spent in the social corner was observed between the BTBR and B6 mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary
Fig. 7B</xref>). A comparison of the responses to the object and social stimuli in each group
showed that the B6 mice spent significantly more time in the social corner than in the
object corner, whereas the BTBR mice spent a comparable amount of time in both corners
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pdf_001">Supplementary Fig. 7C</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated the behavioral phenotypes of the BTBR mice continuously for 4 days
under group housing conditions using MAPS, a recently developed video-based behavioral
analysis system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. MAPS revealed that the BTBR mice
exhibited significantly less locomotor activity than the B6 mice during the dark phase.
Using a computer vision system capable of capturing the behavior of a single mouse in the
home-cage environment, Jhuang <italic>et al.</italic> reported that the total resting time
of the BTBR mice was significantly longer than that of the B6 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. The results obtained from the long-term observation system were
inconsistent with previous reports of studies that analyzed behavior using conventional
behavioral tests (i.e., open-field test), which showed higher levels of locomotor activity
in the BTBR mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. However, our results also show that BTBR mice exhibit hyperactivity in the
conventional open-field test, suggesting that inconsistent results between the studies using
MAPS (long-term observation system) and studies using a conventional open-field test are not
due to differences in the experimental environment between the facilities. These results
demonstrate that the analysis of an animal model using conventional behavioral tests under
simplified artificial conditions and over short observation durations cannot evaluate the
more precise and ethological aspects of the animal model.</p>
<p>The BTBR mouse strain is a widely used model of ASD because of the animals’ reduced
sociability, which is consistent with the most important features of the ASD phenotype
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. In this
study, we quantified the time spent alone as an index of social behavior and showed that the
ratio of time that the BTBR mice spent alone was significantly lower than that of the B6
mice in the novel environment. However, the amount of time spent alone increased during the
light phase on Day 4 in the B6-only and BTBR-only housing conditions. Although it is
difficult to explain the bidirectional change in social behavior that occurred in the BTBR
mice, it is possible that the B6 mice changed their behavior according to the change in
environment while the behavior of the BTBR mice remained constant. This explanation is
inferred from our finding that B6 mice showing a tendency to gradually decrease the amount
of time spent alone during the light phase and BTBR showing no continually change, resulting
the difference between the two mice groups increases with time. This suggests that the BTBR
mice are indifferent to alterations in their surrounding environment and act at their own
pace. This behavioral inflexibility of the BTBR mice is consistent with the clinical
symptoms of ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Then, we examined if co-housing with B6 mice could change the behavior of the BTBR mice.
Our previous study revealed that the phenotype of the socially isolated-reared mice after
weaning was partially rescued by co-housing with group-housed/reared mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. In contrast, the BTBR mice exhibited a robust
phenotype and the influence of co-housing with the B6 mice on this phenotype was weak and
limited. However, it is noteworthy that the housing of the BTBR mice with the B6 mice
occurred after the animals reached adulthood (8–24 weeks of age) and for only 4 days in this
study. It would be interesting to determine if co-housing with the B6 mice for a longer
period starting at a younger age would lead to different alterations in the behavioral
phenotype of the BTBR mice, particularly because we previously showed that the thinner
myelin found in the mPFC of the BTBR mice was rescued by co-housing with B6 mice after
weaning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. That is, the extent of mPFC myelination
may be dependent on social experience with cage mates in early life. Several studies have
demonstrated that myelin is required to exert proper brain function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>], and that mPFC myelination
plays an important role in the social behavior of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Furthermore, BTBR mice exhibited a tendency to spend more time with other BTBR mice than
with the B6 mice during the active period (novel environment and dark phase) in the
B6-BTBR-mix housing condition. During the dark phase, the BTBR mice showed lower activity
than the B6 mice; it is possible that mice with lower activity levels would be more likely
to spend more time together. However, since the activity of the BTBR mice was comparable to
that of the B6 mice in the novel environment, we cannot exclude the possibility that BTBR
mice prefer to spend time with the same strain. This possibility may be related to human
studies which recently reported an atypical form of empathy in individuals with ASD toward
others with ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported impaired sociability in BTBR mice using the conventional
three chamber test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>] and the visible burrow system (VBS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. However, the impairment of
sociability in BTBR mice measured by MAPS seems to be more uncertain than previous studies.
In addition, conventional behavioral tests in this study showed that the BTBR mice exhibited
an increased response to a novel object compared to the B6 mice, whereas, no difference was
observed in their responses to a social stimulus. These results suggest that the impairment
of sociability in BTBR mice might not be severe, but the response to the object is stronger.
Our results suggest that sociability in the BTBR mice is impaired because the BTBR mice are
more attracted to objects in the conventional three chamber test. In the very large
experimental cage like VBS, which comprises a burrow/tunnel system and an adjacent open
surface area, the lower activity of the BTBR mice might lead to a decrease in the number of
approaches and an increase in time spent alone because they cannot find cage mates, which
may be interpreted as an impairment of sociability. Behavioral tests include a number of
confounding factors, so it is important to evaluate and consider the phenotype of the animal
model by comprehensively interpreting the results of various types of tests.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, MAPS would be useful for evaluating the usual/natural behaviors of
animal models in a long-term group housing setting. However, there are some limitations of
MAPS. Especially, MAPS takes images at 1 fps, a time resolution that makes it difficult to
assess fine-scale behavioral interactions, such as an approach or chasing/following
behaviors, which are evaluated in human observation-based approaches. It is necessary to
improve the time resolution of MAPS for analyzing fine-scale and detailed behavioral
interactions in future studies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrated the behavioral phenotypes of the BTBR mice, i.e., lower
activity levels during the dark phase, alteration of social behavior, and inflexible
behavior, under a group housing condition under long-term observation using MAPS. MAPS is a
useful tool for the detailed and ethological evaluation of the behavioral phenotypes of
animal models.</p>
