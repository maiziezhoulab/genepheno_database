<abstract>
<p>Transcription disequilibria are characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases. The activity-evoked transcription of immediate early genes (IEGs), important for neuronal plasticity, memory and behavior, is altered in CNS diseases and governed by epigenetic modulation. KDM1A, a histone 3 lysine 4 demethylase that forms part of transcription regulation complexes, has been implicated in the control of IEG transcription. Here we report the development of vafidemstat (ORY-2001), a brain penetrant inhibitor of KDM1A and MAOB. ORY-2001 efficiently inhibits brain KDM1A at doses suitable for long term treatment, and corrects memory deficit as assessed in the novel object recognition testing in the Senescence Accelerated Mouse Prone 8 (SAMP8) model for accelerated aging and Alzheimer’s disease. Comparison with a selective KDM1A or MAOB inhibitor reveals that KDM1A inhibition is key for efficacy. ORY-2001 further corrects behavior alterations including aggression and social interaction deficits in SAMP8 mice and social avoidance in the rat rearing isolation model. ORY-2001 increases the responsiveness of IEGs, induces genes required for cognitive function and reduces a neuroinflammatory signature in SAMP8 mice. Multiple genes modulated by ORY-2001 are differentially expressed in Late Onset Alzheimer’s Disease. Most strikingly, the amplifier of inflammation <italic>S100A9</italic> is highly expressed in LOAD and in the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice, and down-regulated by ORY-2001. ORY-2001 is currently in multiple Phase IIa studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>KDM1A is a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) dependent amine oxidase that acts primarily as a histone demethylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref001">1</xref>]. KDM1A is recruited by zinc finger (ZNF) TFs into repressive complexes, interacts tightly with RCOR and HDAC1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref002">2</xref>] and demethylates primarily H3K4me2/1 marks, associated with the active transcription state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref003">3</xref>]. Nevertheless, KDM1A was also identified in protein complexes associated with activation of transcription, and in this context the protein was described to demethylate H3K9me2/1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref004">4</xref>] or H4K20me2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>KDM1A is implicated in a variety of biological processes. Required during embryogenesis and normal hematopoiesis, it is over-expressed in certain cancer types and plays a key role in leukomogenesis. Certain types of leukemia and solid cancer types like small cell lung cancer are highly sensitive to both KDM1A knock-down and inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref008">8</xref>], and several selective KDM1A inhibitors are in Phase I and II clinical trials for the treatment of hematological or solid tumor indications.</p>
<p>KDM1A is also required for neurogenesis, and has a role in neuron progenitor cells (NPCs) proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref011">11</xref>] and terminal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref014">14</xref>]. While KDM1A-mediated repression of gene expression (GE) is required for NPC maintenance, the morphogenic properties of KDM1A require dimming of the repressive activity of KDM1A. This is achieved through: rapid feedback mechanisms to lower KDM1A expression level described in olfactory sensor neurons, accelerated protein degradation through PHF15/JADE-2, or alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref017">17</xref>]. KDM1A is expressed in a ubiquitous fashion throughout the body, yet the brain and more specifically, neurons, express developmentally regulated splice forms that incorporate a small additional exon (E8a = DTVK). While there is no consensus on its exact mechanism of action, there is a general agreement that the neuron specific splice form counteracts the ubiquitous splice form and is required for neuronal differentiation and memory. This idea is supported both by the neuro splice form selective KDM1A knockouts and by isoform usage during neuronal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we describe the development and pharmacological characterization of the brain penetrant KDM1A inhibitor ORY-2001 (vafidemstat), reveal its capacity to rescue cognitive deficits and behavior alterations in rodent models, and report on the compound’s mechanism of action.</p>

<title>ORY-2001 is a covalent inhibitor of KDM1A and MAO-B</title>
<p>Computational models based on X-ray structures of KDM1A, MAO-A and MAO-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref022">22</xref>], fine-tuned with preliminary SAR data, were used to design and synthesize &gt;800 KDM1A inhibitors using the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor tranylcypromine (TCP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref024">24</xref>] as a chemical starting point. Molecules were ranked for KDM1A, MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitory activity using biochemical assays as described in Methods, and represented in a bubble diagram (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Fruit of these efforts, we identified ORY-2001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), a compound with mean IC<sub>50</sub> values of 101 ± 40 nM in KDM1A and 73 ± 34 nM in MAO-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). KDM1A is inhibited by covalent binding of ORY-2001 to the FAD cofactor, as shown by changes in the absorbance spectrum of the FAD cofactor and by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s001">S1B and S1C Fig</xref>). The FAD adducts are formed by cyclopropyl ring opening; similarly to adducts formed with TCP described in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref020">20</xref>]. ORY-2001 does not bind free FAD and displays excellent selectivity for inhibition of KDM1A and MAO-B over other FAD containing monoamine oxidases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s007">S1A Table</xref>). The <italic>in vitro</italic> kinetics of inhibition of KDM1A; or of the KDM1A, KDM1A-E8a or KDM1A-E2a/8a isoforms in complex with RCOR1, were analyzed using a H3K4me2 tail peptide as a substrate. The k<sub>inact</sub>/K<sub>i</sub> value for ORY-2001 using the pure recombinant enzyme was 14509 M<sup>-1</sup>sec<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s007">S1 Table</xref>). Addition of RCOR1 increased the k<sub>inact</sub>/K<sub>i</sub> values, but all splice forms were efficiently inhibited by ORY-2001 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s007">S1 Table</xref>). KDM1A inhibitors have been described to induce differentiation in acute myloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. The cellular activity of ORY-2001 was evaluated using a fluorescent assisted cell sorting (FACS) based CD11B induction assay in the AML cell line THP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref008">8</xref>], and yielded an EC<sub>50</sub> of 21 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). A chemoprobe based assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref026">26</xref>] was used to directly assess KDM1A target engagement in the same cell line; and the EC<sub>50</sub> was ~ 1 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g001">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>

<p>The specificity of ORY-2001 was evaluated further in a panel of 19 epigenetic targets. At 10 μM, none of the epigenetic targets were &gt;15% inhibited (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s007">S1B Table</xref>). In a broader panel, 86 additional pharmaceutical targets (CEREP) were used to test ORY-2001 at a concentration of 10 μM and only two targets showed &gt;50% inhibition of enzymatic activity or ligand binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s007">S1C Table</xref>): MAO-B (94%) and the I2 imidazoline receptor (71%), respectively. MAO-A inhibition at 10 μM was 37%, in line with internal data. Altogether, these data illustrate that ORY-2001 is selectively inhibiting KDM1A and MAO-B <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics, platelet pharmacodynamics and KDM1A target engagement and selectivity relative to MAO-B and MAO-A, were characterized in rodents and can be found in the Supporting Materials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s008">S2 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s002">S2 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s014">S1 File</xref>). Summarized, ORY-2001 efficiently crosses the BBB in rodents and inhibits KDM1A &gt; MAO-B &gt; MAO-A <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>ORY-2001 was tested in maximum tolerated dose (MTD) studies. As expected, the dose limiting toxicity of ORY-2001 in 5 day MTD studies was the hematopoietic impact associated with KDM1A inhibition, as reflected by a reversible and dose dependent impact on platelets (PLTs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The MTD studies and pharmacokinetics data served to estimate doses for long term treatment in efficacy models.</p>

<title>ORY-2001 rescues the memory of SAMP8 mice</title>
<p>The SAMP8 mouse is a non-transgenic model for accelerated aging and Alzheimer’s disease. These animals have a shortened life-span and accumulate many of the histopathological, cognitive and behavioral hallmarks present in the human AD pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref028">28</xref>]. SAMP8 mice have been characterized by genome wide expression analysis and deep sequencing, and mutations contributing to the phenotype have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref030">30</xref>]. The evolution of the memory deficit of SAMP8 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) can be reliably assessed using the novel object recognition test (NORT) and is significant in both sexes from 5 months of age. The relative independence of the NORT parameters from potential interfering factors (stress, physical condition,…) as well as the reproducibility of the phenotype and the ample test window provide the NORT assay with optimal characteristics for pharmacological dose range testing. ORY-2001 was tested in a series of experiments in SAMP8 mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s009">S3 Table</xref>) summarized below. Vehicle treated SAMR1 mice were included as a reference strain.</p>

<title>Therapeutic dose range finding</title>
<p>ORY-2001 was administered for 2 to 4 months in drinking water, at doses ranging from 0.11 to 3.2 mg/kg/day in female or male SAMP8 mice (Exp1 to Exp3). Treatment was well tolerated. At the highest dose a mild weight loss and toll on fitness was observed, accompanied by a ~ 50% reduction of PLT level, indicating that the maximum tolerated dose for long term treatment had been reached. Vehicle treated SAMP8 mice were unable to discriminate novel from familiar objects, and this deficit was dose dependently restored by treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s003">S3A–S3D Fig</xref>). The lowest dose (0.11 mg/kg/day) provided ~ 50% rescue. The therapeutic window was estimated to be at least 30 fold. KDM1A target engagement in samples from the cortex of animals treated with ORY-2001 was assessed using chemoprobe ELISA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref026">26</xref>] and correlated with the observed functional effects on memory as assessed by NORT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>KDM1A inhibition is key to the memory rescue by ORY-2001</title>
<p>To evaluate the relative contribution of the KDM1A and MAO-B inhibition, we tested the brain-penetrant selective KDM1A inhibitor ORY-LSD1 (Exp3) and the selective MAO-B inhibitor rasagiline (RSG, Exp4) in parallel with ORY-2001 in the SAMP8 model. The target selectivity profile of ORY-LSD1 is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s007">S1 Table</xref> and its PK profile in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s008">S2 Table</xref>. The doses of ORY-2001 and ORY-LSD1 were normalized to the equivalent impact on hematopoiesis found in MTD experiments. RSG was used at 3 mg/kg/day, a dose sufficient to achieve complete MAO-B inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref031">31</xref>]. As in previous experiments, ORY-2001 (0.32 and 0.96 mg/kg/day) completely restored the discrimination capacity. ORY-LSD1 (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg/day) was also efficacious although less than ORY-2001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). RSG demonstrated a tendency for improvement without reaching significance (p = 0.12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). These results show that KDM1A inhibition, the main pharmacological activity of ORY-2001 <italic>in vivo</italic> as assessed in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> target engagement or inhibition assays, is key to memory rescue in this model, although MAO-B inhibition could provide a minor contribution.</p>

<p>ORY-2001 was tested in a complete two‐period cross-over experiment (Exp6). Five month old female SAMP8 mice were divided in 4 groups, treated for either 2 months with 0.32 mg/kg/day ORY-2001 (complete period), for 1 month with ORY-2001 and 1 month with vehicle (withdrawal), for 1 month with vehicle and 1 month with ORY-2001 (delayed start) or treated with vehicle for 2 months (vehicle). All animals were tested by NORT at the end of treatment (month 7). The discrimination capacity was restored in the complete period and delayed start group. Interestingly, the withdrawal group remained significantly improved relative to the vehicle treated group 1 month after treatment interruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Brain pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s008">S2A Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s002">S2B Fig</xref>) show that brain compound and target engagement levels return to baseline in less than 1 and ~ 3 days, respectively. The therapeutic effect therefore outlasts the target turnover, and provide the first indication that ORY-2001 may have disease-modifying potential.</p>
<p>Finally, the memory deficit was assessed in aged SAMP8 mice. Eight month old SAMP8 mice were treated for 4 months with ORY-2001 or vehicle, and compared with vehicle treated SAMR1 mice of the same age (Exp7). The NORT of the SAMR1 mice indicated that cognitive decline had also started in the reference strain (mean DI = 0.3), but again, treatment fully rescued the performance of the SAMP8 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>Changes underlying the memory rescue in the NORT, were analyzed using a microarray-based survey of pooled hippocampal samples from SAMR1 mice and vehicle or ORY-2001 treated SAMP8 mice. To maximize the probability of identifying changes, the highest dose experiment was used (Exp1), and to assess both the differential expression between genotype or caused by treatment, all samples were compared to the vehicle treated SAMP8 mice using two color hybridization.</p>
<p>The survey confirmed a large part of the previously described genotype-associated differences in hippocampal expression in SAMP8 versus SAMR1 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref029">29</xref>], including higher expression of a set of genes in a region of chr4 amplified in SAMP8 mice including <italic>Ccl19</italic>, <italic>Ccl27</italic>, <italic>Oprs1</italic> and higher expression of <italic>Kif5b</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r1a</italic> in SAMR1, which served for genotype confirmation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

<title>ORY-2001 does not affect anxiety</title>
<p>SAMP8 mice have been reported to have age dependent modified anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref045">45</xref>]. To evaluate whether ORY-2001 affected anxiety, male mice were treated from month 5 of age with vehicle, 0.32 or 0.96 mg/kg/day ORY-2001, or 3 mg/kg/day RSG. In month 7 the animals were sequentially submitted to the open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM) test to evaluate the effect on anxiety; and in the NORT. NORT results were essentially as in previous experiments. There were no significant genotype or treatment differences in the OF test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). SAMP8 mice spent a significantly increased time in the open arms of the EPM relative to SAMR1 mice, but this behavior was not significantly modified by ORY-2001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Therefore, ORY-2001 did not have anxiolytic or sedative activity in SAMP8 mice.</p>
<p>ORY-2001 was also evaluated in the rat rearing isolation model. Adult isolated male rats at PND 61 were treated with vehicle or 0.16 or 0.48 mg/kg/day ORY-2001 administered in drinking water for approximately 1 month. Effect on anxiety was evaluated in the EPM (PND 87–88) and on aggressiveness and social interaction in the RI test (PND 94). ORY-2001 did not produce any significant effect on anxiety or locomotor activity as assessed in the EPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>).</p>

<title>ORY-2001 reduces aggression and improves social behavior</title>
<p>Impaired sociability and other social behavior alterations are associated with many psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
<p>SAMP8 mice exhibit aggressive behavior, which to the best of our knowledge had not been evaluated previously. The effect of ORY-2001 on aggression and social interaction was evaluated in the resident-intruder (RI) test (Exp8). A first cohort of SAMP8 animals was treated with vehicle, 0.32 or 0.96 mg/kg/day ORY-2001 for 5 weeks from month 5 of age; tested in the NORT and in the RI test, in which an intruder mouse of different strain is introduced in the cage of the tested animal (the “stress” cohort). A second cohort (the “basal” cohort) was treated pharmacologically in identical manner but not subjected to the RI test, and included as a comparator for subsequent biomarker analysis (see below). SAMR1 mice were included as a reference strain in both cohorts. No significant strain- or treatment-differences were found in the time spent in social interactions or in the number of rearings in male mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). SAMP8 mice showed a tendency to increase the latency to attack after ORY-2001 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). The number of attacks and especially number of clinch attacks increased strikingly in SAMP8 relative to SAMR1 mice, and was lowered to SAMR1 levels by ORY-2001, in absence of any sign of sedation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g008">Fig 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s004">S4C Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s012">S1 Video</xref>). This experiment was repeated using ORY-2001 at 0.96 mg/kg/day with similar results (Exp5, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s009">S3 Table</xref>). These data showed ORY-2001 reduced aggressiveness of SAMP8 mice, without causing sedation.</p>

<p>SAMP8 mice have been shown to have deficits in social interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref045">45</xref>]. We evaluated the effect of 0.96 mg/kg/day ORY-2001, initiated at 8 months of age, on social interaction alterations of 12 month old female aged mice in the Three-Chamber Test (TCT, Exp7). This test is useful for quantifying effects in social interaction in animals exhibiting innate or acquired deficits in social behavior. Contrary to female SAMR1 mice, SAMP8 mice showed no preference for the socialization chamber in which a mouse is introduced over a chamber with an unanimated object, and they also spent less time exploring the cage with a mouse. Treatment restored the time SAMP8 spent exploring mice introduced in the cage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g008">Fig 8B</xref>), and the preference for the socialization chamber (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s004">S4D Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s013">S2 Video</xref>) to SAMR1 levels.</p>
<p>We also studied the effect of ORY-2001 in the rat isolation rearing model. Rats were isolated after weaning on Post Natal Day (PND) 21 and deprived of the normal environment that preconditions their social behavior. Isolation in this phase of the development of the rat leads to pathological aggressive behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref046">46</xref>] and/or a lack of interest for social interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref047">47</xref>]. The rat isolation model has been proposed to model social avoidance occurring in neuropsychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref048">48</xref>]. Adult isolated male rats at PND 61 were treated with vehicle or 0.16 or 0.48 mg/kg/day ORY-2001 administered in drinking water for approximately 1 month and evaluated in the RI test at PND 94. The RI test did not reveal aggressive behavior in the rats nor did isolation significantly affect active or passive social interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s004">S4E and S4F Fig</xref>). The most striking behavioral difference between non-isolated and isolated rats in the RI test was seen in the social avoidance parameters. The time without social interaction in isolated rats was dose dependently reduced by treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g008">Fig 8C</xref>), and the number of evitations, which was greatly increased in isolated rats, was restored to normality by treatment with ORY-2001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g008">Fig 8D</xref>).</p>
<p>Summarized, ORY-2001 drastically reduced aggressiveness and improved social interaction alterations in these rodent models, but did not act as a sedative or anxiolytic drug.</p>

<p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to play an important role in the control of aggressive behavior.

<p>The expression of selected genes was also analyzed in individual mice from the different cohorts. The genotype and treatment group of each individual animal was verified using <italic>Ccl19</italic> qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g009">Fig 9C</xref>) and KDM1A TE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g009">Fig 9D</xref>), respectively.</p>
<p>It is known that the stress response encompasses modulation of plasticity related genes in a neuronal activity dependent fashion. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the stress response of IEGs like <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Npas4</italic> and of other genes like <italic>Calb2</italic> and <italic>Gng4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g009">Fig 9E–9H</xref>) is compromised in SAMP8 relative to SAMR1 mice, and that treatment with ORY-2001 rescued or potentiated the response capacity, by increasing the gap between the “basal” and “stress” induced levels in the PFC of SAMP8 mice. This effect was reminiscent of the effect of the broad spectrum HDAC inhibitor SAHA on the expression of <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Egr1</italic> in KDM1A-E8a KO mice. These mice display a deficient stress response and a low anxiety phenotype that can be rescued by SAHA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref053">53</xref>].</p>
<p>To evaluate the relevance of these markers to Late Onset Alzheimer’s Disease (LOAD), we also re-examined the biomarkers in the NCBI GEO: GSE44770 dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref044">44</xref>]. While it is evidently not possible to analyze the stress response in post-mortem samples, it was noted that IEGs, GABAergic or glutamatergic synapse genes and signal transduction genes) that exhibited deficient stress response in SAMP8, as well as neuronal plasticity genes like <italic>UCHL1</italic> and <italic>RBM3</italic>; and the neuropeptide <italic>PENK1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g010">Fig 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) were down-regulated in LOAD vs normal samples.

<title>KDM1A is recruited by transcription factors that modulate IEGs</title>
<p>The effects of KDM1A inhibition on transcription in different cell types or tissues may be conditioned largely by the endogenous TF landscape. A dual strategy was used to start and unravel the KDM1A interaction network in human neuronal (progenitor) cells or tissues, including unbiased and candidate based approaches. KDM1A chemoproteomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref025">25</xref>] was used to pull down (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s006">S6 Fig</xref>) and subsequently analyze KDM1A complexes from undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells by tandem mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s010">S4 Table</xref>). This approach identified many components of the core complex including KDM1A, RCOR3 &gt; RCOR2 &gt; RCOR1, HDAC2 &gt; HDAC1, and GSE1; in addition to KDM1A recruiting ZNF TFs like ZMYM2; ZNF516; and ZNF217 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g011">Fig 11A</xref>). No SNAG domain TFs (GFI1, GFI1B, SNAI, INMS1, OVOL2) were identified using chemoproteomics, as expected since chemoprobe and SNAG domain binding is mutually exclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref008">8</xref>] Chemoprobe- and KDM1A-interactor ELISAs confirmed the interaction with HDAC2 and HDAC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g011">Fig 11B</xref>). Interactor ELISAs further detected the ZNF TFs REST, MYT1, ZMYM3, ZEB1, ZNF326 and the SNAG domain containing ZNF TFs OVOL2, SNAI1; the general transcription factor GTF2I, as well as SRF, CTBP1, SIRT1 and SVIL. The ELISA assays revealed striking differences between the KDM1A interactome in SH-SY5Y cells (REST, ZNF217, MYT1, ZMYM2, and CtBP1 high and SRF low) and human hippocampus (SRF, OVOL2, GTF2I, and ZNF217 high, REST, MYT1, ZMYM2 and CTBP1, SVIL low) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233468.g011">Fig 11C and 11D</xref>). SRF was previously described to interact with KDM1A in the mouse hippocampus and is implicated in the transcriptional control of IEGs including of <italic>c-Fos</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref053">53</xref>]. GTF2I is involved in behavior and neurodevelopment disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref054">54</xref>], has been reported to interact with KDM1A in human iPSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref055">55</xref>] and, in another context, to be involved in the control of IEGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref056">56</xref>]. The interactions of KDM1A with SRF and GTF2I may therefore explain the modulation of IEGs in the mouse brain by ORY-2001 treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The use of epigenetic modulators offers a unique opportunity to redress transcriptional imbalances observed in neurodegenerative disease. HDAC inhibitors have been reported to be beneficial in animal models of a variety of human neurodegenerative conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref057">57</xref>]. Unfortunately, few HDAC inhibitors have progressed in the clinic for use in indications beyond hemato-oncology; hampered by the pleiotropy of HDAC function, the broad cytotoxicity of most HDAC inhibitors, and the difficulty to produce isoform selective inhibitors of HDAC2. Attempts to design these were reported to be underway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref058">58</xref>] yet recently efforts have been reoriented towards the development of RCOR1 complex-selective rather than isoform-selective Class I HDAC inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref059">59</xref>].</p>
<p>KDM1A and Class I HDACs coincide in transcription regulation complexes, more precisely in the RCOR1 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref060">60</xref>]. We chose KDM1A as the prime target and developed ORY-2001.</p>
<p>KDM1A inhibitors have been described to disrupt the interaction of KDM1A and GFI1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref061">61</xref>], a SNAG domain containing ZNF transcription factor key involved in hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref062">62</xref>]. The impact of long term treatment with a KDM1A inhibitor on hematology was a potential concern. MTD studies showed that at sufficiently high doses, ORY-2001 indeed impacts hematology. In spite of its effects on hematology at high doses, efficacy studies in rodent models showed that it provides a good therapeutic window for treatment of CNS diseases.</p>
<p>ORY-2001 can rescue the profound memory impairment developed by SAMP8 mice at doses that have no impact on hematology. Positive effects on memory have been reported with other KDM1A inhibitors. T-448 improved the learning function in NMDA receptor NR1 subunit hypofunction mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref063">63</xref>]. Iadademstat (ORY-1001), a highly potent selective KDM1A inhibitor in development for treatment of oncological diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref008">8</xref>], reversed cortical synaptic plasticity deficit and the working memory of SETD1 +/- mice, a model for schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref064">64</xref>].These data provide support for the potential of KDM1A inhibitors in learning and memory.</p>
<p>On the other side, a single high dose of the KDM1A inhibitor RN-1 was reported to provoke deleterious effects on long term memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref065">65</xref>]. However, at the very high dose used in that study, RN-1, a compound originally disclosed by Oryzon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref066">66</xref>], is also a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist (MRA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s010">S4 Table</xref>). Since MRAs like scopolamine are known to induce amnesia in animals and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref067">67</xref>], this activity may provide an alternative explanation to the observed effects. No detrimental neurological effects were reported when using lower doses of RN-1 in long term studies in baboons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref068">68</xref>].</p>
<p>ORY-2001 is not an MRA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0233468.s007">S1 Table</xref>) and did not lead to neurological alterations in the Functional Observation Battery after administration of a single dose to rats of up to 100 mg/kg, 500 times the NoAEL for long term studies.</p>
<p>Our data show the <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacological effect of ORY-2001 can be attributed primarily to KDM1A modulation. The genome wide GE analysis showed that ORY-2001 reduced an inflammatory signature and modulated the expression of genes, including immediate early genes (IEGs), previously described to be required for memory, synaptic plasticity and cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref069">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref071">71</xref>]. Interference with the organism´s capacity to induce these genes provokes memory deficit, as can be observed in mice with attenuated levels of <italic>Acetyl-CoA synthetase 2</italic> (<italic>Acss2)</italic>, a gene that regulates histone acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref072">72</xref>] or interestingly also in the selective knockout of the neurospecific KDM1A-E8a splice form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref005">5</xref>]. The original hypothesis on KDM1A-E8a postulated that <italic>in vivo</italic>, this splice form acts as a dominant negative form that counteracts the repressive activity of the canonical KDM1A splice form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref017">17</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref073">73</xref>]. Alternatively it was proposed that the neurospecific splice form has a distinct substrate specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Inhibition of KDM1A by ORY-2001 appears to have the opposite effect of the deletion of KDM1A-E8a, a splice form required for proper memory function. Indeed, contrary to what happens in KDM1A-E8a KO mice, where the IEG response is compromised; we have shown that chronic pharmacological modulation of KDM1A by ORY-2001 in SAMP8 mice <italic>facilitates</italic> the response of IEGs and shifts the epigenetic balance in a manner favorable to memory. SRF and GTF2I, two factors known to be involved in the control of transcription of IEGs including <italic>cFos</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref074">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref056">56</xref>], form part of the brain KDM1A interactome and are involved in memory and/or behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref075">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref054">54</xref>].</p>
<p>ORY-2001 positively affects cognition but it also corrected behavioral changes, like aggressive behavior and social interaction deficits. These data illustrate the potential of ORY-2001 for the non-sedative treatment of behavior disturbances associated with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders in addition to neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>ORY-2001 also reduced the expression of an inflammation signature in SAMP8 mice. The amplifier of inflammation <italic>S100a9</italic> appeared especially interesting as a biomarker. Knockout or knockdown of <italic>S100a9</italic> decreases the development of memory impairment and neuropathology in transgenic models of AD mice; in humans S100A9 is up-regulated in the hippocampus of AD patients and expressed in microglia in the proximity to Aβ plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref076">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref045">45</xref>], and has been suggested to act as a seeding factor for Abeta accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref077">77</xref>]. Strikingly, <italic>S100A8</italic> and <italic>S100A9</italic> are among the top up-regulated genes in the PFC of LOAD patients; and the S100A8/9 heterodimer is increased in the CSF of AD patients. <italic>S100a8</italic> and <italic>S100a9</italic> were reported to be highly expressed in FACS purified CD11B+CD11C- microglia, associated with the inflammatory response in a mouse model of AD, as opposed to CD11B+CD11C+ microglia, postulated to have a protective immune-modulatory phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref078">78</xref>]. Similarly, disease associated microglia (DAM) cells, assumed to have a protective function, have low <italic>S100a8</italic> and <italic>S100a9</italic> levels; while granulocytes/neutrophils have high <italic>S100a8</italic> and <italic>S100a9</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref079">79</xref>] and may promote AD-like pathology and cognitive decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref080">80</xref>].</p>
<p>S100A9 is also up-regulated in other diseases with a neuro-inflammatory component, including traumatic brain injury (TBI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref081">81</xref>], post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref082">82</xref>], and multiple sclerosis (MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref083">83</xref>]; broadening the potential therapeutic applications of ORY-2001. Indeed, we recently tested ORY-2001 in preclinical models for MS and found it to exert potent therapeutic activity, although the effect is unlikely to be attributed exclusively to S100A9.</p>
<p>In AD patients, cognitive decline is often accompanied by aggressiveness, agitation, psychosis, depression and apathy. Our data demonstrate that ORY-2001 acts on two processes that are frequently affected in neurodegenerative diseases: cognition and behavior. These findings position the compound as a promising candidate for the treatment of AD. In view of recent evidence for potential implication of herpes type viruses in the development of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref084">84</xref>], it is worthwhile to mention that KDM1A inhibitors can block herpes virus lytic replication, reactivation from latency in vitro, as well as infection, shedding and recurrence in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref085">85</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref087">87</xref>], although ORY-2001 has not been evaluated in this context.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Vafidemstat (ORY-2001) is a brain penetrant, orally bioavailable, small molecule inhibitor of the histone lysine demethylase KDM1A. ORY-2001 corrects memory deficit and behavior alterations including aggression and social interaction deficits in SAMP8 mice and social avoidance in the rat rearing isolation model. ORY-2001 increases the responsiveness of IEGs, induces genes required for cognitive function and reduces neuroinflammation in the brain of mouse models of CNS disease. Interestingly, many key genes modulated by ORY-2001 are differentially expressed in the brain of patients with AD or other diseases of the central nervous system.</p>
<p>The preclinical data presented in this manuscript provide support for vafidemstat (ORY-2001) for treatment of memory deficit and behavior alterations in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases.</p>
<p>Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and brain penetration of vafidemstat have been evaluated in a Phase I trial in healthy young and elderly volunteers (EUDRACT Nº 2015-003721-33). Currently vafidemstat is advancing in Phase IIa trials in patients with relapse-remitting and secondary progressive MS patients (SATEEN; EUDRACT Nº 2017-002838-23), with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease (ETHERAL; EUDRACT Nº 2017-004893-32 and ETHERAL-US; NCT03867253), and in patients with aggression across several psychiatric indications and in AD (REIMAGINE and REIMAGINE-AD; EUDRACT Nºs 2018-002140-88 and 2019-001436-54). The first positive human efficacy data for treatment of aggression in Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Borderline Personality Disorder have been reported, providing support for vafidemstat as an emerging therapeutic option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0233468.ref088">88</xref>]. Finally, recent data suggest that specific genetically defined populations of patients with schizophrenia and ASD may also benefit from treatment with vafidemstat.</p>

<p>ORY-2001 treatment effect on the DI in the NORT in male SAMP8 mice. The retention test was evaluated 2 (A,B) and 24 (C,D) hours after training to measure changes in medium and long term memory. Five month old animals were divided in two groups receiving 2 (N = 15-16/group) (A,C) and 4 (N = 9-10/group) (B,D) months of treatment. Means and SEM are represented. SAMR1 and SAMP8 vehicle groups were compared by t-Test. Among the SAMP8 cohorts, different drug treatments were compared by oneway-ANOVA with Dunnett and SNK post-Hoc analysis. **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001.</p>

<title>ORY-2001 remedies social behavior alterations in SAMP8 mice and rats in the isolation rearing model.</title>
<p>Social behavior in SAMP8 mice: (A) number of rearings in the RI test performed, (B) latency to attack and (C) number of attacks of vehicle treated SAMR1 and vehicle or ORY-2001 treated SAMP8 male mice (N = 5-8/group). SAMP8 animals did not show significant differences in the number of rearings or latency to attack compared to SAMR1 mice but SAMP8 animals did show higher number of attacks. Treatment with ORY-2001 had no significant effect on the number of rearings in SAMP8, but a dose dependent tendency to increase in the latency to attack was observed and a clear effect to reduce the number of attacks. (D) In the Three Chamber Test, SAMP8 animals do not show preference for the chamber with the novel mice, treatment with ORY-2001 restored the normal preference to similar levels observed in the SAMR1 (N = 9-12/group). SAMR1 and SAMP8 were compared by t-TEST. Means and SEM are represented. Vehicle and drug vs vehicle treatments in SAMP8 mice or isolated rats were compared by oneway-ANOVA with Dunnett and SNK post-Hoc analysis. Means and SEM are represented. *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001. Social behavior in the rat isolation rearing model: Time spent on (E) active and (F) passive social interactions in the RI test performed on vehicle treated control and vehicle or ORY-2001 treated isolated rats (N = 12/group). Isolated rats did not show significant differences in active or passive social interaction compared to non isolated rats and treatment with ORY-2001 had no effect on these parameters. Control and Isolated vehicle groups were compared by t-Test. Means and SEM are represented. Vehicle and drug vs vehicle treatments in SAMP8 mice or isolated rats were compared by oneway-ANOVA with Dunnett and SNK post-Hoc analysis. *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001.</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: In this impressive study, Maes et al. found a novel role of ORY-2001 for brain memory function in various Alzheimer’s disease animal models. Through a set of comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies the authors have successfully proven the hypothesis that epigenetic modulation concerts neuronal plasticity, memory function, and behaviors. This paper is very strong scientifically. The authors have explored all the controls which prove the main theory. The amount of supporting data (including supplementary figures) is overwhelming. Last but not least, it is a nicely written and very well organized paper.</p>
<p>1. I have only a few minor comments about the effect of ORY-2001 for rescuing the memory deficit in SAMP8 mice. Generally, Morris water maze test is one of majorly well-known animal memory tests. In this regard, if the water maze test is added in figure 2 or 3, then the manuscript would be much stronger.</p>
<p>2. The conclusion part is not supportive enough and does not meet the level of this paper’s data quality. Accordingly, I recommend that the authors could rewrite the conclusion part adequately.</p>
<p>Anyways, despite the above critiques, I still believe this is a great paper that is worth being published in this journal.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The authors report the development of vafidemstat (ORY-2001), a brain penetrant inhibitor of KDM1A and MAOB. They show extensive in vitro and in vivo rodent data on its selectivity and effects on gene expression and behavior. They mine human neuropathology gene expression data to show that many of the target genes are increased in Alzheimer disease. Overall, they provide compelling data on the efficacy of this novel compound. However, the following items should be addressed:</p>
<p>1) Please rephrase lines 9-11 for clarity and define SAMP8 model.</p>
<p>2) The authors state that ORY-2001 does not cause sedation but do not provide clear data to support this. They reference Fig 8A and S4 Fig C which do not appear to provide any measures of sedation.</p>
<p>3) Lines 416 and 417 reference only the SAMP8 mice, yet it is stated that comparison to SAMR1 is made.</p>
<p>4) It is not clear what is meant by “regulated in LOAD vs normal samples” in line 485. This should be clarified.</p>
<p>5) More details about the NCBI GEO: GSE44770 dataset should be provided including the numbers in each group, how groups were defined (clinically or pathologically), and age differences in order to best interpret this data. The possibility that differences between AD and control are due to neuronal loss/atrophy should be addressed.</p>
<p>6) For Figure 6C, images should be labeled with the relevant stain.</p>
<p>7) Interactor ELISA needs to be better defined and clearly delineated in the Figure 11 legend.</p>

<p>RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS</p>
<p>1. I have only a few minor comments about the effect of ORY-2001 for rescuing the memory deficit in SAMP8 mice. Generally, Morris water maze test is one of majorly well-known animal memory tests. In this regard, if the water maze test is added in figure 2 or 3, then the manuscript would be much stronger.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Morris Water Maze (MWM) is a standard test to measure memory deficits, and its use in SAMP8 mice has been described (Chen et al., 2004). We explored the MWM test in experiment 4. SAMR1 and SAMP8 groups (8 months old) learned to identify the location of the underwater platform during the training days. SAMP8 mice were slower than SAMR1 mice to reach the platform. </p>
<p>There was a tendency, but no significant difference for SAMR1 to spend more time in the platform quadrant than SAMP8 mice on the test day; i.e. the test did not provide an a priori good window for testing. SAMP8 mice behaved very poorly: their “total distance travelled” was much reduced compared to the SAMR1 control (a highly significant difference); and they exhibited “passive coping” (i.e. floating) behaviour rather than the normal swimming activity shown by the SAMR1 control strain. The lack of a significant difference between SAMR1 and SAMP8, together with the lack motivation for exploration and floating behaviour of SAMP8 mice invalidated this test as a means to evaluate memory in these animals. </p>
<p>On the contrary, SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice exhibited similar total exploration times in the NORT, allowing for a solid evaluation of the intended parameter. The differences in DI between SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice were highly significant and reproducible, which is why we opted for this particular test to explore different treatments, doses, duration, age, etc. </p>
<p>2. The conclusion part is not supportive enough and does not meet the level of this paper’s data quality. Accordingly, I recommend that the authors could rewrite the conclusion part adequately. </p>
<p>We didn’t want to be too redundant, but have now summarized the main conclusions in this section.</p>
<p>Anyways, despite the above critiques, I still believe this is a great paper that is worth being published in this journal.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The authors report the development of vafidemstat (ORY-2001), a brain penetrant inhibitor of KDM1A and MAOB. They show extensive in vitro and in vivo rodent data on its selectivity and effects on gene expression and behavior. They mine human neuropathology gene expression data to show that many of the target genes are increased in Alzheimer disease. Overall, they provide compelling data on the efficacy of this novel compound. However, the following items should be addressed:</p>
<p>1) Please rephrase lines 9-11 for clarity and define SAMP8 model.</p>
<p>Modified to: </p>
<p>ORY-2001 efficiently inhibits brain KDM1A at doses suitable for long term treatment, and corrects memory deficit as assessed in the novel object recognition testing the Senescence Accelerated Mouse Prone 8 (SAMP8) model for accelerated aging and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>2) The authors state that ORY-2001 does not cause sedation but do not provide clear data to support this. They reference Fig 8A and S4 Fig C which do not appear to provide any measures of sedation.</p>
<p>Our statement on the absence of sedation by the compound derives from the previous evaluation of locomotor activity of these mice cohorts, as measured by the total distances travelled in open field test (Figure 7A), and also by assessment of the total number of entries in both arms of the EPM and rats (Figure 7C). Both parameters are standard measures of locomotor activity that are decreased after treatment with sedatives like Midazolam (Olson and Sherwin, 2006) or triazolam and lorazepam (Krsiak and Sulcova, 1990). Also, ORY-2001 did not have an anxiolytic effect in SAMP8 mice or in the rat isolation rearing model as measured by the time spent in the open arms of the EPM (Figure 7B and 7D). Therefore, we concluded there was no sedative effect. The lack of sedative effect is also exemplified in the S1 and S2 videos. </p>
<p>3) Lines 416 and 417 reference only the SAMP8 mice, yet it is stated that comparison to SAMR1 is made. </p>
<p>The phrase was modified to: </p>
<p>“We performed a genome-wide microarray-based survey on pooled PFC samples from SAMR1 mice and vehicle and ORY-2001 treated SAMP8 mice from the “basal” cohort. All samples were compared to the vehicle treated SAMP8 mice, using two-color hybridization.”</p>
<p>4) It is not clear what is meant by “regulated in LOAD vs normal samples” in line 485. This should be clarified. </p>
<p>Modified to “… are down-regulated in LOAD vs normal samples”. Some markers like S100A9 are clearly up-regulated, but we treated them earlier in the text. Many of the other makers identified are down-regulated, which could indeed reflect either a lack of response capacity or a loss of cells that normally express these genes, or both. </p>
<p>5) More details about the NCBI GEO: GSE44770 dataset should be provided including the numbers in each group, how groups were defined (clinically or pathologically), and age differences in order to best interpret this data. The possibility that differences between AD and control are due to neuronal loss/atrophy should be addressed. </p>
<p>The authors thank the reviewer for pointing this out, as indeed other potential variables should be considered as potential causes for differential gene expression between the “LOAD” and “control” groups. Age and gender are obvious ones to examine; and available in the public NCBI GEO: GSE44770 dataset. For better clarity, we have now included mean ages and numbers of the LOAD and AD groups in the figure legend.</p>
<p>According to the original article reporting the GSE44770 dataset, groups were defined both clinically and pathologically; subjects were diagnosed with LOAD at intake and each brain underwent extensive LOAD-related pathology examination. </p>
<p>We analysed the age of the subjects included in the study and we identified an important difference in mean age between the LOAD (N = 129; average age = 82.1 years) and control (N = 101; average age = 65.2 years) groups. We also reviewed the male/female ratio in the dataset and found that it was 4.3 in the control group and 0.9 in the LOAD group, a substantial difference. These differences could be a source for differential gene expression (although on the other hand it is well known that gender and age are important risk factors for AD). </p>
<p>To evaluate the relevance of the biomarkers with independence of age, we made a sub-selection of subjects, in a rather tight central age window (68 y &lt; age &lt; 75 y), in order to obtain LOAD and control subcohorts within the same age range (LOAD: N = 23; average age = 72.5 y; control: N = 21; average age = 71.4 y). </p>
<p>Of course, this drastic reduction of the size of the population reduces the power of the analysis, and the signal was lost for 3 genes (CALB2, GNG4, NPAS4) that showed smaller sized differences in mean gene expression in the total population. However, the rest of the genes remained highly significant: S100A8 (FC = 4.24, p = 0.0002); S100A9 (FC = 3.93, p = 0.0001); EGR1 (FC = 0.54, p = 0.0022), EGR2 (FC = 0.57, p = 0.0028), FOS (FC = 1.71, p = 0.0044), PENK1 (FC = 0.63, p = 0.0037), RBM3 (FC = 0.43, p = 0.0004), GAD1 (FC = 0.42, p &lt; 0.0001), DOC2A (FC = 0.84, p = 0.0204), UCHL1 (FC = 0.52, p = 0.0001). Such genes were confirmed to be differentially expressed, and all changes were in the same direction as the total sample population. </p>
<p>Subsequently, in order to evaluate the relevance of the biomarkers with independence of gender, we evaluated males and females separately. Almost all markers remained highly significant and the direction and magnitude of change was similar in the female and male sub-cohorts, as can be seen in the images below (A - C). (NOTE images included in the Response to Reviewers pdf uploaded)</p>
<p>Therefore, unless the differences between LOAD and controls originate in yet another unidentified source of systematic variation, these genes appear to be robust markers reflecting genuine differences between LOAD and controls. </p>
<p>Finally, with respect to the possibility that differences between AD and control are due to neuronal loss / atrophy; we agree this is clearly a possibility for genes specifically expressed in neurons, like UCHL1. </p>
<p>6) For Figure 6C, images should be labelled with the relevant stain. </p>
<p>Corrected.</p>
<p>7) Interactor ELISA needs to be better defined and clearly delineated in the Figure 11 legend.</p>
<p>We have incorporated a schematic drawing of (chemoprobe) interactor ELISAs in Figure 11 and adapted the legend. For the interactor ELISAs, the antibodies combinations used for capture and detection are listed in the S2 File.</p>
