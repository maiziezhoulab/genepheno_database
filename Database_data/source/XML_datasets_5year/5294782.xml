<p>The regulation of cargo transport within neurons is not well understood.

<abstract>
<p>Autophagy plays an essential role in the cellular homeostasis of neurons, facilitating the clearance of cellular debris. This clearance process is orchestrated through the assembly, transport, and fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes for degradation. The motor protein dynein drives autophagosome motility from distal sites of assembly to sites of lysosomal fusion. In this study, we identify the scaffold protein CKA (connector of kinase to AP-1) as essential for autophagosome transport in neurons. Together with other core components of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex, we show that CKA associates with dynein and directly binds Atg8a, an autophagosomal protein. CKA is a regulatory subunit of PP2A, a component of the STRIPAK complex. We propose that the STRIPAK complex modulates dynein activity. Consistent with this hypothesis, we provide evidence that CKA facilitates axonal transport of dense core vesicles and autophagosomes in a PP2A-dependent fashion. In addition, CKA-deficient flies exhibit PP2A-dependent motor coordination defects. CKA function within the STRIPAK complex is crucial to prevent transport defects that may contribute to neurodegeneration.</p>

<body><sec id="s01" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>As postmitotic cells with an extended morphology and life span, neurons are especially sensitive to cellular insults that result in the accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles. Macroautophagy, herein referred to as autophagy, is an essential cellular process that functions to promote cellular homeostasis and is critical in neurons for clearing cellular debris and maintaining synaptic function and cell health. Indeed, defects in autophagy have been linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nixon et al., 2005</xref>) and amyotropic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikenaka et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Autophagy gives rise to the formation of a vesicular double-membrane organelle, termed the autophagosome, that encapsulates a portion of the cytoplasm along with damaged proteins and organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meléndez and Neufeld, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mizushima et al., 2010</xref>). The eventual clearance of autophagosomes and their engulfed contents is mediated by cytoplasmic dynein, the retrograde molecular motor that delivers autophagosomes to their sites of fusion with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ravikumar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maday et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome forms an acidified hybrid organelle, the autolysosome, in which degradation of the engulfed contents of the autophagosome occurs.</p><p>Autophagosomes accumulate in the neurons of neurodegenerative disease patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nixon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikenaka et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that a defect in proper autophagosome clearance may contribute to disease progression. Indeed, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, when autophagosome–lysosome fusion is defective, autophagosomes accumulate in neurons, and these animals have locomotor defects and decreased life spans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Takáts et al., 2013</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that autophagosome clearance is crucial for neuronal function. However, the mechanisms that regulate autophagy in neurons are not well understood. In particular, given the unique morphology of neurons, there is considerable interest in identifying the regulatory machineries involved in the targeting, attachment, and cytoskeletal transport of autophagosomes.</p><p>Scaffolding and adaptor proteins have emerged as key regulators of motor-driven organelle transport along microtubules, often acting to physically link motors and their cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schlager and Hoogenraad, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>). Scaffolding proteins can provide an additional level of regulation through their association with posttranslational protein modifiers, such as kinases and phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yasuda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kelkar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Willoughby et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horiuchi et al., 2007</xref>). The tethering of kinase and phosphatase activities to scaffold complexes provides a mechanism by which the motors, cargo attachments, and directed transport can be locally regulated. Using the strength of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics, we identify in this study a scaffolding protein, connector of kinase to AP-1 (CKA), as a new regulator of axonal transport.</p><p>CKA is homologous to the striatin family of proteins in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). CKA and striatin proteins are regulatory subunits of the serine/threonine phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). In addition, they are scaffolding proteins for the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goudreault et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ribeiro et al., 2010</xref>). The STRIPAK complex is a large molecular complex that is highly conserved from fungi to humans and contains PP2A and typically a sterile-20 kinase. PP2A is a holoenzyme consisting of a catalytic subunit, a structural subunit, and a regulatory subunit. Although the structural subunit provides the linkage between the catalytic and regulatory subunits, the regulatory subunit controls the subcellular localization or substrate specificity of the phosphatase activity. The core components of the mammalian STRIPAK complex are striatin family proteins (PP2A regulatory subunits), a PP2A catalytic subunit, a PP2A structural subunit, Mps one binder kinase activator-like 3 (Mob3), cerebral cavernous malformation 3 (Ccm3), striatin-interacting proteins 1 and 2 (STRIP1/STRIP2), and the germinal center kinase III (GckIII) subfamily of kinases MST4, STK24, and STK25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goudreault et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kean et al., 2011</xref>). The STRIPAK complex is conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and its core components consist of CKA (the sole striatin protein), microtubule star (Mts; the sole PP2A catalytic subunit), PP2A at 29B (Pp2A-29B; the sole PP2A structural subunit), Mob4 (orthologue of Mob3), Ccm3, Strip (orthologue of STRIP1), and GckIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ribeiro et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to the core components, the STRIPAK complex contains a less well-characterized set of STRIPAK-associated proteins, some of which appear to be mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goudreault et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ribeiro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hyodo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couzens et al., 2013</xref>). Reflective of the variation in protein compositions, striatins and related STRIPAK complexes have been connected to multiple clinical conditions, including autism, cerebral malformation, cardiac disease, cancer, and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hwang and Pallas, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we identify and characterize the role of CKA and the STRIPAK complex in axonal transport. Similar to dynein depletion, reducing CKA or STRIPAK components disrupts autophagosome transport in motoneurons. We find that CKA is present in a complex with dynein, and binds directly to the autophagosomal membrane protein Atg8a. We show that the STRIPAK components CKA, Mob4, and Strip also participate in the transport of dense core vesicles (DCVs), but not mitochondria. This transport is dependent on the association of the phosphatase PP2A with CKA. Our findings demonstrate that a STRIPAK complex functions to regulate the transport of a subset of organelles important for both protein/organelle turnover and neuronal signaling, and that CKA’s function within the nervous system is essential for locomotion and viability.</p></sec><sec id="s02" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>Dynein depletion disrupts autophagosome distribution in neurons</title><p>To study the transport of autophagosomes in an intact nervous system, we used <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval motoneurons with established and stereotyped synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). We monitored the distribution of autophagosomes using the autophagy-related protein, Atg8a. Atg8a, homologous to LC3 in mammals, is a cytoplasmic protein that upon autophagy induction is covalently linked to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on autophagosomal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mauvezin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shibutani and Yoshimori, 2014</xref>). To specifically label autophagosomes, we expressed a dual-tagged mCherry (mCh)-GFP-Atg8a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Takáts et al., 2013</xref>) in motoneurons using the driver <italic>Ok6-</italic>Gal4. Autophagosomes can be identified by the presence of both GFP and mCh fluorophores of this marker, whereas upon autophagosome–lysosome fusion the hybrid organelles become acidified, quenching the GFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kimura et al., 2007</xref>). Within motoneurons, we observed both a cytoplasmic and punctate autophagosomal distribution of Atg8a. We found that autophagosome punctae (punctae double labeled with mCh and GFP) were present in the synaptic terminals of motoneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B–B</xref>’’), but were rarely found within the cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D–D</xref>’’). However, when lysosomal acidification was blocked by the depletion of a V-ATPase subunit, resulting in defective autolyosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mauvezin et al., 2015</xref>), we observed a significant increase in the number of punctae in the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E–E</xref>’’) but only a minor increase at synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C–C</xref>’’; and Fig. S1 A). These results suggest that autophagic vesicles acidify en route to the cell body. The distribution differences we see in these in situ experiments are similar to those reported for cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maday et al., 2012</xref>). Our results suggest that autophagosomes that form at the synaptic terminals in <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneurons in situ are transported toward the cell body and acidify as they move retrogradely.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Autophagosomes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneurons in situ concentrate at synaptic terminals and are transported by dynein.</bold> mCh-GFP-Atg8a protein was expressed in motoneurons using the <italic>Ok6-Gal4</italic> driver to observe the distribution of autophagosomes.

We observed that depletion of dynein subunits resulted in the accumulation of autophagosomes within the most distal bouton (terminal bouton) of synaptic terminals (dynein heavy chain 64c subunit RNAi; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). In contrast, in control synaptic terminal autophagosomes were present but did not accumulate within terminal boutons of synaptic terminals at steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and F</xref>). To directly test whether the punctae that accumulate when dynein is depleted are autophagosomes, we simultaneously depleted dynein and disrupted the function of the autophagosome initiator kinase Atg1 by expression of a dominant-negative protein (Atg1 K38Q; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scott et al., 2007</xref>). We found that this significantly decreased the accumulation of autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, H–J</xref>). Expression of dominant-negative Atg1<sup>K38Q</sup> alone shows a cytoplasmic distribution of Atg8a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>). Collectively, these results support the role of the dynein motor complex in autophagosome transport for fusion with lysosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>Identification of CKA and its role in autophagic vesicle distribution at the synapse</title><p>We conducted an RNAi screen for <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologues of human proteins that identified candidate regulators of autophagosome transport in neurons (see Materials and methods). Among the candidate proteins recovered was CKA, an orthologue of the mammalian striatin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). In humans, there are three striatin proteins, Striatin (Strn), Striatin 3 (Strn3, also known as SG2NA), and Striatin 4 (Strn4, also known as Zinedin), which are predominantly expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castets et al., 2000</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, zygotic <italic>Cka</italic>-null mutants are pupal lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2002</xref>), and we find that RNAi depletion of CKA specifically in neurons has a similar or earlier lethal developmental phase.

We scored changes in the number of terminal boutons that exhibited accumulations of autophagic vesicles after the depletion of CKA. We compared a control, four independent <italic>Cka</italic> RNAi lines, a sequence-specific RNAi off-target control (C911; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mohr et al., 2014</xref>), and homozygous <italic>Cka</italic><sup>2</sup>-null mutant animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). Depletion of CKA increased the percentage of terminal boutons that exhibit autophagic vesicle accumulation as compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Interestingly, all of the <italic>Cka</italic> RNAi lines had a stronger accumulation phenotype than the homozygous <italic>Cka</italic><sup>2</sup>-null mutant. However, when we analyzed larval brains by Western blot, we found that the homozygous <italic>Cka</italic><sup>2</sup>-null mutants expressed more CKA protein than RNAi-depletion animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). By Western blot, we observed at least three bands that may correspond to specific protein isoforms (Fig. S1 B) or may represent posttranslational modifications. In addition, most of the CKA protein in larval brains derives from neurons, not from glia, as RNAi depletion of CKA in glia had little impact on CKA levels in the brain (Fig. S1 C). We therefore inferred that perdurance of maternally loaded <italic>Cka</italic> mRNA contributes to the weaker accumulation phenotype in the motoneurons of <italic>Cka</italic><sup>2</sup> mutants. The observed differences in levels of CKA protein in <italic>Cka</italic><sup>2</sup> and <italic>Cka</italic> RNAi neurons suggest that an RNAi approach to gene identification may be more informative than a mutant clonal analysis in certain cell types such as neurons. Collectively, our observations support the notion that neuronal CKA protein regulates axonal autophagosome transport, and specifically the retrograde traffic from the synaptic terminal to the cell body.</p></sec><sec id="s05"><title>CKA regulates autophagosome transport</title><p>To directly determine whether CKA depletion influences autophagosome transport, we performed live imaging of autophagosomes in motoneurons. <italic>mCh-GFP-Atg8a</italic> was expressed with <italic>M12-Gal4</italic>, which drives expression in two closely apposed motoneurons per segmental nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>). Autophagosome motility was monitored in the mid-axon region of the two motoneurons. To selectively monitor autophagosomes, not autolysosomes, we tracked only organelles marked by the GFP fluorescence of the mCh-GFP-Atg8a protein. In doing so, we found that there are strikingly few autophagosomes present within the mid-axon region of motoneurons (mean 1.0/axon pair in 2.5 min/108.36 µm; Fig. S2 A). To increase the number of autophagosomes for quantification, we used a mutation in <italic>syntaxin17</italic> (<italic>syx17<sup>LL</sup></italic>), an autophagosomal SNARE protein required for fusion with late endosomes/lysosomes. Blocking autophagosome–lysosome fusion increased the number of autophagosomes within the mid-axon region (mean 3.1/axon pair in 2.5 min/108.36 µm; Fig. S2 A). Interestingly, we found that autophagosomes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneurons retained motility in the <italic>syntaxin17</italic> homozygous mutant background and exhibited motility dynamics similar to heterozygous <italic>syx17<sup>LL</sup></italic>/+ controls (Fig. S2 B).

Importantly, the uncoordinated locomotor phenotype was not rescued by the mutant BFP-CKA<sup>ΔPP2A</sup> fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 A</xref> and Videos 5 and 6). In addition, an increase in pupal lethality was observed when BFP-CKA<sup>ΔPP2A</sup> fusion protein was expressed in neurons depleted of endogenous CKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 A</xref>), again supporting the conclusion that the BFP-CKA<sup>ΔPP2A</sup> mutant protein functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor of CKA function. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CKA’s function within the nervous system is dependent on PP2A activity and is required for coordinated locomotion in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig10" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>CKA is required for adult motor coordination.</bold> (A) Effect of depletion of CKA in late larval brains on viability and adult motor coordination. Expression of transgenes in late larval stages was controlled by feeding RU-486. Loss of neuronal CKA late in development has a minor effect on viability but results in a pronounced uncoordinated phenotype. This phenotype is rescued by BFP-CKA but not BFP-CKA<sup>ΔPP2A</sup> expression. (B) A model for the function of a STRIPAK complex in axonal transport. CKA functions as a scaffold protein, binding core STRIPAK components Mob4, Strip, and the structural subunit PP2A (A), as well as kinases. Strip binds directly to the P150 subunit of the dynactin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sakuma et al., 2014</xref>). Dynactin is a regulatory complex of dynein, and the dynein/dynactin association is necessary for retrograde transport. CKA binds directly to Atg8a, a protein that localizes to the membrane of autophagosomes. As a core STRIPAK component, CKA mediates attachment of autophagosomes to dynein/dynactin transport machinery. The STRIPAK complex also tethers PP2A and kinases that may coregulate the dynein-mediated transport of a subset of organelles.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_201606082_Fig10"></graphic></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Autophagy plays an important role in neuronal homeostasis, removing misfolded proteins and damaged organelles that compromise neuronal function. To our knowledge, this is the first study of the distribution and dynamics of autophagosomes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneurons in situ. We find that autophagosomes in neurons with established synaptic connections are primarily found within synaptic terminals and are rarely seen in motoneuron cell bodies. These autophagosomes move predominantly in a retrograde direction and are powered by the dynein motor, similar to the autophagosome dynamics described in cultured mammalian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maday et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>). We performed an RNAi-based screen and identified the striatin family protein CKA as a regulator of autophagosome transport.</p><p>CKA is a core component of the STRIPAK complex and scaffolds the phosphatase PP2A, kinases, and additional protein components, including Mob4 and Strip. We report that the STRIPAK complex plays a broad role in axonal transport, regulating the transport of autophagosomes and DCVs. Moreover, although the flux of both autophagosomes and DCVs through the axon is decreased by the depletion of STRIPAK components, mitochondrial transport is largely unaffected. This suggests that the STRIPAK complex has specificity in the regulation of organelle transport. Other work has suggested that the STRIPAK components Strip and Mob4 act globally to regulate microtubule stability and organization, potentially through the posttranslational modification of tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schulte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sakuma et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Strip and Mob4 mutants, defects in neuronal and synaptic morphologies have been observed and could arise as the downstream consequences of microtubule dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schulte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sakuma et al., 2014</xref>). Axonal aggregates and larval motility defects were also reported in Mob4 mutants, but whether these defects reflect a disruption of microtubule organization or the aberrant regulation of motor proteins was not addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schulte et al., 2010</xref>). Our observations of the differential impact of STRIPAK depletion in organelle transport are not readily explained by global defects in microtubule stability or microtubule organization and point to a specific defect in organelle transport regulation.</p><p>Our data suggest a model in which the STRIPAK complex acts as a molecular linker between autophagosomes and the dynein motor complex. We show that CKA directly binds the autophagosomal membrane protein Atg8a and, similar to the mammalian STRIPAK complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goudreault et al., 2009</xref>), also associates with cytoplasmic dynein. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that CKA/STRIPAK acts as a cofactor in the regulation of dynein. Further work will be required to understand the role of CKA in the attachment and regulation of motor proteins. In addition, our genetic and motility data further suggest that the STRIPAK complex acts to regulate dynein-based transport in neurons through phosphoregulation events. We hypothesize that dynein and dynein-associated proteins are likely substrates. Previous work by many groups has demonstrated that dynein subunits and dynein-associated proteins are phosphorylated. These phosphorylation events can modulate interactions between dynein, its regulators, or attached cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vaughan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pandey and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mitchell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klinman and Holzbaur, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nirschl et al., 2016</xref>), influencing transport or the initial loading of cargo. Previous work has shown that the loading of cargoes into the microtubule is dependent on retrograde machinery, including the dynein/dynactin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lloyd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moughamian and Holzbaur, 2012</xref>). Here, we find that autophagosomes accumulate at synaptic terminals after the depletion of CKA, suggesting a related regulatory role for CKA activity in dynein-mediated microtubule attachment in neurons.</p><p>Beyond acting as a putative molecular linker, we demonstrate that the CKA scaffold tethers the phosphatase PP2A, which modulates axonal transport. Previous studies have shown that PP2A regulatory subunits, including CKA, control PP2A phosphatase activity in a diverse array of cellular functions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Viquez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ribeiro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bose et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreazza et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sun and Buttitta, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Swarup et al., 2015</xref>). In motoneurons, disruption of all PP2A activities results in multiple neuronal phenotypes, including axonal transport defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Viquez et al., 2009</xref>). Our data support a model in which CKA is the PP2A-regulatory subunit that controls axonal transport. Depletion of CKA and PP2A exhibits similar axonal transport defect phenotypes. Moreover, we show that a BFP-CKA fusion protein partially rescues the DCV motility phenotype observed when CKA is depleted, whereas expression of BFP-CKA<sup>ΔPP2A</sup>, a mutant with greatly reduced PP2A binding capability, cannot rescue the DCV motility defects. A role in axonal transport has not been described for any of the other regulatory subunits in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. <italic>Well-rounded</italic>, another PP2A regulatory subunit, is known to regulate synaptic growth, cytoskeletal stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Viquez et al., 2006</xref>), and active zone stability but does not affect axonal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2014</xref>). In light of these observations, we propose that CKA not only acts as a linker to bridge autophagosomes to the dynein motor complex, but also regulates axonal transport through the modulation of PP2A phosphatase activity.</p><p>CKA likely scaffolds both PP2A and the kinase that functions in opposition to PP2A to regulate the phosphorylation of proteins required for retrograde dynein-mediated axonal transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 B</xref>). The opposing action of kinases and phosphatases serves to finely tune substrate activity in multiple cellular processes. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, GSK3β kinase acts in opposition to PP2A to coordinately regulate substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Viquez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to defects in axonal transport, aberrant cytoskeletal organization and defective development of synaptic active zones are observed after loss of PP2A activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneurons. Significantly, the active zone and cytoskeletal phenotypes are suppressed by a reduction in the level of GSK3β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Viquez et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, no suppression of the axonal transport defects was reported, suggesting that GSK3β is not the kinase that acts with PP2A to regulate axonal transport. Instead, the axonal transport defects and vesicle accumulations are more severe if both PP2A and GSK3β are reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Viquez et al., 2009</xref>). The increased severity may reflect the involvement of GSK3β in negatively regulating both kinesin-1 and dynein to coordinate bidirectional transport in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Weaver et al., 2013</xref>). These results suggest that another kinase, yet unidentified, functions in opposition to PP2A activity to regulate axonal transport. Our results suggest that Hpo is the candidate STRIPAK kinase that mediates autophagosome transport. Future work will seek to identify the STRIPAK-associated kinases in neurons and their substrates in neurons. Regardless of the identity of the STRIPAK-associated kinase, our work has linked the STRIPAK complex and its core PP2A regulatory subunit, CKA, to the transport of autophagosomes and DCVs in neurons. These results raise the possibility that dysregulation of axonal transport could underlie the previously reported linkage between PP2A dysfunction, tau hyperphosphorylation, synaptic deficits, and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gong et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rudrabhatla, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sontag and Sontag, 2014</xref>). In support of this possibility, our work demonstrates that depletion of CKA results in a severe neurological phenotype in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>The STRIPAK complex has recently been implicated in the regulation of a broad range of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ribeiro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kean et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hyodo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hwang and Pallas, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreazza et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lant et al., 2015</xref>). An important question is how the STRIPAK complex is targeted to specific functions and whether redundant regulatory mechanisms exist. The components of the STRIPAK complex have been identified in cultured mammalian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goudreault et al., 2009</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ribeiro et al., 2010</xref>) cells, but functional investigations of the heterogeneity in subunit composition are only just beginning. In the present study, we find that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneurons, not all core components of the STRIPAK complex contribute to the regulation of organelle motility. Specifically, depletion of Ccm3 had no effect on autophagosome transport, suggesting that Ccm3 is either not in the STRIPAK complex in motoneurons or does not function within the complex to regulate axonal transport. In mammalian cells, Ccm3 bridges striatin and the kinase GckIII within the STRIPAK complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kean et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with the idea that Ccm3 function is not required for autophagosome transport, we also found that depletion or overexpression of GckIII did not impact the autophagosome distribution in neurons (unpublished data). Future work will explore the tissue and functional specificity for components in the STRIPAK complex. Moreover, in addition to CKA/STRIPAK, the scaffolding complexes Huntingtin/HAP1 and JIP1 are also known to impact the transport of autophagosomes in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wong and Holzbaur, 2014b</xref>). In a similar fashion to CKA, JIP1 binds and coregulates JNKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yasuda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horiuchi et al., 2007</xref>) and the phosphatase MKP7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Willoughby et al., 2003</xref>), impacting the transport of numerous organelles and vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsuda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scheinfeld et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horiuchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). Remarkably, JIP1 also binds to the Atg8 orthologue LC3 through an LIR motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). The fact that multiple scaffolding proteins modulate autophagosome transport raises many interesting questions regarding the targeting of scaffolding proteins to distinct subpopulations of autophagosomes. Alternatively, the redundancy of scaffolding complexes involved in autophagosome transport may help ensure the clearing of cellular debris to safeguard neuronal homeostasis and function.</p></sec><sec id="s12" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s13"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks</title><p>Table S1 lists the genotypes used to evalulate the data for each experiment.
