<p>Krejciova et al. present the first study demonstrating that CJD prions infect human stem cell–derived astrocytes in vitro. This provides a physiologically relevant model for discovery of key molecular pathogenic events of CJD and facilitates the development of future therapies.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Prions are infectious agents that cause neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD). The absence of a human cell culture model that replicates human prions has hampered prion disease research for decades. In this paper, we show that astrocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) support the replication of prions from brain samples of CJD patients. For experimental exposure of astrocytes to variant CJD (vCJD), the kinetics of prion replication occur in a prion protein codon 129 genotype–dependent manner, reflecting the genotype-dependent susceptibility to clinical vCJD found in patients. Furthermore, iPSC-derived astrocytes can replicate prions associated with the major sporadic CJD strains found in human patients. Lastly, we demonstrate the subpassage of prions from infected to naive astrocyte cultures, indicating the generation of prion infectivity in vitro. Our study addresses a long-standing gap in the repertoire of human prion disease research, providing a new in vitro system for accelerated mechanistic studies and drug discovery.</p>

<body><sec id="s01" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prions are protein-based transmissible pathogens responsible for fatal neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prusiner, 2013</xref>). CJD can be sporadic (sCJD), genetic, iatrogenic (iCJD), or zoonotic (such as variant CJD [vCJD]) and is uniformly untreatable, presenting a significant public health concern. The CJD prion is a misfolded and aggregated conformer of the host-encoded prion protein (PrP) that replicates by seeded self-propagating conversion of the host’s normal cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) to the disease-associated scrapie form (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>). The genotype at the polymorphic codon 129 of the human prion protein gene (<italic>PRNP</italic>), methionine/methionine (MM), methionine/valine (MV), and valine/valine (VV), is critical in determining disease susceptibility and, in combination with the conformer of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> present (type 1 or type 2), defines the disease phenotype. For example, all but one of the 178 definite clinical cases of vCJD worldwide have occurred in individuals homozygous for methionine at codon 129 of <italic>PRNP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mok et al., 2017</xref>), whereas sCJD occurs in all three codon 129 genotypes with distinct phenotypic subtypes, such as the common MM1 and VV2 subtypes of sCJD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parchi et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2009</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms underlying susceptibility, including cell type specificity, to infection and the sequence of events that lead to neurodegeneration in CJD are poorly understood. Although infectious prions can accumulate in a range of tissues and organs expressing PrP<sup>C</sup>, the pathological effects of prion replication appear to be restricted to a progressive neurodegenerative cascade in the CNS, which can be extrapolated from animal models of prion diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cunningham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gray et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alibhai et al., 2016</xref>). Notwithstanding the importance of small and large animal models to our understanding of the pathobiology of prion diseases, there is an urgent need for complementary experimental systems to model aspects of human prion diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCutcheon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Watts and Prusiner, 2014</xref>). In this regard, cell-free assays have provided important insights into prion composition, prion strains, and barriers to prion transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deleault et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krejciova et al., 2014a</xref>). Against this background, the availability of a scalable and physiologically relevant human-based cellular experimental system to study human prion diseases—including the modeling of neuronal–glial interactions that are increasingly thought to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases—would be of great value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gómez-Nicola et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asuni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hennessy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liddelow et al., 2017</xref>). However, to date, no human cell lines have been described that are directly and reproducibly susceptible to infection with human prions from a CJD brain. The literature contains only one, as yet unconfirmed, study of direct sCJD prion infection of a human immortalized SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ladogana et al., 1995</xref>). Consequently, the majority of cell biology studies of prion replication and its inhibition continue to be performed using mouse-adapted prion strains in transformed or transgenic rodent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grassmann et al., 2013</xref>). Rodent-adapted CJD prions have been shown to replicate in an immortalized hypothalamic GT-1 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arjona et al., 2004</xref>) and rabbit epithelial cell line RK13 expressing mouse PrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lawson et al., 2008</xref>). vCJD and sCJD prions have also been shown to replicate in cerebellar granule cells from transgenic mice overexpressing human PrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cronier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hannaoui et al., 2014</xref>). Each of these examples involved the passage of human prions through intermediate species and/or the use of recipient cells with an experimentally modified <italic>PRNP</italic> genotype, arguably diminishing the relevance of these culture models to the study of human prion mechanisms of disease. The inadequacy of current cell culture models of human prion disease likely contributes to the translational failure of apparently promising antiprion compounds from the laboratory to clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trevitt and Collinge, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stewart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Watts and Prusiner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Giles et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we establish the first human cell culture model that can replicate human prions directly from CJD-affected brain tissue. We hypothesize that the prerequisites for human prion replication in vitro would include matching of agent (inoculum) and host (cell) PrP sequences (specifically, the critical M/V polymorphism at codon 129 of <italic>PRNP</italic>) and a relevant differentiated human CNS cell type. We tested these requirements for prion infection by exposing astrocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of defined codon 129 genotypes to human prions from vCJD and sCJD brains.</p></sec><sec id="s02" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s03"><title>Characterization of human iPSC–derived astrocyte progenitor cells (APCs) and astrocyte cultures</title><p>Astrocytes were generated from iPSC lines using a previously established protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krencik and Zhang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Serio et al., 2013</xref>). All iPSC lines used in this study have been previously demonstrated to generate functional and highly enriched (&gt;90%) astrocyte populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krencik and Zhang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Serio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krencik et al., 2015</xref>). After <italic>PRNP</italic> genotyping, two MM (iPSC1 and iPSC4), one MV (iPSC2), and one VV (iPSC3) cell line were selected for the generation of APCs and astrocytes. Quantitative immunocytochemistry of epidermal growth factor (EGF)/fibroblast growth factor (FGF)–treated cultures revealed a highly enriched APC-containing population defined by expression of APC markers vimentin (iPSC1, 97.1 ± 1.2%; iPSC2, 90 ± 0.6%; iPSC3, 98.5 ± 0.2%) and nestin (iPSC1, 98.2 ± 2.2%; iPSC2, 99.1 ± 0.5%; iPSC3, 98.7 ± 0.3%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). After the withdrawal of mitogens and addition of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), astrocyte cultures expressing extracellular <sc>l</sc>-glutamate/<sc>l</sc>-aspartate transporter (GLAST; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>) and GFAP<sup>+</sup> (iPSC1, 87.8 ± 1.7%; iPSC2, 91.4 ± 1.7%; iPSC3, 89.2 ± 0.7%) were generated with comparably low levels of other CNS cell markers present, such as NeuN (neurons), O4 and Olig2 (oligodendrocytes), and Iba1 and CD68 (macrophages; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref> and Fig. S1). Comparable differentiation efficiency was observed across all iPSC lines. Immunolabeling for the cell proliferation marker Ki67 showed significantly reduced proliferation of differentiated astrocyte cultures compared with APC cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Functional evaluation of iPSC-derived APC and astrocyte cultures confirmed differentiation-dependent (astrocyte) functional up-regulation of the ability to take up extracellular <sc>l</sc>-glutamate in a time-dependent manner with no differences between lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Having established enriched astrocyte populations, we next confirmed expression of PrP<sup>C</sup> across all genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). Immunocytochemistry suggests that PrP<sup>C</sup> resides predominantly on the cell surface, which is consistent with the known localization of PrP<sup>C</sup> in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stahl et al., 1987</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Characteristics of iPSC-derived astroglial progenitor cells and astrocytes.</bold> (A) Schematic representation of differentiation of healthy donor cells to astrocyte progenitors and astrocytes.

One interpretation of this observation is that heterozygosity provides a substantial degree of protection from developing clinical vCJD, perhaps effected by limiting the rate of vCJD prion replication. Exposure of MM astrocyte cultures to vCJD inoculum resulted in a rapid and reproducible rise in PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, first detected at 3 dpe, progressively continuing to the 28-d stage. In contrast, MV astrocyte cultures failed to accumulate detectable PrP<sup>Sc</sup> at early time points, and only at 28 dpe was a faint PrP<sup>Sc</sup> signal observed. This implies that <italic>PRNP</italic> codon 129 genotypic effects on vCJD prion replication can be faithfully modeled in iPSC-derived astrocytes, and the results confirm that heterozygosity is an incomplete protective factor against vCJD (MM) prion replication in human populations, in transgenic modeling, in cellular, and in cell-free model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bishop et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jones et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mok et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, we demonstrate that genotype is also an important factor in prion replication in sCJD cases, whereby genotype-matched patient brain homogenate to the cellular genotype was more likely to result in efficient prion replication. An exception to this, however, was in the case of the sCJD (VV1) subtype, which did not efficiently replicate, even in cells of the VV genotype. This suggests that specific aspects of the prion strain itself might also play a substantial role in determining prion transmission, which is a comparable finding to earlier studies performed using transgenic mice expressing human PrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>To our knowledge, this study that utilizes human iPSC–derived astrocytes is the first to demonstrate that human cells of a relevant CNS phenotype are directly susceptible to infection with human prions.

NspI cleaves the amplicon once at <italic>PRNP</italic> codon 155 and a second time at codon 129, only when the latter sequence codes for methionine (-ATG-). This enables distinction between the three <italic>PRNP</italic> codon 129 polymorphic genotypes MM, MV, and VV by agarose gel electrophoresis and Sybr green staining (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s14"><title>iPSC lines and astrocyte differentiation</title><p>Previously generated iPSC-derived astrocyte precursors (APCs), shown to produce highly pure and functional astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krencik and Zhang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Serio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krencik et al., 2015</xref>) were designated iPSC1, iPSC2, and iPSC4 (34D6, Lord2R6, and 33D9, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Serio et al., 2013</xref>) and iPSC3 (162D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krencik and Zhang, 2011</xref>). APCs were grown in EGF/FGF-2 (R&amp;D Systems)–containing media at 5 ng/ml each, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krencik and Zhang, 2011</xref>), and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. The protocol used for astrocyte differentiation had already been shown to yield cells that have astrocyte glutamate transporter function, and propagate calcium waves via extracellular ATP signaling and the cultures were lacking of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krencik et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, there were no Iba1- or CD68-positive (macrophage) cells in the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref> and Fig. S1). Astrocytes differentiated using this protocol were shown to express a full range of astrocyte markers at the quantitative PCR and microarray levels and promote formation of synapses on human neurons (iPSC3 [162D]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krencik et al., 2015</xref>). Astrocyte differentiation was as follows: APCs were dissociated with accutase (Stemcell Technologies), and then cells were plated on poly-<sc>l</sc>-ornithine (PLO; Sigma-Aldrich)– and matrigel (BD Matrigel Matrix Growth Factor Reduced; BD Biosciences)-precoated wells. Cells were cultured in neurobasal media supplemented with 0.2% B27, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, 1% GlutaMax (all Gibco), and recombinant human ciliary CNTF (R&amp;D Systems) at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml for 2 wk. Astrocyte cultures produced by this method were typically &gt;90% pure when assessed by immunolabeling for the combination of astrocytic markers GLAST (Miltenyi Biotech) and GFAP (Millipore) and against the neuronal marker NeuN (Abcam), oligodendrocyte markers O4 (R&amp;D Systems) and Olig2 (Chemicon), and macrophage markers Iba1 (Abcam) and CD68/SR-D1 (Novus).</p></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Glutamate uptake assay</title><p>The method used to measure the decrease of glutamate in the media over time was adopted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krencik et al., 2011</xref>). In brief, cells were plated on matrigel and cultured in EGF/FGF-2 (APC)– or CNTF (astrocyte; 10 ng/ml each)-containing media for 2 wk. Cells were dissociated with accutase and replated at equal density. 4 h after attachment, cells were pretreated with high sodium buffer for 30 min to equilibrate at 37°C (140 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 23 mM glucose, and 15 mM Hepes, pH 7.4). Cells were then treated with high sodium buffer ± 500 µM <sc>l</sc>-glutamate for 1 h. Media was removed and <sc>l</sc>-glutamate concentration was determined using the glutamine/glutamate determination kit (Sigma-Aldrich). HEK293 cells, which do not significantly uptake glutamate when compared with differentiated astrocytes, were used as a baseline control. After subtraction of the blanks (no glutamate added), the decrease of glutamate in the media (or uptake by cells) was reported as micromolars of glutamate per microgram of protein after being normalized to the total protein in each well. The protein content was determined by a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Sample results were within range of a working standard curve. Values were normalized to cell numbers at the end of the assay. Values are reported as mean ± SEM.</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title>Preparation of CJD inocula</title><p>Brain tissue was first homogenized at 10% weight to volume (wt/vol) in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS)/5% sucrose at 4°C and then ribolysed for 40 s (MP FastPrep-24). The homogenate was then sonicated (Sonicator 3000; Misonix) for 40 s at 80% power output and cleared of particulate matter by centrifugation at 424.1 <italic>g</italic> for 10 s at 4°C. The homogenate was then filtered by spin filters, pore size 220 nm (Agilent Technologies) or pore size 450 nm (Thermo Fisher Scientific), at 10,621 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4°C. Cell homogenate inoculum was prepared by scraping astrocytes in Dulbecco’s modified PBS (D-PBS) at 8 dpe to CJD brain homogenate. Cell homogenates were prepared as follows: astrocytes at 8 dpe to CJD brain homogenate were washed twice with ice-cold D-PBS, scraped in D-PBS using silicone cell scraper (USA Scientific), and homogenized using a 1-ml syringe with a 27-gauge needle, all at 4°C. Next the suspension was cleared by centrifugation at 424.1 <italic>g</italic> for 10 s and spin filtered (pore size of 450 nm) at 4°C. Detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in the spin-filtered CJD brain homogenates and cell homogenates was confirmed by PK digestion (Novagen) at a final concentration of 50 µg/ml and immunoblot analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Cell exposure regimen</title><p>APCs were plated at a density of 75,000 cells/well in 12-well plates precoated with PLO and matrigel and maintained in EGF/FGF-2–containing medium. Cells were plated at a lower density, in comparison to astrocytes, to accommodate the highly proliferative nature of APCs. APC cultures intended for astrocyte differentiation were plated at a density of 200,000 cells/well in 12-well plates precoated with PLO and matrigel and differentiated for 2 wk in CNTF-containing medium. Cells were exposed to vCJD, sCJD, or non-CJD brain homogenates (450 nm spin filtered and diluted in culture media) for 24 h. The medium was then discarded, and cells were washed twice with D-PBS at 37°C, given fresh (brain homogenate free) CNTF-containing medium, and further cultured. For time course studies, exposure was staggered according to the desired recovery time, and cultures were then harvested simultaneously, thus resulting in cultures of equivalent age in vitro. Exposure to human brain homogenate of individuals who died of a nonneurological cause (NBH) served as a negative control. Cells cultured exclusively in brain homogenate–free CNTF medium served as unexposed controls in all experiments. In subpassage experiments, naive astrocytes were exposed (24 h) to cell homogenate of astrocytes previously exposed to CJD brain homogenate and harvested at 8 dpe. Because of the differing prion replication efficiencies between cells of (MM or VV) <italic>PRNP</italic> polymorphism exposed to different prion strains, we chose to normalize the concentration of subpassaged cell homogenate (first passage) in two ways. First, lysate dilutions of MM (iPSC1) astrocytes exposed to vCJD were quantified for levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> by immunoblots. The cell homogenate used for exposure was diluted to match the amount of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> detected in the brain homogenate originally used to infect the astrocyte culture. However, in the case of iPSC3 (VV) astrocytes exposed to sCJD (VV2), a 1:1 well transmission of cell lysate to naive culture was performed instead because of the lower efficiency of sCJD prion replication. For immunocytochemistry experiments, APC plated on PLO and matrigel precoated glass coverslips (at a density of 50,000 cells/well in 24-well plates) were differentiated to astrocytes in CNTF media for 2 wk and then exposed to vCJD or sCJD brain homogenates (220 nm spin filtered and diluted in the CNTF medium) for 24 h. The conditions and procedures of each time course were as described above. Cultures from each time course experiment were terminated and immunolabeled at the same time and were therefore at the same culture stage.</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>Cell viability assay</title><p>The cytotoxic effect of the CJD and non-CJD NBH exposure was assessed by the LIVE/DEAD viability/cytotoxicity assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Unexposed cells served as a baseline control. Cells were viewed under a differential interference contrast microscope (CKX41; Olympus) with reflected fluorescence system 494-nm (green) and 528-nm (red) excitation filters. Captured images were analyzed using the particle counting plugin of ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).</p></sec><sec id="s19"><title>Anti-PrP antibodies</title><p>Immunoblotting for PrP used the mouse monoclonal antibody 3F4 obtained from Millipore (MAB1562, human PrP epitope 109–112) and the humanized Fab P (HuM-P, Prusiner Laboratory, human PrP epitope 96–105; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Safar et al., 2002</xref>). Immunocytochemistry for PrP used the mouse monoclonal anti-PrP antibody 6H4 obtained from Prionics (01-010) or Thermo Fisher Scientific (7500997; human PrP epitope 144–152) and HuM-P. Each antibody recognizes an epitope in PrP<sup>C</sup> that is retained in the protease-resistant core of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, and their specificity has been confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yull et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Watts et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s20"><title>Immunoblot analysis</title><p>Immunoblotting for PrP followed the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krejciova et al.

In brief, each well was washed twice with 4°C D-PBS and then lysed on ice for 10 min with radioimmunoprecipitation assay extraction buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing protease inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTA-free; Roche) and EDTA at 5 mM. The lysate from each well was then collected using a silicone cell scraper into safe-lock tubes. The samples were digested with PK at a final concentration of 50 µg/ml at 37°C for 60 min, and digestion was terminated with 1 mM Pefablock SC (Roche). MgCl<sub>2</sub> and Benzonase at a final concentration of 1 mM and 50 U/ml, respectively, were added to the lysates and incubated at 37°C for 10 min before addition of 4× NuPAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Novex) at a final concentration of 1×. The entire sample was then boiled at 100°C for 10 min and subjected to immunoblot analysis using antiprion protein monoclonal antibody 3F4 or HuM-P. The PK digestion step was omitted in immunoblotting experiments involving the detection of PrP<sup>C</sup>/β-actin.</p></sec><sec id="s21"><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>Immunocytochemistry followed the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krejciova et al. (2014b)</xref>. In brief, cells were washed twice with D-PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. A denaturation step involving Gnd thiocyanate (+Gnd) pretreatment during the immunolabeling procedure was necessary to retrieve PrP<sup>Sc</sup> epitopes buried in nondenatured PrP<sup>Sc</sup> aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giri et al., 2006</xref>). Cells were pretreated with 4 M Gnd for 10 min at room temperature (unless indicated otherwise, −Gnd) and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with the primary antibodies PrP antibody 6H4, 3F4, or HuM-P, anti-GFAP (Millipore), anti-Nestin (Millipore), anti-Vimentin (Abcam), anti-NeuN, anti-Ki67 (Abcam), or anti-GLAST (Miltenyi Biotech), and subsequently the cells were incubated with the secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti–mouse IgG1 antibody (Invitrogen) or goat anti–human IgG Fc F(ab′)2 FITC (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti–rabbit IgG (Invitrogen), and Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti–chicken IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For plasma membrane staining experiments, CellMask (Molecular Probes) was applied to fixed cells for 10 min at 37°C before washing in PBS. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen). Slides were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Ltd.) and examined by confocal microscopy using the LSM 710 (Zeiss) or TCS SP8 (Leica) microscope. All images from independent, but identical, experiments were acquired under the same conditions, and laser intensity levels were maintained constant throughout to reduce technical variability. Images were captured using the Zen 2012 black edition (Zeiss) or Las X (Leica) imaging software.</p></sec><sec id="s22"><title>Image quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>For quantitative analysis of the cell viability assay, cells were counted from each time course over 10 randomly chosen areas, and the viable and nonviable cell counts were normalized to corresponding percentages of the cell population and plotted as a mean using Prism v.7 software (GraphPad). To assess the population of actively proliferating cells in the culture, APCs and astrocytes were immunolabeled for a cellular marker of proliferation, Ki67. DAPI counterstaining was used to assess total cell count in each culture. The count of proliferating cells was normalized by total cell count using the Prism v.7 software. Data were analyzed from two independent experiments (<italic>n</italic> = 2) in triplicate. Cell culture exposure and immunoblot analysis experiments were generally performed in triplicate (technical replicates) and repeated (experimental <italic>n</italic>) for each cell line, allowing for quantification and statistical analysis. No component parts of the reported experiments were excluded for presentational purposes. The numbers of independent identical experiments terminated at 8 dpe conducted for each cell line were APC cultures of iPSC1 (<italic>n</italic> = 2), iPSC3 (<italic>n</italic> = 1) for exposure to vCJD brain homogenate, and iPSC3 (<italic>n</italic> = 2 each) for exposure to sCJD VV1 and VV2. Astrocyte exposure was repeated as follows: iPSC1 (<italic>n</italic> = 6), iPSC2 (<italic>n</italic> = 4), iPSC3 (<italic>n</italic> = 4), iPSC4 (<italic>n</italic> = 1) for exposures to vCJD brain homogenate, and iPSC3 exposed to sCJD VV1 (<italic>n</italic> = 2) and VV2 (<italic>n</italic> = 4) brain homogenate. For the extended time point experiments up to 28 d, iPSC1 cells exposed to vCJD, sCJD MM1 or VV2, or a non-CJD brain homogenate (<italic>n</italic> = 3 each), iPSC2 astrocytes exposed to vCJD (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and iPSC3 exposed to vCJD, sCJD MM1, VV1 or VV2, or a non-CJD brain homogenate (<italic>n</italic> = 2 each). Astrocytes of the iPSC1 (<italic>n</italic> = 2) and iPSC3 (<italic>n</italic> = 2) were used in subpassage experiments. Densitometric analysis of the PK-resistant PrP<sup>Sc</sup> bands detected by immunoblot was performed using the volume tool of the XRS+ System Image Lab 2.0 software (Bio-Rad). The background signal values of individual blots were subtracted, and all samples were normalized against the PK-resistant PrP<sup>Sc</sup> signal of the inoculum used in each individual experiment before data were analyzed and displayed using Prism v.7. Linear regression was applied to establish a trend line for the change in cell-associated protease-resistant PrP<sup>Sc</sup> over time, which was normalized by the protease-resistant PrP<sup>Sc</sup> signal in the inoculum to which the cell cultures were exposed.</p><p>The immunofluorescence data represent analysis of 9–12 images per time point per independent experiment. Each independent experiment was performed in triplicate, and the numbers of independent identical experiments conducted for each cell line were iPSC1 (<italic>n</italic> = 3), iPSC2 (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and iPSC3 (<italic>n</italic> = 4) for exposures to vCJD brain homogenate and iPSC3 (<italic>n</italic> = 7) exposed to sCJD (VV2) brain homogenate. Semiquantitative assessment was performed using the ImageJ histogram plugin to quantify the intensity of the green fluorescence of each image as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krejciova et al., 2014b</xref>). The green fluorescence pixel value (corresponding to PrP immunolabeling signal) was divided by the cell count of the analyzed image (corresponding to DAPI-stained nuclei), thus normalizing PrP immunolabeling to cell number. These values were plotted as arbitrary fluorescence units using Prism v.7 software, giving an intensity of PrP immunofluorescence per cell. Data were plotted with mean ± SEM and a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test to determine variance compared with the control unexposed cells.</p></sec><sec id="s23"><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 demonstrates the presence of astrocytes after CNTF differentiation using the astrocyte marker GFAP and the absence of other CNS glial cells using the markers O4 and Olig2 for oligodendrocytes and Iba1 and CD68 for microglia.</p></sec></sec>
