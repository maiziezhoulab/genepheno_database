<p id="P2">The transcriptional underpinnings of brain development remain poorly understood, particularly in humans and closely related non-human primates. We describe a high resolution transcriptional atlas of rhesus monkey brain development that combines dense temporal sampling of prenatal and postnatal periods with fine anatomical parcellation of cortical and subcortical regions associated with human neuropsychiatric disease. Gene expression changes more rapidly before birth, both in progenitor cells and maturing neurons, and cortical layers and areas acquire adult-like molecular profiles surprisingly late postnatally. Disparate cell populations exhibit distinct developmental timing but also unexpected synchrony of processes underlying neural circuit construction including cell projection and adhesion. Candidate risk genes for neurodevelopmental disorders including primary microcephaly, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia show disease-specific spatiotemporal enrichment within developing neocortex. Human developmental expression trajectories are more similar to monkey than rodent, and approximately 9% of genes show human-specific regulation with evidence for prolonged maturation or neoteny.</p>

<p id="P3">The primate brain develops through a series of stereotyped processes that are conserved across mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, including the specification, migration and maturation of diverse cell types and the formation and refinement of functional neuronal circuits. There are also primate-specific features of brain development that increase anatomical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, cognitive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, and behavioral complexity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and may explain why many human neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases are not well modeled in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. These features include a larger cortical progenitor pool in the outer subventricular zone not present in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and protracted myelination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, synapse production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, and pruning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Consequently, rhesus monkey and human share a greatly expanded neocortex and specialization of areas (most notably primary visual cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>), compared to mouse, reflecting the more recent common ancestor of human and rhesus monkey (25 million years) than human and mouse (70 million years)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.

Rhesus monkey thus provides a valuable proxy for human brain development, particularly during prenatal and early postnatal development that are difficult to sample in human, and also provides a comparator to study human-specific features such as prolonged maturation or neoteny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P4">Molecular programs responsible for brain development remain incompletely understood in any species, due to the spatiotemporal complexity of these processes and the resource intensity of methods needed to probe them.

<title>Spatiotemporal transcriptome analysis</title>
<p id="P6">This resource characterizes rhesus monkey forebrain development with three modalities: 1) anatomical reference datasets consisting of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and corresponding densely sampled Nissl stains; 2) cellular resolution gene expression data generated with a high throughput ISH platform; and 3) fine anatomical resolution transcriptome timeseries data generated with a combination of laser microdissection (LMD) and DNA microarrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Molecular analyses focused on discrete progenitor and postmitotic cell populations in neocortex (medial prefrontal and visual cortical areas), hippocampus, striatum, and amygdala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Tables 1–2</xref>). Ten developmental timepoints were chosen to correspond to peak periods of neurogenesis for neurons destined for different layers and glial cell types of V1 (prenatal)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and major developmental epochs: neonate, infant, juvenile, and young adult (postnatal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Anatomical parcellation at each time point was based on prior work in monkey and human brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). Canonical genes marking different neural cell types showed expected spatiotemporal patterning across development, shown as heatmaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>) laid out following the anatomical organization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>.</p>
<p id="P7">To gain a high level understanding of transcriptional dynamics during cortical development, we represented the similarity between cortical samples using multidimensional scaling (MDS) based on correlated expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 e–g</xref>). Layer and age explained almost 90% of the variation across all samples (n = 922; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>) and prenatal samples (n = 542; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). To examine smaller differences between neuronal populations (grey circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>), we repeated the MDS analysis only on V1 cortical layers (containing different types of excitatory neurons; n = 175; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Transcriptional similarity of layers reflects spatial proximity and birth date, as described in adult rhesus monkey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, continuous variation across prenatal development suggests gradual changes in gene expression.</p>
<p id="P8">There were few sex-related differences in expression, although the study was not powered to detect subtle differences restricted to specific brain regions or developmental stages. Only one autosomal gene (<italic>LOC693361</italic>, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 1-like) showed robust increased expression in males across brain regions during prenatal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). However, the microarray probe for <italic>LOC693361</italic> also targets an unannotated region of rhesus monkey Y chromosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> so there are likely no autosomal genes with persistent male- or female-specific expression differences across development.</p>

<title>Developmental transcriptional dynamics</title>
<p id="P9">Previous work has demonstrated that different cortical layers have distinct transcriptomic profiles both in adult and developing cortex, where the largest differences are seen between germinal and postmitotic cell populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In grossly dissected developing human prefrontal cortex, gene expression changes fastest prenatally and slows sharply just after birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. If dividing cells drive most expression change, then depletion of the progenitor pool would explain decreased rates. In contrast, we find that all layers of V1 and prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate gyrus; ACG) have similar rates of expression change across development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Thus transcriptional programs change dramatically both in progenitor cell populations as they give rise to different neuronal and non-neuronal cell types, as well as in postmitotic neuronal cell types as they differentiate and mature into adulthood.</p>
<p id="P10">Similar developmental trajectories were seen in hippocampus, basal ganglia and amygdala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). However, the genes changing dynamically could differ by region or age. We identified the top 1000 genes with the largest increase and decrease in relative expression between all pairs of ages for each structure and visualized overlap of these gene lists as a heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This threshold was selected because at least 1000 genes significantly changed expression (ANOVA FDR &lt; 0.05, fold change &gt; 1.25) between all adjacent ages in the majority of regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>). Genes changing over time were remarkably synchronized across different cell populations. At every age, approximately half of the top increasing and decreasing genes were shared by most brain regions, and unsupervised clustering grouped samples almost perfectly by age (age index bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Genes increasing with age showed substantial overlap across ages within, but much less between, prenatal and postnatal ages. This suggests that distinct transcriptional programs are active in prenatal and postnatal development, and that many of these programs progress gradually. At early stages, samples grouped by proliferative state independently of brain region (mitotic index bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) reflecting a common set of cell division genes. Postnatally, samples grouped more by anatomical structure, reflecting increased regional identity during brain maturation (structure index bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">To interpret these dynamic gene expression patterns, we searched for enrichment of gene ontology (GO) terms at each region and age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Tables 4–5</xref>) and represented significant enrichments as heatmaps ordered as above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). For example, genes related to onset (positive regulation) of axonal projection were enriched during prenatal periods as expected. Surprisingly, this process appears to be actively repressed during late postnatal development, as genes associated with offset (negative regulation) of axonal projection showed increased expression from juvenile (12 months) to young adult (48 month) stages. Processes associated with synapse development appear to be temporally enriched in late prenatal and early postnatal periods, and also synchronized between presynaptic (synaptic vesicle localization) and postsynaptic (dendrite development) neurons. Interestingly, the region-specific blocks of coordinated expression in postnatal visual cortex (V1 and V2) and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, arrows) were enriched for autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>), which may reflect early dendritic spine pruning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and grey matter volume reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> in visual cortex.</p>

<title>Regional timing of biological processes</title>
<p id="P12">Some biological processes, such as synaptogenesis and myelination, are protracted over development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, and we find that process activation (increasing genes) is longer than inactivation (decreasing genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Biological processes persist longer in all regions pooled together (black lines) than in any individual region (colored lines) so developmental timing must vary between regions. We quantified synchrony between pairs of regions as the proportion of ages during which a process is active in either region, for processes active in all regions at some age (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). Remarkably, despite major differences in cellular and functional makeup of brain regions sampled, all pairs of regions showed similar degrees of synchrony across all GO terms. This synchrony was centered on overlap of approximately half of all ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>), far greater than expected by chance. Few processes – cell proliferation, projection, and adhesion – were synchronized across all regions and ages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">Processes usually started before birth in all regions, but sometimes at strikingly different times in different regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Consistent with known early maturation of subcortical circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, rank ordering age of onset for each process across regions showed earlier subcortical onset, particularly in amygdala, and similar timing for neocortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). For example, subcortical globus pallidus is myelinated before cortical white matter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and shows early increased expression of genes specific to myelinating oligodendrocytes (<italic>MOG</italic>, <italic>MOBP</italic>, and <italic>ERMN</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5d</xref>). Interestingly, three other oligodendrocyte markers (<italic>MAL</italic>, <italic>ASPA</italic>, and <italic>OPALIN</italic>) turned on synchronously in all regions, suggesting a temporal and regional dissociation of different stages of myelination.</p>

<title>Late emergence of mature cortical identity</title>
<p id="P14">The neocortex is composed of diverse neuronal subtypes organized into layers that have distinct connectivity and transcriptional signatures in the adult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> with graded and discrete variation between cortical areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. A neuron develops its mature molecular identity through cell-autonomous processes and environmental interactions during migration, process extension, and synapse formation. If early generated neurons closely resemble their mature states, then environmental interactions must have small effects on their terminal molecular identities. Since we found dramatic expression changes within postmitotic cortical layers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), there is a significant role for either or both of these mechanisms.</p>
<p id="P15">To examine the emergence of mature laminar signatures, we compared layer-enriched expression patterns across development from the earliest stage at which all postmitotic layers are present (E80) to adulthood. We calculated the average expression correlation, across layers and between all pairs of ages, of the top 2.5% of genes most specific for each layer in V1 at each age (see <bold>Methods</bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Adult identity emerged gradually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), as evidenced by decreased expression similarity with increased age separation. In fact, laminar expression patterns in young adulthood barely resembled mid-fetal cortex (R &lt; 0.1).</p>
<p id="P16">These correlation trends result from nearly complete shifts in genes showing robust layer-specific expression (fold change &gt; 1.5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Most genes were enriched only for a subset of contiguous ages at early, middle, and late stages, while few genes showed persistent laminar enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). Sets of laminar genes tile smoothly across development, suggesting a graded emergence of functional characteristics of neuronal subtypes as well as shifting proportions of subtypes within layers. Genes with early laminar expression are enriched for GO terms related to early developmental events such as neuron differentiation (P = 1.6 × 10<sup>−7</sup>) and axon generation (P = 6.7 × 10<sup>−6</sup>), whereas later laminar genes are enriched for axon guidance (P = 6.5 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) and innervation (P = 9.8 × 10<sup>−6</sup>).</p>
<p id="P17">Different anatomical and functional neocortical areas have distinct gene expression patterns in the adult, most prominently in V1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. During development, intrinsic (protomap)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and extrinsic (protocortex)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> factors shape cortical area identity. To ask whether the temporal dynamics of areal expression support intrinsic versus extrinsic areal specification, we first identified genes differentially expressed between caudal (V1, blue) and rostral (ACG, red) cortex in different layers at each developmental stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). More genes were differentially expressed between cortical areas in postmitotic layers during late postnatal than prenatal development. These genes were enriched for cell adhesion (P = 3.9 × 10<sup>−6</sup>) and synaptic transmission (P = 7.3 × 10<sup>−4</sup>) GO terms, suggesting a role for extrinsic factors related to the functional maturation of cortical circuitry. Developmental process timing varies across primate cortex, with neurogenesis occurring earlier in frontal than caudal cortex but circuit maturation persisting later in frontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and this was recapitulated by an even more protracted emergence of enriched genes in ACG (12 to 48 months) compared to V1 (3 to 12 months).</p>
<p id="P18">To test for genes that may contribute to intrinsic specification, we searched for genes with persistent areal enrichment beginning prior to the arrival of thalamic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> or other extrinsic inputs. While 38% of genes showed regional differences, only 1% were persistent over development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). These genes were primarily expressed in postmitotic cortical layers, for example <italic>CBLN2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, and only 20 genes (0.2%) were expressed in germinal zones, including the well-known caudal-to-rostral gradient genes <italic>FGFR3</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and <italic>NR2F1</italic> (<italic>COUP-TFI</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, while there is evidence for a small number of genes clearly reflecting early intrinsic areal specification, there are many more adult differences that could be due to extrinsic interactions and activity-dependent mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P19">Some areal differences are likely due to differences in the proportion and maturation state of specific cell types, such as dividing neural progenitors and postmitotic neurons and glia. Indeed, we identified spatiotemporal locations with significant enrichment in V1 or ACG for markers of cell cycle (i.e. actively dividing progenitor cells), GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in adult mouse V1, and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e–h</xref>). Cell cycle markers were enriched in V1 SZ from E80-E90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), reflecting extended generation of superficial excitatory neurons in V1 relative to ACG. Likewise, markers for excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>) were enriched in ACG prenatally, corresponding to earlier generation and maturation of these cells. Postnatal enrichment in V1 is likely secondary to using markers derived from adult mouse V1. Astrocyte marker enrichment in prenatal ACG progressed from proliferative to postmitotic layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>), tracking astrocyte generation and migration in these layers. Finally, markers of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons showed early enrichment in V1 SZ, followed by ACG enrichment in several layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>), a potential signature of early interneuron migration from medial ganglionic eminence to caudal cortex.</p>
<p id="P20">The majority of areal genes showed intermediate expression in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), located approximately midway between rostral ACG and caudal V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). Therefore, rostro-caudal expression gradients, rather than specific features of ACG and V1, likely drive many of these areal expression differences.</p>

<title>Mapping disease genes to development</title>
<p id="P21">Highly heritable but genetically complex neurodevelopmental disorders will be more tractable if we can identify common pathways linking many candidate risk genes. For example, recent work on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrated that candidate genes are co-expressed in mid-fetal human cortical neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and converge on synaptic development pathways. Large-scale genetic association studies have identified high confidence genes associated with primary autosomal recessive microcephaly (MCPH), ASD, intellectual disability (ID), and schizophrenia (SCZ). We localized these disease genes in developing cortex using this new high resolution map.</p>
<p id="P22">We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify sets of genes with correlated patterning (modules) in cortical samples at each age, linked modules with overlapping genes between adjacent ages, and annotated modules for enrichment in different cortical layers and cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). Next, we tested disease gene sets for significant enrichment (hypergeometric test, corrected P &lt; 0.1). As expected, MCPH genes showed early- to mid-fetal enrichment in neuronal progenitor-enriched modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>) where they are positioned to alter cell cycle kinetics to reduce neuron numbers and brain size. Many ASD genes showed coordinated expression in post-mitotic neurons prenatally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>), as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, but also postnatally. In contrast, SCZ genes were selectively enriched only in postmitotic neuronal modules from infancy through adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>).</p>
<p id="P23">ID-associated genes were not enriched in any gene modules, consistent with the view that disruption of many biological pathways can undermine cognitive development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. To investigate whether these diverse molecular pathways converge on intermediate phenotypes within ID such as structural brain malformations, we looked for correlated expression among the 71 ID genes across prenatal and postnatal cortex. We identified four major expression patterns: 1) postnatal cortical plate, 2) prenatal germinal layers, 3) prenatal subventricular zone and cortical plate, and 4) more complex patterns spanning development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Consistent with the module analysis above, MCPH-associated genes had significantly similar expression profiles (multivariate distance matrix regression, P &lt; 0.001) and were enriched in prenatal germinal zones in clusters 2 and 3 in either VZ or SZ. In contrast, other phenotypes did not share expression patterns, including cortical atrophy, seizures and even microcephaly with other brain malformations. Furthermore, genes with similar patterns can give rise to different phenotypes: <italic>ASXL3</italic> and <italic>GRIP1</italic> are co-expressed (R = 0.80) in cluster 3 but are associated with MCPH and corpus callosum agenesis, respectively.</p>

<title>Human-specific developmental trajectories</title>
<p id="P24">Humans exhibit unique cortical and cognitive developmental trajectories compared to other mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> that are likely correlated with differences in gene expression. To identify conserved and divergent genes, we compared gene expression trajectories across prenatal and postnatal development in frontal cortex between rat, rhesus monkey, and two independent human data sets, normalizing timescales by developmental event scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Expression conservation varied across species (Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, P &lt; 10<sup>−21</sup>), with greater similarity within humans than within primates (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P &lt; 10<sup>−6</sup>), as expected based on evolutionary distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in conservation of rat trajectories with either human or rhesus monkey, indicating transcriptional patterning has evolved at the same average rate in human and rhesus monkey since our last common ancestor. On average, 69% of genes had conserved expression trajectories (R &gt; 0.5) across all three species, and genes with the most dynamic expression change over development were even more highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7a,b</xref>). For example, <italic>EMX2</italic>, a transcription factor critical to cortical arealization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, and <italic>CNTN1</italic>, a cell adhesion gene that guides neuronal migration and connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>), are highly conserved.</p>
<p id="P25">A significant minority (13%) of genes differed between primates and rat (validated for a subset of genes in developing mouse; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 10</xref>) and approximately 9% had human-specific expression trajectories. The proportion of genes showing different conservation patterns was robust to gene selection and correlation threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>). Some of these differences were dramatic; for example, <italic>BMP3</italic> decreases over primate development but increases in rodents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). <italic>BMP3</italic> is a <italic>WNT</italic> signaling growth factor that has been linked to craniofacial variation in dogs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. <italic>CNTN2</italic>, a close family member of the conserved adhesion gene <italic>CNTN1</italic>, likewise shows opposite developmental trajectories in primates and rodents. In both human data sets, <italic>LGALS1</italic> and <italic>LIN7A</italic> increase or decrease expression, respectively, in opposite directions to other species. <italic>LGALS1</italic> further has a different adult laminar pattern of cortical expression in human compared to mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, while deletion of <italic>LIN7A</italic> is associated with human intellectual disability and disrupted neuronal migration and axonal pathfinding in mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P26">Some aspects of cortical development, such as myelination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and synaptic pruning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, are protracted or neotenous between cortical areas or between species. Reasoning that abrupt changes in expression may represent important developmental milestones, we compared developmental timing by identifying distinct changes in expression trajectories, or breakpoints. 179 increasing and 179 decreasing genes met these criteria in all three species, being well fit by segmented linear regression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). Consistent with different developmental rates of these species, breakpoints for increasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>) and decreasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7c</xref>) genes often occurred earliest in rat, intermediate for rhesus monkey, and latest in human. Almost half (81) of increasing genes were synapse related (dashed lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>), and breakpoints coincided with ages of peak synaptic density estimated in these species (shaded rectangles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7d</xref>). There was no significant difference in the breakpoints for synapse-related genes in human V1 versus prefrontal cortex and only a short delay in rhesus monkey V1 (42 days, P = 9.6 × 10<sup>−9</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7e</xref>), consistent with synchronous synaptogenesis reported in primates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. One study later reported protracted synaptogenesis in human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, but this study suffered from sparse sampling and no statistical analysis and does not appear consistent with the bulk of evidence.</p>
<p id="P27">While breakpoint timing was largely conserved between species, particularly between rhesus monkey and rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7f</xref>), human breakpoints were clearly bimodally distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>) suggesting that some genes had different developmental timing. For example, <italic>OLIG1</italic> is expressed in maturing oligodendrocytes and had a late breakpoint relative to rhesus monkey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>), consistent with prolonged myelination in several human cortical areas compared to rhesus monkey and chimpanzee<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, many more genes had an early rather than late breakpoint in human prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>), in contrast to previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> showing human-specific delayed peak expression in this brain region. However, we found that many early genes continued to increase expression through adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>), such as <italic>SYT7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>), a presynaptic calcium-binding protein important for modifying neurotransmitter release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. In rhesus monkey, gene expression often did not change significantly after breakpoints. Genes with an early breakpoint and late maximal expression may mark developmental processes that are protracted in human relative to non-human primates and that underlie our extended cognitive development. Interestingly, we found this transcriptional signature of neoteny between species in both prefrontal cortex and V1, but much less so in evolutionarily older structures including hippocampus, amygdala and striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7g</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P28">The current project transcriptionally profiled primate brain development with fine anatomical detail from early gestation to young adulthood. While expression rates of change decreased more than 100-fold over development, we observed small but coherent changes from juvenile to adult, a period of enormous cognitive change and susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disease. These changes related to the late emergence of mature laminar and areal signatures, biological pathways such as negative regulation of axonal pathfinding, and the appearance of gene modules significantly associated with ASD and SCZ.</p>
<p id="P29">Two unexpected characteristics of expression trajectories support extrinsic influences on developmental transcriptional regulation. First, there was a striking synchrony among genes changing in disparate brain regions and cell populations, suggesting a mechanism for global regulation such as circulating hormones. Second, the surprisingly late acquisition of adult-like cortical areal and laminar molecular phenotypes points to an important role for contextual and activity-dependent mechanisms in sculpting mature cellular phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P30">We show that 22% of genes have different developmental trajectories in rat and human, comparable to 25% of genes that have different laminar patterns in adult mouse and human cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In contrast, approximately 9% of genes have different trajectories in rhesus monkey and human including genes with delayed peak expression solely in human cortex. Therefore, rhesus monkey is an important comparator for understanding human-specific features of brain development but cannot fully model protracted circuit formation and associated diseases that are seen only in humans.</p>
<p id="P31">A recently expanded set of ASD candidate genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> were significantly enriched in newborn neurons during prenatal development, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, but also enriched throughout postnatal development. SCZ risk genes were also enriched in neurons but not until infancy, suggesting a larger role for dysfunction in circuit refinement than prenatal processes such as neurogenesis. SCZ and ASD were enriched in the same neuron-enriched module in infancy despite only 5% overlap in candidate genes, pointing to a shared etiology that is being increasingly appreciated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.</p>

<p id="P34">Frozen postmortem tissue samples from prenatal rhesus macaque (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) of predominantly Indian origin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>) were provided by the Time-Mated Breeding Program at the California National Research Primate Center (CNPRC; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cnprc.ucdavis.edu">www.cnprc.ucdavis.edu</ext-link>). Prenatal brain material was acquired following fetectomy using Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) at the CNPRC. Timed pregnancy derived biological replicate specimens (2 males, 2 females) at each of six prenatal developmental stages (E40, E50, E70, E80, E90, and E120) were profiled. These timepoints were selected to coincide with peak periods of neurogenesis for the different layers of primary visual cortex based on birthdating experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Frozen postmortem tissue samples from postnatal rhesus macaque were also provided by CNPRC. Brain regions were systematically collected from well-characterized rhesus monkeys born and raised at the CNPRC in outdoor, half-acre enclosures that provide a naturalistic setting and normal social environment. For transcriptome analysis, three male specimens at each of four postnatal developmental stages representing the neonate (0 months), infant (3 months), juvenile (12 months) and post-pubertal adult (48 months) were profiled. Extensive health, family lineage and dominance information were maintained on all animals. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at UC Davis.</p>

<title>Postnatal MRI and histological reference series</title>
<p id="P35">An interleaved anatomical atlas of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histology, and block face photographs was created from four male rhesus macaques at 2 weeks, 3, 12 and 48 months after birth as described in the “Reference Series” white paper. In addition, ISH data were generated serially across complete hemispheres of three post-pubertal adult (48 months) male specimens. Genes were selected to mark specific cell populations and cortical areas and to represent gene families important to neural function and associated with neuropsychiatric disease and brain evolution. Several histological stains (Nissl, acetylcholinesterase and SMI-32) of complete hemispheres were combined with ISH data to provide an unprecedented cellular resolution view of gene expression in the whole post-pubertal adult brain.

<title>Tissue processing</title>
<p id="P36">Following collection, brain tissues were partitioned in a manner dependent on specimen stage, gradually frozen, and then stored at −80°C until processing. For a subset of E40 specimens, following specimen collection, the calvarium was frozen intact in an isopentane/dry ice slurry maintained at −40°C to −45°C, gradual freezing at a steady rate. For the majority of E40 specimens, the specimens were embedded in OCT (optimal cutting temperature compound) during the freezing process. In brief, chilled OCT was placed around the calvarium. A disposable embedding chamber was filled with approximately 5 mm<sup>3</sup> chilled OCT. The specimen was carefully oriented and centered in the OCT, posterior surface down in the OCT. Then, the specimen was aligned along the medial/lateral axis using the bilateral ocular fiduciaries as a frame of reference. Next, the specimen was aligned in the coronal plane. After alignment along all axes, OCT was added to encase the specimen in its entirety. The top of the specimen was covered with approximately 3 mm of OCT. The chamber containing the specimen was directly placed onto a level bed of dry ice. The specimen and OCT were allowed to freeze completely. After demarcation of the orientation of the brain in the OCT block, the frozen tissue block was stored at −80°C.</p>
<p id="P37">For the E50 specimens, following removal of the brain from the skull, the whole brain was frozen intact in an isopentane/dry ice slurry maintained at −40°C to −45°C, gradual freezing at a steady rate. For a subset of E50 specimens, the specimens were embedded in OCT during the freezing process. In brief, chilled OCT was placed around the intact brain. Freestanding aluminum bars were assembled onto a Teflon coated plate and sized to the appropriate specifications for the E50 brain. The internal chamber was filled with approximately 5 mm<sup>3</sup> chilled OCT. The specimen was carefully oriented and centered in the OCT dorsal surface down in the OCT. Then, the specimen was aligned along the medial/lateral axis using the longitudinal fissure as the frame of reference. Next, the specimen was aligned in the coronal plane. After alignment along all axes, OCT was added to encase the specimen in its entirety. The top of the specimen was covered with approximately 3 mm of OCT. The Teflon plate containing the specimen was directly placed onto the level bed of dry ice. The specimen and OCT were allowed to freeze completely. After demarcation of the orientation of the brain in the OCT block, the aluminum bars were removed and the frozen tissue block was stored at −80°C.</p>
<p id="P38">For the E70, E80, E90, and E120 specimens, the hemispheres were bisected along the midline and individually frozen by placing the medial aspect of each hemisphere down onto an aluminum-Teflon coated plate that was slowly lowered into an isopentane/dry ice slurry maintained at −40°C to −45°C. Only approximately a third of the tissue was submerged in the slurry to allow the tissue to gradually freeze and to keep freezing artifacts to a minimum. Frozen hemispheres were stored at −80°C.</p>
<p id="P39">Depending on the prenatal timepoint, different approaches were taken for generating coronal slabs. When possible, the number of slabs per specimen was kept to a minimum. The E40, E50, and E70 specimens were not slabbed. For E80, the first slab contained up through the temporal pole and the second slab contained the occipital pole. For E90, the first slab contained the frontal lobe anterior of the temporal pole and the second slab contained temporal pole posterior through the occipital lobe. For E120, three coronal slabs were made. The first slab consisted of the frontal lobe anterior of the temporal pole. The second slab consisted of the temporal pole posterior to the cerebellum including all of the mid-brain. The third slab included primarily the occipital lobe.</p>
<p id="P40">For postnatal brains, after dissection brains were sectioned into coronal slabs approximately 1 to 1.5 cm in thickness and the left hemisphere was prepared for sectioning onto microscope slides for ISH. Structures for microarray analysis were isolated from the right hemisphere slabs, and these samples were then frozen at −80°C until processed further.</p>

Specifically, frozen tissue was cryosectioned at 14 µm onto polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) slides (Leica Microsystems, Inc., Bannockburn, IL) and a 1:10 Nissl series was generated for neuroanatomical reference for all prenatal timepoints. In addition, for the E40, E50, E70, E80, and E90 timepoints, a 1:10 <italic>GAP43</italic> and 1:10 <italic>ENC1 in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) series was generated for neuroanatomical reference, as they often clearly delineate nuclei and layers at early developmental stages. For E120, a 1:10 acetylcholinesterase series was generated for neuroanatomical reference. In total 127 transient and terminal anatomical structures were isolated using this strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P42">After drying for 30 minutes at room temperature, PEN slides were frozen at −80°C. Slides were lightly Nissl stained with cresyl violet to allow cytoarchitectural visualization. Slides were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 30 seconds, washed 15 seconds in nuclease-free water, stained in 0.7% cresyl violet in 0.05% NaOAc, pH 3.4 for 2 minutes, nuclease-free water for 15 seconds, followed by 15 seconds each in 50%, 75%, and 95% ethanol, followed by 20 seconds in 100% ethanol, and then a final 100% ethanol wash for 25 seconds. Slides were air-dried for 2 minutes, and desiccated in a vacuum for 1 hour, then frozen at −80°C until microdissection. Laser microdissection was performed on a Leica LMD6000 (Leica Microsystems, Inc., Bannockburn, IL), using the Nissl stain and GAP43 and ENC1 ISH or acetylcholinesterase histological staining as a guide to identify target brain regions in prenatal samples.</p>
<p id="P43">Microdissected tissue was collected directly into RLT buffer from the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) with β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were volume-adjusted with water to 75 µl, vortexed, centrifuged, and frozen at −80°C.</p>
<p id="P44">RNA was isolated for each structure following the manufacturer’s directions for the RNeasy Micro kit. RNA samples were eluted in 14 µl and 1 µl was run on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) using the Pico assay. Due to low sample volume and incompatibility of the eluant with the Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE), samples were quantitated using the Bioanalyzer concentration output. This was done by running a 1ng/µl RNA standard on the same Pico chip and then dividing the sample concentration output by the output of the standard concentration. For prenatal samples, 2 ng of total RNA was almost always used as the input amount for the labeling reaction, and the average RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of passed samples was 7.5, with RINs typically lower than 4.5 failing. For postnatal samples, 5 ng of total RNA was almost always used as the input, and the average RIN of passed samples was 7.5, with RINs typically lower than 5 failing.</p>

Unlike acetylcholinesterase staining in fixed tissue, staining in fresh frozen tissue does not elucidate cholinergic fibers commonly seen in the cortex, but instead provides demarcation of various subcortical nuclei. Acetylcholinesterase staining was performed using a direct coloring thiocholine method combined with a methyl green nuclear counterstain to improve tissue visibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Glass slides with fresh frozen tissue sections were removed from 4°C, allowed to equilibrate to room temperature, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) and washed briefly in ultra-pure water. Sections were then incubated for 25 minutes in a solution of acetylthiocholine iodide, sodium citrate, cupric sulfate, and potassium ferricyanide in a 0.1M sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0), washed in 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2), and incubated with 0.5% diaminobenzidine (DAB) in 0.1M Tris-HCl with 0. 03% hydrogen peroxide for 8 minutes.

<title>Microarray processing and normalization</title>
<p id="P51">To account for differences in mRNA processing, prenatal and postnatal samples were first normalized separately using a standard procedure, and then scaled together to minimize the effects of technical biases (e.g. due to differences in mRNA processing of prenatal and postnatal samples) while preserving biological variance. For prenatal samples, the BioConductor “affy” package was used to read in the Affymetrix microarray data and RMA method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, consisting of background normalization, log<sub>2</sub> transformation, and quantile normalization, was applied to summarize the probe level data into gene expression measurements for each batch. Control samples from macrodissected adult cortex were included in each batch to normalize the data across batches by aligning their mean gene expression values. Postnatal samples from each batch were preprocessed using the same RMA method as for prenatal samples. ComBat (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://statistics.byu.edu/johnson/ComBat/">http://statistics.byu.edu/johnson/ComBat/</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> was then applied to reduce more severe non-biological batch-to-batch bias. The postnatal microarray data are unchanged since the original public release. Finally, the normalized prenatal data was scaled to postnatal data by sorting probes by average expression across developed regions in E80 and older animals, finding the difference in average expression levels (postnatal – prenatal) of each group of 100 probes, and then scaling each probe by the corresponding value.</p>
<p id="P52">The purpose of normalization was to minimize the effects of these non-biological biases while keeping biological variance intact so that within and across brain comparisons primarily reveal differences and similarities that are biologically relevant. As a data-driven QC process, for each batch, we applied clustering/MDS (multi-dimensional scaling) to detect any outlier in the batch by checking whether samples from the same structure/age were grouped together. IAC (inter-array-connectivity) was also calculated to numerically measure how one microarray was similar to the other microarrays in the batch. The same QC process was applied over multiple batches to identify outliers. After normalization and outlier removal, a total of 1212 prenatal and 724 postnatal samples remained.</p>

A permutation based correction for multiple comparisons was then performed. For each of 6 prenatal ages, donor sex labels (2 males, 2 females) were shuffled to generate 64 permuted data sets. For each of these permutations, an identical linear mixed model was fit to all genes, and genes were ordered by the magnitude of the fixed effect of sex. Median and 95% confidence interval (i.e. 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles) were calculated for each rank ordered fixed effect. Finally, a quantile-quantile plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>) was created to compare observed fixed effects to median expected (permuted) effects. 11 genes had sex effects lying outside of the 95% confidence interval (i.e. greater expression in males), and 7 of these genes were nominally significant (mixed model P value &lt; 0.05).</p>

<title>Analysis of dynamic genes using GO</title>
<p id="P58">We first calculated average gene expression in all brain regions (n = 3–4 monkeys) at 10 ages, and then calculated rates of expression change as the difference in log2-transformed expression between adjacent ages in each region and expressed as doublings or halvings per year. Note that rates of expression change could not be calculated for the earliest time point (E40) or for regions without sampling at adjacent ages. For each of 419 distinct brain regions, we rank ordered genes by rates of expression change, and selected the top 1000 increasing and decreasing genes. We compared all of these genes lists (419 * 418 = 175,142 comparisons). For each gene list comparison, we found the number of overlapping genes and calculated an overlap similarity score based on the weighted rank order of the lists (“OrderedList” package in R). We then generated a null distribution of similarity scores by shuffling gene lists 10 million times and calculated P values for observed similarity scores. We found that 56,540 gene lists were significantly (Bonferroni corrected P &lt; 0.05) overlapping.</p>
<p id="P59">We visualized the number of overlapping genes as a heatmap and reordered rows and columns based on the correlated patterns of overlapping increasing genes. Specifically, we calculated the distance between 419 brain samples as (1 – correlation) / 2 and used unsupervised hierarchical clustering with complete linkage to order samples. The dendrogram was reordered (while preserving the tree structure) by weighting branches by median ages of samples and rotating branches to group similar ages. Samples from the same age were highlighted with grid lines aligned to this dendrogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The heatmap was also annotated with brain structure and a mitotic index approximated by mean expression of<italic>MKI67</italic> (Ki-67 protein).</p>
<p id="P60">We performed GO enrichment with the Bioconductor “GOstats” package in R with a background set of 10,715 human orthologs included in this study. We repeated GO enrichment analysis on each of 56,540 gene lists (32,053 increasing and 24,487 decreasing), and found 11,899 biological process terms were nominally significant (P &lt; 0. 05) for at least one list. To reduce false positive associations, we calculated the level of statistical support for each GO term as the proportion of children of that term (based on the GO hierarchy) that were nominally enriched. For example, if a GO term had 10 associated children and four were enriched, then the term had a support of 0.4. For each term, we plotted a heatmap of statistical support for all 56,540 gene lists (on a scale of 0 to 1), and many of these heatmaps showed distinct patterns of enrichment (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). We summarized GO enrichment as a table by calculating the average support for all 419 regions and considered a GO term active if mean support was greater than 0.01. We transformed this table into a binary matrix showing when and where GO terms were active. We removed terms associated with fewer than 10 of 419 regions since these terms likely represented noise, and this resulted in 3,704 processes increasing and/or decreasing over development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p id="P61">We repeated the previous gene overlap and GO enrichment analyses with a set of five major brain regions including neocortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia and amygdala at nine ages and thalamus at four ages (40 total brain regions). We found that 556 of 1,600 gene list comparisons were significantly overlapping and 1,012 biological processes were active in these regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). For each GO term, we calculated commonality as the number of ages (maximum nine) that term was active in each brain region and in any region. We plotted the distribution of commonalities across all terms in different regions as density line plots separately for increasing and decreasing processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>

<title>Relative timing of developmental processes</title>
<p id="P62">We calculated the relative timing of GO term activity using the binary matrix representing when and where terms were active in the four brain regions (neocortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia and amygdala) for which we had information across development. For each of six possible region comparisons, we divided the number of ages a GO term was active in both regions by the number of ages it was active in either region (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). For each term, we averaged the six age overlap calculations to summarize overall timing differences. We repeated these calculations for all 1,012 GO terms and plotted the distribution of age overlaps for increasing and decreasing processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>
<p id="P63">For 837 increasing processes, we plotted the earliest age of activity in four brain regions and ordered terms by age of onset in amygdala, basal ganglia, hippocampus and neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). We characterized timing as either simultaneous (equal age of onset in all regions), subcortex early (either amygdala or hippocampus onset earlier than both hippocampus and neocortex), or cortex early (either hippocampus or neocortex onset earlier than both amygdala and hippocampus). Next, for each term, we rank ordered the four brain regions based on age of onset. Ties were broken by assigning the average rank to all tied regions. For example, if a process was first active at E50 in amygdala and at E70 in the other three regions, then amygdala was assigned a rank of 1 while the other regions were assigned a rank of 3 (average of ranks 2, 3 and 4). This tie-breaking method highlighted terms that were earlier and later than all other regions. We calculated region ranks for 837 terms and plotted a heatmap of the proportion of terms with each rank for each region (columns sum to one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>) and used these proportions to calculate the weighted mean rank of each region.</p>
<p id="P64">We selected the top 40 genes enriched in myelinating oligodendrocytes in adult mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> and identified 23 orthologs with expression data in rhesus.

<title>Transcriptional signatures of V1 layers</title>
<p id="P65">We compared gene expression across postmitotic layers in V1 for each age starting from E80, the earliest age at which all layers were sampled. Samples from L2 and L3 were considered together as L2/3, and samples from sub-layers of L4 were considered together as L4. For each subject and age, we calculated the average log2 scaled gene expression of layers 2/3, 4, 5 and 6, as well as adjacent layers marginal zone/L1 and intermediate zone/white matter for comparison. For each age, we fit a linear model to the expression data with a dummy variable coding for layer. The proportion of variance explained by each layer was estimated using the CAR metric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup> in the “relaimpo” R package. For each layer and age, we rank ordered genes based on the proportion of variance explained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 6</xref>).</p>
<p id="P66">Layer signatures between ages were compared by identifying the top 10% most laminar genes evenly allocated between layers (top 2.5% each in L2/3, L4, L5, and L6), and then calculating their average across-layer correlation between ages. Specifically, for each “source” list of marker genes, we found the average expression by layer of these genes at the “source” age and at every other “target” age, resulting in two expression tables of 1224 genes by 4 layers. Gene by gene, expression across layers was compared using Pearson correlation and the average correlation across all 1224 genes was determined.</p>
<p id="P67">Differential expression between the layer and all other layers was calculated using the “limma” R package. Genes were considered layer-enriched if they explained at least 25% of the expression variance in all layers (see description of analysis above) and had expression &gt; 1.5-fold higher than other layers combined. Genes marking the same layer in at least two ages were further defined as “persistent” if they were laminar during at least 5 out of 7 ages, or “early”, “middle”, or “late” if their median age of laminar enrichment was &lt;E120, between E120 and 3M, or &gt;3M, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). Selected marker genes were visualized using heatmaps as described above, but only showing the subset of data considered in this analysis (L1-WM in V1 from E80-48M). To characterize the function of genes from each laminar timing group, we grouped genes from all layers with the same timing and performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment using all “Biological Process” terms with fewer than 500 associated genes. We identified significantly associated terms (nominal P &lt;10<sup>−4</sup> and five or more genes enriched for at least one timing group) and visualized–log10P values using a heatmap.</p>

<title>Differential expression between neocortical regions</title>
<p id="P68">We compared gene expression in V1 and ACG independently for each age in the outer (L2/L3) and inner (L5/L6) cortical layers, in the subventricular zone (SZ), and in the ventricular zone (VZ). First, we averaged gene expression (logarithmically scaled) within specimen across all relevant samples for each layer in V1 and ACG independently (i.e., L2 and L3 in V1 were averaged in each brain). For each age and layer, nominal P values for differential regional expression were calculated using a paired test (n = 3–4 monkeys), and genes with P &lt;0.05 and average fold change &gt;2 were considered significantly enriched in ACG or V1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). We then defined persistent regional markers as genes significantly enriched in either ACG or V1 in at least 2/3 of the ages in which a layer was present (N&gt;=5 in L2/L3; N&gt;=6 in L5/L6; N&gt;=4 in SZ and VZ). We visualized the expression patterns of select regional markers using line plots, where each point shows the average (± standard deviation) log2-scaled gene expression levels of that gene in ACG (red) or V1 (blue) for a particular layer (specified to the right of the plot).</p>
<p id="P69">We quantified regional enrichment of several cell types in each layer and at each age using a hypergeometric test. Specifically, we compared 242 lists of marker genes derived from the literature against each set of V1 and ACG enriched genes described above, calculated a P value based on the significance of overlap using the <italic>phyper</italic> function in R. P values were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons and visualized as boxes in a grid of layers (vertical axis) and ages (horizontal axis). Cell type lists were derived as follows: dividing cell markers were defined as any marker of any phase of cell cycle as presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 3</xref> of Bar-Joseph et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. Markers for excitatory neurons in adult mouse V1 were derived from Tasic et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup> by identifying all genes expressed in at least 2.2X as many excitatory as inhibitory cells (based on proportion) and that have expression in the 80<sup>th</sup> percentile excitatory cell that is both 2.2X higher than the 80<sup>th</sup> percentile inhibitory cell and also higher than RPKM=2.5. Inhibitory neuron markers were defined the same way, but swapping excitatory and inhibitory above. Finally, astrocyte marker genes were defined as genes which showed at least 10-fold enrichment in sorted astrocytes compared with both neurons and oligodendrocytes in Cahoy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup></p>
<p id="P70">To address the issue of timing of gene expression in prenatal cortical development, we extended these analysis to S1 by considering the set of genes showing rostral enrichment during the phase in which V1 corticogenesis lags ACG (E70-E90), and asked to what extent these genes also show higher expression in S1 vs. V1. We do this in two ways. First, we re-plot genes presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S1</xref> also shown for direct comparison. Second, we calculate the average enrichment of these genes in S1 relative to V1 (using log2 fold change across all samples from the relevant layers between E70-E90), and compare it directly to the average enrichment in ACG relative to V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Network profiling of disease genes</title>
<p id="P71">We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup> to generate 10 unbiased gene co-expression networks (one at each age) using cortical structures (ACG and V1) with the goal of quantifying the distribution of disease-related genes throughout these networks. Initial networks were generated using an automated strategy with the following function call in R:
<preformat>
<italic>blockRun = blockwiseModules(datExprRun, checkMissingData = TRUE</italic>,
 <italic>maxBlockSize = 17500,power = 14, networkType = "signed", deepSplit = 1</italic>,
 <italic>minModuleSize = 50, minCoreKMESize = 17, minKMEtoStay = 0.4</italic>,
 <italic>mergeCutHeight = 0.1, numericLabels = TRUE, verbose = 1</italic>)
</preformat> where <monospace><italic>datExprRun</italic></monospace> is the log2 normalized microarray data from the top 9331 (75%) most variable genes (at each time point). For postnatal time points these values in V1 and ACG were scaled to the mean interquartile expression of samples from layers 2, 3, 5, and 6. The goal of this scaling was to deemphasize regional patterning differences or batch effects and maximize laminar and cell type patterning. After running the network (and after performing the merging steps described below) module eigengenes (ME; the first principal component of genes in the module) were calculated for each module, and all genes were reassigned to the module to which it is most highly correlated to the ME (referred to as the gene’s module membership, or kME). Genes with kME&lt;0.4 for all modules in a given age are left unassigned (defined as module 0). While there is no agreed upon value for a kME cutoff in the literature, we have successfully used a cutoff of kME &lt; 0.4 in the past as the cutoff for assigned vs. unassigned genes (e.g. Hawrylycz et al. 2015<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>).</p>
<p id="P72">If the resulting network at any time point contained more than 15 modules, the module pair with the most highly correlated ME were iteratively merged until 15 modules remained. Since networks are unaffected by changes in labeling, modules were then re-ordered manually such that modules with strong enrichment for cortical plate neurons had low numbers, modules with strong enrichment for progenitor or glial cells had higher numbers, and modules between ages with a highly significant number of overlapping genes were ordered similarly across development. To do this third step, every pair of modules in networks from adjacent ages were compared using a hypergeometric test, and pairs with overlap significance of P &lt; 10<sup>−50</sup> were linked (using grey lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). We note that several additional pairs of modules show significant overlap (but with P &gt;= 10<sup>−50</sup>)—these modules pairs are not shown in the plot for readability and because we are interesting in finding only the most significant overlaps. Finally, modules which were split into two modules at a single age but not at both adjacent ages were merged. At each age, modules are numbered by row number in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> with the top row being Module 01 at each age. Module assignments for each gene at each age are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 9</xref>.</p>
<p id="P73">We have broadly annotated many of these modules based on cortical layer, cell type, and disease enrichments, and provide the annotated network as a resource to the community. Module assignments of postmitotic vs. progenitor cell layer in prenatal neocortex was done by comparing mean expression in cortical plate (CP) and subplate (SP) vs. all other layers, and noting which mean value is highest. Similarly, assignments of cortical vs. glial cell layers in postnatal neocortex was done by comparing mean expression in post-mitotic layers 2–6 vs. white matter and layer 1. Module assignments based on cortical layer were performed by finding the average expression of all module genes in all layers included in them and finding the layer in which expression is highest (select layer enrichments are labeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Additional assignments for primarily postmitotic cortical layers (from E80-48M) were found by performing a hypergeometric test on every module against layer markers identified in the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref> for each age. Significant enrichments (P &lt; 10<sup>−30</sup>) are color-coded in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>. This p-value cutoff ensured that modules selected were only enriched with markers for a single layer, whereas with lower cutoffs some modules had markers for multiple layers. Module enrichments for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes were calculated by performing hypergeometric test comparisons, and plotting these P values as colored discs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> for modules that are highly significant (P &lt; 10<sup>−15</sup>). Astrocyte marker genes were defined as genes which showed at least 10-fold enrichment in sorted astrocytes compared with both neurons and oligodendrocytes in Cahoy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> (likewise for oligodendrocyte markers).</p>
<p id="P74">We used empirical rather than Bonferroni correction of the significance of disease gene enrichments because the tests were correlated due to high module gene overlap. Hypergeometric P values were calculated by comparing each module against genomics-based disease genes for autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (13 genes)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>, autism spectrum disorder (<italic>a posteriori</italic> probability &gt; 0.8; 171 genes)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> and schizophrenia (206 genes)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup> with homologs in this data set. Module assignments were then permuted 999 times per disease, and the minimum P value across all modules for each of the permuted comparisons was recorded. Nominal P values were corrected with this empirical null distribution of minimum P values. For example, a nominal P value less than the minimum P value in 90% of the permutations had an empirically corrected P value equal to 0.1 that controlled the family-wise error rate at 10%. This is a much more stringent criterion than FDR &lt; 0.1 because it means that there is a less than 10% chance that any of the enriched modules is a false positive enrichment. Modules that were significantly enriched for disease-associated genes were plotted as red discs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b–d</xref>.

Genes were annotated with color bar tracks indicating phenotypes present in one or more individuals with likely pathological mutations in these genes. Primary microcephaly was defined as microcephaly without other brain malformations and corpus callosum abnormalities included agenesis and various hypogenesis and dysgenesis phenotypes.

To compare rhesus monkey to gross cortical samples in rat and human, we calculated average expression across all sub-regions of anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG, partially overlapping with MFC in human), V1, hippocampus, amygdala and striatum at each age. We aligned ages across species by estimating event scores based on the conserved timing of developmental events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and found that prenatal and postnatal development were well sampled in all species.</p>
<p id="P77">For frontal cortical samples, 4,125 orthologous genes were identified using NCBI Homologene, and we selected 2,062 genes that were among the top 50% most variable genes over development in rhesus. This filter removed genes that had relatively constant expression and therefore would be difficult to compare trajectories between species. Independently for each gene and species, we estimated the shape of expression trajectories by smoothed local linear regression (“loess” R function) with degree zero to allow for complex dynamics while reducing overfitting. With these smoothed fits, we estimated expression at 8 approximately evenly spaced event scores (ranging from 0.27 to 1.32) for each species. We correlated expression trajectories between each pair of species and plotted a Venn diagram showing the number of conserved (Pearson correlation R &gt; 0.5) genes between each pair of species. Genes were assigned to one of five sets based on the pattern of species conservation. “Conserved” genes were conserved between at least two species pairs and “Not conserved” were not conserved between any species pair and may represent noise. “Primate-specific” genes were conserved between human and rhesus but not between rat and either primate. “Human-specific” genes were conserved between rhesus and rat but not between human and either other species. “Rhesus-specific” genes were conserved between human and rat but not between rhesus and either other species.</p>

Correlation distributions deviated significantly from normality based on a Shapiro-Wilk test (“shapiro.test” in R), and so differences were tested with a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (“kruskal.test”) followed by paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests (“wilcox.test”) to test for significant differences in conservation between species. Finally, we repeated the analysis described above for a larger set of 8,683 orthologous genes in human and rhesus macaque. First, we rank ordered genes based on the standard deviation of expression across rhesus monkey development. For the top 100 most variable genes, we calculated expression correlations between human data sets and between human and rhesus.

A linear mixed model was fit to all prenatal brain samples with a fixed effect for sex and random effects for brain region, age and donor (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). Genes were ordered by the observed sex effect and plotted versus the expected sex effect based on permutation testing. A 95% confidence interval was calculated (dashed line) based on permutations, and 11 genes in males and no genes in females were more highly expressed than expected by chance. Seven of these 11 genes were nominally significant and included at least two Y-chromosome genes (<italic>EIF1AY</italic>, <italic>LOC720563</italic>) and potentially a third gene (<italic>LOC693361</italic>) whose microarray probe maps to an unannotated region of the Y chromosome.</p>

<p id="P89"><bold>a</bold>, Genes with enriched expression in ACG relative to V1 between E70-E90 also show enriched expression in S1 relative to V1, suggesting that the timing of primary sensory regions is non-uniform in L5/L6 (top), SZ (middle), and VZ (bottom). Each plot shows the average enrichment (log2 fold change) in S1 vs. V1 (y-axes) compared with the average enrichment in ACG vs. V1 (x-axes) between E70-E90 for all genes significantly enriched in ACG in at least two of the three ages between E70-E90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). <bold>b</bold>, Marker genes for cell types (compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e–h</xref>) show expression patterns in S1 which are either consistent with ACG (i.e., <italic>GAD1</italic>) or intermediate between V1 and ACG (i.e., AQP4). <bold>c</bold>, Genes with enriched expression for V1 (<italic>FGFR3</italic>) or ACG (<italic>CBLN2</italic>) across development show intermediate expression in S1, suggesting that these genes may show cortical gradients rather than specific expression in V1 or ACG. <bold>d</bold>, Genes with common expression patterning in V1 and ACG can show different patterns in S1, suggesting that rate of neuron and glia development is not the whole story.

<p id="P104"><bold>a</bold>, Left: Boxplots of pairwise correlations between developmental expression trajectories (median ± 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles, whiskers at 1.5 times the inter-quartile range) of orthologous genes profiled in rhesus monkey, rat and two human data sets. Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, post-hoc Wilcoxon signed rank paired tests: * P &lt; 0.001 (Bonferroni-corrected), n.s. not significant. Right: Venn diagram showing the number of conserved (R &gt; 0.5) genes between each pair of species. <bold>b</bold>, Examples of conserved and species-specific gene trajectories. Colors and symbols are consistent in <bold>b-d. c</bold>, Distribution of breakpoint ages for 179 orthologs (solid lines) of which 81 were synapse related (dashed lines) in frontal cortex and V1. Shaded bars indicate periods of peak synaptic density (95% confidence intervals) in each species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>). <bold>d</bold>, Genes with unexpectedly early and late breakpoints in expression trajectories in human. Observed breakpoints (dashed lines) compared to expected breakpoints (dotted lines) based on timing in rhesus monkey. <bold>e</bold>, Many genes in human cortex have early breakpoints followed by prolonged increase in expression. Left: Comparison of breakpoint timing (points with 95% confidence intervals) between human and rhesus shows a biased population of early breakpoint genes in human cortex but not striatum. Many of these early breakpoint genes continue to increase expression through young adulthood (red) in contrast to genes with relatively conserved timing that tend to plateau (grey) or decrease (blue). Ages corresponding to equivalent (solid lines) or nearby (dashed lines) developmental stages (event scores within ± 0.2; see <bold>Methods</bold>) in human and rhesus monkey are shown. Right: Bar plot summarizing the number of genes that have an early or late breakpoint in human in different brain regions.</p>
