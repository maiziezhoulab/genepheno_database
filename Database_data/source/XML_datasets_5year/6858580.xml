<p id="P3">Volumetric variations of human brain are heritable and are associated with many brain-related complex traits. Here we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 101 brain volumetric phenotypes using the UK Biobank (UKB) sample including 19,629 participants. GWAS identified 365 independent genetic variants exceeding significance threshold of 4.9 × 10<sup>−10</sup>, adjusted for testing multiple phenotypes. Gene-based association study found 157 associated genes (124 new), and functional gene mapping analysis linked 146 additional genes. Many of the discovered genetic variants and genes have previously been implicated in cognitive and mental health traits. Using genome-wide polygenic risk score prediction, more than 6% of phenotypic variance (<italic>P</italic> = 3.13 × 10<sup>−24</sup>) in four other independent studies could be explained by the UKB GWAS results. In conclusion, our study identifies many new genetic associations at variant, locus and gene levels and advances our understanding of the pleiotropy and genetic co-architecture between brain volumes and other traits.</p>

<p id="P5">Regional brain volumes are heritable measures of brain functional and structural changes. Volumetric variations of human brain are known to be phenotypically and genetically associated with heritable cognitive and mental health traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, and it is an active research area to understand the shared genetic influences on these traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Individual variations of human brain volume are usually quantified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In region of interest (ROI)-based analysis, whole brain MRIs are processed and annotated onto many pre-defined ROIs, and then regional volumetric phenotypes are generated to measure the structure of brain ROIs. Both twin and population-based studies have shown that these volumetric phenotypes can be highly or moderately heritable. The heritability of brain regions estimated from twin studies can be larger than 80%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. For example, the heritability of basal ganglia structures (putamen, caudate, pallidum) and limbic and diencephalic regions (hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus) was reported to range from 0.60 to 0.85<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Common genetic variants (typically single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) can account for more than 50% phenotypic variation in the general population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The SNP heritability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> estimates of accumbens area, amygdala, putamen, palladium, caudate, thalamus and hippocampus range from 0.40 to 0.54<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. A highly polygenic or omnigenic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> genetic architecture has been observed, which indicates that a large number of genetic variants influence regional brain volumes and their genetic contributions are widespread across the genome.</p>
<p id="P6">Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> have been conducted to identify genetic risk variants for brain volumetric phenotypes. However, except for the whole brain volume and volumes of a few specific ROIs (e.g., hippocampus in subcortical area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>), GWAS of most brain volumetric phenotypes were insufficiently powered, for which the largest sample size of discovery GWAS was less than 10,000 in Elliott et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Such GWAS sample size is much smaller than those of recent GWAS of other heritable brain-related traits, such as cognitive function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, neuroticism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, and intelligence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, where sample sizes ranged from 269,867 to 449,484. Given the polygenic nature of brain volumes, most of the genetic risk variants may remain undetected, and GWAS with larger sample size can uncover more associated variants and enrich the pleiotropy and genetic co-architecture with other traits. Recently, the UK Biobank (UKB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>) study team has collected and released MRI data for more than 20,000 participants. In addition, publicly available imaging genetic datasets also emerge from several other independent studies, including Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>), Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>), Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>), and the Human Connectome Project (HCP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>), among others. These datasets provide a new opportunity to perform better-powered GWAS of all ROI brain volumes.</p>
<p id="P7">Here we downloaded the raw MRI data from these data resources and processed the data using consistent standard procedures via advanced normalization tools (ANTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>) to generate 101 regional (and total) brain volume phenotypes (referred as ROI volumes), including total brain volume (TBV), gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We used 19,629 UKB individuals of British ancestry in the main discovery GWAS. Four other datasets with relatively small sample sizes (total sample size 2,192 after quality controls) were used to validate the UKB findings, and finally, a meta-analysis was performed to combine all the data. We started our analysis of UKB data by estimating SNP heritability, which is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be explained by the additive effects of all common autosomal variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Since the UKB MRI data were released at different time points, we organized them in two parts: the first part was released in 2017 (which we refer to as phase 1, <italic>n</italic> = 9,198), most of which has been analyzed in Elliott et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and the second part was released in 2018 (which we refer to as phase 2, <italic>n</italic> = 10,431). To detect any potential heterogeneity between the two phases, we compared the SNP heritability estimated in phase 2 data to those in phase 1 data. We then carried out GWAS to identify the associated genetic variants for each ROI volume. We performed gene-based association analysis via MAGMA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> to uncover gene-level associations, and performed post-GWAS functional mapping and annotation (FUMA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>) to explore the functional consequences of the significant genetic variants. We calculated the pairwise genetic correlation between ROI volumes and 50 brain-related complex traits by the linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression (LDSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>). To confirm the robustness of UKB GWAS findings, we jointly analyzed the UKB GWAS results with those from PNC, ADNI, PING and HCP. We developed genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) to assess the predictive ability of the UKB GWAS results on the four other datasets. GWAS summary statistics of the UKB sample and meta-analysis for the five studies have been made publicly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://med.sites.unc.edu/bigs2/data/gwas-summary-statistics/">https://med.sites.unc.edu/bigs2/data/gwas-summary-statistics/</ext-link>.</p>

<title>SNP heritability estimates of the two UKB phases.</title>
<p id="P8">In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, we compare the SNP heritability (<italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>) estimated separately from UKB phase 1 and 2 data. The sample correlation coefficient of these estimates was 0.85 (correlation = 0.85), indicating moderate to high level of agreement in terms of the degree of genetic contributions to ROI between the two phases. The mean <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> across 101 ROI volumes was 0.41 for phase 1 and 0.37 for phase 2. The difference of mean <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> was not significant (two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.12). Ten ROIs had &gt;0.6 <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> estimates in both phases, including TBV, cerebellar vermal lobules VIII-X, cerebellar vermal lobules I-V, brain stem, left/right cerebellum exterior, left/right cerebellum white matter, and left/right putamen. The <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> estimates from the combined data were highly correlated with those from phase 1 (correlation = 0.93) and phase 2 (correlation = 0.95) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">3</xref>). The <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) are illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">6</xref>. The <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> estimates, standard errors, raw and Bonferroni-corrected <italic>P</italic>-values from the one-sided likelihood ratio tests are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. In the combined data, <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> of most ROIs was significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (mean <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 0.40, <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> range = (0.12, 0.72), standard error = 0.15). SNP heritability estimates of left basal forebrain (<italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 0.10) and optic chiasm (<italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 0.06) were not significant. These <italic>h</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> estimates were comparable with previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, for each ROI, we examined the genetic correlation (gc) of its regional volumes collected in the two phases. The gc estimates distributed around the point one, and the 95% CIs of gc estimates covered the point one for most ROIs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). In summary, SNP heritability and genetic correlation analyses indicate that most ROI volumes are heritable and have largely consistent genetic basis in the two phases data.</p>

<title>Significant GWAS associations of 101 ROI volumes.</title>
<p id="P9">We carried out GWAS of the 101 ROI volumes using 8,944,375 genetic variants after genotyping quality controls. Manhattan and QQ plots of all 101 phenotypes are displayed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Datasets 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">2</xref>, respectively. In the rest of this paper, we use 4.9 × 10<sup>−10</sup> (that is, 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>/101, additionally adjusted for all 101 GWAS performed) as the significance threshold for genetic variant-level associations unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p id="P10">We found that 365 independent significant variants had 494 significant associations with 58 ROIs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">3</xref>) at the 4.9 × 10<sup>−10</sup> significance level. Independent significant variants were defined as significant variants that were independent of other significant variants by FUMA (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). The number of associations for each ROI is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. Left/right hippocampus, left/right putamen, and cerebellar vermal lobules VIII-X had at least 30 independent significant variants. The number of independent significant associations on each chromosome is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>. Chromosome 12 had the largest number of independent variant-level associations after weighting by chromosome length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">Based on the pre-calculated LD structure from the 1000 Genomes reference panel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, variants in LD with independent significant variants were identified and then (independent) lead variants and genetic risk loci were defined (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). The 494 independent significant variant-level associations were further characterized as 170 significant associations between genetic risk loci and ROI volumes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Brain stem, X4th ventricle, cerebellar vermal lobules VIII-X, cerebellar vermal lobules VI-VII, left/right putamen, left/right cerebellum exterior, left/right hippocampus, left/right lateral ventricle, left pallidum, TBV and WM had at least five associated loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Each chromosome had at least one associated locus except for chromosomes 13, 21 and 22 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Results at significance thresholds 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup> and 5 × 10<sup>−9</sup> are also provided in the above tables and summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>. We also performed association analysis for 283,120 genetic variants on the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>) but observed no significant association at the 4.9 × 10<sup>−10</sup> significance level.</p>

<title>Concordance with previous GWAS results.</title>
<p id="P12">We performed association lookups for the 365 independent significant variants and their correlated variants in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. We found that 166 independent significant variants (associated with 47 ROI volumes) have previously reported GWAS associations with other traits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Our results tagged many variants that were previously reported in GWAS of ROI volumes, including 19 variants in van der Meer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> for hippocampal subfield volumes, 12 in Hibar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> for subcortical brain region volumes, 6 in Chen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> for putamen volume, 4 in Bis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> for hippocampal volume, 2 in Hibar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> for hippocampal volume, 2 in Stein et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> for brain structure, 2 in Ikram et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> for intracranial volume, 1 in Furney et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> for whole brain volume, and 1 in Baranzini et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> for normalized brain volume (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 9</xref>). For the other traits, we highlighted previous associations of 46 variants with mental health disorders (such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and depression), 98 with cognitive functions, 25 with educational attainment, 24 with neuroticism, 14 with Parkinson’s disease, 4 with reaction time, and 3 with Alzheimer’s disease. We observed more overlap with previous GWAS results when the significance threshold was relaxed to 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 10</xref>). We also compared our results with those reported in Elliott et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, who performed GWAS of 3,144 imaging phenotypes (including brain volume phenotypes processed by FreeSurfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>) using the UKB phase 1 data (<italic>n</italic> = 8,428). When both were corrected for the number of GWAS analyses performed, 26 of the 78 significant variants reported in Elliott et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> were in LD (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.6) with our independent significant variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 11</xref>).

Due to the small sample size of these four datasets, the probability of replicating significant findings in the UKB was low.

<title>Genetic correlation with other traits.</title>
<p id="P18">We used the meta-analysis GWAS results to estimate the genetic correlation with other traits via LDSC. As positive controls, we first estimated the genetic correlation between several UKB ROIs volumes (TBV, left/right thalamus proper, left/right caudate, left/right putamen, left/right pallidum, left/right hippocampus, left/right accumbens area) and their corresponding traits studied in the ENIGMA consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>.

Particularly, TBV had positive correlations with cognitive functions, education, intelligence, and numerical reasoning (gc range = (0.20, 0.25), mean = 0.22, <italic>P</italic>-value range = (1.52 × 10<sup>−11</sup>, 3.45 × 10<sup>−5</sup>)). These results matched the previous finding that brain size has small but significant connections with cognitive performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>.

<title>Predictive ability of the UKB GWAS results.</title>
<p id="P20">We examined the out-of-sample prediction power of the UKB GWAS summary statistics using polygenic risk scores prediction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. We first used a ten-fold cross-validation design to examine the prediction power within the UKB sample for seven ROIs, including thalamus proper, caudate, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus, accumbens area, and TBV (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). The polygenic profiles can explain 1.18%-3.93% phenotypic variance (<italic>P</italic>-value range = (7.88 × 10<sup>−210</sup>, 4.90 × 10<sup>−72</sup>)) for these ROIs. The largest R-squared 3.93% was observed on putamen. Next, we used ROI-derived profiles to carry out cross-trait prediction on brain-related traits including education, reaction time, numeric memory, and fluid intelligence. The largest R-squared of a single profile was 0.24% (<italic>P</italic> = 7.53 × 10<sup>−7</sup>), which occurred when using the TBV-derived profile to predict fluid intelligence. When putting the profiles of seven ROIs together in one multivariate model, the R-squared for predicting fluid intelligence can be improved to 0.52% (<italic>P</italic> = 1.89 × 10<sup>−9</sup>). These results are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 27</xref>.</p>
<p id="P21">We then used the GWAS summary statistics of 19,629 UKB individuals to construct polygenic profiles on subjects in PNC, HCP, PING, and ADNI. We found that, for 11 ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), the genetically predicted regional volume was significantly associated with the observed ROI volume in all four validation datasets after Bonferroni correction (that is, 101 × 4 = 404 tests), and can account for 1.17%-6.38% phenotypic variance (<italic>P</italic>-value range = (3.31 × 10<sup>−24</sup>, 1.68 × 10<sup>−5</sup>)) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 28</xref>). For example, the R-squared of right putamen-derived profile was 6.38% in ADNI and 4.85% in PNC. Furthermore, 29 genetically predicted regional volumes were significant in at least three of the four datasets, 56 in at least two datasets, and 84 in at least one dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 15</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">17</xref>). In summary, our within-UKB and out-of-UKB PRS analyses clearly indicate that UKB GWAS summary statistics of ROI volumes have widespread prediction power across ROIs. However, the R-squared can be low when predicting other brain-related complex traits. Such results are unsurprising because the genetic correlations among these traits were found to be small (though significant) in LDSC analysis.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P22">In this study, we presented GWAS of 101 ROI volumes using data of 19,629 UKB individuals. Our novel contributions include: (i) identification of many new genetic associations at variant, locus, and gene levels; (ii) insights into the genetic co-architecture of brain volume phenotypes and other brain-related complex traits; (iii) validation of the UKB results in independent studies; and (iv) assessment of the predictive power of UKB GWAS results. Significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 4.9 × 10<sup>−10</sup>) associations were found for 58 of the 101 ROIs. With larger sample size, the present study replicated many known genetic variants but also prioritized new ones. Compared to Elliott et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, our GWAS not only discovered more genetic variants, but also enriched the degree of (statistical) pleiotropy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup> of the associated genes and characterized the shared genetic influences with cognitive and mental health traits. Our SNP heritability estimates are aligned with those previous results of existing twin studies. For example, our results supported previous findings that the degree of genetic control varies across different regions within the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>. We also confirmed that cortical ROIs have larger variability in their heritability estimates than subcortical and ventricular ROIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In addition, some subcortical ROIs, such as putamen, cerebellum white matter, and brain stem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>, were confirmatively highly heritable. On the other hand, SNP heritability of ROI volumes were found to be generally lower than estimates reported in twin studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. This is expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup> and may indicate that genetic influences cannot be fully captured by additive effects of common genetic variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Such gaps may inspire future work to explore the effects of rare genetic variants on ROI volumes and to better model the genetic variation of the brain.</p>
<p id="P23">The present GWAS still faces some limitations. First, the current GWAS sample size of ROI volumes (and many other brain imaging phenotypes) is still far from sufficient. The highly polygenic genetic architecture of ROI volumes requires a larger number of individuals to identify many weak causal variants. In the era of sharing GWAS summary statistics, well-powered GWAS is essential for ROI volumes to be linked to the genetic co-architecture atlas with other complex traits. For example, a recent study of Watanabe et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup> to discover the global overview of genetic co-architecture of 2,965 traits only focused on GWAS with sample size larger than 50,000, with the average sample size of selected traits being 256,276. In our genetic correlation analysis, we only obtained limited number of significant correlations, even though many pleiotropic genes were found in association lookups. In addition, ROI-derived PRS currently may have insufficient power to predict other brain-related traits. Therefore, we expect that GWAS of ROI volumes with larger sample size will be available and can further improve our understating of genetic overlaps underlying other traits. Besides increasing the sample size, combining genotyping data with external information, such as gene expression data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>, may also help elucidate causal mechanisms, improve prediction performance, and identify genetic connections among traits.</p>
<p id="P24">Second, potential imaging artifacts, such as MRI hardware and software changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>, may cause unwanted variation in downstream genetic analyses, especially when combining multi-site and multiple-phase neuroimaging data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup>. In the present GWAS, we confirmed that the pairwise genetic correlations between UKB phases 1 and 2 data distributed around the point one, and verified that the UKB GWAS results had satisfactory prediction ability on four other independent datasets. However, we found that the SNP heritability estimates of the two phases data were not perfectly harmonized. The inadequate GWAS sample size may partially explain the variation in these heritability estimates, but it is also possible that artificial factors impaired the consistency of our results (see Table 1 of Smith and Nichols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup> for a list of common imaging batch effects). Future studies that integrate data from more sites and phases are expected to be batch effects-aware and to confirm the previous GWAS findings.</p>

We input the UKB GWAS summary statistics obtained from PLINK. FUMA first identified independent significant variants, which were defined as variants with a <italic>P</italic>-value smaller than the predefined threshold and independent of other significant variants at <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.6. Using these independent significant variants, FUMA then constructed LD blocks for independent significant variants by tagging all variants that had a MAF ≥ 0.0005 and were in LD (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.6) with at least one of the independent significant variants. These variants included those from the 1000 Genomes reference panel and may not have been included in the present study. Based on these independent significant variants, (independent) lead variants were also identified as those that were independent from each other (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.1). If LD blocks of independent significant variants were closed (&lt;250 kb based on the closest boundary variants of LD blocks), they were merged to a single genomic locus. Thus, each genomic locus could contain more than one independent significant variants and lead variants. Independent significant variants and all the tagged variants were subsequently searched by FUMA in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog (version 2019-01-31, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/</ext-link>) to look for their reported associations (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 9 × 10<sup>−6</sup>) with any traits.</p>

<title>Gene-based association analysis and functional annotation.</title>
<p id="P29">Gene-based association analysis was carried out for 18,796 protein-coding genes using MAGMA (v1.07, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ctg.cncr.nl/software/magma">https://ctg.cncr.nl/software/magma</ext-link>/), which was also implemented in FUMA. Genetic variants were mapped according to their psychical positions, and then the gene-based <italic>P</italic>-values were calculated by the GWAS summary statistics of mapped variants. Default MAGMA parameters were used, which mapped genetic variants to genes with no window around genes (window size = 0). In functional annotation and mapping analysis, variant-level signals were annotated with their biological functionality and then were linked to genes by a combination of positional, eQTL, and 3D chromatin interaction mappings. Specifically, independent significant variants and all the tagged variants were first annotated for functional consequences on gene functions (e.g., intergenic, intronic, exonic) using ANNOVAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></sup> (version 2017-01-11). Functionally-annotated variants were then mapped to 35,808 candidate genes based on physical position on the genome (tissue/cell types for 15-core chromatin state: brain), eQTL associations (tissue types: GTEx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup> v7 brain, BRAINEAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref></sup>, and CommonMind Consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref></sup>) and chromatin interaction mapping (built-in chromatin interaction data: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref></sup>; annotate enhancer/promoter regions: E053-E082 brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref></sup>). We used default values for all other parameters.</p>
<p id="P30">For the detected genes, we performed lookups in the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog (version 2019-05-03) again to explore the previously reported associations with the same or other traits. We focused on traits including cognitive functions (such as general cognitive ability, cognitive performance, and empathy quotient), intelligence, educational attainment, math ability (such as highest math class taken and self-reported math ability), reaction time, neuroticism, neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease), and neuropsychiatric disorders (such as major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S15">
<title>Biological annotation and enrichment analyses.</title>
<p id="P31">For the 14 brain tissues (GTEx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup> v7), we performed gene property analysis via MAGMA. That is, for each candidate gene, we tested whether its tissue-specific expression levels can be linked to the strength of its association with ROI volumes. We also performed cell-type/tissue-specific chromatin-based annotation analysis using stratified LDSC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/bulik/ldsc/wiki/Cell-type-specific-analyses">https://github.com/bulik/ldsc/wiki/Cell-type-specific-analyses</ext-link>). The cell-type/tissue-specific annotations of DNase I hypersensitivity and activating histone marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K9ac and H3K36me3) were from the Roadmap Epigenomics consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref></sup> and the ENCODE project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref></sup>. For each annotation, we tested whether it had an enriched contribution to per-SNP heritability, conditional on the other annotations. DEPICT (version 1 rel194, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/perslab/depict">https://github.com/perslab/depict</ext-link>) and MAGMA gene set analyses were used to explore the implicated biological pathway by the UKB GWAS summary statistics. Specifically, DEPICT tested 10,968 reconstituted gene sets, and the GWAS summary statistics with <italic>P</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup> were used as input. The MAGMA gene set analysis examined 10,678 gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref></sup> (MSigDB, v6.2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb">http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb</ext-link>), including 4,761 curated gene sets and 5,917 Gene Ontology (GO) terms. All parameters in these analyses were set as default.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S16">
<title>Meta-analysis of GWAS results.</title>
<p id="P32">We meta-analyzed the UKB, PING, PNC, ADNI, and HCP GWAS summary results using METAL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/METAL">https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/METAL</ext-link>) with the sample-size weighted approach. Since the sample sizes of four other datasets were small, we removed the variants that were not presented in the UKB data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S17">
<title>Genetic correlation estimation with LDSC.</title>
<p id="P33">LD Hub (v1.9.1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/ldhub/">http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/ldhub/</ext-link>) was used to estimate the genetic correlation between several UKB ROIs volumes and their corresponding traits studied in the ENIGMA consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/">http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/</ext-link>). The LDSC software (v1.0.0, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/bulik/ldsc">https://github.com/bulik/ldsc</ext-link>) was then used to estimate the pairwise genetic correlation with 50 sets of collected GWAS summary statistics. In addition, for each ROI, we also examined the genetic correlation between its regional volumes collected in UKB phases 1 and 2. We used the pre-calculated LD scores provided by LDSC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/">https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/</ext-link>), which were computed using 1000 Genomes European data. We used HapMap3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref></sup> variants and removed all variants in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S18">
<title>Polygenic scoring.</title>
<p id="P34">Polygenic profiles were created to examine the out-of-sample prediction power of the GWAS results. Specifically, we used PLINK to generate risk scores in testing data by summarizing across variants, weighed by their effect sizes estimated from training data. To account for the LD structure, two procedures were used: (i) LD-based pruning (window size 50, step 5, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.2); and (ii) posterior effect size estimation under continuous shrinkage prior with an external LD reference panel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/getian107/PRScs">https://github.com/getian107/PRScs</ext-link>). We tried five <italic>P</italic>-value thresholds for predictor selection in each of the two procedures: 1, 0.5, 0.05, 5 × 10<sup>−4</sup> and 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>. Thus, ten polygenic profiles were generated for each ROI volume, and we reported the best prediction power that can be achieved by a single profile of the ten. The association between polygenic profile and phenotype was estimated and tested in linear regression model, adjusting for the effects of age and sex. The additional phenotypic variation that can be explained by polygenic profile (i.e., the incremental R-squared) was used to measure the prediction power.</p>
<p id="P35">For UKB dataset, we randomly divided the 19,629 UKB individuals into ten folds, then used nine of these folds as training data to rerun GWAS, and created polygenic profiles on the individuals in the remaining fold, which served as testing data. We repeated this procedure ten times such that each fold alternated to serve as the testing data for exactly one time. We examined seven ROIs including thalamus proper, caudate, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus, accumbens area, and TBV. For the first six ROIs, their volumes were the sum of volumes of the corresponding left and right ROIs. We then used these ROI-derived profiles to predict four brain-related traits: education (Data-Field: 845), reaction time (Data-Field: 20023), numeric memory (Data-Field: 4282), and fluid intelligence (Data-Field: 20016). We first assessed the cross-trait prediction ability of each profile, and then we selected the best profile for each ROI and put the seven profiles together in one model for multivariate analysis.</p>
<p id="P36">Next, we used the UKB GWAS results to perform prediction on ADNI, PING, PNC and HCP data for all 101 ROI volumes. The prediction accuracy was evaluated on all samples in the four testing sets (with phenotype and genetic data available), not limited to individuals of European ancestry used in GWAS.</p>
