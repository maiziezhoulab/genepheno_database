<abstract>
<p id="P2">Ectopic expression of defined transcription factors can force direct cell fate conversion from one lineage to another in the absence of cell division. Several transcription factor cocktails have enabled successful reprogramming of various somatic cell types into induced neurons (iNs) of distinct neurotransmitter phenotype. However, the nature of the intermediate states that drive the reprogramming trajectory towards distinct iN types is largely unknown. Here we show that successful direct reprogramming of adult human brain pericytes into functional iNs by Ascl1 and Sox2 (AS) encompasses transient activation of a neural stem cell-like gene expression program that precedes bifurcation into distinct neuronal lineages. Intriguingly, during this transient state key signaling components relevant for neural induction and neural stem cell maintenance are regulated and functionally contribute to iN reprogramming and maturation. Thus, AS-mediated reprogramming into a broad spectrum of iN types involves the unfolding of a developmental program via neural stem cell-like intermediates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">Direct lineage reprogramming is an emerging strategy to harness cellular plasticity of differentiated cells for lineage conversion into desired target cell types for disease modeling and tissue repair<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>. While direct lineage reprogramming from starting to target cell type classically occurs without cell division, thereby sharply contrasting reprogramming towards induced pluripotency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, little is known about the intermediate states that bridge the trajectory between start and end points. Two models have been proposed according to which direct reprogramming is mediated either through direct conversion between fully differentiated states or reversal to a developmentally immature state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>. Furthermore, reprogramming efficiency and final differentiation outcomes are highly cellular context-dependent, for which the underlying reasons are only incompletely understood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>. Analyses of the transcriptome alterations induced by the reprogramming factors has yielded fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms of iN conversion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. For instance, a single factor Ascl1 can reprogram mouse astrocytes into induced neurons (iN) with high efficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, while the same factor induces a muscle cell-like fate in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) alongside neuronal fates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>. Efficient reprogramming of MEFs into iNs requires co-expression of additional factors (e.g. Brn2, Ascl1, Myt1l; BAM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>. Moreover, Ascl1 induces a GABAergic neuron identity in mouse astrocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, while BAM-transduced fibroblasts predominantly adopt a glutamatergic phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, raising questions of how the respective reprogramming trajectories translate into distinct iN transmitter and subtype identities.</p>
<p id="P4">In the present study, by analyzing transcriptomes at population and single cell level we aimed at reconstructing the trajectories that underlie direct lineage conversion of adult human brain pericytes into induced neurons (iNs) by forced expression of Ascl1 and Sox2 (AS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>. This allowed us to scrutinize the contribution of the starting cell population heterogeneity to the variability in reprogramming success. By identifying cells of distinct reprogramming competence, we were able to reconstruct a trajectory of productive AS-mediated iN generation, allowing us to uncover intermediate states during successful conversion. Surprisingly, we found that despite the absence of cell division, cells in the productive trajectory passed through a neural stem cell-like state. Transiently induced genes, many of which are core components of signaling pathways, typified this intermediate state, and interference with these signaling pathways demonstrated their functional importance for the reprogramming process. Finally, the productive reprogramming trajectory revealed an unexpected point of bifurcation into lineages whose transcriptomes were dominated by transcription factor families involved in the specification of GABAergic and glutamatergic subclasses of forebrain neurons.</p>

<title>Ascl1 and Sox2 synergism in inducing neuronal gene expression in pericytes</title>
<p id="P5">We have recently shown that adult human brain pericytes can be reprogrammed into iNs via forced expression of the transcription factors Ascl1 and Sox2 (AS), and time-lapse imaging showed that this conversion occurs in the absence of cell division qualifying it as direct lineage reprogramming<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>. Given that adult human brain pericyte reprogramming into functional iNs requires co-expression of Sox2 alongside Ascl1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, we first addressed the contribution of each factor individually or in combination to the gene expression programs underlying pericyte-to-neuron conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). We performed RNA-seq of early-passage cultured human brain pericytes obtained from 3 different adult donors transduced with retroviruses encoding a reporter for control, <italic>Ascl1, Sox2</italic>, or <italic>Ascl1</italic> plus <italic>Sox2</italic> (AS) at early stages (2 days post infection (dpi) and 7 dpi) of reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Surprisingly, Sox2 only induced minor changes in gene expression, both at 2 and 7 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1a, e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In contrast, Ascl1 and AS substantially altered gene expression at both stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1a, e, f</xref>). Intriguingly, Ascl1 and AS changed the expression of distinct sets of genes. We noticed that several of the Ascl1-only altered genes are expressed in cells of the mesodermal lineage, indicative of a failure of crossing the lineage barrier towards neurogenesis. In sharp contrast, AS resulted in significant induction of genes related to neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1e, f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Moreover, we detected upregulation of several transcription factors and non-coding RNAs playing key roles in forebrain GABAergic neurogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1e, f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">2</xref>). Yet, we also observed a significant increase in <italic>NEUROG2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), which is associated with diverse excitatory neuron identities.</p>
<p id="P6">Comparison of the genes upregulated by Ascl1-only or AS with those transactivated by Ascl1 in mouse neural stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> revealed a progressive induction of direct Ascl1 neural stem cell target genes between dpi 2 and 7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). However, many of the direct Ascl1 neural stem cell target genes became induced only upon co-expression of Sox2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1c, d</xref>), indicating that the proposed on-target pioneer factor activity of Ascl1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> is highly context-dependent.</p>
<p id="P7">To further dissect the differences in the early gene expression programs induced by Ascl1 or AS, we measured 280 single cell transcriptomes of Ascl1- (146) and AS-expressing (134) cells by single-cell RNA-seq at dpi 2 and 7. Principal component analysis (PCA) followed by t-stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) of single cell transcriptomes revealed an early and progressive separation of Ascl1-only and AS-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Pericyte identity genes (e.g. <italic>PDGFRB, COL1A1, CAV1</italic>) became downregulated in Ascl1- and AS-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1g</xref>), but only the latter acquired a GABAergic neuron (iGN) fate signature (<italic>DLX1/2, DLX5/6, SATB1</italic> etc.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1h</xref>). In agreement with our bulk RNA-seq data and published data from MEF-to-neuron reprogramming<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> Ascl1-expressing cells induced myocyte differentiation genes (e.g. <italic>MUSTN1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1h</xref>). Occasionally individual AS cell transcriptomes clustered with those of Ascl1-only cells suggesting failed AS synergism as a potential mechanism underlying reprogramming failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Overall, these data demonstrate that Ascl1 alone is unable to induce a neuronal program in adult human brain pericytes but requires synergism with Sox2.</p>

<sec id="S4">
<title>Pericyte heterogeneity and reprogramming competence</title>
<p id="P8">To define the competence of adult human brain pericytes for AS-induced reprogramming, we next compared the transcriptomes of control pericytes with those of AS-transduced cells at early and later stages of reprogramming. To our surprise, t-SNE analysis revealed that control cells fell into two discernible clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2a, b</xref>), here referred to as group 1 and group 2 pericytes, with differentially enriched GO terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). While both groups highly expressed several classical pericyte genes (i.e., <italic>PDGFRB, CAV1, DCN</italic> etc.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>), other pericyte-associated genes such as <italic>ANGPT1</italic>, <italic>APOE</italic>, and <italic>LEPR</italic> were differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2a, b</xref>) and such differential expression could be confirmed on protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). Intriguingly, transcriptomes of AS-transduced cells exhibited distinct degrees of relatedness to the two pericyte starting populations, with cells undergoing successful reprogramming being more similar to group 2 pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d, e</xref>). This data strongly suggest that the two pericyte groups differ markedly in their response to AS. In fact, t-SNE analysis indicated that productive reprogramming towards neurogenesis originated specifically from group 2 pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, e</xref>). In contrast, group 1 pericytes appear to give rise to a distinct population positive for the hypothalamic neuronal marker PMCH but lacking expression of other neuronal genes which thus precluded identifying these cells as hypothalamic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Besides AS-transduced cells clustering differentially with group 1 and group 2 pericytes, we observed two smaller clusters of AS-transduced cells enriched in genes involved in cell cycle progression (e.g. <italic>MKI67</italic>) and potentially an alternative fate marked by the expression of <italic>POU2F3</italic>. To independently corroborate differential neurogenic competence of group 1 and group 2 pericytes we FACS-purified these populations via antibodies specific to leptin receptor, encoded by the <italic>LEPR</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f, g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). Consistent with the observation that iNs may originate from group 2 pericytes, we found that leptin receptor-negative cells are more prone to undergo AS-induced neurogenesis than leptin receptor-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). This data provide experimental evidence that the two pericyte starter populations display distinct degrees of reprogramming competence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Transient activation of a neural stem cell-like program</title>
<p id="P9">We next reconstructed the transcriptome trajectory of reprogramming-competent pericytes into iNs by pseudotemporal ordering<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Genes that mark pericyte identity such as <italic>PDGFRB</italic>, <italic>CAV1</italic>, and <italic>CFH</italic> became gradually downregulated. Conversely, genes associated with the acquisition of a neuronal fate were progressively upregulated with more linear (e.g. <italic>CHD7</italic>, <italic>DLX5</italic>) or non-linear dynamics (<italic>SNAP25</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b, c</xref>), possibly reflecting distinct gene expression waves during early and later phases of neuronal differentiation. Most intriguingly, we identified a set of genes, which became upregulated early during the reprogramming process, but then declined again as neuronal differentiation progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b, c</xref>). We refer to these genes as switch genes. These include genes involved in the regulation of cell signaling such as <italic>NOG</italic>, <italic>LEFTY2</italic>, <italic>DKK1</italic>, and <italic>NOTCH2</italic> suggesting that modulation of signaling pathways is important during early phases of productive reprogramming (see below). The conspicuous dynamics of the regulation of these genes urged us to interrogate their expression during mouse embryonic development. Intriguingly, the switch genes were markedly enriched in the germinal zones of the developing CNS containing the neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). This strongly suggests that cells undergoing productive reprogramming by AS transiently acquire a neural stem cell-like state. This was further corroborated when analyzing the expression levels of these genes in human fetal brain tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> with higher levels of expression being found in distinct human neural stem cells (i.e. apical radial glia, aRG and basal radial glia, bRG) as compared to neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Consistent with the upregulation of the switch genes during successful reprogramming, mapping the switch gene signature onto the tSNE plot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> revealed its specific occurrence in the cell population that connects productive group 2 pericytes with iNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). In contrast, the switch gene signature was absent from transcriptomes of AS-transduced cells in the immediate neighborhood of group 1 pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>), indicating that acquisition of a neural stem cell like-state is critical for AS-mediated pericyte-to-iN reprogramming. Of note, mapping the same switch gene signature onto previously published single cell transcriptomes undergoing MEF-to-iN reprogramming<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> revealed a surprisingly high base level of switch gene expression in the MEF starting population, and its expression did not increase at any stage along the MEF-to-neuron axis but was found to be strongly decreased in neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). These data are indicative of fundamental differences in the reprogramming trajectories of these two distinct reprogramming paradigms. Intriguingly, time-lapse imaging of pericytes during AS reprogramming revealed the occurrence of different cellular morphologies: while at early phases of reprogramming cells displayed a flat fibroblast-like morphology, at subsequent phases processes undergoing dynamic turn-over akin to multipolar progenitors appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). Finally, at the end of the reprogramming process, neuron-like cells dramatically decreased their motility and protruded processes of increased stability. Thus, the cellular behavior and morphology are consistent with the notion of distinct cellular states underlying the reprogramming of pericytes into iNs.</p>

<sec id="S6">
<title>Modulation of signaling pathways</title>
<p id="P10">The conspicuous regulation of several components of signaling pathways, well known to play key roles during neural induction and neural stem cell maintenance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, such as of the BMP inhibitor <italic>NOG</italic>, the ACTIVIN/NODAL inhibitor <italic>LEFTY2</italic>, as well as <italic>NOTCH2</italic> and its downstream targets <italic>HEY1</italic> and <italic>ID1</italic>, prompted us to investigate whether these pathways are of functional importance for successful reprogramming. To test the importance of modulation of NODAL and BMP signaling, we treated pericytes during early phases of reprogramming with recombinant NODAL (1 μg/ml) and BMP4 (30 ng/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, b</xref>). These treatments resulted in a significant reduction of reprogramming as determined by the number of TUBB3-positive cells amongst AS-transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Conversely, inhibition of BMP, ACTIVIN/NODAL, and TGF-β signaling via the small molecules Dorsomorphin (1 μM) and SB431542 (10 μM) caused a 3-fold increase in the number of reprogrammed iNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d, e</xref>). To address the relevance of NOTCH signaling in the reprogramming process we treated AS-transduced pericytes with the γ-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT). DAPT treatment (10 μM) resulted in a marked increase in the number of iNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d, e</xref>). This finding is consistent with the role of Notch signaling in inhibition of neurogenesis and neural stem cell maintenance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>.</p>
<p id="P11">Though AS induction leads to productive iN reprogramming, we observed that maturation seems to stall at dpi 14, either because cells at later time points failed to mature further or because of a technical bias against harvesting healthy iNs at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Our data showed that productive reprogramming involves inhibition of BMP signaling, and blocking BMP signaling appeared to promote maturation as suggested by an increased morphological iN complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). We therefore analyzed the effect of the BMP inhibitor Dorsomorphin during early phases of the reprogramming process on subsequent neuronal maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Dorsomorphin-treated AS-induced neurons exhibited a markedly increased morphological complexity and soma size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>), as well as increased membrane capacitance and decreased membrane resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). scRNA-seq on Dorsomorphin-treated AS-induced neurons revealed that genes associated with synapse formation and synaptic function showed increased expression relative to untreated AS transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). In line with enhanced iN maturation we also noted enhanced GABA and PVALB immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>

<title>Bifurcation into distinct iN lineages</title>
<p id="P12">This data urged us to have a closer look at the neuronal subtype specification induced by AS with or without Dorsomorphin (ASD). We focused on iNs that expressed both <italic>SNAP25</italic> and <italic>MAP2</italic> and analyzed 20 AS and 72 ASD cells. The majority of AS and ASD iNs exhibited a forebrain GABAergic interneuron program characterized by coordinated expression of multiple members of the <italic>DLX</italic> gene family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). Intriguingly we found evidence for further sub-specification among the <italic>DLX</italic>-expressing iNs. We observed distinct clusters of <italic>VIP</italic>-expressing neurons some of which also co-expressed <italic>CCK</italic>. Likewise we noted two clusters expressing specifically <italic>SST</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13">However, we also noted a subset of iNs that expressed a transcription factor of the glutamatergic lineage, <italic>NEUROG2</italic>. Intriguingly, these iNs also expressed downstream targets <italic>NEUROD1</italic> and <italic>NEUROD4</italic>, consistent with the expression of a telencephalic glutamatergic neuron program<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>. The fact that this subset also expressed RELN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>) may indicate that these iNs acquire a Cajal-Retzius neuron-like program. It is noteworthy that while the majority of <italic>DLX1</italic>-expressing cells were <italic>NEUROG2</italic> negative and many high <italic>NEUROG2</italic>-expressing cells were <italic>DLX1</italic> negative, we observed some outliers expressing both genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4d</xref>). This may reflect the possibility that the definitive decision between the two major neuron lineages (GABA versus glutamate) had not yet taken place in these cells. To reveal the developmental trajectory towards a <italic>DLX</italic>- or <italic>NEUROG2-</italic>dominated fate, we employed pseudotemporal ordering of the transcriptomes of AS cells of the productive path and d14 ASD cells. Intriguingly, we observed a bifurcation of the trajectory into a <italic>DLX</italic>- and <italic>NEUROG2</italic>-dominated path, which preceded neuronal differentiation marked by <italic>SNAP25</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4e</xref>). Projecting the switch gene signature identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> onto the reprogramming path revealed that the transient expression of neural stem cell-like genes occurs and ceases prior to lineage bifurcation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>). Consistent with the increased maturation of ASD cells, the distribution of ASD transcriptomes was shifted farther along the trajectory of pericyte-to-iN reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i</xref>). We corroborated the emergence of <italic>DLX</italic>- or <italic>NEUROG2</italic>-expressing inhibitory and excitatory neuronal lineages using an alternative scRNA-seq method and a second pericyte donor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14">To test whether NEUROG2 indeed suffices to induce a glutamatergic phenotype we overexpressed <italic>NEUROG2</italic> alongside AS (ASN) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 4f</xref>). NEUROG2 overexpression resulted in the almost complete suppression of <italic>DLX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5j</xref>), suggesting that NEUROG2 can divert iNs from adopting predominantly a GABAergic phenotype towards generating mostly glutamatergic neurons.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P15">In the present study, we have shown that reprogramming success of adult human brain pericytes into iNs by the transcription factors Ascl1 and Sox2 (AS) critically depends on cellular context as revealed by the observation that pericyte heterogeneity is a key determinant for reprogramming competence. Successful reprogramming by AS encompasses the passage through a neural stem cell-like intermediate state, yet it occurs in the absence of cell division. Moreover, regulation of signaling pathways during the neural stem cell-like state was of functional importance for the reprogramming outcome. This data indicates that AS-mediated reprogramming involves the unfolding of developmental programs and argues for the engagement of hierarchical developmental gene regulatory networks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> rather than direct interconversion between two states of terminal differentiation. Finally, we found that following the transition through a neural stem cell-like state the reprogramming trajectory eventually bifurcates to give rise to two distinct branches characterized by <italic>DLX</italic>- and <italic>NEUROG</italic>-dominated gene expression and indicative of bifurcation into GABAergic and glutamatergic lineages. This provides a mechanistic explanation for the common observation that one and the same reprogramming cocktail can yield neurons of distinct neurotransmitter phenotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>.</p>
<p id="P16">We observed that reprogramming competence of adult human brain pericytes is highly variable and a main source for this variability is pericyte heterogeneity. Heterogeneity of pericytes has been described in many tissues and may reflect distinct embryonic origins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>. Our scRNA-seq experiments revealed two distinct populations, of which one, characterized by high <italic>LEPR</italic> expression, displayed markedly reduced reprogramming propensity. Intriguingly, using scRNA-seq a recent study showed that several of the heterogeneously expressed genes are also expressed at highly variable levels in acutely isolated human midbrain pericytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, which might indicate that similar heterogeneity occurs in vivo. However, our study may actually underestimate overall pericyte heterogeneity, as we included in our scRNA-seq analysis only retrovirus-transduced cells, for which ongoing cell division at the time of transduction is required. We would also expect that proliferative pericytes do not perfectly match pericytes under resting conditions, but may be more akin to those found to undergo cell division in response to severe CNS injury<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>.</p>
<p id="P17">Revealing the cell context requirements for reprogramming is of greatest importance if direct lineage reprogramming is to be of therapeutic value. Many reprogramming factor cocktails that work well with mouse cells (e.g. MEFs) are rather inefficient with human cells, and in particular, when of adult tissue origin. It will be therefore a fruitful field of investigation to identify besides transcriptome differences, also disparities in the epigenome between the two subpopulations of pericytes identified here. This may yield potential molecular targets for improved reprogramming strategies that may apply to other adult human somatic cell types.</p>
<p id="P18">A key finding of our study is the observation that AS transduced cells pass through a neural stem cell-like state prior to differentiating into iNs. This neural stem cell-like state is characterized by expression of a battery of genes that are normally expressed in neural stem or progenitor cells during forebrain embryonic development, to which we referred here as switch genes as they are dynamically regulated during the reprogramming process. While referring to the state characterized by switch gene expression to a neural stem cell-like state, we do not equate it to a bona fide neural stem cell state. This distinction is warranted given the absence of classical markers of neural stem cells such as <italic>MSI1</italic> (Musashi) or <italic>NES</italic> (Nestin) during the switch state, some anomalies in gene regulation such as <italic>DLX5</italic> preceding <italic>DLX1</italic> expression in time, and above all the absence of cell division and of a transcriptomic signature of an active cell cycle. We hypothesize that genes induced during the switch state represent a neural stem cell gene expression module specifically regulated by Ascl1 and Sox2, and other transcription factors may be required for inducing other neural stem cell markers. Importantly, the AS-induced neural stem cell expression module appears to be sufficient to drive the trajectory towards neuronal differentiation.</p>
<p id="P19">Switch genes include components of several signaling pathways such as the ACTIVIN/NODAL (<italic>LEFTY2</italic>), BMP (<italic>NOG</italic>), and NOTCH (<italic>HES5, HEY1, ID1, NOTCH2</italic>) signaling pathways. By activating or inhibiting the ACTIVIN/NODAL and BMP pathways during the early phase of reprogramming through recombinant ligands or pharmacologically, we could show that these pathways exert an important influence on reprogramming efficiency. The fact that inhibition of ACTIVIN/NODAL and BMP signaling is required for reprogramming is consistent with the fact that inhibition of these pathways is important for neural induction during embryonic development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, can be utilized for driving human pluripotent stem cells towards neural lineages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, and enhances transcription factor-mediated reprogramming<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>. Most intriguingly, we found that inhibition of NOTCH signaling promoted reprogramming. This is consistent with the role of NOTCH signaling in preventing neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>. The conspicuous induction of the NOTCH ligand <italic>DLL1</italic> during reprogramming suggests that <italic>DLL1</italic>-expressing cells exert a differentiation inhibitory effect on other AS-transduced cells, an inhibition, which can be relieved pharmacologically. Intriguingly, iNs appear to express Myt1, which has recently reported to be induced cell-autonomously by Ascl1 and to repress Notch signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>. Likewise, its close relative Myt1l, a widely used component of the BAM reprogramming cocktail has been shown to repress Notch signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. This suggests that the BAM cocktail exhibits similarities to AS’ mechanism of reprogramming, however that the addition of the postmitotic repressor Myt1l serves to curtail molecular pathways of the switch state that keep neuronal differentiation in check.</p>
<p id="P20">Another intriguing aspect of <italic>NOTCH2</italic> expression during reprogramming is the fact that Notch2, has been recently described to repress cell cycle-related genes and drive neural stem cells to quiescence, which may account in part for the lack of cell division during the switch state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>.</p>
<p id="P21">Surprisingly, we found that human brain pericytes reprogrammed by AS undergo bifurcation into lineages dominated by transcription factors that specify inhibitory and excitatory neuron fates. This bifurcation was corroborated using two distinct scRNA-seq platforms (Fluidgm C1, 10x Genomics). While the <italic>DLX</italic> gene family dominated branch was enriched for genes characteristic for the GABAergic neuron lineage (e.g. <italic>GAD1, GAD2</italic>), the <italic>NEUROG</italic>-expressing branch expressed other transcription factors of the glutamatergic neuron lineage such as <italic>NEUROD1</italic> and <italic>NEUROD4</italic>. Moreover, cells of the latter lineage also expressed <italic>RELN,</italic> suggesting similarities to Cajal-Retzius subtype of glutamatergic neurons. The fact that forced expression of <italic>Neurog2</italic> in AS-transduced pericytes suppresses <italic>DLX</italic> gene expression may indicate that lineage bifurcation is driven by mutual cross-repression of <italic>NEUROG</italic> and <italic>DLX</italic> family genes. Our data raise the intriguing possibility that the bi-potent neural stem cell-like state observed during AS reprogramming relates to the suggested common precursor generating both, glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the cerebral cortex of human and non-human primates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>.</p>
<p id="P22">Overall, our study not only provides new insights into the biology underlying iN reprogramming, but also sheds light on the capacity of two transcription factors Ascl1 and Sox2 to cooperate in the generation of diverse neuronal subtypes, a cooperation that may be relevant during human brain development. The identification of the molecular programs that establish cellular intermediates and lineage bifurcations during iN reprogramming provides handles to improve lineage conversion of human brain-resident cells towards therapeutically relevant cell types.</p>

The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.4 (NaOH); the osmolarity ranged between 309 to 313 mOsmol. All recordings were performed at room temperature (23 – 24°C). The electrodes for whole cell patch-clamp recordings were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (OD: 1.5 mm, ID: 0.86 mm, Hugo Sachs Elektronik-Harvard Apparatus) and filled with a solution composed of (in mM): potassium gluconate 135, KCl 4, NaCl 2, ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) 0.2, HEPES (potassium salt) 10, adenosine-triphosphate (magnesium salt, ATP[Mg]) 4, sodium guanosine-triphosphate (NaGTP) 0.5, and phosphocreatine 10 (pH: 7.25 – 7.30, osmolarity: 288 – 291 mOsmol). The electrodes (resistance: 5 – 7 MΩ) were connected to the headstage of a npi ELC-03XS amplifier (npi, Tamm, Germany). In order to visualize the cultured cells, the microscope was equipped with differential interference contrast (DIC) optics and with epifluorescence optics for green and red fluorescence (filter sets: Zeiss BP450-490, LP520, Zeiss BP546/12, lP590). Images were taken and displayed using a software-operated CCD microscope camera (ORCA R, Hamamatsu, Germany). Following membrane rupture, the cells were voltage-clamped to a holding potential of -60 mV and kept under this condition until stabilization of the holding current was achieved (3 – 5 min). Then the amplifier was switched to the current-clamp mode. The recorded signals were amplified (x10), filtered at 10 or 20 kHz (current clamp) and 5 kHz (voltage clamp), digitized at a sampling rate of 10 or 20 kHz and stored on a computer for off-line analysis. Data acquisition and generation of command pulses was done by means of a CED 1401 Micro 3 system in conjunction with Signal6 data acquisition software (Cambridge electronic design).

Determination of the input resistance RN was performed by measurement of the amplitude of a voltage deviation induced by a small hyperpolarizing current pulse (1 s, 2 – 10 pA). The total membrane capacity CN was estimated using a method described by (Zemankovics et al., 2010). The ability of the cells to generate action potentials was tested by injecting depolarizing current pulses (50 ms) with increasing current strengths (ΔI: 2 - 10 pA) or by depolarizing current ramps (50 ms) from 0 – 100 pA.

<title>Capturing of single cells and preparation of cDNA</title>
<p id="P36">Transduced human brain pericytes were sorted using FACS and single cells were captured on a medium-sized (10–17 μ m cell diameter) microfluidic RNA-seq chip using the Fluidigm C1 system. Cells were loaded onto the chip at a concentration of 350–500 cells per μl and imaged by phase-contrast to assess number of cells per capture site. Only single cells were included in the analysis. cDNAs were prepared on chip using the SMARTer v4 Ultra Input Low RNA kit for Illumina (Clontech).</p>

<title>RNA-seq library construction and cDNA sequencing</title>
<p id="P37">Size distribution and concentration of single-cell cDNA was assessed on a capillary electrophoresis based fragment analyser (Advanced Analytical Technologies) and only single cells with high quality cDNA were further processed. Sequencing libraries were constructed in 96-well plates using the Illumina Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit using primer sets A and B according to the protocol supplied by Fluidigm and as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>. Libraries were quantified by Agilent Bioanalyzer using High Sensitivity DNA analysis kit as well as fluorometrically using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kits and a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Up to 192 single-cell libraries were pooled and sequenced 100 bp paired-end on one lane of Illumina HiSeq 2500 to a depth of at least 500,000 reads per cell. Basecalling, adaptor trimming, and de-multiplexing was performed as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>. The transcriptome of a total of 769 cells was measured from the following 12 independent experiments: d2 control (76 cells, 1 experiment), d2 Ascl1-only (82 cells, 1 experiment, d7 Ascl1-only (64 cells, 1 experiment), d2 AS (86 cells, 1 experiment), d7 AS (48 cells, 1 experiment), d14 AS (79 cells, 2 experiments), d21/22 AS (130 cells, 2 experiments), d14 ASD (183 cells, 2 experiments), d14 ASN (21 cells, 1 experiment).

We excluded cells that had less than 100,000 reads, did not express &gt; 1000 genes, or did not express either of two housekeeping genes <italic>ACTB</italic> and <italic>GAPDH</italic>. Transcript levels were converted to the log-space by taking the log2 (FPKM). R studio (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rstudio.com/">https://www.rstudio.com/</ext-link>) was used to run custom R scripts to perform principal component analysis (PCA, FactoMineR package), hierarchical clustering (stats package) and to construct heatmaps, correlation plots, scatter plots, violin plots, dendrograms, bar graphs, and histograms. Generally, ggplot2 and gplots packages were used to generate data graphs. The Seurat package implemented in R was used to identify cell clusters and perform differential gene expression based on tSNE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>. The Monocle2 package<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> was used to analyze cell lineage relationships. Covariance network analysis and visualizations were done using igraph implemented in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://igraph.org/redirect.html">http://igraph.sf.net</ext-link>). Signatures were calculated by summing the log2 FPKM expression values of each gene in a set of genes comprising a signature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Table 6</xref>)</p>

<title>10x Genomics scRNA-seq experiment</title>
<p id="P39">For the 10X Genomics experiment, cells were transfected with AS, treated with Dorsomorphin, and analyzed at 14 dpi. Cells were sorted based on the expression of GFP and used for 1 encapsulation. 10X Genomics sample libraries were sequenced on on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 and base-calling, adaptor trimming, and de-multiplexing of single cells were performed using 10X Genomics Cell Ranger 2.0 software. We performed PCA and tSNE analyses using the Seurat v2.0 package for R on 3,419 single cells with 1,000 – 7,000 genes detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). We used genes correlating and anti-correlating with the first 8 principal components to cluster the cells, and found that clustering patterns were robust across multiple PC inclusions. Neuronal cluster specific markers were found using Seurat’s implementation of the ‘bimod’ likelihood-ratio test for single cell gene expression data and the top genes were selected based on the average log fold change.</p>

Nuclei are stained with Dapi. Scale bar = 50 µm. <bold>c,</bold> Bulk RNA-seq with pericytes derived from three individual donors was performed at 2 and 7 dpi with Ascl1-only, Sox2-only, or Ascl1 + Sox2 (AS). Bar graph shows the number of differentially expressed (DE) genes (padj &lt; 0.01; calculated according to Benjamini-Hochberg) in each condition compared to pericytes transduced with a control vector. The Euler diagram shows the overlap of the DE genes at 7 dpi. Note that the majority of the DE genes results from AS synergism. <bold>d,</bold> Heatmaps show normalized expression (Z-score) of representative DE genes highlighting the induction of mesodermal, neurogenesis-related, and GABAergic signature genes at both 2 and 7 dpi. <bold>e,</bold> ScRNA-seq was performed 2 and 7 dpi on cells transduced with Ascl1-only (2 dpi 82 cells; 7 dpi 64 cells) and AS (2 dpi 86 cells; 7 dpi 48 cells). PCA (calculated on a total of 280 cells) followed by tSNE shows that the pericyte signature is diminished in many d7 Ascl1-only and strongly diminished in the majority of d7 AS cells, concomitant with the acquisition of a mesoderm and iGN signature in Ascl1-only and AS-cells, respectively. Signatures were calculated by summing the expression of the fate-determinants highlighted in panels d (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). <bold>f,</bold> The iGN signature is plotted for all Ascl1-only and AS cells relative to the pericyte signature.</p>

<title>Pericyte heterogeneity correlates with distinct reprogramming competence.</title>
<p><bold>a,</bold> PCA (total of 419 cells) followed by tSNE reveals heterogeneity during iN reprogramming, with genes marking distinct clusters colored on the adjacent tSNE plots. Control-transduced pericytes (green) segregate into two distinct clusters. One cluster links to cells that express iN fate determinants (productive), whereas the other cluster is unlinked to iN reprogramming (unproductive). Cells expressing <italic>MKI67</italic> and other hallmarks of cycling cells are observed, as well as a group of cells expressing <italic>POU2F3</italic>. <bold>b,</bold> Heatmap shows the expression of genes that correlate with PC1 from PCA on control-pericytes only. Hierarchical clustering reveals two distinct groups of pericytes with selected genes indicated below the heatmap. <bold>c,</bold> Micrographs showing cultured human brain pericytes stained against pan-pericyte marker PDGFRB (left panel). Right panel shows the same field of view of cultured human brain pericytes stained against pericyte group 1 marker ITGA6 and pericyte group 2 marker CD4. Nuclei are stained with Dapi (n = 3 individual pericyte donors; two independent experiments). Scale bar = 50 µm. <bold>d,</bold> Cells from the productive reprogramming cluster in Fig. 2a have a higher similarity to group 2 pericytes while cells from the unproductive reprogramming clusters have a higher similarity to group 1 pericytes. <bold>e,</bold> Lineage network based on pairwise correlations between cells suggests that group 2 pericytes (lighter green population) are more competent to contribute to productive iN reprogramming. <bold>f,</bold> Violin blots show the density distribution of RNA expression of <italic>LEPR</italic> in pericyte groups 1 (31 cells) and 2 (44 cells) (upper panel). Representative flow cytometry plots show the protein expression of LEPR in cultured human brain pericytes (lower panel; 4 independent experiments). <bold>g,</bold> Human brain pericytes were sorted based on LEPR expression (group 1 marker), plated and transduced with AS to induce lineage conversion. Micrographs show AS-transduced pericytes at 35 dpi, with inset showing higher magnification of reprogrammed pericytes that acquired neuronal morphology and GABA immunoreactivity (n = 4). Nuclei are stained with Dapi. Scale bars = 50 µm. <bold>h,</bold> Quantification of reprogramming efficiency (dots represent independent individual experiments; n = 4; data are represented as boxplots with whiskers; two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test; <italic>P</italic> = 0,000593; ***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; boxplots show median, quartiles (box), and range (whiskers)) reveals that the LepR-negative pericyte subpopulation is more competent to iN reprograming using AS, confirming predictions from scRNA-seq.</p>

<p><bold>a,</bold> PCA was performed on 211 single cell transcriptomes from the productive reprogramming cluster from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>. Monocle2 was used to infer a pseudotemporal ordering of cells. <bold>b,</bold> Scaled expression of representative marker genes in all 211 cells of the productive reprogramming path shown as a function of pseudotime. Shaded gray represents 0.95 confidence interval. <bold>c,</bold> Heatmap shows the expression of genes identified by PCA and ordered by hierarchical clustering. Cells are ordered according to pseudotime. The reprogramming path is characterized by three phases of gene expression changes. In the first phase, genes associated with pericyte identity are down-regulated concomitant with a transient upregulation of switch genes (e.g. <italic>NOG, DKK1</italic>). In a second phase, genes associated with iN fate determination are upregulated (e.g. <italic>DLX5</italic>). In a third phase, neuron maturation factors (e.g. <italic>DLX1, SNAP25</italic>) are upregulated alongside phase 2 genes. <bold>d,</bold> Chart shows fraction of pericyte, switch, and neuronal genes (from panel c) expressed in bloodvessels/meninges, ventricular zones, or neuron compartments determined from in situ patterns in the developing mouse brain. <bold>e,</bold> Violin plots show the density distribution of the switch gene signature from scRNA-seq of fetal human cortex (dots within the violins represent medians). Cortex cells are grouped based on cell type (41 cells apical progenitor, AP; 19 cells basal progenitor, BP; 42 cells early-born neurons, Neuron). <bold>f,</bold> Switch gene signature projected onto tSNE plot from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> shows the induction of switch genes at an intermediate stage exclusively within the productive reprogramming path. <bold>g,</bold> Time-lapse imaging of AS-transduced cells over time (three independent experiments) shows the morphological changes during successful pericyte-to-neuron reprogramming (time points are specified within the pictures). Arrows indicate a successfully reprogrammed pericyte throughout the different morphological changes mentioned below the images. Scale bar = 50 µm.</p>

Reprogramming efficiency was calculated by quantifying TUBB3-immunoreactive cells out of reporter-positive transduced cells 3-5 weeks following transduction with AS. The fold change was calculated by determining the ratio of growth factor treated versus non treated TUBB3+ and reporter+ per total reporter+ cells of the transduced pericytes (dots represent independent individual experiments; untreated, n = 9; NODAL, n = 4; BMP, n = 3; data are represented as boxplots with whiskers; two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test; <italic>P</italic> = 0.01202 for NODAL; <italic>P</italic> = 0.01821 for BMP4; *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; boxplots show median, quartiles (box), and range (whiskers)). <bold>d,</bold> Reprogramming efficiencies (TUBB3+ and reporter+ per total reporter+) are increased following enhancing treatments with Dorsomorphin (Dorso) + SB431542 (SB) or DAPT. The fold change was calculated by determining the ratio of small molecule treated versus non treated TUBB3+ and reporter+ per total reporter+ cells of the transduced pericytes (dots represent independent individual experiments; untreated, n = 9; Dorso + SB, n = 4; DAPT, n = 7; data are represented as boxplots with whiskers; two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02133 for Dorso + SB; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0050 for DAPT; *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, boxplots show median, quartiles (box), and range (whiskers)). <bold>e,</bold> Representative micrographs of AS-transduced pericyte cultures (green) and stained with an antibody against TUBB3 (magenta).

<p><bold>a,</bold> Schematical overview of experiments in this figure. <bold>b,</bold> Representative examples of untreated and Dorsomorphin-treated AS-transduced pericytes showing complex branching of dendritic arbors in Dorsomorphin-treated cells. Neuronal morphology was reconstructed using TUBB3 immunoreactivity and used for Sholl analyses. In the Sholl mask (right panels) warmer hues indicate higher number of intersections (untreated, n = 14 cells of 3 independent experiments; Dorsomorphin-treated, n = 14 cells of 3 independent experiments). <bold>c,</bold> Single cell neuromorphology reconstruction by Sholl analysis on Dorsomorphin treated AS-transduced cells was compared to untreated cells. Note the increase in complexity of Dorsomorphin-treated cells with higher number of intersections with concentric shells and overall increase in the length of the dendrites (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>).
