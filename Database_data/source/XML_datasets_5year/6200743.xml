<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Kv1.2 is a prominent voltage-gated potassium channel in the central nervous system, where it influences cellular excitability and action potential propagation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. As the first eukaryotic voltage-gated channel with a reported atomic resolution structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, it has been used as a template for understanding and investigating fundamental details of voltage-dependent regulation of ion channels. Genetic manipulation of Kv1.2 also illustrates important subtype-specific roles for Kv channels in the CNS. Early mouse knockout models showed a particular requirement for Kv1.2 among the Kv1 subfamily, as Kv1.2 knockout mice fail to survive beyond 3 weeks of life due to severe generalized seizures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. More mildly perturbative mutations of Kv1.2 have been linked to an ataxic phenotype in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The advent of next-generation sequencing has accelerated the correlation of genetic mutations with rare phenotypes, and several Kv1.2 mutations have been identified in patients with severe epilepsies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Molecular phenotyping of these genetic defects in heterologous systems yields basic information that may partly inform the link between the mutation and the disease, but these interpretations lack a more complete understanding of interactions between channels and extrinsic regulators, such as accessory proteins. Although our study focuses on Kv1.2, this shortcoming is likely true for many investigations of disease-linked ion channel or neurotransmitter receptor mutations.</p>
<p id="Par4">The canonical accessory proteins for Kv1.2 and other Kv1 subtypes are Kvβ subunits, which promote cell surface maturation and (in some cases) inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Kv1.2 subunits also bind to cytoskeletal anchors, including cortactin, in a tyrosine phosphorylation dependent manner that influences Kv1.2 endocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The sigma-1 receptor is another associated protein of Kv1.2, reported to assemble with Kv1.2 and promote trafficking to the cell membrane in response to cocaine exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Certain lipids, including phosphatidic acid, can alter the voltage-dependence of Kv1.2 activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This list of interactors is likely incomplete. For instance, several reports have described a poorly understood dynamic regulation in heterologous systems and primary dissociated neurons, generating wide cell-to-cell variability of Kv1.2 gating that likely depends on extrinsic regulatory mechanisms (not directly encoded by the primary sequence of the channel)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Despite the variety of extrinsic factors reported to regulate Kv1.2 channel gating, none of these binding partners account for the dramatic moment-to-moment alteration of Kv1.2 activity that has been observed. Therefore, there are likely other interacting proteins and molecules with significant effects on channel gating, which have not yet been discovered.</p>
<p id="Par5">In this study, we investigate the potential assembly of Kv1.2 with previously unrecognized accessory proteins. We use a mass spectrometry approach to identify candidate genes, followed by screening of their effects on Kv1.2. We report that Slc7a5, a neutral amino acid transporter, associates with Kv1.2 channels and dramatically alters gating and expression. Several aspects of this putative regulatory complex stand out. Slc7a5 mutations have been linked to recessively inherited neurodevelopmental delay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and while this has been attributed to its role as an amino acid transporter, the pleiotropy we report suggests additional mechanisms that could also contribute to severe neurological phenotypes. Second, the assembly of an ion channel and transporter is part of an emerging trend of functional interactions between complex transmembrane proteins (channels, transporters, GPCRs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Third, the gating effects of Slc7a5 are more dramatic than any previously reported accessory subunit of Kv1 channels, and we also describe a mechanism of current suppression involving compounded effects of accelerated inactivation and a pronounced hyperpolarizing shift of channel activation. Finally, we report that gain-of-function Kv1.2 mutations identified in patients with severe human epilepsy are particularly susceptible to suppression by Slc7a5, and this may underlie the paradoxical observation that both gain- and loss-of-function Kv1.2 mutations lead to severe epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Identification of Kv1.2-associated proteins</title>
<p id="Par6">We have previously reported marked variability of Kv1.2 gating parameters in commonly used expression systems, suggesting these channels are subject to unrecognized regulatory mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. To identify interacting proteins, we used 1D4 affinity purification of cross-linked channel complexes, followed by quantitative LC–MS/MS mass spectrometry. Cross-linking and mass spectrometry was done using a hybrid channel (Kv1.5N/Kv1.2[S371T]) to enhance cell surface maturation in HEK293 cells, followed by functional validation using wild-type Kv1.2 (rat). Several previously reported Kv1.2 regulatory proteins appeared in the screen (data supplement), including several phosphatases and kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Based on criteria including abundance relative to pulldowns from untransfected cells, and cross-referencing against the CRAPome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> we selected 30 candidate proteins for further screening by electrophysiology in <italic>ltk-</italic> fibroblasts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>, a full list of proteins identified has been deposited online, see Data Availability statement). Our previous study highlighted a prominent effect of redox conditions on Kv1.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, so we also purified protein in either ambient redox or reducing conditions, and prioritized abundant proteins previously identified to contain labile extracellular disulfide bonds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Electrophysiology recordings were performed in ambient redox conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b, c</xref>) and we measured the half-activation voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>1/2</sub>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>) and current density (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). Most proteins tested had little or no discernible impact on Kv1.2 electrical function, although we cannot rule out that they may affect Kv1.2 under other experimental conditions. The neutral amino acid transporter Slc7a5 (LAT1) had the most pronounced impact on Kv1.2, greatly reducing Kv1.2 currents and shifting the conductance-voltage relationship by approximately −40 mV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b, c</xref>) in our initial screen.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Mass spectrometry and screening of Kv1.2 channel complexes.

<title>Suppression of Kv1.2 currents by Slc7a5</title>
<p id="Par7">We further explored the effects of Slc7a5 on Kv1.2 using electrophysiology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>) and western blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b–d</xref>). Co-expression of Kv1.2 and Slc7a5 (2:1 transfection ratio) markedly decreased Kv1.2 current density, recapitulating our initial screen (using a holding potential of −80 mV, and a voltage step to +60 mV). We also tested Slc3a2, which also appeared with high abundance in the screen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>) and can form a heterodimer with Slc7a5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Slc3a2 and Slc7a5 peptides were both enriched in Kv1.2 cross-linked complexes, but Slc7a5 was not well identified by mass spectrometry (2 peptides, small sequence coverage), likely because it is primarily composed of transmembrane segments. Co-expression with Slc3a2 alone did not affect Kv1.2 current density. The combination of Kv1.2, Slc3a2, and Slc7a5 (2:2:1 transfection ratio) partially rescued the Slc7a5-mediated suppression of Kv1.2 currents (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). These experimental conditions were chosen to highlight the broad range of regulation that is possible with various combinations of Kv1.2, Slc7a5, and Slc3a2. Although, we have not examined this in detail, our preliminary exploration demonstrated that co-transfection with larger amounts of Slc7a5 (e.g., a 1:1 ratio with Kv1.2) caused less prominent rescue by Slc3a2. Overall, these data suggest that Kv1.2 function is influenced by the relative amounts of Slc7a5, Slc3a2, and Kv1.2.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Slc7a5 alters Kv1.2 expression and current density. <bold>a</bold> Combinations of Kv1.2, mCherry-Slc7a5, and mEGFP-Slc3a2 were expressed in <italic>ltk</italic>-mouse fibroblasts. Current density was measured at +60 mV (pulsed from a holding potential of −80 mV). Transfection ratios were (with Kv1.2 maintained constant): Kv1.2:Slc7a5 (2:1); Kv1.2:Slc3a2 (1:1); Kv1.2:Slc7a5:Slc3a2 (2:1:2), <italic>n</italic> = 14–19 cells.

(<italic>n</italic> = 3–5)</p></caption><graphic id="d29e508" xlink:href="41467_2018_6859_Fig2_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par8">We also measured Kv1.2 protein expression after transient transfection with Kv1.2 and combinations of Slc7a5 and Slc3a2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b–d</xref>). Kv1.2 generates two prominent bands: a mature cell surface band, and a core glycosylated band<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Slc7a5 + Kv1.2 (1:1) co-expression diminished total Kv1.2 expression by 50 ± 15% (mean ± s.d., here and throughout the text), relative to Kv1.2 alone. Slc3a2 + Kv1.2 (1:1) did not significantly affect overall expression (116 ± 43%), and co-expression of Slc3a2 with Slc7a5 + Kv1.2 (1:1:1) partially rescued Kv1.2 expression, to 68 ± 3% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>), although this was not statistically significant compared to WT Kv1.2 expression. In all cases, surface expression as a fraction of total protein was not affected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par9">We noted an inconsistency between Kv1.2 current density vs. protein expression, depending on the expression of Slc7a5 and Slc3a2. For example, co-expression of Kv1.2 + Slc7a5 + Slc3a2 did not dramatically rescue protein expression (relative to Kv1.2 + Slc7a5, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b–d</xref>), but had consistently larger currents (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). Thus, it was unclear why Slc7a5 caused more pronounced current suppression. We recognized that Slc7a5-mediated current suppression is likely a combination of effects on expression and gating, because hyperpolarized holding voltages result in significant disinhibition of Kv1.2 co-expressed with Slc7a5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). We measured Kv1.2 current at 0.3 s intervals, with holding potentials between −80 mV and −120 mV. We observed that with a holding potential of −120 mV, Kv1.2 currents increase significantly during a 30 s pulse train, but not with −80 or −100 mV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b, c</xref>). We are uncertain whether significantly more disinhibition can be achieved with more negative holding potentials or a longer time at −120 mV, as the long application of strong hyperpolarized voltages was a technical challenge that frequently led to seal breakdown. As described later, it is also not clear whether this disinhibition reflects recovery from a canonical C-type inactivated state, or some other non-conducting state.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Hyperpolarization disinhibits Kv1.2 co-expressed with Slc7a5. <bold>a</bold>

<title>Slc7a5 induces a hyperpolarizing shift of Kv1.2 activation</title>
<p id="Par10">The recognition of hyperpolarization-mediated disinhibition allowed us to examine gating effects in more detail. Kv1.2 + Slc7a5 co-expression (2:1 transfection ratio) leads to a hyperpolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of Kv1.2 activation of −58 ± 3 mV, compared to −11 ± 3 mV in Kv1.2 channels expressed alone. Co-expression of Slc3a2 with Kv1.2 (1:1 transfection ratio) does not affect the <italic>V</italic><sub>1/2</sub> (−11 ± 10 mV). However, similar to the effects on current density, co-expression of Kv1.2 with both Slc7a5 and Slc3a2 (2:1:2 ratio of Kv1.2:Slc7a5:Slc3a2) rescues the Slc7a5-mediated gating shift, generating a <italic>V</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of −16 ± 3 mV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a, b</xref>). Slc3a2 and Slc7a5 interact via an extracellular disulfide bond between Slc7a5 Cys164 and Slc3a2 Cys109, along with other intermolecular contacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The disulfide bond is not essential for their mutual regulation of Kv1.2, as the Slc7a5[C164A] mutant transporter retains the ability to shift Kv1.2 gating, and causes a sevenfold current disinhibition at negative voltages (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a, b</xref>). Also, gating effects mediated by Slc7a5[C164A] are rescued by overexpression of Slc3a2 (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a, c</xref>), although the extent of rescue seen in co-expression with Slc3a2 varies on a cell-to-cell basis (gray lines, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). Thus, the Slc7a5:Slc3a2 interaction does not rely solely on the formation of an extracellular disulfide bond, consistent with a previous report describing a broad interaction surface between Slc7a8 and Slc3a2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Slc7a5 shifts the voltage-dependence of Kv1.2 activation. <bold>a</bold> Indicated combinations of Kv1.2, Slc7a5, and Slc3a2 were transfected in <italic>ltk-</italic> mouse fibroblasts.

<p id="Par11">We have not exhaustively tested the entire Slc7 transporter family. However, the effects of Slc7a5 exhibit some specificity, as Kv1.2 is not affected by co-expression with Slc7a6, a closely related transporter that also heterodimerizes with Slc3a2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Also, the Slc1a5 amino acid transporter does not influence Kv1.2 gating or current magnitude (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>). Finally, Slc7a5 exhibits some degree of subtype specificity, as co-expression of Slc7a5 did not influence Kv1.5 (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2b</xref>). Future testing of other Kv1 channel types and Slc7 transporters will catalog the specificity of reported effects.</p>
<p id="Par12">The canonical accessory subunits of Kv1 family channels are the Kvβ subunits. We tested whether Slc7a5 regulates channels co-expressed with Kvβ1.3, which introduces rapid N-type inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Co-expression with Kvβ1.3 does not prevent Slc7a5-mediated gating or disinhibition effects (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c, d</xref>). In addition, rapid inactivation was apparent at positive voltages even when Kvβ1.3 was co-expressed with Slc7a5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>). This combination of rapid inactivation together with a pronounced activation shift demonstrates that channels can simultaneously co-assemble with both Slc7a5 and Kvβ subunits.</p>

<title>Slc7a5 promotes Kv1.2 inactivation</title>
<p id="Par13">The hyperpolarization-induced current disinhibition led us to speculate that Slc7a5 might influence Kv1.2 inactivation. To investigate this, we used the Kv1.2[V381T] mutant, which replaces the outer pore residue equivalent to <italic>Shaker</italic> Thr449, making channels more prone to C-type inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Kv1.2[V381T] channels exhibit a similar Slc7a5-mediated gating shift as WT Kv1.2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>), along with disinhibition at −120 mV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). Also, Slc7a5 co-expression markedly accelerates the rate of inactivation of Kv1.2[V381T] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>) and shifts the steady-state inactivation curve from −31 ± 3 mV to −69 ± 6 mV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>). There is an important mismatch that should be noted between inactivation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>) and disinhibition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). Disinhibition at −120 mV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>) was always measured before the inactivation protocol. However, subsequent recording of inactivation did not restore the original state/level of current inhibition, as currents measured in the inactivation protocol recovered with an interpulse holding voltage of −100 mV (7 s duration). These findings suggest that Slc7a5 promotes C-type inactivation of Kv1.2[V381T] and may also promote additional inactivated/non-conducting states over longer periods of time (i.e., during incubation time prior to recording).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Slc7a5 influences inactivation of Kv1.2. <bold>a</bold> Kv1.2[V381T] channels were expressed alone or with Slc7a5 (1:1 transfection ratio).

<p id="Par14">We also tested Slc7a5 effects on the Kv1.2[I304L][S308T] (Kv1.2[LT]) mutant, which shifts channel activation to depolarized voltages by dissociating voltage sensor movement from channel opening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that Kv1.2[LT] would be less prone to current suppression by Slc7a5 because fewer channels would activate at resting voltages. Slc7a5 caused a hyperpolarizing shift of activation of Kv1.2[LT] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>). More importantly, hyperpolarization to −120 mV did not cause disinhibition, suggesting that Kv1.2[LT] channels have not accumulated in an inactivated/non-conducting state (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5f, g</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that Slc7a5 promotes C-type inactivation (coupled to channel opening) and likely other non-conducting states of Kv1.2, partially contributing to the Slc7a5-mediated current suppression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). In combination with the shift in voltage dependence of channel activation, this effect leads to a requirement for strong hyperpolarizing voltages for disinhibition of current (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>).</p>

We fused the Nanoluc bioluminescent donor to Kv1.2 and used mEGFP as an acceptor in various test constructs. We collected emission spectra between 400 and 700 nm, resulting in a large emission peak centered at ~455 nm corresponding to Nanoluc bioluminescence, and variable levels of a shoulder with a peak centered at ~510 nm corresponding to mEGFP emission.

<p id="Par16">We tested a variety of mEGFP-tagged BRET acceptors. Kv1.2 can assemble as a homotetramer, therefore co-expression with mEGFP-Kv1.2 generates mEGFP emission. Although not quite as pronounced, mEGFP-Slc7a5 generated a clearly discernable emission, whereas the Slc1a5 negative control generated a much smaller emission (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a, b</xref>). We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the mEGFP emission component between 480 and 600 nm and normalized each AUC to a matched mEGFP-Kv1.2 positive control (run in parallel with each experiment, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>). We also tested whether co-expression of Slc3a2 would influence the BRET signal from mEGFP-Slc7a5. In the presence of Slc3a2, the BRET signal from mEGFP-Slc7a5 was modestly attenuated although these results are variable and ambiguous (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>, co-expression with Slc3a2 is not significantly different from EGFP-Slc7a5 alone, but also not different from EGFP-Slc1a5). These, along with our functional findings (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>), suggest that Kv1.2 and Slc7a5 are in close proximity and that Slc3a2 may influence this association, although it is not clear whether Slc3a2 occludes the Slc7a5:Kv1.2 interaction or acts by some other mechanism. Data further investigating mutual interactions of Kv1.2-Slc7a5-Slc3a2 is presented later.</p>
<p id="Par17">We also investigated the presence of Slc7a5 in neurons.

This is consistent with more recent RNA-seq approaches that detect high levels of Slc7a5 mRNA in vascular endothelium, and lower levels Slc7a5 in single neurons or enriched populations of neurons, comparable to Kv1.2 and other prominent neuronal Kv1 channel subunits, Kv1.1 and Kv1.4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> (online resources including <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html">https://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html</ext-link>; mousebrain.org; neuroseq.janelia.org).

<title>Mutual interactions of Kv1.2 and Slc7a5 and Slc3a2</title>
<p id="Par18">We further investigated interactions between Kv1.2, Slc7a5, and Slc3a2, using a flow cytometry approach to determine whether expression of one protein might influence assembly of the other two. We used complementation of split YFP fragments (YFPC or YFPN) fused to two subunits as a crude assessment of protein interaction, and tested whether the third subunit could influence YFP reconstitution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. For example, we tested whether YFP reconstitution between Kv1.2-YFPC and Slc7a5-YFPN was altered by expression of Slc3a2-LSS-mOrange (or LSS-mOrange alone as a control). For all permutations tested, we found only modest effects of the LSS-mOrange tagged subunit on reconstitution of YFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>), suggesting that none of the subunits dramatically prevent assembly of the other two (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>). For example, in the representative flow cytometry experiment in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b</xref>, cells with the brightest LSS-mOrange fluorescence (from Slc3a2) also tended to have the brightest YFP signal (from the assembly of Kv1.2-YFPC and Slc7a5-YFPN), suggesting that Slc3a2 does not prevent assembly of Slc7a5 and Kv1.2.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Using split YFP constructs to measure competition for Slc7a5 between Kv1.2 and Slc3a2.

<p id="Par19">An important aspect of the flow cytometry experiments is that split-YFP complementation can promote/stabilize the targeted protein interaction. We investigated these constructs in greater detail using patch clamp recordings of various combinations of tagged Kv1.2, Slc7a5, and Slc3a2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c–e</xref>) in order to test the mutual regulation of these proteins when assembly of specific pairs is biased by split-YFP assembly. For example, we tested Slc3a2 effects when assembly of the Kv1.2:Slc7a5 complex was enhanced using Kv1.2-YFPC and Slc7a5-YFPN constructs. In these experiments, co-expression of Kv1.2-YFPC and Slc7a5-YFPN mimicked the gating shift and current suppression observed with WT constructs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c, d</xref>). Co-expression with Slc3a2-LSS-mOrange generated a wide range of gating phenotypes despite the irreversible fusion of Slc7a5 and Kv1.2, suggesting that Slc3a2 can alter the effects of Slc7a5 on Kv1.2 even when the channel and transporter are held in close proximity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c, d</xref>). A similar experiment was done using Slc7a5-YFPC and YFPN-Slc3a2, along with LSS-mOrange-Kv1.2, suggesting that close association of Slc3a2 and Slc7a5 does not prevent regulation of Kv1.2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7e</xref>). Interestingly, in this instance, the YFP-stabilized association of Slc3a2 and Slc7a5 is not very effective at rescuing the WT Kv1.2 <italic>V</italic><sub>1/2</sub> (most cells were only poorly rescued, multiple gray lines in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7e</xref> represent GV curves from individual cells). This observation may arise because Slc3a2 association helps to stabilize Slc7a5 at the membrane where it can influence Kv1.2. Also, in these experiments a 1:1:1 transfection ratio was used, possibly leading to a greater amount of Slc7a5 relative to Kv1.2, and thus weaker rescue by Slc3a2 as mentioned earlier. Overall, these experiments demonstrate complex mutual regulation of Kv1.2, Slc7a5, and Slc3a2, that persists even when strategies are taken to bias the interaction of specific interacting pairs. This finding supports the proposal that Kv1.2, Slc7a5, and Slc3a2 may form a complex, and that the rescue effect of Slc3a2 does not require physical occlusion of the Kv1.2:Slc7a5 interaction. However, the variability of channel gating observed when all three proteins are co-expressed suggests additional complexity that we cannot yet control.</p>

However, both mutants are extremely susceptible to Slc7a5, leading to dramatic current reduction, and hyperpolarizing shifts of channel activation (Kv1.2[R297Q] <italic>V</italic><sub>1/2 </sub>= −143 ± 6 mV; Kv1.2[L298F] <italic>V</italic><sub>1/2 </sub>&lt; −200 mV; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9a–f</xref>). This is especially evident in the exemplar traces where current inhibition coupled with the shift in activation can be better appreciated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9c, d</xref>). The large shift in voltage-dependent activation provides a rationale for the low current density and very weak extent of disinhibition observed at −120 mV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9a, b</xref>). Since the activation curve of the mutant channels is so dramatically shifted, significantly more negative voltages may be required for disinhibition. Using western blots, we demonstrated that expression of the mutant channels was slightly reduced relative to WT Kv1.2 channels and decreased further by co-expression of Slc7a5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9g, h</xref>). Overall, these disease-linked Kv1.2 mutants categorized as gain-of-function appear to be strongly suppressed by Slc7a5 due to diminished protein expression and hypersensitivity to the gating effects of Slc7a5.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Kv1.2 disease-linked mutations are strongly suppressed by Slc7a5. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Current density at +60 mV was measured before and after a 30 s hyperpolarizing train to −120 mV for Kv1.2[R297Q] alone (<italic>n</italic> = 6) or with Slc7a5 (<italic>n</italic> = 13), and Kv1.2[L298F] alone (<italic>n</italic> = 12) or with Slc7a5 (<italic>n</italic> = 14), as indicated. <bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold> Exemplar currents recorded from Kv1.2[R297Q] or Kv1.2[L298F], expressed in <italic>ltk-</italic> mouse fibroblasts.

<p id="Par22">Interestingly, the enhanced gating effects of Slc7a5 provides a more sensitive tool to probe the effects of Slc3a2. Based on BRET spectra (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>) and variable gating properties of split-YFP tagged Kv1.2:Slc7a5:Slc3a2 complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>), we had speculated that attenuation of the gating effects of Slc7a5 may not require direct physical occlusion/competition of the Kv1.2:Slc7a5 interaction by Slc3a2. In the case of the Kv1.2 R297Q or L298F mutants, it is clear that co-expression with Slc3a2 leads to incomplete rescue of gating properties, and wide variability of gating (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5a, c</xref>). This wide variation is likely due to the vast dynamic range of gating arising from the Slc7a5-mediated effects, together with cell-to-cell variability of relative expression of Slc7a5 and Slc3a2. In addition, we observed that co-expression with Slc3a2 led to incomplete rescue of channel deactivation (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5b, d</xref>). These findings support the idea that Slc3a2 and Slc7a5 can co-assemble and influence the gating properties Kv1.2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par23">In this study, we demonstrate profound regulation of Kv1.2 gating and expression by Slc7a5, in addition to its canonical function as an amino acid transporter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Slc7a5 suppresses Kv1.2 by diminishing expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>), and a combination of gating effects that cause channels to accumulate in a non-conducting state that requires much hyperpolarized voltages for recovery to occur (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>). Recently reported Slc7a5 mutations linked to autosomal recessive inherited neurodevelopmental delay/autism spectrum disorder (A246V and P375L) have attenuated effects on Kv1.2 gating and current density, possibly due to a localization defect that prevents association with Kv1.2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>). In contrast, epileptic encephalopathy-linked mutations of Kv1.2 (R297Q and L298F) enhance susceptibility to the gating effects of Slc7a5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>). Relative to other known accessory subunits of Kv1 channels, these gating effects are unique and large in magnitude, and reveal a previously unrecognized ion channel regulatory mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par24">Kv1.2 was the first eukaryotic voltage-gated ion channel with a reported atomic resolution structure, and has served as a valuable template for understanding mechanisms of voltage-dependent gating of ion channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In search of additional regulatory mechanisms, we performed mass spectrometry of cross-linked Kv1.2 complexes, followed by screening to identify proteins with clear effects. We used cross-linking to maximize detection of proteins that may have transient or lower affinity interactions with the channel, or that are lost with detergent solubilization. Our approach was less stringent at the immunoprecipitation stage, at the expense of more laborious screening of candidate genes. A more stringent protocol (non-cross-linked, more detergent washes, etc.) would likely yield less candidate genes, but might also miss important transient or low affinity interactions.</p>
<p id="Par25">The Slc7a5-mediated hyperpolarizing shift of channel activation, coupled with suppression of current, initially seemed to be counteracting effects. However, these are related—the hyperpolarizing shift contributes to current suppression by making the channels more prone to enter an inactivated (or other non-canonical non-conducting) state. This effect of Slc7a5 is accomplished by the combination of opening at more negative voltages (stabilization of channel activation) and enhancing the inactivation rate (accentuated in the V381T mutant, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10a, b</xref>). In the presence of Slc7a5, channel activation and inactivation are sufficiently shifted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10c</xref>, green lines) that some inactivation (or other non-conducting mode) of Kv1.2 may occur even when cells are at rest. In addition, extremely negative voltages are required to allow for current recovery/disinhibition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>, holding potential of −120 mV). In a physiological system where such extreme voltages are never reached, this molecular complex would act as a trap that could alter excitability by silencing channels. Although the stoichiometry of the Kv1.2:Slc7a5 interaction is not yet known, it is important to note that assembly with different numbers of Slc7a5 subunits, or heteromeric channels with Slc7a5 sensitive (e.g. Kv1.2) and insensitive (e.g. Kv1.5) subunits, may lead to intermediate instances of the effects described. Our findings likely represent an extreme case, and variable or regulated assembly might temper these effects in native settings. Further exploration of the entire Kv1 family, other Kv subtypes, and the Slc7 family will likely reveal functional diversity of these effects. In addition, a deeper investigation of the variable influence of Slc3a2 may provide important additional understanding of this ion channel regulatory mechanism.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Inactivation trap gating effect of Slc7a5 on Kv1.2. <bold>a</bold> Generic gating scheme of Kv1.2 cycling between closed, activated, and inactivated states. <bold>b</bold> Slc7a5 accelerates channel activation and inactivation, and slows recovery from inactivation, leading to accumulation of channels in an inactivated state. <bold>c</bold> Activation curves from Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref> and inactivation curves from Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref> are shown, illustrating the greater propensity for inactivation of Kv1.2 when assembled with Slc7a5. <bold>d</bold> Disease-linked gain-of-function mutants (GoF Kv1.2) exhibit greatly exaggerated sensitivity to Slc7a5 gating effects, such that Kv1.2 channels in complex with Slc7a5 are predominantly inactivated at resting voltages.

<p id="Par26">The silencing effect of Slc7a5 may be noteworthy in the context of an apparent paradox in the characterization of epilepsy-associated Kv1.2 mutations. Recent findings have reported similar epileptic phenotypes for both gain- and loss-of-function Kv1.2 mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In addition, an observation lacking a good explanation has been that Kv1.2 mutants with powerful gain-of-function (increased current magnitude and ~50 mV hyperpolarizing gating shifts) lead to hyperexcitability, rather than suppression of excitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Although many factors may contribute to these outcomes, gain-of-function mutations of Kv1.2 are much more sensitive to the Slc7a5-mediated silencing, and this could lead to a loss-of-function effect when co-expressed with Slc7a5 (even in the presence of Slc3a2, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). The hypersensitivity of Kv1.2 gain-of-function mutations arises from two main differences that we have observed. First, there is an intrinsic gating shift of the mutant channels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10d</xref>, black lines), and for reasons that are not yet apparent, the Slc7a5-mediated gating shift is even more extreme than seen with WT Kv1.2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10d</xref>, green lines). Therefore, a greater fraction of Kv1.2 channels would activate and become silenced/inactivated at physiological resting voltages. Second, this extreme gating shift induced by Slc7a5 causes the gain-of-function mutants to require extreme hyperpolarized voltages for disinhibition. The unique gating effects of Slc7a5 provide an interesting example of how the outcome of a disease-linked ion channel mutant might be fundamentally altered by assembly with an accessory protein.</p>
<p id="Par27">Slc7a5 is a multi-pass transmembrane protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, a feature that stands out from previously described accessory proteins of Kv1 channels, which are predominantly soluble cytoplasmic proteins, and often associated with the cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. A prominent area of investigation of Slc7a5 has been its expression in vasculature where it transports amino acids, neurotransmitters and small drugs across the blood–brain barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. While it is enriched in the epithelial cells of blood vessels in the brain, it is also expressed midbrain structures, cortex and hippocampus where its function is less well characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Pathological consequences of Slc7a5 disruption (mutation or knockout) are predominantly attributed to its amino acid transport function. Our findings indicate that future consideration of a role of Slc7a5 in ion channel regulation is also warranted, in terms of physiological consequences of the Slc7a5:Kv1.2 interaction. However, further investigation of this complex will be required to generate tools that distinguish the amino acid transport function vs. ion channel regulation. It will also be of interest to determine whether Kv1.2 exerts a reciprocal effect on Slc7a5 transport activity. The assembly of ion channels with membrane proteins that have pleiotropic functions is an emerging theme, as other transporter subunits have recently been reported to influence ion channels. One example is a functional interaction of the sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) pump and the endothelial sodium channel (ENaC) at the distal convoluted tubule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Also, the sodium-coupled myoinositol transporter SMIT1 affects expression of KCNQ1 and KCNQ2/3 potassium channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. These findings highlight the importance of continuing to investigate interactions of Kv channels with accessory subunits, and how these shape potassium currents in excitable cells and may influence the functional outcome of disease-linked mutations.</p>

<p id="Par41">Hippocampi or cortices from postnatal day 0–2 Sprague Dawley rats were isolated and digested in 27 U/mL papain solution in HEPES-buffered HBSS (10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin/streptomycin dissolved in calcium/magnesium-free HBSS) for 10 min in a 37 °C water bath. DNase (0.15 mg/mL) was added to the digestion mixture and incubated for 5 min in the 37 °C water bath. Ten percent FBS was then added and the mixture was centrifuged at 200×<italic>g</italic> for 1 min. The supernatant was aspirated and the pellet was resuspended in plating media (10% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in MEM) and triturated. The mixture was filtered with a 40 µM sterile cell strainer. The neurons were counted using a hemocytometer and plated at a density of 800 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>. After 3 h, the plating media were replaced with growth media (1X B27 supplement, 500 µM GlutaMAX-1 and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in Neurobasal-A). Neurons were treated with cytosine arabinoside (5 µM) for 24 h at 3 days in vitro. All reagents and materials were purchased from Fisher, Sigma-Aldrich and Invitrogen.</p>
<p id="Par42">Immunohistochemistry experiments were done at 7–9 d in vitro. Neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 and stained with primary antibodies as follows: mouse monoclonal Kv1.2 antibody (1:500 dilution, clone #K14/16 75–008; NeuroMab), rabbit polyclonal Slc7a5 antibody (1:50, KE026; Trans Genic Inc.), mouse or rabbit NF-200 antibody (1:500 dilution, N4142 or N5389, Sigma-Aldrich). Neurons were then stained with secondary antibodies as follows: anti-rabbit Alexa 680 (cat. A21109, Invitrogen), anti-mouse Alexa 488 (cat. A21202, Invitrogen), and/or anti-mouse Alexa 555 (cat. A31570, Invitrogen) each at a 1:500 dilution. Neuronal images were obtained on a Zeiss Colibri microscope and analyzed using ImageJ software. All procedures on animals were approved by the University of Alberta’s Animal Care and Use Committee and were in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.</p>
