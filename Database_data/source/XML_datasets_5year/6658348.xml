<abstract id="ABS1">
<sec id="S1">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p id="P7">To evaluate gastrointestinal symptoms and continence in the context of Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMS).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Study design:</title>
<p id="P8">A prospective evaluation of children with PMS (n=17) at the National Institutes of Health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Results:</title>
<p id="P9">Parent-reported history of symptoms were common: constipation (65%), reflux (59%), choking/gagging (41%), and more than half received gastrointestinal specialty care. No aspiration was noted in 11/11 participants who completed modified barium swallows. Four participants met criteria for functional constipation, 2 of whom had abnormal colonic transit studies. Stool incontinence was highly prevalent (13/17) with non-retentive features present in 12/17. Participants who were continent had significantly smaller genetic deletions (p=0.01) and higher nonverbal mental age (p=0.03) compared to incontinent participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p id="P10">Incontinence is common in PMS and associated with intellectual functioning and gene deletion size. Management strategies may differ based on the presence of non-retentive fecal incontinence, functional constipation, and degree of intellectual disability for children with PMS.</p>
