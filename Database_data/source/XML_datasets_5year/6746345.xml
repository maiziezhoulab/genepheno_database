<title>SUMMARY</title>
<p id="P3">Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading heritable cause of intellectual disability and commonly co-occurs with autism spectrum disorder. Silencing of the Fmr1 gene leads to the absence of the protein product, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which represses translation of many target mRNAs. Excess translation of these targets is one cause of neuronal dysfunction in FXS. Utilizing the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of FXS, we identified the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) Wallenda/dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) as a critical target of FMRP. dFMRP binds Wallenda mRNA and is required to limit Wallenda protein levels. In dFmr1 mutants, Wallenda signaling drives defects in synaptic development, neuronal morphology, and behavior. Pharmacological inhibition of Wallenda in larvae suppresses dFmr1 neurodevelopmental phenotypes, while adult administration prevents dFmr1 behavioral defects. We propose that in dFmr1 mutants chronic Wallenda/DLK signaling disrupts nervous system development and function and that inhibition of this kinase cascade might be a candidate therapeutic intervention for the treatment of FXS.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="P6">Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most commonly inherited form of intellectual disability and is a leading cause of autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bassell and Warren, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Crawford et al., 2001</xref>). FXS is caused by a defect in the gene <italic>Fmr1</italic>, resulting in the absence of the <italic>Fmr1</italic> gene product fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Pieretti et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Warren and Nelson, 1994</xref>). The loss of FMRP drives a host of neurological symptoms of varying severity, including learning disabilities, behavioral deficits, sensory integration issues, and an increased propensity toward seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bailey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Berry-Kravis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Contractor et al., 2015</xref>). One role of FMRP is to act as an RNA-binding protein (RNA-BP) that targets mRNAs and represses translation by stalling the ribosome and preventing the transcript from being translated into protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bassell and Warren, 2008</xref>). FMRP is a highly conserved protein, with orthologs in mice (FMRP) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (dFMRP). The absence of FMRP in animal models causes abnormal neuronal morphology, physiology, and defects in behaviors such as hyperactivity, social assays, and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bardoni and Mandel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bhogal and Jongens, 2010</xref>). Many mRNA targets of FMRP have been identified and are highly enriched for transcripts encoding proteins that govern synaptic development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>). For many target transcripts, the protein products are present at elevated levels in Fmr1-knockout neurons due to the loss of translational repression. Unfortunately, efforts to treat FXS by inhibiting or downregulating these target proteins have not succeeded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Erickson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lee et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">Defining the molecular factors underlying the neurobiological defects in FXS is critical to identify candidate therapies. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of FXS, in which the single ortholog of <italic>Fmr1, dFmr1,</italic> has been mutated and causes the absence of dFMRP, has been extremely fruitful in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Wan et al., 2000b</xref>). dFMRP is the lone ortholog of three human Fmr1 protein products—FMR1, FXR1, and FXR2—yet only expression of human FMR1 is sufficient to rescue neurological dysfunction in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of FXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Coffee et al., 2010</xref>), highlighting the functional conservation between dFMRP and FMR1. <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants exhibit abnormal synaptic morphology and physiology at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), which parallel observations of cortical and hippocampal neurons in the Fmr1<sup>KO</sup> mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Comery et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">The Dutch-Belgian Fragile X Consortium, 1994</xref>). Adult flies also exhibit abnormal brain morphology and deficits in behaviors such as repetitive motions, learning and memory, and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Dockendorff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Michel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Tauber et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, <italic>Drosophila</italic> is a powerful model to identify the molecular drivers of nervous system defects in FXS.</p>
<p id="P8">Studies of the larval NMJ have defined molecular pathways regulating neuronal development and function. We previously identified the conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) Wallenda (Wnd) as a potent promoter of synaptic growth at the larval NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Collins et al., 2006</xref>). Wnd and its mammalian ortholog dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) have since been characterized as master regulators of neuronal stress pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Asghari Adib et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Gerdts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Simon and Watkins, 2018</xref>). Activation of Wnd/DLK signaling triggers activation of downstream kinases and transcription factors that promote a stress response. Chronic activation of this stress response induces neuronal dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Pichon et al., 2017</xref>). There is substantial evidence that the molecular pathways involved in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases are similarly dysregulated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including FXS, autism, and Down syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Wang, 2015</xref>). Could dysregulated Wnd/DLK signaling, and subsequent upregulation of a conserved stress pathway, have a role in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders? In seeking regulatory mechanisms controlling Wnd/DLK activity during synaptic development, we discovered that dFMRP regulates Wnd levels and function.</p>
<p id="P9">FMRP targets an estimated 4% of all neuronal mRNAs for translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ashley et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Brown et al., 2001</xref>), so multiple targets likely account for the widespread and varied defects observed when FMRP-mediated translational control is lost. Nonetheless, there may be critical targets that are responsible for multiple phenotypes. Here, we identify the MAP3K Wnd/DLK as such a key target of dFMRP. dFMRP binds <italic>wnd</italic> mRNA and limits Wnd protein levels. Moreover, Wnd is required for defects in neuronal morphology, physiology, and behavior in the fly FXS model. Pharmacological inhibition of Wnd in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant larvae corrects neurodevelopmental defects, while Wnd inhibition in the adult is sufficient to prevent behavioral defects in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant flies. Taken together, these findings show that dysregulated Wnd signaling is a central driver of neural dysfunction in the fly model of FXS. We propose that the Wnd/DLK stress pathway may be an exciting candidate therapeutic target for FXS.</p>

<title>Overexpressing dFMRP Suppresses <italic>hiw</italic> Mutant Synaptic Overgrowth by Decreasing Levels of the Conserved MAP3K Wnd</title>
<p id="P10">We conducted an <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to identify regulators of the conserved MAP3K Wnd. We leveraged <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae mutant for the E3 ubiquitin ligase <italic>highwire</italic> (<italic>hiw</italic>). <italic>hiw</italic> mutant larvae exhibit dramatic overgrowth at the larval neuromuscular junction, defined by an increased branching of the synaptic terminal nerve and a substantial increase in the number of presynaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Collins et al., 2006</xref>). We previously identified Wnd as the Hiw target responsible for driving this extensive overgrowth, demonstrating that (1) Wnd protein levels are significantly increased in the <italic>hiw</italic> mutant nervous system, (2) the overgrowth phenotype is entirely suppressed in <italic>hiw;wnd</italic> double mutants, and (3) <italic>hiw</italic>-dependent NMJ overgrowth is a downstream readout of MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling through JNK and Fos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Collins et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that overexpressing proteins that normally limit Wnd protein levels or Wnd signaling would also suppress the <italic>hiw</italic> mutant overgrowth phenotype at the larval NMJ. We conducted a screen in <italic>hiw</italic> mutants to identify candidate genes with regulatory control over Wnd. We screened through transgenic constructs enriched for (1) genes with roles in nervous system development and (2) genes with orthologs for disease-related genes in mammals, and we examined NMJ morphology in these larvae to determine if overexpression suppressed <italic>hiw</italic> mutant overgrowth.</p>
<p id="P11">The strongest hit from this screen was overexpression of <italic>Drosophila</italic> FMRP (dFMRP), which is encoded by the <italic>dFmr1</italic> gene. <italic>hiw</italic> mutants exhibit increased branching and bouton number at the larval NMJ compared to wild type (WT), and driving a Wnd-RNAi in the nervous system of <italic>hiw</italic> mutants fully suppresses the overgrowth phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Overexpressing dFMRP in the <italic>hiw</italic> mutant phenocopied Wnd knockdown by completely suppressing NMJ overgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), restoring the number of synaptic boutons to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Overexpression of dFMRP suppresses synaptic overgrowth in a second <italic>hiw</italic> mutant allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref>), demonstrating that suppression is not an allele-specific effect. Overexpression of dFMRP in an otherwise wild-type background does not significantly alter the bouton number at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref>), consistent with dFMRP blocking <italic>hiw</italic>-dependent signaling rather than inhibiting a parallel synaptic growth pathway. These results are consistent with a prior study that demonstrated overexpression of dFMRP can suppress morphological defects in <italic>hiw</italic> mutant class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kim et al. 2013</xref>). Kim et al. demonstrated that FMRP represses translation of Dscam1 and that Wnd signaling enhances Dscam1 translation, and so they proposed a model in which FMRP and Wnd act antagonistically to tune Dscam1 levels. However, we found that while expression of FMRP fully rescues the <italic>hiw</italic> synaptic growth defect, loss of Dscam1 does not rescue (data not shown). Instead, expression of FMRP phenocopies a loss of Wnd, leading us to test the hypothesis that the Wnd protein levels might be downregulated by dFMRP.</p>
<p id="P12">To test if dFMRP decreases Wnd protein levels in the <italic>hiw</italic> mutant nervous system, we used the pan-neuronal driver Elav-GAL4 to overexpress either a control upstream activating sequence (UAS) transgene (RFP) or dFMRP in a <italic>hiw</italic> null background (<italic>hiwΔN</italic>) and measured endogenous Wnd protein levels in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) of third instar larvae. Examination of the VNCs reveals a substantial increase in endogenous Wnd levels in the <italic>hiwΔN</italic> background over wild-type controls, in which Wnd protein is just barely detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Overexpression of dFMRP in the <italic>hiw</italic> mutant nervous system completely suppresses this increase in Wnd protein in the larval VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), showing that excess dFMRP decreases Wnd protein levels. We next tested whether dFMRP can regulate a transgenic Wnd construct under the control of the exogenous UAS-promoter in <italic>hiw</italic> mutants. Similar to endogenous Wnd, levels of the UAS-Wnd<sup>KD</sup>GFP transgene are increased in <italic>hiw</italic> mutant VNCs relative to WT—this is completely suppressed by overexpression of dFMRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Hence, dFMRP can regulate Wnd protein levels regardless of whether <italic>wnd</italic> is expressed from the endogenous or exogenous locus and so is unlikely to regulate Wnd levels via a transcriptional mechanism. We conclude that overexpressing dFMRP suppresses <italic>hiw</italic> mutant overgrowth by downregulating Wnd protein levels.</p>

<title>dFMRP Is Required to Limit Wnd Levels in the Nervous System and Interacts with Wnd mRNA</title>
<p id="P13">Given that overexpressing dFMRP can negatively regulate Wnd protein levels, we hypothesized that endogenous dFMRP normally regulates Wnd protein levels. To test this, we compared endogenous Wnd protein levels in wild-type VNCs to Wnd levels in two different transheterozygous <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant backgrounds: the null allele <italic>dFmr1</italic><sup><italic>Δ50M</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>) over a deficiency line in which <italic>dFmr1</italic> locus is excised (Df(3R)by62 (labeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> as <italic>dFmr1</italic>(1)) and <italic>dFmr1</italic><sup><italic>Δ50M</italic></sup> over a second null allele, <italic>dFmr1</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> (labeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> as <italic>dFmr1</italic>(2); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Dockendorff et al., 2002</xref>). Western blotting for dFMRP protein confirms that these transheterozygotes lack dFMRP in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Wnd protein levels are significantly increased in the VNCs of <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Neuronal expression of a wild-type <italic>dFmr1</italic> rescue transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Dockendorff et al., 2002</xref>) reverts Wnd protein levels to those of wild-type flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Thus, dFMRP negatively regulates Wnd protein expression in the nervous system, and the absence of dFMRP results in increased Wnd protein.</p>
<p id="P14">dFMRP is an RNA binding protein that can stall translation from its target mRNAs. While this is a likely mechanism by which dFMRP is regulating Wnd levels, we sought to test other possible regulatory mechanisms. First, the absence of dFMRP can trigger transcriptional changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Korb et al., 2017</xref>), so we conducted qPCR in wild-type and <italic>dFmr1</italic> larval brains to determine if <italic>wnd</italic> mRNA levels are increased in dFmr1 mutants. We observed no significant difference in <italic>wnd</italic> mRNA in the <italic>dFmr1</italic> nervous system relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken with our data that excess dFMRP does not require the endogenous locus to decrease Wnd protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>), we conclude that dFMRP does not regulate <italic>wnd</italic> at the level of transcription. Second, Wnd protein stability could be increased in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants, which could also drive increased Wnd protein levels. We used the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) to assess turnover of Wnd protein. Wild-type and <italic>dFmr1</italic> nervous systems were exposed to CHX for 0, 6, 12, and 18 h, and we probed for Wnd protein levels at each time point. As expected, <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants have higher Wnd protein at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>); however, the relative rate of Wnd degradation over the time course did not vary between wild type and <italic>dFmr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>), demonstrating that Wnd protein stability is not increased in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants.</p>
<p id="P15">We then employed RNA immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP) to test the hypothesis that <italic>wnd</italic> is an mRNA target of dFMRP <italic>in vivo</italic> in the fly, which would suggest regulation at the level of translation. We collected lysates from the heads of both wild-type and <italic>dFmr1</italic> null flies and confirmed that dFMRP could be pulled down from wild-type flies, while no dFMRP was present in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). The pulldowns and subsequent western blots were performed in non-denaturing buffers to preserve any protein-protein interactions between dFMRP and Wnd. We did not detect any Wnd coimmunoprecipitating with dFMRP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). We next conducted RT-PCR to assess whether <italic>wnd</italic> mRNA immunoprecipitated with dFMRP. The mRNA for <italic>Futsch</italic>, a known target of dFMRP in the fly nervous system, was successfully detected in the immunoprecipitated samples from wild-type flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). Further, the mRNA for <italic>rp49,</italic> a housekeeping gene that is commonly used as a negative control in dFMRP studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bienkowski et al., 2017</xref>), was not detected in immunoprecipitated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). <italic>wnd</italic> mRNA coimmunoprecipitated with dFMRP and can be observed after RT-PCR of the RNA isolated from wild-type samples immunoprecipitated with dFMRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). The qPCR of immunoprecipitated RNA samples confirmed that <italic>wnd</italic> mRNA is present in wild-type samples and virtually absent in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). Thus, we conclude that dFMRP binds <italic>wnd</italic> mRNA <italic>in vivo,</italic> and Wnd protein is negatively regulated by dFMRP in wild-type animals likely through translational control. These findings are consistent with high-throughput studies conducted in flies and mice that identified both Wnd and DLK, respectively, among FMRP bound transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">McMahon et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Excess Wnd in the <italic>dFmr1</italic> Mutant Nervous System Drives Defects in Synaptic Morphology</title>
<p id="P16">Wnd levels are increased in the <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant nervous system, and excess Wnd can trigger numerous neuronal phenotypes, including defects in NMJ morphology, axon development, and synaptic physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Collins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Goel and Dickman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Shin and DiAntonio, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>), so we hypothesized that Wnd might be a functionally relevant target required for defects observed in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant neurons. <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant NMJs exhibit well-established morphological phenotypes, with an increase in the number of synaptic boutons that is largely driven by a profusion of satellite boutons, which surround larger boutons rather than occurring individually along the nerve terminal and may represent an arrested state of bouton development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Siller and Broadie, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Gatto and Broadie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). We first tested if NMJ morphological defects in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant larvae are Wnd dependent. We generated double-mutant flies for <italic>dFmr1</italic> and <italic>wnd</italic> to conduct epistasis analysis of <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant NMJs. We recombined the <italic>dFmr1</italic><sup><italic>Δ50M</italic></sup> and <italic>df</italic>(<italic>dFmr1</italic>) alleles with two different, previously validated alleles of <italic>wnd</italic>—<italic>wnd-1</italic> and <italic>wnd-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Collins et al., 2006</xref>)—to generate four unique double-mutant lines in which both dFMRP and Wnd protein are absent. <italic>dFmr1</italic> larvae exhibit synaptic overgrowth with abundant satellite boutons, while <italic>dFmr1,Wnd</italic> double mutants do not exhibit increases in total bouton number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) or in satellite bouton number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Larvae mutant for <italic>wnd</italic> alone show no substantial differences in NMJ morphology relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Hence, Wnd is necessary for morphological defects at the <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant NMJ.</p>
<p id="P17">We next asked if Wnd can drive other neuronal morphological defects in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants. We have previously demonstrated that <italic>hiw</italic> mutants exhibit Wnd-dependent defects in fly mushroom body (MB) morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Shin and DiAntonio, 2011</xref>), and MB morphology is also disrupted in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Michel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Siller and Broadie, 2011</xref>). <italic>dFmr1</italic> phenotypes include thin or misprojected α and/or β lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Michel et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, we tested if dysregulated Wnd also drives MB developmental defects in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants. We examined the MBs of wild-type, <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants, and double <italic>dFmr1,Wnd</italic> mutants immediately after eclosion. MB phenotypes are highly sensitive to genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Michel et al., 2004</xref>), and in our <italic>dFmr1</italic><sup><italic>Δ50M</italic></sup><italic>/</italic>df(<italic>dFmr1</italic>) adults, the most penetrant phenotype was malformation of the α lobe. The α lobe is substantially thinner than the β lobe, while in wild-type MBs, the width of each lobe is roughly the same (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2D</xref>). We quantified the width of each fly’s <italic>α</italic> and β lobe and present these data as “<italic>α</italic>/β lobe width ratio” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref> for schematic; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">Method Details</xref> for quantification details). The ratio for <italic>dFmr1</italic> MBs is significantly decreased relative to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>) due to abnormally thin <italic>α</italic> lobes. After categorizing all the α lobes across genotypes, we found that thin a lobes are a highly penetrant phenotype in mutants, affecting about 80% of the <italic>dFmr1</italic> brains analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>). In contrast, there was no significant decrease in the MB lobe width ratio relative to wild type in <italic>dFmr1,Wnd</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2D</xref>). Hence, Wnd is required for MB lobe malformations in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants, demonstrating that the effects of dysregulated Wnd signaling can impact neuronal morphology beyond the larval NMJ.</p>
<p id="P18">We returned to the NMJ to assess whether Wnd functions in the neuron to disrupt synaptic development in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants. Many important FMRP targets are regulated postsynaptically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Darnell and Klann, 2013</xref>); however, the previously described role for Wnd in promoting synaptic growth at the NMJ is presynaptic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Collins et al., 2006</xref>). To test this, we employed the panneuronal elav-GAL4 driver in a <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant background to drive an RNAi against Wnd exclusively in neurons. <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants expressing a control transgene have an increase in the number of synaptic and satellite boutons, compared to a wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3D</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). Presynaptic knockdown of Wnd fully rescued these bouton phenotypes at the larval NMJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3D</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). We next tested if Wnd functions through its canonical MAP kinase cascade, in which the downstream MAP kinase JNK activates the transcription factor Fos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Collins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>), by (1) RNAi knockdown of JNK and (2) overexpression of a dominant-negative transgene for the transcription factor Fos (Fos-DN) in the <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant background. We observed a complete suppression of the increases in bouton number and the formation of satellite boutons in the <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant background with either JNK or Fos loss-of-function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3D</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). While other MAP3Ks can also signal through JNK and Fos, the full suppression from inhibition of Wnd, JNK, or Fos is consistent with the model that Wnd signaling through a JNK-/Fos-dependent transcriptional program is required for defects in <italic>dFmr1</italic> NMJ synapse morphology.</p>

<title>Excess Wnd in the <italic>dFmr1</italic> Mutant Nervous System Drives Defects in Synaptic Physiology</title>
<p id="P19">Having determined that Wnd is necessary in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant larval NMJs to drive defects in synaptic terminal morphology, we next sought to determine whether Wnd alters synaptic transmission at the NMJ. Both the fly and mouse models of FXS exhibit significant changes in synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Contractor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Drozd et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Repicky and Broadie, 2009</xref>). At the larval NMJ in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> previously reported phenotypes include increased evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>) and decreased quantal size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Gatto and Broadie, 2008</xref>). We tested if increased Wnd in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants leads to changes in synaptic transmission at the larval NMJ. We performed electrophysiological recordings at the larval NMJ of <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants and observed that relative to wild type, there is an increase in quantal content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Notably, and consistent with previous studies, evoked excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitudes are slightly but not significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Repicky and Broadie, 2009</xref>). However, the amplitudes of miniature, spontaneous excitatory events (mEPSPs) are significantly decreased in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), indicating that increased quantal content is driven by a decrease in postsynaptic response to the neurotransmitter in a single vesicle; thus, the nerve releases more vesicles to compensate for the decreased postsynaptic response. Such homeostatic compensation is well described at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Davis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Petersen et al., 1997</xref>). In <italic>dFmr1,Wnd</italic> double mutants, the decrease in mEPSP amplitude is abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), and quantal content is restored to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Neuronal depletion of Wnd via RNAi also suppressed the decrease in mEPSP amplitude and increase in quantal content in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S3A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3D</xref>). Hence, neuronal Wnd is required for the decrease in quantal size and the increase in quantal content during neurotransmission at the <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant NMJ.</p>
<p id="P20">What are the Wnd-dependent mechanisms driving decreased quantal size and increased quantal content at the <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant synaptic terminal? We first assessed active zones and postsynaptic densities via staining for the active zone protein Bruchpilot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S3E</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3G</xref>) and the common glutamate receptor subunit DGluRIII (also known as DGluRIIC; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S3E</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3G</xref>) and detected no obvious change in levels or localization, suggesting that synapse formation is largely normal in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants. We next tested if postsynaptic mechanisms governing sensitivity to neurotransmitters are altered by Wnd. Increased Wnd signaling in the neuron reduces the sensitivity of the postsynaptic muscle via downregulation of glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Goel and Dickman, 2018</xref>). Further, dFMRP regulates the ratio of different subclasses of ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits at the larval NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Pan and Broadie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Tessier and Broadie, 2012</xref>), and we have previously shown that the ratio of the two alternative subunits, DGluRIIA and DGluRIIB, regulates quantal size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">DiAntonio et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, we tested if excess Wnd is driving changes in glutamate receptor subunit expression in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants. We observed that the ratio of DGluRIIA to DGluRIIB expression is decreased in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants in a Wnd-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). Less DGluRIIA decreases quantal size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">DiAntonio et al., 1999</xref>), so this would explain the decreased mEPSP amplitudes in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants. Taken together, these findings indicate that changes in synaptic transmission at the NMJ in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants are due to increased neuronal Wnd signaling altering postsynaptic glutamate receptor subunit composition.</p>

<title><italic>dFmr1</italic> Mutant Repetitive Grooming Behaviors are Wnd Dependent</title>
<p id="P21">Both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian models of FXS display behavioral abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Drozd et al., 2018</xref>). Given that Wnd is a critical downstream target of dFMRP in neuronal development and synaptic physiology, we sought to determine if this regulatory relationship extends beyond nervous system development and is required for normal behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic> adults. One known <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant behavioral phenotype is excessive, repetitive grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Tauber et al., 2011</xref>). Adult flies execute stereotyped exploratory behavior when introduced into a novel chamber, alternating between bouts of walking, stopping, and grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Phillis et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Soibam et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants groom excessively, spending significantly more total time grooming and more time in each bout of grooming than do wild-type flies. This grooming phenotype emerges as flies age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Tauber et al., 2011</xref>). Adapting a previously published assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Tauber et al., 2011</xref>), we tested if <italic>dFmr1,Wnd</italic> double mutants retain this defect in grooming. We observed that wild-type and <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant flies groom the same amount at 10 days of age, but by day 25, grooming in wild-type flies remains stable while <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants groom themselves excessively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Videos S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S3</xref>). Excitingly, <italic>dFmr1,Wnd</italic> double mutants did not display any excessive grooming activity and were statistically indistinguishable from wild type at both ages tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Videos S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S3</xref>). <italic>wnd</italic> mutants alone did not show any repetitive grooming behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Thus, Wnd is necessary for the excessive grooming behavior of <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant flies.</p>

<title>A Chemical Inhibitor of Wnd Suppresses NMJ Defects in <italic>dFmr1</italic> Mutant Larvae</title>
<p id="P22">The genetic data demonstrate that increased Wnd drives various neurological phenotypes in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant larvae and flies. If excess Wnd signaling drives defects in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants, then inhibiting the kinase activity of Wnd should also suppress <italic>dFmr1-</italic>dependent defects. Potent and selective kinase inhibitors of DLK, the mammalian ortholog of Wnd, block DLK-dependent neurodegenerative phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Patel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Pichon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Summers et al., 2018</xref>). We tested whether this DLK inhibitor (DLKi) can inhibit Wnd signaling. The most potent and best-described Wnd-dependent phenotype in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is the synaptic terminal overgrowth in <italic>hiw</italic> mutants, so we raised <italic>hiw</italic> mutant larvae on food dosed with the DLK inhibitor and assessed synaptic terminal morphology. In the <italic>hiw</italic> mutant, synaptic terminal overgrowth was fully suppressed when the larvae consumed DLK inhibitor-dosed food, while wild-type larvae raised on DLK inhibitor had no change in synaptic growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Thus, the DLK inhibitor suppresses the <italic>hiw</italic> NMJ phenotype, a downstream readout of increased Wnd MAP kinase signaling, as robustly as does genetic loss of <italic>wnd</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Collins et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, we conclude that the DLK inhibitor is an effective inhibitor of the Wnd kinase in <italic>Drosophila.</italic> We next raised <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants on the DLK inhibitor and analyzed synaptic morphology. As with the <italic>hiw</italic> mutant, the DLK inhibitor suppresses aberrant synaptic morphology in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6C</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). The <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants raised on the DLK inhibitor do not exhibit an increase in total or satellite boutons relative to wild type, while <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants raised on the vehicle retain these defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6C</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). Thus, pharmacological inhibition of Wnd kinase signaling can suppress synaptic development defects in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> FXS model.</p>

<title>Feeding Adult <italic>dFmr1</italic> Mutant Flies the DLK Inhibitor Blocks Repetitive Grooming Behaviors</title>
<p id="P23">The ultimate goal in developing therapies for FXS is to ameliorate the symptoms associated with the disorder. Given that the DLK inhibitor treatment suppresses synaptic development abnormalities in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant larvae, we tested if treatment with the DLK inhibitor could block excessive grooming behavior in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant flies. Since the behavioral defects could result from prior developmental defects, we first asked if treating developing larvae with the DLK inhibitor would suppress behavioral defects in adults. Larvae remained on the DLK inhibitor from embryonic stage through pupation, and flies were moved to regular food within 8 h of eclosion. Grooming behavior was observed and quantified on days 10 and 25 post-eclosion. Developmental treatment with the DLK inhibitor did not reverse defects in grooming behavior. <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants raised as larvae on either the DMSO or DLK inhibitor displayed excessive grooming activities at day 25 relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). We next asked if treating adult <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant flies with the DLK inhibitor, after larval and pupal development has occurred, is sufficient to block excessive grooming. Larvae were raised on regular food, and within 8 h of eclosion, adult flies to be tested for grooming were moved onto food dosed with the DMSO or DLK inhibitor and were examined for grooming behavior at days 10 and 25. Excitingly, feeding adult flies the DLK inhibitor is sufficient to prevent excessive grooming behavior in the <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). This suggests that aberrant Wnd signaling persists beyond development, and the deleterious effects of this signaling promotes excessive grooming behavior. Thus, Wnd signaling can be pharmacologically targeted to restore normal behavior to <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants, even after the bulk of neuronal development is complete, highlighting the possibility of targeting the Wnd/DLK signaling cascade for therapeutic intervention in FXS.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P24">FXS is a common and pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder for which there are no effective therapeutic strategies. Here, we demonstrate that the highly conserved MAP3K Wnd is dysregulated in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of FXS. <italic>wnd</italic> is an mRNA target of dFMRP in the fly nervous system, and Wnd protein levels are elevated in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants. Genetic depletion of <italic>wnd</italic> in larvae and adults lacking dFMRP suppresses aberrant neuronal morphology, physiology, and behavioral defects. Further, larvae and adults can be orally dosed with an inhibitor against the mammalian ortholog of Wnd to suppress NMJ development and adult behavioral defects. We conclude that aberrant Wnd signaling through its canonical MAP kinase cascade drives a wide variety of neurological defects imparted by the loss of dFMRP. This work highlights Wnd/DLK inhibition as a possible therapeutic strategy for FXS.</p>
<sec id="S11">
<title>FMRP: One RNA Binding Protein, Many Targets</title>
<p id="P25">The search for a single, key target of FMRP that could be leveraged to alleviate the symptoms of FXS has been challenging and has yet to yield a viable therapeutic strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Erickson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). This is perhaps not surprising, given that FMRP regulates a large set of target mRNAs, and the respective protein products have roles in virtually every aspect of neuronal function, including synaptic development and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, loss of FMRP drives defects in many biological processes, including basal translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Banerjee et al., 2018</xref>), epigenetic modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Korb et al., 2017</xref>), metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Weisz et al., 2018</xref>), and excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Contractor et al., 2015</xref>). As such, it was a surprising and exciting result that Wnd/DLK behaves as an essential, functionally relevant target for many of the neuronal phenotypes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of FXS.</p>
<p id="P26">Why might overactive Wnd/DLK signaling have such a profound impact on FXS? Activation of Wnd/DLK triggers wide-ranging effects throughout the neuron, including defects in the synapse, axon, and cell body. Asa MAP3K, Wnd phosphorylates downstream MAP kinases that both signal locally and activate a major transcriptional response governing critical cell stress pathways. We posit that reduction of Wnd/DLK signaling has such profound effects in suppressing <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutant phenotypes because the consequences of Wnd activation are not limited to a single pathway or cellular compartment. Of course, other FMRP targets also must contribute to neuronal dysfunction, and overactive Wnd/DLK signaling likely interacts with these other dysregulated proteins. Indeed, increased Wnd/DLK signaling in <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants and <italic>hiw</italic> mutants yields very different synaptic phenotypes, suggesting that the impact of Wnd/DLK activation is influenced by other molecular abnormalities in the <italic>dFmr1</italic> mutants. It will be critical in future studies to understand how downstream effectors of Wnd/DLK signaling interact with other dysregulated molecular pathways to govern the numerous neurological defects apparent in models of FXS.</p>

<title>DLK Signaling in Injury and Disease</title>
<p id="P27">Wnd/DLK signaling through its canonical MAP kinase cascade is a critical feature of the neuronal response to insult and injury. In acute axon injury paradigms, Wnd/DLK promotes distal axon degeneration by speeding up the turnover of axon survival factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Summers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). In the proximal axon, Wnd/DLK stimulates a retrograde signal to the neuronal cell body that can stimulate axon regeneration or neuronal cell death depending on the cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Shin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Watkins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Welsbie et al., 2013</xref>). This retrograde signal involves activation of the MAP kinase JNK and phosphorylation of the transcription factor Jun to mount the appropriate transcriptional response. In addition to responding to acute injury, there is emerging evidence that Wnd/DLK is chronically activated in neurodegenerative diseases. DLK and JNK signaling is active in both mouse models of and human patients with Alzheimer’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Pichon et al., 2017</xref>). The loss or inhibition of DLK protects against the progressive neuronal degeneration that occurs in these mouse models, paralleling our finding that progressive worsening of repetitive behaviors in the <italic>dFmr1</italic> fly can be reversed by the DLK inhibitor. We hypothesize that low-level, chronic activation of Wnd/DLK signaling might be a shared feature of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Indeed, it is estimated that 50%–70% of people with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hartley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Head et al., 2012</xref>), and premutations in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> gene can cause the neurodegenerative disorder fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hagerman and Hagerman, 2013</xref>), so a critical link may exist between development and degeneration.</p>

<title>Wnd/DLK as a Candidate Therapeutic Target in FXS</title>
<p id="P28">FXS is characterized by neuroanatomical and functional defects that are established during development, leading to lifelong cognitive, sensory, and behavioral abnormalities. However, from our work in the fly model of FXS, we propose that the key factors underlying this neurodevelopmental disorder can be parsed into two stages: neuronal development is disrupted by increased Wnd/DLK signaling, and aberrant Wnd/DLK signaling persists throughout the lifetime of the organism, further impairing neuronal function. This model is consistent with prior studies of FMRP-regulated processes, including metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Dölen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Hou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Huber et al., 2002</xref>). mGluR activation stimulates protein translation in dendritic spines, and normally FMRP inhibits translation to serve as a “brake”; the absence of FMRP leads to excessive translation of synaptic proteins and increased AMPA receptor internalization, driving synaptic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Dölen and Bear, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Muddashetty et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Stoppel et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, not only is initial development impaired due to improper levels of specific synaptic proteins, but increased flux through mGluR-dependent translational mechanisms drive ongoing perturbations to synaptic plasticity and function. This concept, which has made downregulation of mGluR signaling an attractive treatment approach, is critical when considering Wnd/DLK as a therapeutic target in FXS—there are signaling abnormalities that can be alleviated through inhibition of Wnd/DLK’s kinase function even after development is complete.</p>
<p id="P29">The idea of targeting Wnd/DLK for treatment in FXS has other advantages. First, Wnd/DLK is a MAP3K with numerous downstream signaling effectors; if DLK inhibition does not lend itself well to therapeutic inhibition, further examination of the signaling cascade may identify alternative approaches and targets. Second, while DLK is essential for embryonic development, conditional knockout of DLK later in life does not impact viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Miller et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that DLK inhibition is a reasonable therapeutic strategy. Finally, highly selective inhibitors against DLK are currently being tested in patients as treatments for neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Siu et al., 2018</xref>). Testing whether the FMRP-dependent regulation of DLK is conserved and functionally relevant in the mouse model of FXS is imperative, and positive results in such experiments may motivate additional translational studies.</p>

<title>Western Blots</title>
<p id="P36">To analyze protein levels in the third instar larval nervous system, ventral nerve cords (VNCs) were dissected and homogenized on ice in lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris ph 8.0, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 2 M urea, 1% v/v SDS, 20 mM Na3VO4, 1x Roche protease inhibitor) with a pestle. VNCs from 10 genetically identical flies were pooled into one lysate to achieve sufficient protein concentration, and the lysate was boiled for 10 minutes, and centrifuged at RT for 10 minutes at 13000 RPM. Gel electrophoresis and transfer were performed by standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). Membranes were blocked for 1 hour and incubated overnight at 4°C in primary antibody solution consisting of 5% milk solution in Tris-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween-20 (TBST), and one of the following antibodies: rabbit α-Wallenda (1:800), mouse α-dFMRP (5B6, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, 1:500), and mouse β-Tubulin (E7, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, 1:100). Primary antibody solution was removed, membranes were washed 3 times with TBST, and membranes were then incubated with HRP conjugated secondary antibodies to either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson, 1:10,000). After 1 hr of incubation, membranes were washed 3 times for 10 minutes in TBST, 1 time for 10 minutes in TBS, and developed using Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent Substrate (EMD Millipore). Membranes were imaged on a G:Box Chemi-XX6 (Syngene) and quantified using ImageJ. Wnd band intensities were normalized to the intensity of their respective β-Tubulin loading control band, and intensities are represented as fold change over the control genotype.</p>

<title>Cycloheximide Chase</title>
<p id="P37">To measure Wnd protein stability, an <italic>ex vivo</italic> preparation was employed to expose the intact nervous system to cycloheximide (CHX) for varying periods of time. Briefly, third instar larvae were dissected in ice-cold HL3.1. Upon exposure of the nervous system tissue and removal of gut tissue, dissected larvae were incubated in CHX (100 μg/mL) dissolved in HL3.1 for 6, 12, or 18 hours. After the indicated time, VNCs were dissected out and transferred to an Eppendorf tube, residual HL3.1 + CHX was removed with a pipette, and ice cold lysis buffer (described above) was added to VNC samples. 0hr time point samples were collected from VNCs after dissection in normal HL3.1. Samples were homogenized in lysis buffer, and a Micro BCA Assay was used to measure total protein and ensure equal loading across conditions and genotypes. Wnd, dFMRP, and Tub protein levels were measured and analyzed employing the western blot protocol described above. 8 to 10 VNCs were pooled per time point per genotype for each biological replicate of the CHX experiment, and 3 independent biological replicates were completed and are represented in the quantification. For each time point, Wnd protein intensities were normalized to levels of the loading control (Tub), and these values were normalized to the 0hr time point for the given genotype to present relative changes in Wnd levels over time.</p>

Homogenized lysate was spun at 4°C for 30 minutes and the pellet was discarded, and 500 uL of supernatant was collected. 50 uL of supernatant was collected and saved for Input blots. Protein G Dynabeads (Thermo Fischer Scientific, #10003D) were coupled to anti-dFMRP (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, 25 μg antibody per 40 uL beads) by rotating end over end for 2 hours at RT. The remaining 450 uL of supernatant was precleared with blank beads for 1 hour rotating at RT. The supernatant was then transferred to tubes containing the Dynabeads conjugated to dFMRP antibody, and tubes were rotated overnight at 4°C. The following day, the beads were collected, washed 5 times for 1 minute each in a high-salt wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4,350 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, and 1 U/μL RNAsin), and resuspended in 200 uL of lysis buffer. 50 uL was collected and processed for western blot to assess immunoprecipitation of dFMRP, and 150 uL was added to 100 uL of PBS and 750 uL Trizol to be processed for RNA extraction.</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p id="P48">Intracellular recordings were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Daniels et al., 2004</xref>). In brief, wandering 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae were dissected in Ca<sup>2+</sup> free HL3.1 buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Feng et al., 2004</xref>) (70 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm trehalose, 5 mm HEPES, and 0 mm Ca<sup>2+</sup>, pH 7.2) and then washed with and recorded in HL3.1 buffer containing 0.35 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Spontaneous mEPSPs and evoked EPSPs were recorded from muscle 6 in segments A2, A3, and A4 using borosilicate sharp electrodes (15–20 MΩ). Intracellular recordings were only used if a resting membrane potential between −60 and −80 mV could be maintained through the duration of the recording and if the muscle input resistance was &gt; 5 MΩ. We did not observe significant differences in resting membrane potential or input resistance between genotypes in any experiment. 75 consecutive spontaneous events were measured per cell using MiniAnalysis Software (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA) to determine mEPSP mean amplitude and frequency. Evoked EPSPs were recorded by sucking the end of a cut segmental nerve into a stimulating electrode and stimulating with a 1 ms pulse of sufficient amperage to recruit both axons innervating muscle 6. EPSP amplitude was calculated by averaging 75 consecutive evoked events at 2 Hz using pClamp9 software (Molecular Devices). Quantal content (QC) for each individual cell was estimated by dividing the average EPSP amplitude by the average mEPSP amplitude.</p>

<title>Imaging and Image Analysis</title>
<p id="P49">To assess synaptic growth, larvae stained for DVGlut and HRP were imaged using a 40x-oil or63x-oil immersion objective on a Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope. Images shown are maximal Z-projections of confocal stacks. Images for a given experiment (including experiments described below) were taken simultaneously using identical laser power, gain, and offset settings using the same step-size. Synaptic growth was quantified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Brace et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Collins et al., 2006</xref>). Briefly, DVGlut-positive boutons were manually counted at larval muscle 4, segments A2 through A4, from at least 4 larvae per genotype. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, both the total number of boutons and the number of satellite boutons were collected during counting. Satellite boutons were defined as boutons that were 1) smaller in size than immediately adjacent boutons and 2) emerging from an adjacent bouton rather than being spaced along a section of HRP positive nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Dickman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Lee and Wu, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p id="P50">To assess Wnd levels, larval ventral nerve cords were imaged using a 20x-oil immersion objective. Wnd levels were measured by analyzing confocal stacks for fluorescence intensity using ImageJ software (NIH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). A mask was created using the HRP channel to select the entire area encompassed by nervous system membrane. The mask was then applied to the stacks in which the Wnd channel had been isolated, and the mean intensity for the entire area was acquired. Mean Wnd/GFP intensities were normalized to the total area of the VNC compartment, and then presented as the fold change over the WT (control) intensity.</p>
<p id="P51">To assess levels of synaptic proteins (Brp, DGluRIII, DGluRIIA, DGluRIIB), NMJs were imaged using a63x-oil immersion objective, and confocal stacks were collected and analyzed for fluorescence intensity using ImageJ software (NIH). A mask was created using the HRP channel to select the entire synaptic terminal area, and the mask was applied to stacks in which the channel of interest had been isolated. The mean intensity for the entire area was acquired, normalized to the total area of the synaptic terminal, and presented as either 1) the ratio of expression of receptor subunits, found by dividing the mean DGluRIIA intensity by the mean DGluRIIB intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>) or 2) the mean intensity of the given protein (Brp and DGluRIII) across the entire terminal in arbitrary units (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3G</xref>).</p>
<p id="P52">To quantify mushroom body phenotypes in adult fly brains, mushroom body structures were imaged using a 20x-oil immersion objective. ImageJ software was used to measure the α and β lobe widths for each individual mushroom body. Using these data, an α/β lobe width ratio was calculated by dividing the α lobe width by the β lobe width for each individual mushroom body, and the average ratio for each genotype is presented. As the mushroom body is a symmetrical paired structure, each brain contains a set of two α lobes and two β lobes, both of which were quantified in each brain. Thus, each brain contributed an N of 2, with lobes exhibiting damage from the dissection being excluded from analyses. To calculate the percent penetrance of thin α lobe phenotypes, we defined “thin a lobe” as an α lobe with a width that was less than the WT mean width minus two-standard deviations. α lobes that met this criterion were classified as “thin,” and counted toward the percent of lobes exhibiting the thin phenotype.</p>

<title>DLK Inhibitor Experiments</title>
<p id="P53">GNE-3511 (MedChem Express HY-12947) referred to as DLKi, was resuspended from powder into 10 mM aliquots in DMSO. To dose larvae or flies with DLKi, the drug was diluted to either 35 uM (larvae) or 50 uM (adults) in the appropriate quantity of water to add to Formula 4–24 Instant <italic>Drosophila</italic> Medium Blue Food (Carolina, #173210) to make enough food to fill the bottom of an empty vial. For larval experiments, crosses were made directly on Blue Food such that egg-laying took place on food dosed with either control (DMSO in water) or DLKi, and larvae were exposed to drugged food for the entirety of development until dissection. For adults, flies were collected within 8 hours of eclosion and moved immediately to Blue Food with either control or DLKi. Adult flies were moved onto fresh Blue Food with the respective treatment every 5 days to ensure the drug remained active.</p>

Briefly, male and female virgin flies of each genotype and/or drug condition were collected within 8 hours of eclosion and housed on either regular food (for genetic experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and larval dosing experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) or Blue Food prepared and dosed with either drug vehicle (DMSO) or DLKi at 50 uM. 12 hours prior to testing, flies were lightly anesthetized on ice and housed individually and moved to the behavioral testing room. On the testing day, each individual fly was gently tapped into a testing chamber comprised of a small clear plastic Petri dish with an agar coated bottom. After one minute of acclimation to the chamber, grooming behaviors were observed for 3 minutes. A stopwatch was used to record the duration of grooming activities and count the number of grooming bouts initiated. After the trial, flies were rehoused on the appropriate medium. Flies were tested at days 10 and 25 post-eclosion. No significant differences in grooming were observed between male and female flies from the same genotype at any age or treatment, thus all data presented are from roughly equal numbers of male and female flies.</p>

<title>QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</title>
<p id="P55">For all NMJ immunostaining and electrophysiological experiments, each NMJ terminal is considered an <italic>N</italic> of 1 since each presynaptic motor neuron is confined to its own muscle hemisegment. To control for variability between larvae within a genotype in these experiments, all data were collected from a minimum of 4 different larvae. With the exception of <italic>hiw</italic> experiments, in which only males were assessed because <italic>hiw</italic> is on the X chromosome, male and female larvae were used in equal numbers and it was confirmed that there are no statistical differences in NMJ morphology or physiology between males and females. For Wnd intensity experiments, each VNC contributed an <italic>N</italic> of 1.</p>
<p id="P56">In all immunostaining (larval and adult) experiments, animals were dissected and the data were analyzed blinded to genotype, and genotype was only decoded after the analysis was complete. For electrophysiology, the experimenter was blinded to genotype while recording and genotypes were decoded after traces were analyzed. For behavior, experimenter was blinded to genotype and condition, and individual flies were observed for grooming in random order, with each individual trial for each fly contributing an <italic>N</italic> of 1. Genotypes and conditions were decoded after the experiments were complete.</p>
<p id="P57">For all biochemistry experiments (Western blots and RNA-IP), each experiment was repeated at least three times with larvae and/or flies derived from independently made crosses. Each lane was loaded with protein from a pooled sample of 8–10 VNCs for a given genotype and experiment, and each experiment was independently conducted at least 3 times.</p>

<title>Overexpression of dFMRP Suppresses Synaptic Overgrowth and Decreases Wnd Protein Levels in hiw Mutant Larvae</title>
<p id="P65">(A) Representative images of the NMJ synaptic terminal at muscle 4 in third-instar larvae. For all genotypes, the pan-neuronal driver Elav-GAL4 was used to express the given transgene, and the wild-type (WT) control is Elav-GAL4 in an otherwise wild-type background driving UAS-RFP. NMJs were stained for the presynaptic bouton marker DVGLUT (green) and nerve membrane marker HRP (red). Scale bar: 25 μm.</p>
<p id="P66">(B) Quantification of the mean (±SEM) number of DVGlut+ boutons per muscle 4 NMJ in each genotype. Overexpression of dFMRP completely suppresses NMJ overgrowth in <italic>hiw</italic> mutants.</p>
