<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The potential for adverse effects of alcohol (ethanol) on the developing fetus has been recognized for centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B1">1</xref>). The modern era of medical study began after the publications by Lemoine and coworkers in 1968 and by Jones and coworkers in 1973 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B3">3</xref>). They identified stillbirths, prematurity, growth retardation, cognitive delay, face and limb anomalies, microcephaly, and cardiac defects. The first autopsy description of presumed alcohol-related teratogenic effects documented microphthalmia, partially fused cerebral hemispheres with leptomeningeal hamartomas, simplified gyral pattern, large lateral ventricles, and agenesis of the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B4">4</xref>). Images from this extreme case have been widely reproduced in publications and on the Internet. This was originally termed fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The more recent designation, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), encompasses cases with functional abnormalities but not necessarily overt physical anomalies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B5">5</xref>). However, the clinical diagnostic criteria (which include historical evidence of in utero alcohol exposure, facial anomalies, growth rate, head size, and neurodevelopmental features) are not unanimously agreed upon, with several different methods in use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B6">6–9</xref>).</p>
<p>The prevalence of FASD has been difficult to determine, due to underreporting of maternal alcohol use and differences in diagnostic criteria. In the broad population up to 0.5% might be affected, while in certain geographic groups &gt;20% might be affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B10">10</xref>). FASD is among the most common neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B12">12</xref>) and is associated with substantial costs to society because of lost productivity due to premature mortality and morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B13">13</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the apparently high prevalence of FASD, neuropathological findings have been described in only 33 autopsy cases of suspected FASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B14">14–18</xref>). Reported abnormalities include micrencephaly, regional cortical dysgenesis, leptomeningeal heterotopias, hydrocephalus, holoprosencephaly, neural tube closure defects, partial or complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellum, and brainstem dysgenesis. In addition, ∼80 fetuses with a history of prenatal alcohol exposure (PNAE) have been described; the most convincing features are subtle abnormalities of the cortical vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B19">19–21</xref>) (see details of all known prior autopsy reports in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Data</xref> S1). Quantitative neuroimaging studies on people with FASD highlight the micrencephaly, abnormal gyral patterns, reductions in regional brain volume (primarily basal ganglia, diencephalon, and cerebellum), and abnormalities of the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B22">22–25</xref>).</p>
<p>The reported autopsy material tends to document extreme abnormalities that are less frequently reported in the imaging literature. Therefore, our goals were (1) to assemble a community-based autopsy database of cases with reported PNAE and/or FASD diagnosis, (2) to document the epidemiological and neuropathological features of those cases, and (3) to assemble a collection of tissues to be used for future studies capable of validating pathogenetic hypotheses that have arisen from animal experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B26">26</xref>), including the potential association between PNAE and epigenetic modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B27">27</xref>).</p>

<title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
<sec>
<title>Identification of Cases</title>
<p>Ethics approval was obtained from the Health Research Ethics Board of the University of Manitoba (approval #HS13161 – H2011:213). We conducted a retrospective survey of autopsies performed at the Health Sciences Centre (HSC) in Winnipeg, Canada from 1980 to 2016. HSC serves a population of about 1.3 million people. Manitoba has a relatively high prevalence of FASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B28">28</xref>) and has had a centralized diagnostic center for 2 decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B29">29</xref>). One of the coauthors (A.E.C.) has been a leader in developing diagnostic criteria for FASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B30">30</xref>). Approximately 1100 autopsies are performed annually, among which ∼80% are medico-legal. The total includes 100–200 fetal/pediatric cases and ∼350 complete brain examinations per year. All pediatric autopsies since 1980 and all adult autopsies since 1996 (both medico-legal and family permission) are amenable to full-text search using DocFetcher software (SourceForge.net; open source software license from Eclipse Public License).</p>
<p>The senior author (M.R.D.) identified candidate cases by whole text search using a wide range of key words related to alcohol consumption during pregnancy or a clinical diagnosis of FASD; e.g. EtOH, alcohol, ethanol, booze, fetal alcohol, FASD, FAS, pFAS, FAE, ARND, ARBD, binge, drink, drank, drunk, liquor, beer, wine, vodka, whisky, home brew, substance abuse, etc. The clinical details of ∼500 reports were screened; ∼200 cases with probable PNAE or FASD were identified. Files predating 1994 had been scanned into searchable PDF format from microfilms, which at times did not allow for perfect text recognition. Candidate reports were thoroughly reviewed and summarized by the first author (J.S.J). Cases with a diagnosis or “suspected” FASD diagnosis were further investigated by review of records in the Program in Genetics and Metabolism database, the Manitoba FASD Centre (formerly the Clinic for Alcohol &amp; Drug Exposed Children; established in 1999), or by hospital chart review. Cases that were not confirmed remained “suspected”, as a physician might have made the diagnosis without referral to the Manitoba FASD Centre, where a multidisciplinary team assessment is standard. The inclusion criteria were met by 174 cases.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Age Groupings and Descriptive Epidemiology</title>
<p>Cases were divided into 5 age groups: fetuses (stillborn/intrauterine death; n = 52); infants (1 day old to 12 months of age, including premature births; n = 65); children (13 months to 12 years; n = 32); teens (13–19 years; n = 14); and adults (20–65 years; n = 11). Details extracted from the reports included age, sex, birth characteristics (gestation, weight, method of birth, stillborn/liveborn), and maternal health and substance abuse during pregnancy (e.g. disease, infections, estimated alcohol use, tobacco use, other drug use, age at birth, prior abortions, parity and gravida, level of prenatal care, etc.). The maternal details were seldom available for children, teens, and adults. Additional information in these age groups included the history of FASD diagnosis, history of foster care or contact with Child &amp; Family Services, history of epilepsy, and the individuals’ own substance abuse. Autopsy details included cause of death, brain weight, FASD facial anomalies (short palpebral fissures, smooth philtrum, and thin upper lip), other facial anomalies, abnormal palmar creases, and congenital abnormalities affecting other body regions (heart, kidneys, and skeletal). Brain weight percentiles were classified as &lt;5th, &gt;5th – ≤50th, &gt;50th – ≤95<sup>th</sup>, and &gt;95th percentile according to published autopsy databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B31">31–34</xref>). A brain weight &lt;5th percentile was classified as micrencephalic. Microcephaly is usually defined as a head circumference of ≤3rd percentile, but it may not be a sensitive marker of PNAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B35">35</xref>). Because this is a retrospective analysis, almost all cases were missing some information. Percentage values only represent cases for which information was reported; they are not based on the totals.</p>
<p>Maternal alcohol ingestion was difficult to estimate because descriptors concerning amount, timing, and duration of alcohol exposure were varied. We broadly categorized alcohol ingestion as minimal/moderate use (“one episode of drinking”, “occasional alcohol”, “in the first trimester only”, etc.) or heavy/chronic use (“binge drinking”, “drinking heavily throughout pregnancy”, “arrived in hospital intoxicated and in labor”, etc.). Descriptors such as “drank during pregnancy”, “mother abuses alcohol”, or “mother has a history of alcohol abuse” were harder to classify. In rare cases, other children in the family had been diagnosed with FASD, but the mother denied current alcohol use.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Neuropathologic Examinations</title>
<p>Photographs of the brain were retrieved to verify gross abnormalities. Complete neuropathological assessment was conducted in 135 cases. Nine stillborn infants had autolytic liquefaction of the brain, which was not examined by microscopy. Among the teen and adult cases, the forensic pathologist cut 6 brains fresh with only 1 or 2 tissue samples saved for histology, and in 8 cases the brain was not examined. In general, brain samples had been fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 1–2 weeks, and then select regions were embedded in paraffin. Cases with a complete examination by a neuropathologist had, at a minimum, samples taken of parasagittal frontal lobe (level of caudate nucleus head), basal nuclei, hippocampus/medial temporal lobe, thalamus, midbrain, pons, and posterior cerebellum. In all cases, the glass slides (or recut slides) were reviewed by the senior author (M.R.D.), an experienced neuropathologist. The minimum histologic evaluation included hematoxylin and eosin staining of 5-µm-thick paraffin sections mounted on glass slides.</p>

<title>Stillbirth and Intrapartum Deaths</title>
<p>In the stillborn/intrapartum death cohort, we had 52 fetuses (20–41 weeks gestation, median 32 weeks gestation), with an almost equal ratio of male to females (25:27). Three pregnancies were electively terminated for malformation (neural tube defects for 2, kidney and bladder defects for 1), 5 cases were live born premature infants who died &lt;1 day, and the remaining 44 were stillborn fetuses. Most (38/52) were premature (&lt;37 weeks). Birth weight was below the 10th percentile (definition of small for gestational age) in 22 cases (11 of which were below the 5th percentile). The maternal age ranged from 15 to 39 years (median 25 years). Nine mothers had a vaginal or sexually transmitted infection at the time of birth and 5 had diabetes (Type I or II, 4 cases; gestational diabetes, 1 case). When indicated, &gt;75% reported poor or no prenatal care during their pregnancy. Twelve cases had exclusively early/first trimester alcohol exposure (3 “minimal” and 4 “heavy”), 21 cases had the vague description of minimal use during pregnancy or history of alcohol use, and 19 had descriptors suggesting more substantial use into the second trimester or throughout pregnancy. In addition to alcohol ingestion, 86% of mothers smoked tobacco during the pregnancy and 77% abused other illicit drugs (when reported).</p>
<p>Anomalies were identified in the heart (n = 5), kidneys (n = 3), and skeletal system (n = 10). Diagnostic FASD facial anomalies were identified in 3 cases and other facial anomalies were identified in 10 cases. Placentas were examined in 50/52 cases; 16 were normal, 16 had chorioamnionitis / villis inflammation, 10 had hemorrhage or focal infarction, 4 had features or placental abruption and the remaining 4 cases has other findings.</p>
<p>Brain weight was &lt;5th percentile in 10 cases. Congenital neuropathological findings included 4 cases with neural tube defects (2 lumbosacral, 1 exencephaly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nlx064-F1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>), 1 anencephaly), 1 case with a complex brain malformation (moderately severe hydrocephalus due to aqueduct stenosis, partial agenesis of the posterior corpus callosum) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nlx064-F1">Fig. 1C-H</xref>), and 1 case with alobar holoprosencephaly. Multiple congenital anomalies were found in 2 cases. Acquired neuropathological findings included 12 cases with widespread hypoxic neuronal damage (typically apoptotic neurons in the hippocampus and pons), 2 cases with small periventricular hemorrhages, and 1 case with small foci of white matter necrosis (periventricular leukomalacia). Among the cases with placental anomalies, 12 brains had hypoxic neuron damage, 5 brains were not examined due to severe autolysis, 2 brains were not examined (for unknown reasons), 1 case had a neural tube defect, and 1 case had periventricular leukomalacia.

<title>Infants</title>
<p>In the infant cohort, 65 individuals died between the ages of ≥1 day and 12 months (median 5 weeks). Male sex predominated (65%), 24 (39%) were premature, and 4 had a birth weight &lt;5th percentile. Mother’s age at birth ranged from 15 to 40 years of age (median 24 years). Eighteen reported poor or no prenatal care (no information was available for the remainder). At the time of birth, 5 mothers had a vaginal/sexually transmitted infection (or had been treated for one during the pregnancy). Two had diabetes (1 type II and 1 gestational), 1 had tuberculosis, 1 had hypertension, and 1 had Grave’s disease. In terms of PNAE, 17 (26%) cases had a maternal history of alcohol use/abuse, 19 (29%) reportedly drank alcohol during/throughout the pregnancy, 9 had minimal or occasional alcohol during pregnancy, 11 had documented drinking during a specific trimester (first: 6 cases, second: 4 cases, and third: 1 case) with the amount unspecified, and 7 had heavy/chronic use of alcohol during pregnancy (2 during the first trimester exclusively). Seven infants had a history of seizures/epilepsy; among these 3/7 had been born prematurely, and 2/7 had multiple congenital anomalies. The top 4 causes of death were sudden unexplained death in an infant (SUDI) (28%), complications due to malformations (23%), infection/sepsis (bacterial or viral) (19%), and unsafe sleeping environment (17%).</p>
<p>Fourteen cases had heart defects, 6 had kidney defects, and 4 had skeletal system defects. Twelve cases had typical FASD facial anomalies and 12 had other facial anomalies. Only 6 cases had placental examination; 3 had chorioamnionitis (no brain abnormalities), 1 had abruption (rare heterotopia in frontal leptomeninges), and 2 were normal.</p>
<p>Eight cases (13%) had a brain weight below the 5th percentile (i.e. micrencephaly). One case had lumbosacral myelomeningocele with Chiari Type 2 malformation (NTD), 1 case had lumbar diplomyelia (NTD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nlx064-F3">Fig. 3A, B</xref>), 4 cases had hydrocephalus (2 mild; 2 with agenesis of posterior corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nlx064-F2">Fig. 2A-F and G-J</xref>)) and 1 case had agenesis of posterior corpus callosum and microcephaly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nlx064-F2">Fig. 2K</xref>). Four cases had only minor leptomeningeal heterotopias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nlx064-F3">Fig. 3C-G</xref>). Nonmalformative neuropathologic findings included 10 cases with hypoxic-ischemic neuronal changes or resolving brain hemorrhage (complications of premature birth), 1 case with periventricular leukomalacia (infant had been born at term), and 5 cases with bacterial meningitis. Among the 7 infants with a history of seizures or epilepsy, the hippocampi were normal.

<title>Children</title>
<p>In the child cohort, 32 individuals died between 13 months and 12 years of age (median 3.5 years). Most were female (59%). A minority of autopsy reports documented maternal factors (18%) or details of the child’s birth (28%); this is likely because the details were less relevant to the child’s cause of death. Four cases had a confirmed FASD diagnosis, while 12 had a suspected FASD diagnosis. Seven cases had a seizure disorder or epilepsy. A bacterial or viral infection was the cause of death in 50%, followed by drowning or other environmental cause in 19%.</p>
<p>Six cases had a heart defect, 3 had kidney defects and 10 had skeletal anomalies. Seven cases had FASD facial anomalies, and 4 cases had other facial anomalies.</p>
<p>Six cases (21%) had a brain weight &lt;5th percentile; 3 of these had ischemic brain lesions acquired in the perinatal period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nlx064-F5">Fig. 5A-G</xref>). One case, with a brain weight &lt;10th percentile, had mild delay in cerebral myelination and mildly enlarged cerebral ventricles. Three cases had moderate to severe hydrocephalus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nlx064-F4">Fig. 4A-H</xref>), and 1 had Miller-Dieker type lissencephaly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nlx064-F4">Fig. 4I</xref>). Nonmalformative neuropathologic findings include 4 cases with residual damage due to hypoxic and hemorrhagic complications of premature birth, 1 with an old occipital lobe hemorrhagic infarct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nlx064-F5">Fig. 5H</xref>), 1 with severe acute brain trauma, 1 with acute meningitis, and 1 with chronic damage related to perinatal meningitis. Among the 7 cases with seizure disorder/epilepsy, 3 had hippocampi with neuron loss and reactive glial changes (“mesial temporal sclerosis”).

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<sec>
<title>Mortality and PNAE/FASD</title>
<p>The risk of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth increases with the quantity of alcohol consumed during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B36">36–38</xref>). In utero PNAE deaths have been linked to placental insufficiency, which can result in hypoxia, and intrauterine growth restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B39">39</xref>). In humans, alcohol consumption was positively correlated with placental hemorrhage and accelerated villous maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B40">40</xref>). Administration of ethanol to Rhesus macaque monkeys daily for the first 60 days of gestation is associated with decreased placental blood flow and reduced fetal brain size at 110 days gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B41">41</xref>). In the present study, placental abnormalities (including abruption) were documented in at least 68% of the fetal (and some infant) cases. Half of those cases were born prematurely and had a birth weight below the 50th percentile. Cigarette smoking, which is common among women who drink during pregnancy, is also a contributing factor to fetal hypoxia due to vasoconstrictor effects on the placental and umbilical cord vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B42">42</xref>).</p>
<p>PNAE is also associated with increased risk of infant and child mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B43">43</xref>). Among our infant and child cohorts, 32% had a documented history of premature birth, which increases the risk for adverse neurological outcome or early death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B44">44</xref>). A search of the medical literature for information concerning mortality and FASD identified only 57 individuals, majority of whom died within the first year of life (54%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B45">45</xref>). Contributors to death were heart malformations (76%), brain malformations (51%), sepsis (14%), kidney malformations (14%), and cancer (8%). In our infant and child cohorts, 19% had infections and 23% had severe malformations that contributed to death. In the remainder, the cause of death was not obvious. Sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) is defined as the death between the ages 1 day and 12 months that remains unexplained by autopsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B46">46</xref>). Risk factors for SUDI include premature birth, household tobacco smoke exposure, and unsafe sleep conditions (e.g. bed sharing with an adult; 17% in our infant cohort). Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy may be associated with continued use during the postnatal period and a risk for child neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B47">47</xref>). In our PNAE/FASD cohorts, 19% of infants and 44% of children were either in foster care at the time of death or involved with child and family services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B48">48</xref>).</p>
<p>Teens and young adults with FASD have disabilities such as mental illness, reckless and criminal behavior, and substance abuse problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B5">5</xref>), which put them at risk for suicide (7/25 in our combined teen and adult cohorts), homicide (6/25), and accidental traumatic or drug-related deaths (5/25).</p>

<title>Brain Abnormalities in PNAE and FASD</title>
<p>PNAE is postulated to interfere with normal neurological development through a range of mechanisms, including alteration of gene expression through epigenetic modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B49">49</xref>), interference with neural crest cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B50">50</xref>), cell toxicity through reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B51">51</xref>), apoptosis of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B52">52</xref>), damage to radial glia and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B53">53</xref>), and inappropriate activation of microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B54">54</xref>). In our cohorts collectively, the observed brain malformations were micrencephaly (31 cases), neural tube defects (6 cases), dysgenesis of the posterior corpus callosum combined with hydrocephalus (3 cases), isolated hydrocephalus of varied etiology and severity (5 cases), dysgenesis of the posterior corpus callosum combined with other minor anomalies (2 cases), isolated minor leptomeningeal heterotopias (4 cases), and ischemic/vascular brain lesions not attributable to a complication of birth or prematurity (6 cases) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="nlx064-T2">Table 2</xref> for summary). The 3 youngest age groups had the most severe brain abnormalities. At least 2 factors might explain this: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B1">1</xref>) the most severe malformations often involve multiple organ systems and are therefore likely to cause early death; or (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B2">2</xref>) among people who survived to adulthood, the ascertainment of FASD in the death investigation might be less reliable. In a meta-analysis of 127 clinical studies in which imaging was used to identify brain anomalies, 428 comorbid conditions were identified in individuals with FASD. These included microcephaly (62%), congenital hydrocephalus (58%), malformations of the corpus callosum (31%), epilepsy (21%), and spina bifida (&lt;3%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B55">55</xref>). In a recent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging study of 62 children and teens with FASD, thin (hypoplastic) corpus callosum was found in 24, partial agenesis was found in 2, and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia in 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B56">56</xref>). Also using MR imaging, small corpus callosum was identified in newborns with PNAE even after adjusting for brain volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B58">58</xref>). In the absence of reliable normative data and photographs of mid-sagittal brain slices, subtle hypoplasia of the corpus callosum might be underreported in autopsy material. We identified a history of epilepsy or seizures in 19/122 (16%) cases (excluding stillbirths); among them 5 had micrencephaly, 4 had hydrocephalus, 3 had mesial temporal sclerosis, 3 had multiple congenital anomalies, and 2 had a history of meningitis. In the absence of an overt brain abnormality, epilepsy suggests that there may be subtle neuronal abnormalities in PNAE brains. Three-dimensional analysis of brain surface contours on MR images indicates that children and adolescents with FASD have significantly smoother cortices than controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B25">25</xref>). One MR imaging study showed reduced thickness of neocortex (males only), reduced regional brain volumes, and altered fractional anisotropy (“microstructure”) in white matter tracts of FASD children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B59">59</xref>). However, another study showed increased cortical thickness in FASD subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B60">60</xref>). Unfortunately, in the absence of postmortem imaging, it is difficult to mirror these quantitative parameters using conventional histopathological methods and, further, the structural correlate of fractional anisotropy changes is unclear.

<p>The possible contributions of PNAE to nervous system malformations must be considered in the context of developmental timing. Neural tube defects typically occur during weeks 3–4 of human gestation, although cranial defects due to amniotic band adhesions could develop later. Among our 6 cases with neural tube defects, drinking exclusively in the first trimester was reported in 1 case and drinking throughout pregnancy was reported in the others. Ethanol administered to pregnant rats on gestational days 6–12 is associated with delayed closure of the caudal neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B61">61</xref>), although the adverse effect of alcohol on neural tube closure in mice seems to be strain specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B62">62</xref>). In humans, pioneer axons of the corpus callosum genu appear during gestational weeks 11–12, with the posterior aspect (splenium) developing during weeks 16–18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B63">63</xref>). We identified 5 cases with corpus callosum dysgenesis (3 combined with hydrocephalus). The historical information was suggestive of high levels of PNAE (1 heavy drinking, 3 drinking throughout the pregnancy, and 1 binges in the first trimester). Corpus callosum anomalies in animal PNAE experiments are generally subtle. Sheep fetuses exposed to alcohol from gestational day 30–60 had activated microglia in the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B64">64</xref>). Three-day-old male, but not female, rats exposed to alcohol from gestational day 6 to birth had a ∼20% reduction in corpus callosum area, however this was associated with overall reduction in brain volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B65">65</xref>). In contrast to humans, 3- to 5-year-old macaque monkeys with PNAE had enlarged corpus callosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B66">66</xref>). Neocortical leptomeningeal heterotopias, which reflect migration through the damaged glia limitans/pia mater, are postulated to occur in midgestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B67">67</xref>). Periventricular heterotopias reflect failed migration of germinal cells away from the ventricle wall. Although this is location-dependent, heterotopia along the roof of the ventricle likely indicate an insult before 20 weeks gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B68">68</xref>). The timing of an insult that causes isolated hydrocephalus is difficult to determine; the cerebral aqueduct can be secondarily obstructed at any time during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B69">69</xref>). Among our 9 cases with hydrocephalus, 6 had aqueduct stenosis with some disorganization and chronic reactive astroglial changes, 1 had a venous anomaly compressing the aqueduct, and 2 had no obvious site of cerebrospinal fluid obstruction. Historical information did not identify a particular period of alcohol exposure. In a rat model of PNAE, a small proportion of offspring developed severe hydrocephalus with periventricular heterotopia; the site of cerebrospinal fluid obstruction was not identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B70">70</xref>).</p>
<p>The most common brain abnormality, micrencephaly (31 cases), cannot be attributed to a specifically timed insult. Hypotrophy of the brain could be caused by interference with progenitor cell proliferation, or through toxin-induced death of cells. Long projection neurons are generated in the first half of gestation, but interneuron and glial progenitors are generated well into the third trimester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B71">71</xref>). Alternately, neurons of normal quantity could be small because they fail to mature properly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B72">72</xref>). We found no evidence for an obvious defect in myelination.</p>
<p>Hypoxic–ischemic lesions were very common. In the stillborn population, scattered dead neurons are likely due to hypoxia immediately preceding death and 7 cases had lesions that could be attributed to complications of premature birth. Six cases had discrete regions of infarction that appeared to represent pre or perinatal insults. Three were arterial zone (one with cardiac anomaly) and one was deep periventricular. Compared to controls, alcohol-exposed human fetuses from 31 to 38 weeks gestation showed disorganized radial organization and angular branching of the cortical microvessels, which were immunolabeled with antibody to GluN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B21">21</xref>). However, the pathogenesis of these large lesions, which correspond to the clinical entity known as perinatal arterial ischemic stroke, is difficult to explain on the basis of alcohol exposure alone. Other prenatal risk factors include prolonged rupture of amniotic membranes, preeclampsia, maternal smoking, infection, thrombophilia, and congenital heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B73">73</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>PNAE and FASD Are Not Monofactorial Exposure Problems</title>
<p>In our PNAE cases with maternal information available, a large majority of mothers smoked tobacco (89%) or abused other drugs (83%) during their pregnancies. Furthermore, many had other diseases that can be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including diabetes (8 cases), hypertension (1 case), obesity (1 case), and sexually transmitted infections (14 cases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B74">74</xref>). When reported, 88% of mothers had poor or no prenatal care. Poor nutrition is known to increase the risk of FASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B75">75</xref>). There is good evidence that harmful effects of toxins on the fetus may be either additive or synergistic, which confounds any attempt to attribute a causal effect to PNAE alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B77">77</xref>). For example, administration of ethanol alone to pregnant rats on gestational day 9–12 had no adverse effects on the embryos, while the combination of ethanol and nicotine significantly retarded embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B78">78</xref>). Nicotine has a constricting effect on the uterine arteries, which in turn reduces the amount of oxygenated blood the fetus receives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B79">79</xref>). Maternal cigarette smoking causes episodic carbon monoxide and cyanide elevations in blood, which is associated with reduced head growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B80">80</xref>). MR imaging of female (but not male) adolescents showed that maternal cigarette smoking was associated with reduced size of posterior corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B81">81</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>As with any retrospective human autopsy study, this report has limitations. Maternal histories and details of PNAE were inconsistently reported and self-reported levels of consumption are frequently lower than reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B82">82</xref>). Therefore, our estimate of alcohol consumption is crude. There remains uncertainty whether low doses of alcohol have any adverse effect in pregnant humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B83">83</xref>). Because these autopsy cases were acquired over several decades, the FASD diagnostic criteria were not applied uniformly and the information collected at autopsy differed. Brain sampling also varied because several different neuropathologists did the examinations. Hopefully the prospective study being conducted by the Prenatal Alcohol in SIDS and Stillbirth Network will overcome some of these problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B84">84</xref>). There was likely a referral and ascertainment bias, particularly among the teenage and adult death groups. Only one of the teenage FASD brains available for study had micrencephaly, which is reportedly the most common abnormality. However, the circumstances of death were often associated with brain swelling; therefore, reliance on the brain weight could mask the presence of preexisting micrencephaly. The 2 cases with anomalies typically ascribed to genetic mutations (holoprosencephaly and Miller–Dieker lissencephaly) did not undergo genetic testing. Overall, we can only report on the associations between PNAE/FASD and human brain abnormalities; we cannot ascribe a cause–effect relationship.</p>

<p>This is the largest study of human PNAE and FASD autopsy brains reported. The information elicited is important, despite the deficiencies. There is no characteristic neuropathologic pattern associated with PNAE or FASD. Malformations must be distinguished from in utero vascular insults and complications of prematurity, which can contribute to the neurological phenotype but might be only indirectly related to PNAE. The almost ubiquitous concurrent use of tobacco is a critical point because of its direct association with placental dysfunction. Some of the brain features of PNAE/FASD might be teratogenic in the sense of a direct adverse effect of ethanol on brain development. However, we also provide indirect evidence that some of the brain damage might be caused by hypoxic/ischemic events. Although animal studies are necessary to understand the human abnormalities related to PNAE, the animal research community might be doing a disservice by focusing too much on fine details of ethanol-alone teratogenicity. Increased attention should be paid to combined toxicities, in particular ethanol plus nicotine or other vasoactive agents in tobacco. With respect to the clinical diagnosis of FASD, information more specific than “structural brain anomalies” should be provided, considering the diverse pathogenesis of these anomalies. Prevention through avoidance of alcohol, tobacco, and other substance abuse during pregnancy must be the main societal goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="nlx064-B85">85</xref>). Nevertheless, tissues accrued in the current study will be used to validate hypotheses about the pathogenesis of FASD that have been developed in animal experimentation.</p>
