<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">The human N-terminal acetyltransferase E (NatE) contains NAA10 and NAA50 catalytic, and NAA15 auxiliary subunits and associates with HYPK, a protein with intrinsic NAA10 inhibitory activity. NatE co-translationally acetylates the N-terminus of half the proteome to mediate diverse biological processes, including protein half-life, localization, and interaction. The molecular basis for how NatE and HYPK cooperate is unknown. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of human NatE and NatE/HYPK complexes and associated biochemistry. We reveal that NAA50 and HYPK exhibit negative cooperative binding to NAA15 in vitro and in human cells by inducing NAA15 shifts in opposing directions. NAA50 and HYPK each contribute to NAA10 activity inhibition through structural alteration of the NAA10 substrate-binding site. NAA50 activity is increased through NAA15 tethering, but is inhibited by HYPK through structural alteration of the NatE substrate-binding site. These studies reveal the molecular basis for coordinated N-terminal acetylation by NatE and HYPK.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Protein N-terminal acetylation is one of the most ubiquitous covalent modifications among eukaryotes, occurring on ~80% of human proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. This modification affects many protein functions, including protein half-life, folding, complex formation, and localization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Protein N-terminal acetylation is considered an irreversible process and is catalyzed by N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs). In human, seven different NATs with different subunit composition and substrate preferences have been identified to date, including hNatA through hNatH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, with the exception that NatG is only present in chloroplasts of plant cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. NatA, NatB, and NatC are three major NATs, each consisting of a catalytic subunit and one (NatA and NatB) or two (NatC) auxiliary subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The NatE complex contains NatA and an additional catalytic subunit, NAA50<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. NatD, NatF, and NatH function in the absence of an auxiliary subunit. NatA acetylates non-methionine containing substrates harboring small N-terminal residues (alanine, serine, threonine, cysteine, and valine)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. NatB/C/E/F modify proteins with N-terminal methionine residues: NatB acetylates methionine followed by a negatively charged residue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, while NatC/E/F acetylate methionine followed by hydrophobic/amphipathic residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. NatD and NatH exhibit highly selective substrate recognition patterns; NatD acetylates only the N-terminus of histones H2A and H4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, while NatH acts solely on processed actins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. NatA through NatE function predominantly co-translationally through association with the ribosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, while NatF anchors onto the Golgi membrane to acetylate transmembrane proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">About one-half of the human N-terminal acetylome is mediated by hNatA. Mutations in either the hNAA10 catalytic or hNAA15 auxiliary subunits have been correlated with a broad spectrum of pathologies, including intellectual disabilities, developmental delay, autism spectrum disorders, craniofacial dysmorphology, congenital cardiac anomalies, and Ogden syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Aberrant NatA activity has also been correlated with neurodegenerative disorders and cancer although a causative role of NatA is less clear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. NatA forms complexes with at least two other proteins, NAA50 and the chaperone protein Huntingtin-interacting protein K (HYPK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The trimeric hNAA10/hNAA15/hNAA50 complex is referred to as hNatE, and we refer to the tetrameric hNAA10/hNAA15/hNAA50/HYPK complex as hNatE/HYPK. Previous studies have demonstrated that HYPK may be important for cellular NatA activity and that NAA50 and NatA can affect each other’s function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Previous studies also demonstrated that hNatA can physically associate with hNAA50 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>) and HYPK (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>), separately. Moreover, the crystal structures of hNatA with HYPK and related pull-down experiments indicated that HYPK and hNAA50 binding to hNatA might be mutually exclusive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, another study suggested that HYPK and NatE form a tetrameric complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">To delineate the mechanistic basis for how the NAA10 and NAA50 catalytic subunits of the NatE complex coordinate function and how this is regulated by HYPK, we characterized the human NatE and NatE/HYPK complexes biochemically, structurally, and in cells. We show that hNAA50 and HYPK exhibit negative cooperative binding to hNatA in vitro and in human cells, by inducing hNAA15 shifts in opposing directions. We show that hNAA50 and HYPK both mediate hNAA10 inhibition through structural alteration of the hNAA10 substrate-binding site. We show that hNatE is about tenfold more active than hNAA50, likely due to a reduced entropic cost for substrate-binding through hNatA tethering, but is inhibited by HYPK through structural alteration of the hNatE substrate-binding site. Taken together, these studies reveal the molecular basis for coordinated N-terminal acetylation by the hNAA10 and hNAA50 catalytic subunits of NatE and its modulation by HYPK.</p>

<title>hNatE and HYPK form a tetrameric complex</title>
<p id="Par6">To determine if human NAA50 and HYPK can simultaneously bind to NatA to form a hNatE/HYPK complex, we prepared the recombinant hNatA/HYPK complex from insect cells and mixed it with recombinant hNAA50 for analysis on size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>—left). Analysis of the peak fractions on sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) revealed that the four protein components (hNAA10, hNAA15, hNAA50, and HYPK) co-eluted in a single major peak with excess hNAA50 eluting in later fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). This result demonstrates that HYPK and hNAA50 can bind to hNatA simultaneously to form a tetrameric hNatE/HYPK complex.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>HYPK and hNatE form a tetrameric complex.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Left—gel filtration elution profile of the hNatA/HYPK complex with excess hNAA50, using a Superdex S200 column.

<title>HYPK and hNAA50 display negative cooperative binding to hNatA</title>
<p id="Par7">Previous studies demonstrated that both human HYPK and hNAA50 bind tightly to hNatA, with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. We set out to determine if the HYPK- and hNAA50 binding properties to hNatA are altered in the context of the tetrameric complex. Using fluorescence polarization (FP) assays, we observed that hNAA50 bound to hNatA with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 46 ± 8.8 nM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>), consistent with previous results. However, in the presence of maltose-binding protein (MBP) tagged HYPK (MBP-HYPK), this binding <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> decreased about threefold to 127 ± 13 nM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). This data demonstrates that HYPK can negatively affect the stability of the hNatE complex by about threefold. Based on this data, we hypothesized that in the presence of hNAA50, the binding affinity between hNatA and HYPK would also decrease. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we determined that the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> between hNatA and MBP-HYPK was 29.9 ± 16.7 nM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>), which is consistent with the previously reported <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> in the thermophilic fungus <italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The reason for the apparent two-binding transition when HYPK is titrated into hNatA is unknown. We further determined the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> between HYPK and hNatE, and observed that the affinity was 154.1 ± 55.3 nM, approximately fivefold weaker than HYPK binding to hNatA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). A control ITC run of MBP titrated into hNatA failed to show binding (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that HYPK and hNAA50 display negative cooperative binding with respect to hNatA.</p>

<sec id="Sec5">
<title>hNAA50 and HYPK inhibit hNatA activity, and HYPK is dominant</title>
<p id="Par8">While our previous studies demonstrated that yeast and human NatA have slightly elevated catalytic efficiencies in the presence of NAA50, we set out to make a more direct comparison of NatA activity as a function of added NAA50 vs. HYPK. To do this, we used an in vitro acetylation assay using a cognate SASE NatA substrate (Ser-Ala-Ser-Glu; for full sequence see Methods) to compare the hNatA catalytic activity as a function of added hNAA50 or MBP-HYPK. This comparison revealed that while MBP-HYPK showed ~90% inhibition of hNatA activity at an MBP-HYPK concentration beyond ~100 nM, hNAA50 only decreased hNatA activity by ~50% at concentrations between ~100 nM and 1 µM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>), consistent with the previous data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Titrating both MBP-HYPK and hNAA50 into hNatA showed a similar degree to hNatA inhibition as did titrating in MBP-HYPK alone, illustrating that HYPK inhibition of hNatA overrides the incomplete inhibitory effect of hNAA50 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>HYPK binding negatively affects hNatE acetylation activity.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Either MBP-HYPK (green), hNAA50 (red), or both (blue) are titrated into hNatA (100 nM) to evaluate their modulatory effect on hNatA activity against an SASE peptide substrate.

<title>HYPK inhibits hNatE activity</title>
<p id="Par9">Given that HYPK was shown to be a negative regulator for hNatA acetylation activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, we asked if it also inhibited the activity hNatE. To do this, we used the same in vitro acetyltransferase activity assay but employed a cognate MLGP hNatE substrate (Met-Leu-Gly-Pro; for full sequence see Methods) in the absence or presence of HYPK, as well as a hNAA50 only control. This analysis revealed that while hNatE was more active than hNAA50, this improvement was essentially nullified with the addition of HYPK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b–d</xref>). A full kinetic analysis of hNAA50, hNatE, and hNatE/HYPK revealed the kinetic parameters responsible for this modulation of hNAA50 function. Specifically, we found that hNatE displayed ~8.6-fold decrease of <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>, and ~1.1-fold decrease of <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>, with an overall ~7.7-fold increase of catalytic efficiency, compared to hNAA50 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). These findings are in general agreement with the previous studies with the orthologous yeast proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.

<title>hNatA forms competing complexes with hNAA50 and HYPK in cells</title>
<p id="Par10">To further confirm the existence of the tetrameric hNatE/HYPK complex observed in vitro in human cells, we immunoprecipitated hNAA15 (c-terminal V5 tagged) from HeLa cells to evaluate the associated proteins. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of this sample revealed that endogenous hNAA10, hNAA50, and HYPK were all co-immunoprecipitated with NAA15-WT-V5, in agreement with the tetrameric hNatE/HYPK complex formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>hNatA forms competing complexes with hNAA50 and HYPK.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Heat map showing the mean relative IBAQ intensity of NatA components from three independent MS analyses of immunoprecipitated NAA15 variants, NAA15-WT-V5, NAA15-T406Y-V5, and NAA15-L814P-V5.

<p id="Par11">In prior studies, we reported that a hNAA15-T406Y mutant can disassociate hNAA50 from hNatA in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, while a hNAA15-L814P mutant is defective for HYPK inhibition and reduces hNatA thermostability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Based on these observations, we also carried out a MS analysis of the V5 immunoprecipitates of the hNAA15-T406Y-V5 and hNAA15-L814P-V5 mutants to evaluate the effect of the mutation’s on formation of the hNatE/HYPK tetrameric complex (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>). For relative quantification of the hNatA proteins, the intensity-based absolute quantification (IBAQ) intensities of the hNatA components in each sample were normalized to the IBAQ intensity of hNAA15 in the respective sample and to the corresponding protein in the (wild-type) WT sample (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>). This analysis demonstrated that hNAA15-T406Y-V5 and hNAA15-L814P-V5 had reduced binding of hNAA50 and HYPK respectively, indicating that the mutations negatively affected the ability of hNAA15 to bind hNAA50 and HYPK, respectively. Furthermore, it appeared that the reduced binding of HYPK or hNAA50 resulted in greater binding of the other component: hNAA15-T406Y-V5 bound less hNAA50, but more HYPK than hNAA15-WT, while hNAA15-L814P-V5 bound less HYPK and more hNAA50 than hNAA15-WT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). These observations are in agreement with the in vitro FP and ITC assays, demonstrating that HYPK and hNAA50 display negative cooperative binding with respect to hNatA. Taken together, these cellular studies agree with the in vitro studies by confirming the existence of the tetrameric hNatE/HYPK complex, and indicating that HYPK and hNAA50 display negative cooperative binding with respect to hNatA.</p>
<p id="Par12">The intrinsic hNatA catalytic activities of the hNAA15-T406Y-V5 and hNAA15-L814P-V5 variants were also tested in a Nt-acetylation assay and western blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Importantly, equal levels of hNAA10 was pulled out with the NAA15 mutants from the lysates supporting that none of the mutants affect hNAA10 binding. The hNAA15-T406Y-V5 hNatA complex displayed a decreased catalytic activity toward the hNatA substrate SESS<sub>24</sub> compared to WT hNatA. This could be explained by an increased binding and inhibitory effect of HYPK and/or due to the reduced binding of hNAA50. The hNAA15-L814P-V5 hNatA complex showed an increased catalytic activity compared to WT hNatA, which is consistent with the in vitro findings of reduced binding of HYPK and consequently less inhibition of the catalytic activity and/or an increased binding of hNAA50.</p>

<title>hNatE structure reveals molecular basis for enzyme crosstalk</title>
<p id="Par13">To determine the molecular basis for interaction and enzymatic crosstalk between human NAA10 and NAA50 enzyme subunits within the NatE complex, we determined the single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the hNatE complex in the presence of inositol hexakisphosphate IP6 and bi-substrate analogs of both hNatA and hNAA50. The model of the human complex was rigid body fitted with the coordinates of the crystal structure of hNatA (PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6c9m">6C9M</ext-link>) and hNAA50 (PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3tfy">3TFY</ext-link>), with all ligands removed. After refinement of the model, we observed clear density of IP6 and acetyl-CoA cofactors in each catalytic subunit, but the peptide portion of the bi-substrate inhibitors was not resolved.

<p id="Par14">Consistent with the previous studies with the orthologous yeast proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, hNAA50 predominantly interacts with hNAA15 (α21, α22, α23, and α24), and makes relatively few interactions with hNAA10 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>), burying a solvent excluded surface of 34,316 Å<sup>2</sup> with hNAA15, and 9100 Å<sup>2</sup> with hNAA10. Based on the structure of the <italic>Sc</italic>NatE complex, a hNAA15-T406Y mutant was shown to disrupt the hNatA-NAA50 interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Indeed, we find that hNAA15-Thr406 is located at the center of the hNAA50-hNAA15 interface, making hydrogen bond interactions with the backbone carbonyl group of hNAA50-Ala55 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). Additional hydrogen bonds are formed between the backbone carbonyl of hNAA50-His14 with the backbone amide of hNAA15-Thr439, between hNAA50-Arg21 and the backbone carbonyl of hNAA15-Pro405, and between hNAA50-Asn52 and hNAA15-Thr371 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). hNAA50-Arg21 also makes direct ionic interaction with hNAA15-Glu433, which is absent in yeast (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). It is possible that this ionic interaction underlies the increased salt sensitivity of the human vs. yeast NatE complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par15">hNAA50-hNAA10 interactions are less extensive than hNAA50-hNAA15, yet still significant.

This structural observation highlights the recent identification of a missense mutation of hNAA10 R83H that exhibits decreased acetylation activity in boys with intellectual disability and developmental delay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.

<p id="Par16">To assess the importance of the NatA-NAA50 interactions on the catalytic crosstalk of the two enzymes, we prepared hNAA50-E7A, -D53A and -E7A/D53A mutants and evaluated their effect on hNatA activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>). We found that the single and double mutants were able to restore between 12–17% of hNatA activity relative to the activity of hNatA bound to WT-hNAA50 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>). These results demonstrate that the observed hydrogen bond interactions between hNatA and hNAA50 make a small, albeit significant, contribution to the catalytic crosstalk between the two enzymes.</p>

However, it is noteworthy that when bound to NatA, we observe that NAA50 shifts significantly closer to NAA10 in the human over the yeast complex, resulting in more significant and intimate NAA10-NAA50 interactions in the human complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). α3 and β7 of hNAA50 shift toward hNAA10 ~10 Å and 11 Å, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>).

<p id="Par18">To understand other structural contributions that hNAA50 might have on hNatA activity, we superimposed the hNatE structure with the hNatA crystal structure (PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6c9m">6C9M</ext-link>). We found that hNAA15 and hNAA10 in the ternary hNatE complex displayed an RMSD of 0.747 Å (over 624 common Cα atoms), and 0.897 Å (over 141 common Cα atoms), respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). The hNAA10 β6–β7 loop displayed about a 4 Å shift toward hNAA50 in the hNatE complex relative to the hNatA complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). Given that the β6–β7 loop of hNAA10 plays an important role in peptide substrate recognition, we propose that this shift in position also contributes to the inhibitory effect that hNAA50 binding has on hNatA activity.</p>
<p id="Par19">To understand the molecular basis for why hNatA binding increases the catalytic efficiency of hNatE by nearly eightfold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>), we superimposed the hNAA50 crystal structure (PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3tfy">3TFY</ext-link>) with the hNAA50 subunits of the hNatE structure. Remarkably, we did not observe any significant structural changes in hNAA50 with an overall RMSD for all atoms of 0.437 Å (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). Notably, the β6–β7 and α1–α2 peptide substrate-binding loops of hNAA50 within the hNatE complex superimposed well with hNAA50 bound to CoA and substrate peptide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the increased activity of hNatE is due to a reduced entropic cost for substrate binding to the hNAA50 subunit due to hNatA tethering. This is consistent with the observations of Wand and colleagues for other protein systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>hNatE/HYPK structure reveals negative cooperative mechanism</title>
<p id="Par20">To obtain a molecular understanding of how hNAA50 and HYPK can both bind hNatA, we determined the structure of the hNatE/HYPK complex by cryo-EM, which we were able to resolve to an overall resolution of 4.0 Å (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). The starting structure was modeled using the hNatA/HYPK (PDB: 6C95) and hNAA50 (PDB: 3TFY), which were placed into the cryo-EM map through rigid body fitting, followed by adjustment and refinement. The refinement statistics can be found in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">2</xref>.</p>
<p id="Par21">In the tetrameric structure, we observe that both hNAA50 and HYPK simultaneously dock onto the same binding regions on hNatA, as previously identified in the absence of the other protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. While both hNAA50 and HYPK contact both subunits of hNatA, no direct interactions are observed between hNAA50 and HYPK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). HYPK binds NatA mainly through interactions with the hNAA15 subunit of hNatA: only the α1 helix of HYPK interacts with hNAA10, while the α2 and C-terminal UBA domain (α3, α4, and α5 helices) of HYPK interact with hNAA15 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that the UBA domain and α2 helix play key roles in hNatA binding, while α1 is essential for hNatA activity inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Overall structure of the hNatE/HYPK complex.</title><p><bold>a</bold> hNAA50 (pink), hNAA15 (green), hNAA10 (orange), and HYPK (red) within the hNatE complex is shown in cartoon. <bold>b</bold> Zoom-in view of the contacts between HYPK and hNAA15 with residues that participate in interaction shown. <bold>c</bold> Zoom-in view of the contacts between hNAA15 and hNAA50 with residues that participate in interaction shown. <bold>d</bold> Zoom-in view of the contacts between hNAA10 and hNAA50 with residues that participate in interaction shown.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e1479" xlink:href="41467_2020_14584_Fig6_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par22">Over the HYPK and hNatA interaction interface within the tetrameric complex, we observe polar interactions between HYPK-Glu74 and hNAA15-Tyr158, between the backbone carbonyl of HYPK-Thr100 and hNAA15-Lys687, between the backbone carbonyl of HYPK-Asn129 and hNAA15-Arg697, and between HYPK-Asn129 and hNAA15-Lys696, which were all observed similarly in the hNatA/HYPK crystal structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>). However, HYPK-Glu103, hNAA15-Lys685, and hNAA15-Glu655 which form a salt bridge in the hNatA/HYPK structure do not show a similar contact in the tetrameric hNatE/HYPK complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>). We speculate that the absence of this interaction might contribute to the slightly weaker affinity of HYPK for hNatE over hNatA.</p>
<p id="Par23">hNAA15 and hNAA50 also make similar interactions in the absence or presence of HYPK. The backbone carbonyl of hNAA50-His14 hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide of hNAA15-Thr439, and hNAA50-Asn52 hydrogen bonds with hNAA15-Thr371 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>). Interestingly, however, a key residue that stabilizes the hNatA-hNAA50 interaction, hNAA15-Thr406 shifts from in interaction with the carbonyl of hNAA50-Ala55 to a hydrogen bond to the hNAA50-Gln18 side chain in the tetrameric complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>). An additional H-bond is formed between hNAA50-Gln18 and the backbone carbonyl of hNAA15-Thr406 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>). hNAA50-Arg21, a residue that makes extensive contacts to NAA15 in the hNatA/NAA50 complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>) is only contacting hNAA15-Glu433 in the tetrameric complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6c</xref>). In addition, while hNAA50-Asp53 and hNAA10-Arg83 maintain interaction as observed in the hNatA/hNAA50 complex, hNAA50-Glu7 and hNAA10-Arg116 lose interaction in the tetrameric complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d</xref>). These observations correlate with the observed weaker binding interaction between hNAA50 and hNatA in the presence of HYPK.</p>
<p id="Par24">To understand the molecular basis for the biochemical findings that the binding of hNAA50 and HYPK to hNatA exhibit negative cooperativity, we superimposed the ternary hNatA/HYPK and hNatE complexes onto the hNatE/HYPK complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>). To align the hNatE and hNatE/HYPK complexes, we superimposed the hNAA50 position to delineate how the HYPK binding regions are affected by hNAA50 binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>). The overall overlay suggests that both the hNAA10 and hNAA15 subunits of hNatA shift in the direction that is away from the hNAA50 binding region to make closer and more optimal contacts with HYPK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>). The hNAA15 α36–α40 helices, which bind to the C-terminal UBA domain (α3–α5) of HYPK in the tetrameric hNatE/HYPK complex, clearly shift away from the binding interface, when only hNAA50 is bound to hNatA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>). Notably, α40, α38, α37, and α36 display shift of ~4.5 Å, ~2.3 Å, ~1.6 Å, and ~1.8 Å, respectively. The important residues of hNAA15 (Lys696, Arg697, Lys687, and Lys685), which mediate HYPK interactions in this region suggested that most of them in the hNatE structure exhibit an ~ 2 Å shift away from HYPK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>). Meanwhile, hNAA15 N-terminal helices of α7, α8, α9, and α10, which are in close contact with HYPK-α2 also show ~3.0 Å, ~4.1 Å, ~1.9 Å, and ~3.5 Å shifts, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7d</xref>), while Tyr158 is about ~2 Å further away. Lastly, we observe that α2 and β3–β4 of hNAA50-bound hNAA10 move ~2.5 Å closer to contact the HYPK N-terminal α1 helix (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7e</xref>). Thus, it appears that hNAA50 binding to hNatA, destabilizes hNatA-HYPK interactions through moving hNatA away from its optimal binding position to HYPK.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><title>Molecular basis for hNAA50 and HYPK binding to hNatA.</title><p><bold>a</bold> hNatE/HYPK overlayed onto hNatE (purple) with NAA50 aligned. <bold>b</bold> hNatE/HYPK overlayed onto hNatA/HYPK (PDB: 6C95, blue) with HYPK aligned. <bold>c</bold> Zoom-in view of HYPK C-terminal binding region as indicated in <bold>a</bold>. <bold>d</bold> Zoom-in view of HYPK α2 binding region as indicated in <bold>a</bold>. <bold>e</bold> Zoom-in view of HYPK N-terminal α1 domain binding region as indicated in <bold>a</bold>. <bold>f</bold> Zoom-in view shows the hNAA50 binding region on hNAA15 as indicated in <bold>b</bold>. <bold>g</bold> Zoom-in view shows the hNAA50 binding region on hNAA10 as indicated in <bold>b</bold>. <bold>h</bold> Zoom-in view shows the hNAA15 C-terminal helices conformal changes when HYPK bound as indicated in <bold>b</bold>.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e1594" xlink:href="41467_2020_14584_Fig7_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par25">Similarly, a superposition of hNatE/HYPK with the crystal structure of hNatA/HYPK by aligning to the HYPK position to delineate how the hNAA50 binding regions are affected by HYPK binding reveals that hNAA15 is shifted away from HYPK and closer to hNAA50 in the hNatE/HYPK complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b</xref>). A further zoom-in view of the hNAA50 binding regions in hNAA15 demonstrates that residues Glu433, Thr406, Thr371, and Thr439 of hNAA15 are shifted by ~2 − 3 Å away from hNAA50 when HYPK is bound relative to their positions in the absence of hNAA50 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7f</xref>). Regarding the hNAA50-hNAA10 binding interface, a 4.3 Å shift of hNAA10-Arg116 was observed, with a 1.7 Å for hNAA10-Arg83 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7g</xref>). It is also noteworthy that significant conformational shift of the C-terminal hNAA15 helices α41–α45(~2.2 − 4.2 Å) was induced, in order to have hNAA50 bound in the tetrameric hNatE/HYPK complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7h</xref>). This suggests that HYPK bound hNatA is also not optimal for hNAA50 binding.</p>
<p id="Par26">Taken together, these comparisons reveal that hNAA50 and HYPK destabilize the binding of the other protein to hNatA, despite their independent binding surfaces to hNatA, and explain the observed negative cooperative binding of hNAA50 and HYPK to hNatA.</p>

<title>Molecular basis for decrease of hNatE activity by HYPK</title>
<p id="Par27">Our kinetic data demonstrated that the catalytic efficiency of hNatE is greater than hNAA50, but that this increase is partially nullified in the presence of HYPK (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). To understand the molecular basis for this, we overlayed structures of hNatE and hNatE/HYPK with the common hNatA subunits aligned. This superposition reveals that the largest structural differences within the hNAA50 subunit map to the β6–β7 and α1–α2 loops, which shift such that the hNAA50 peptide substrate-binding groove is ~2.4 Å wider in the hNatE/HYPK complex relative to the hNatE complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>). In addition, the hNAA50 β3–β4 loop is shifted in the direction away from hNatA by ~3.5 Å in the presence of HYPK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>). The previous studies demonstrated that Tyr73 and Met75 from hNAA50-β4 and Tyr138, Tyr139 and Leu142 from the hNAA50 β6-β7 loop are important for hNAA50 catalytic function and substrate binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. To directly test this, we prepared the following mutants: hNAA50-Y73F, -M75A, -Y138A, -Y139A, and -I142A, and tested their effects on hNatE activity when HYPK was bound (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). Consistent with the previous studies, Y73F, Y138A, and Y139A decreased hNAA50 activity to undetectable levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. For hNAA50-M75A and -I142A, we observed increased activity when bound to hNatA to form the hNatE complex, as we observed for hNAA50-WT. As expected, the hNatE/HYPK complex displayed reduced activity compared to both hNAA50 alone and hNatE. However, we observed that hNatE-M75A/HYPK and hNatE-I142A/HYPK exhibited similar activity, compared to their corresponding hNAA50 mutants alone. These data are consistent with the conclusion that perturbation of the hNAA50 β3−β4 and β6−β7 loops within the hNatE/HYPK complex underlies the observed reduced catalytic efficiency of hNatE in the presence of HYPK.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><title>Molecular basis for the decrease of hNAA50 activity by HYPK.</title><p>hNatE/HYPK (green) overlayed onto hNatE (magenta) with hNatA aligned.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par28">While the interaction and catalytic crosstalk within NatE in the yeast system had previously been reported, the corresponding human system and the influence of HYPK binding on hNatE activity had not previously been characterized. Here, we biochemically and structurally characterize the mechanistic interplay of the hNAA10 and hNAA50 catalytic subunits within the hNatE complex, and the role of HYPK in regulating hNatE activity. Similar to the crystal structure of <italic>Sc</italic>NatE (PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6o07">6O07</ext-link>), we find that hNAA50 binds hNatA mainly through hNAA15, using highly conserved residues, including a key threonine residue located at the center of the binding interface. Notably, the distance between hNAA50 and hNAA10 in the human complex is significantly shorter than in the yeast complex. We find that these two acidic hNAA50 residues, Glu7 and Asp53 contact two hNAA10 arginine residues, inducing a conformational change in hNAA10, which contributes to a decrease in hNatA enzymatic activity.</p>
<p id="Par29">While both hNAA50 and hNatA are conserved from yeast to human, it had long been considered that HYPK is not present in yeast until the recently identified HYPK in thermophilic fungus <italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, it appears that evolutionarily NAA50 appeared as a NatA-binding partner earlier than HYPK did. In both budding and fission yeast, NAA50 is inactive but regulates NatA acetylation activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. While in higher eukaryotes, NAA50 is enzymatically active, either with or without NatA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Thus, within the higher eukaryotic tetrameric NatE/HYPK complex, it is likely that the regulation of NatA activity by NAA50 was replaced by HYPK.</p>
<p id="Par30">Here, we have reconstituted the tetrameric hNatE/HYPK complex to demonstrate that HYPK and hNAA50 can bind to hNatA simultaneously. We also confirmed the physiological relevance of the tetrameric hNatE/HYPK complex through immunoprecipitation of the complex from HeLa cells. We find that while HYPK inhibits hNatA activity directly, it also indirectly, but less potently, inhibits hNatE. We also find that hNAA50 and HYPK exhibit negative cooperativity with respect to hNatA binding in vitro and in vivo. The structure of the hNatE/HYPK complex suggests that this is due to the ability of the hNAA50 and HYPK protein to bind to the hNAA15 subunit of hNatA in a way that indirectly destabilizes binding of the other protein. This observation, together with our findings that HYPK has a dominant regulatory effect on hNatA activity relative to hNAA50 may explain why excess free hNAA50 is observed over hNatA in higher organism and HeLa cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par31">The nanomolar dissociation constants of HYPK and hNAA50 for hNatA is consistent, with our immunoprecipitation of the tetrameric hNatE/HYPK complex from cells. The previous studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> also reported that a dNAA50 knockout decreases in vivo dNatA catalytic activity in the presence of HYPK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In terms of the biological function of this tetrameric complex, we propose two non-mutually exclusive regulatory mechanism for how hNAA50 protein levels could affect hNatA activity. First, since hNAA50 has a negative effect on binding between hNatA and HYPK, the absence of hNAA50, would promote HYPK binding to hNatA to inhibit hNatA activity. Second, since a recent yeast NatE-ribosome structure demonstrated that yeast NAA50 participates in ribosome association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, it is likely that hNAA50 in higher eukaryotes also contributes to the association between tetrameric hNatE/HYPK and ribosome. The lower level of hNAA50 could therefore decrease the fraction of ribosome-associated hNatA to regulate its co-translational activity.</p>
<p id="Par32">The overall structures of hNAA50 and ScNAA50 are well conserved with a mix of α-helices and β-strands. However, the overlay of hNatE and ScNatE suggested that NAA50 shifts closer to NAA10 in the human over the yeast complex. It is possible that in the human system NAA10 and NAA50 have more intimate contact and crosstalk in enzymatic activity. However, the previous data indicated that the degree of NAA50 and NAA10 activity crosstalk is similar in yeast and human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In a recently reported yeast ScNatE-ribosome structure, the ScNAA10 and ScNAA50 catalytic sites are 50 Å and 85 Å away from the peptide exit site on the ribosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. While unlike ScNAA50, hNAA50 is co-translationally enzymatically active<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Thus, we propose that this shift of NAA50 closer to NAA10 in the human over the yeast complex may have an impact on the relative distance between the nascent chain and active sites of hNAA10 and hNAA50.</p>
<p id="Par33">With respect to hNatA binding to the ribosome, it is possible that HYPK may also contribute to ribosome binding by hNatA. This could then indirectly affect hNAA50 recruitment to the ribosome, which would be promoted by hNatA but inhibited by HYPK. HYPK contains a UBA domain, which is also present at the C-terminus of the alpha subunit of the nascent polypeptide-associated complex. Further studies are required to test these hypotheses for hNatA recruitment to the ribosome.</p>
<p id="Par34">The hNatE/HYPK complex co-translationally acetylates nascent peptides with N-termini of either methionine maintained or cleaved, which accounts for the largest number of substrates among all NATs. Given that this complex acetylates ~40–60% of the human proteome and has altered function in many human diseases, the studies presented here provides an important molecular scaffold for potential therapeutic development.</p>

<title>Acetyltransferase activity assays</title>
<p id="Par42">Acetyltransferase assays were modified from previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and carried out at room temperature in a reaction buffer containing 75 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 120 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT. The SASE substrate peptide (NH<sub>2</sub>-SASEAGVRWGRPVGRRRRP-COOH; GenScript) and the MLGP substrate peptide (NH<sub>2</sub>-MLGPEGGRWGRPVGRRRRP-COOH; GenScript) were used to determine the enzymatic activity of hNatA and hNAA50, respectively. Each curve was repeated at least three times. To test the effect of hNAA50 and HYPK on hNatA activity, 100 nM of hNatA was mixed with 500 µM SASE peptide, 300 µM C<sup>14</sup> labeled acetyl-CoA (4 mCi mmol<sup>−1</sup>; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and varied concentrations of hNAA50 or HYPK modulator were added for 12-minute reactions. Signals were normalized against enzyme without modulator. For time course activity assays, 500 nM of hNAA50, hNatE, or hNatE/HYPK were mixed with 500 µM MLGP peptide, and 300 µM C<sup>14</sup>-labeled acetyl-CoA (4 mCi mmol<sup>−1</sup>; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a 20 µl reaction volume. Only 15 µl of each reaction mixture was quenched at specific times. For kinetic assays of hNAA50, hNatE and hNatE/HYPK against MLGP peptide, 300 nM enzyme was mixed with 300 µM C<sup>14</sup>-labeled acetyl-CoA (4 mCi mmol<sup>−1</sup>; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the concentration of the peptide substrate was varied for a 40-min reaction.
