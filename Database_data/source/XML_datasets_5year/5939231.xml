<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The tetraspanin family of proteins is widely expressed and conserved in eukaryotic cells, with 33 different tetraspanins being expressed in human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C75">Tarrant et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C19">Charrin et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C18">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C37">Jiang et al. 2015</xref>). Structurally, these proteins are characterized by 4 transmembrane domains, 2 extracellular loops and short intracellular N- and C- termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C32">Hemler 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>A main feature of tetraspanins is their ability to interact with other proteins such as integrins, membrane receptors and signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C5">Bassani and Cingolani 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C5">Bassani and Passafaro 2012</xref>). Such interactions lead to the formation of tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs) on the cell surface, which regulate transmembrane protein signaling, trafficking, and biosynthetic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C51">Maecker et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C31">Hemler 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C33">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C82">Yauch and Hemler 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C20">Chavis and Westbrook 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Tetraspanins play roles in many biological processes, including immune system functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C38">Jones et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C78">van Spriel 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C47">Levy 2014</xref>), cancer progression or metastasis formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C12">Boucheix and Rubinstein 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C85">Zoller 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C67">Romanska and Berditchevski 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C34">Hemler 2014</xref>), and intercellular communication via extracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C3">Andreu and Yanez-Mo 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>TM4SF2</italic> gene encodes the tetraspanin7 (TSPAN7) protein, which is highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), particularly in the frontal cortex, olfactory bulb, cerebellum and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C84">Zemni et al. 2000</xref>). Importantly, nonsyndromic X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C61">Piton et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C8">Bassani et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C59">Penzes et al. 2013</xref>) has been associated with mutations in this gene, including X;2 balanced translocation, a nonsense mutation that results in a premature stop codon TGA (gly218-to-ter), a point mutation (P172H) substituting a single amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C84">Zemni et al. 2000</xref>), and a 2-bp deletion (564delGT) that results in a premature stop codon at position 192 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C1">Abidi et al. 2002</xref>). Both the gly218-to-ter nonsense mutation and the 2-bp deletion are predicted to produce a truncated protein lacking the fourth transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail.</p>
<p>We previously found that TSPAN7 promotes the formation of filopodia and dendritic spines and is required for spine stability and normal synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, we identified protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1) as a binding partner of TSPAN7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C7">Bassani et al. 2012</xref>). PICK1 is involved in the internalization and recycling of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C60">Perez et al. 2001</xref>), and TSPAN7 appears to regulate the association between PICK1 and AMPAR, thereby controlling AMPAR trafficking and internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C7">Bassani et al. 2012</xref>). Additionally, TSPAN7 has been shown to promote D<sub>2</sub> dopamine receptor internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C46">Lee et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, we showed that absence of TSPAN7 in the brains of <italic>Tm4sf2<sup>−</sup></italic><sup><italic>/y</italic></sup> mice caused alterations in excitatory postsynapse structure, function and plasticity as well as impairment in hippocampal-related learning and memory behavior. In addition, <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice showed an increased AMPA rectification index (RI) compared with <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> mice, indicating that less GluA2-containing AMPAR was present at the cell surface. Interestingly, interference on PICK1–GluA2 binding or treatment with CX516, a positive modulator of AMPAR, rescued the ID phenotype. These findings suggest that modulation of AMPAR could represent a new therapeutic strategy for ID caused by <italic>TM4SF2</italic> mutations.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>
<italic>Tm4sf2</italic>
<sup>+/y</sup> and <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−</italic>/y</sup> 30–90 days old male mice were housed in polycarbonate cages with food and water ad libitum. Cob-bedding was changed weekly, and the animal house was 21 °C with a 12 h light cycle (lights on at 08:00) if not stated otherwise. All the experiments followed the guidelines established by the Italian Council on Animal Care and were approved by the Italian Government decree No. 747/2015-PR, if not stated otherwise. All efforts were made to minimize the number of subjects used and their suffering. The 3 mice per genotype/age/treatment were used for electron microscopy (EM), 3–9 mice per genotype at 90 days for biochemical and crosslinking assays. For electrophysiology and behavioral analysis 3 mice 60 days old per genotype/treatment and at least 7 mice 90 days old per genotype/treatment were used, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bhx221s2b">
<title>Histological Analyses</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/ml avertine (Sigma) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Dissected brains were further fixed for 48 h at 4 °C before paraffin embedding and sectioning. Four micrometers sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined under the optical microscope.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bhx221s2c">
<title>Electron microscopy</title>
<p>Sample preparation for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and quantitative analyses on TEM images were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C26">Folci et al. 2016</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/ml avertine (Sigma) and transcardially perfused with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.15 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Dissected brains were postfixed for additional 24 h at 4 °C. Coronal sections (100 μm thickness) where obtained with a vibratome (Leica VT1000S, Leica Microsystems, Austria) and selected brain areas were manually dissected. After washing, samples were postfixed with 2% osmium tetroxide, rinsed, en bloc stained with 1% uranyl acetate in water for 45 min, dehydrated and embedded in Spurr's epoxy resin that was baked for 48 h at 60°C. Thin sections (70–90 nm) were obtained with a Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Austria), stained with a saturated solution of uranyl acetate in ethanol 20% and 1% lead citrate. Grids were observed in a Philips CM10 TEM (FEI, Eindhoven, Netherland). The excitatory synapses that were included in the EM analyses were those fitting these 3 criteria: (1) presence of a cluster of presynaptic vesicles (at least 3 of them); (2) presence of a defined synaptic cleft; and (3) presence of the postsynaptic density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C15">Burette et al. 2015</xref>). For quantitative analyses, images were acquired at a final magnification of ×25.000–34.000 using a Morada CDD camera (Olympus, Munster, Germany). Quantitative measurements were performed with ImageJ 1.47 v.</p>

<sec id="bhx221s2d">
<title>Serial Block Face Scanning Electron Microscopy—Sample Preparation, Image Acquisition and Analyses</title>
<p>Tissue fixation and embedding were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C23">Denk and Horstmann 2004</xref>) with slight modifications.</p>
<p>Serial block-face (SBF) datasets were collected using a FEI Quanta 200 F SEM, equipped with a Schottky field emission electron source, operating at an accelerating voltage of 3 kV, with beam current of 21 pA in a water low pressure of 30 Pa, and by using a Gatan 3View SBF-system (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, USA).</p>
<p>The resulting datasets were assembled into volume files aligned using Digital Micrograph (Gatan), and then manually segmented into 3-dimensional (3D) models in AMIRA 5.4.3 software package (FEI Visualization Science Group, Burlington, MA, USA). 3D structures in image stacks containing hundred or thousand of 2D orthoslices were traced individually in each plane and automatically surface rendered. The volumes of Amira 3D models were measured by the ‘Material Statistics’ tool.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bhx221s2e">
<title>SDS-Page and Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Analysis of synaptic markers was performed on hippocampal lysates from 90 days old male <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> and <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice. Hippocampi were homogenized in modified RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors cocktail) and centrifuged 9000 × <italic>g</italic> 4 °C for 30 min. Collected supernatants were quantified and consequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer (5% non-fat dry milk in TBST 0.1%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bhx221s2f">
<title>BS3 Crosslinking</title>
<p>The experiments were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C26">Folci et al. 2016</xref>) and in parallel with electrophysiology. Briefly, mice were sacrificed, and brain slices of 400 μm thickness were cut using a vibratome and rapidly put in ice-cold artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF). Cell membrane impermeable BS3 crosslinker (PierceNet) was prepared as a 52 mM stock in 5 mM sodium citrate buffer pH 5. The slices were then put into a 12-well plate with 1 ml of ice-cold aCSF and BS3 added to a final concentration of 2 mM. The plate was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Glycine was added to a final concentration of 100 mM and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation to quench the reaction. The slices were then collected and lysed with mechanical homogenization in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, pH 7.4). The lysates were then loaded on acrylamide gel and underwent standard western blotting procedures to analyze GluA2, GluA2/3, GluA1, α-tubulin, and transferrin receptor expression.</p>

<p>Miniature AMPA (AMPA-mEPSCs) and evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) were recorded at a holding potential of −65 mV with an internal solution containing (in mM) 126 K-gluconate, 4 NaCl, 1 EGTA, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 ATP (magnesium salt), 0.1 GTP (sodium salt), 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES-KOH (pH 7.28). Access resistance was between 10 and 20 MΩ; if it changed by &gt; 20% during the recording, the recording was discarded.</p>
<p>All glutamatergic currents were recorded in the presence of the GABA<sub>A</sub> blocker bicuculline (20 μM) in the aCSF. For the recording of AMPA-mEPSCs, lidocaine (500 μM), and the NMDA blocker APV (100 μM) were added to the aCSF. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons eEPSCs were elicited stimulating the Schaffer collaterals (SC) with a patch pipette placed near the patched neuron in the CA1.</p>
<p>For AMPAR rectification experiments eEPSCs were recorded using a cesium chloride-based intracellular solution consisting of (in mM) 140 CsCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES-CsOH, 2 ATP (disodium salt), 0.15 spermine (pH 7.3) and adding to the aCSF bicuculline (20 μM) and APV (100 μM) to isolate AMPARs-mediated currents. The RI was identified by the ratio between the amplitude of the currents recorded at −60 mV and the currents recorded at +40 mV. Paired pulse experiments were performed and analysed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C26">Folci et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) and current clamp analyses were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C63">Pizzamiglio et al. 2016</xref>). Currents through the patch-clamp amplifier were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz using Clampex 10.1 software.</p>
<p>fEPSPs were evoked (0.05 Hz of frequency) and recorded from the <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> of the hippocampal CA1 stimulating the SC using aCSF-filled monopolar glass electrodes. fEPSPs were acquired at 20 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz. Input–output (I–O) curves were constructed by measuring the slope of fEPSPs evoked in response to stimulation with increasing intensity (0–1.0 mA). Stimulus strength was adjusted to give 50% maximal response and long-term potentiation (LTP) was elicited using 2 protocols: the first one consisting of 100 stimuli at 100 Hz and the second one, much stronger, consisting of 100 stimuli at 250 Hz.

<p>Food pellets and water were available ad libitum if not stated otherwise.</p>
<p>L/D, emergence and fear conditioning tests were performed according to the animal protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee San Raffaele (IACUC) (San Raffaele, Milan, Italy) and approved by the National Ministry of Health (IACUC ID 653).</p>
<p>Animals were video-tracked using the EthoVision 2.3 system (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, the Netherlands, <uri xlink:href="http://www.noldus.com">http://www.noldus.com</uri>) using an image frequency of 4.2/s.

<p>Frames of non-reflective black Perspex walls (37 cm high) were used to partition a round open field arena (diameter of 150 cm and 35-cm high walls) into 4 squares (50 × 50-cm<sup>2</sup> arena), allowing for concurrent tracking of 4 animals at one time. The day before this test a box made of plastic (12 × 8 × 4 cm<sup>3</sup> with a door of 8 × 4 cm<sup>2</sup>) was inserted in each mouse's home cage. The same box was then placed in a corner of the arena, with the opening facing the center of the arena. The mice were released into the center of the arena and tracked for 30 min.

<title>Novel Object Recognition</title>
<p>The test was carried out over a two-day period in an open plastic arena (60 cm × 50 cm × 30 cm) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C58">Pan et al. 2008</xref>). Animals were habituated to the test arena for 10 min on the first day and then were subjected to familiarization (T1) and novel object recognition (T2). During the initial familiarization stage, 2 identical objects were placed in the center of the arena equidistant from the walls and from each other. Each mouse was placed in the center of the arena between the 2 objects for a maximum of 20 min or until it had completed 30 s of cumulative object exploration. Object recognition was scored when the animal was within 0.5 cm of an object with its nose toward the object. Exploration was not scored if a mouse reared above the object with its nose in the air or climbed on an object. Mice were returned to the home cage after familiarization and then tested again after different delays (5 min, 120 min, and 24 h later). A novel object (never seen before) took the place of 1 of the 2 familiars.</p>
<p>Scoring of object recognition was performed in the same manner as during the familiarization phase. From mouse to mouse the role (familiar or new object) as well as the relative position of the 2 objects were counterbalanced and randomly permuted. The objects for mice to discriminate consisted of white plastic cylinders and colored plastic Lego stacks of different shape. The arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol after each trial. An experimenter blind to the genotype group manually recorded the exploration times to the objects for each animal. Total time spent to exploring the 2 objects during T1 and T2 was also calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bhx221s2n">
<title>Spatial Object Recognition</title>
<p>For the spatial object recognition the animals were first habituated to test apparatus for 10 min for one day. Then they were subjected to a familiarization trial (T1) and a spatial object recognition trial (T2) with a delay of 5 min or 120 min, or 24 h from T1. During T1 and T2 mice were placed into the open field arena for a maximum of 20 min or until it had completed 30 s of cumulative object exploration and allowed to explore 2 different objects. In T1, 2 different objects were placed in NE and NW corners, approximately 5 cm from the walls of the open field arena. Then the mice were returned in the home cage. After 5 min, 120 min, or 24 h mice were re-exposed to the open field arena with the more explored object moved toward the opposite side of the test arena. Mice will preferentially explore a spatially displaced object than one remained stationary. Objects were counterbalanced across locations and conditions. The open field arena and all objects were thoroughly wiped down with 70% ethanol before and after all behavioral procedures. Care was taken to minimize the difference between the to-be discriminated objects in order to prevent a greater preference for one of the 2 objects. An experimenter blind to the treatment group manually recorded the exploration times to the objects in each animal. Mice that did not explore any of the 2 objects/shapes for at least 30 s during T1 were excluded from the data analysis. The basic measure for all the object tests was the time mice spent in exploring each object/shape during T1 and T2. The discrimination index ([time spent exploring novel object−time exploring familiar object]/[time spent exploring novel object + time exploring familiar object]) was calculated as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C62">Pitsikas et al. 2001</xref>).

<title>Water Maze</title>
<p>To evaluate the integrity of hippocampus-dependent memory formation in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> and <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice, the water maze paradigm according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C53">Morris et al. (1982)</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C53">Morris et al. 1982</xref>), was used. Water maze was a circular tank (diameter 1.5 m) filled with water (25 °C ± 0.5 °C). A platform (13.5 cm × 23 cm) was submerged below the water's surface in the center of the target zone. Floating polystyrene particles were placed on the surface of the water to hide the platform from sight. Extra maze cues (simple geometrical shapes) and visual references (chair, table) were present around the room to provide spatially oriented cues. Four points around the circumference of the maze were arbitrarily designated as N, S, E, and W, which served as a reference for experimenters when releasing the mice into the pool. For the acquisition trial, mice performed 4 trials per day (with 60 s of intertrial interval) for 4 consecutive days in which each mouse was released to the pool from different starting points and trained to a constant platform position. 24 h after the last trial a probe test was carried out during which the platform was removed. Two days after, a reversal task was performed in order to assess cognitive flexibility. The platform was placed in the opposite quadrant in the tank and there were 4 daily trials for 4 days. And 24 h later, a probe trial was given similar to that of acquisition phase. An experimenter, blind to the genotype, manually recorded the escape latency during training phase and the latency and the time spent in the target zone of the maze during probe phase. After each trial, mice were placed on a paper towel for additional drying and then put back into their home cages.</p>

<title>Trace and Standard Fear Conditioning</title>
<p>Auditory trace and delay fear conditioning were performed by placing the mice in an opaque conditioning chamber (L × W × H: 25 × 17 × 23 cm<sup>3</sup>) with a grid floor through which scrambled foot shocks could be delivered as unconditioned stimuli (US; 0.26 mA average intensity). The chamber was placed into a dimly lit (&lt;5 lux) sound attenuating box (background noise level 55 dB), and a speaker on top of the chamber allowed to deliver sounds as conditioning stimuli (CS; 2000 Hz).</p>
<p>All mice were pre-exposed to the test chamber for 10 min on the day preceding conditioning. On day 2, the day of the conditioning, after 60s of baseline period (no stimulus), 5 trials were presented separated by 60 s of intertrial intervals (ITI). In the trace fear conditioning, every trial is composed by the presentation of the CS (15 s) followed, 15 s later, by the presentation of the shock for 2 s. Instead in the delay fear conditioning each trial is composed by the CS (15 s), with the US delivered during the last 2 s of CS presentation.</p>
<p>The mice freezing behavior was measured during the presentation of the CS. And 24 h after fear conditioning, mice were placed in the conditioning box again, measuring their freezing behavior in the context test and tone test. Context testing consisted of 2 min without CS (“contextual freezing”), tone testing consisted of 1 min without CS followed by 1 min with the CS turned on.</p>

<title>Absence of TSPAN7 Alters the Postsynaptic Compartment of Excitatory Synapses in the CA1 Region of the Hippocampus</title>
<p>To examine TSPAN7 function in vivo, we generated <italic>Tm4sf2</italic>-knockout (<italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed the absence of TSPAN7 protein (27 kDa) in the brains of the mutant mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>). Histological analysis was performed on sections of paraffin-embedded brain tissue and showed no changes in the brain structure neither in hippocampi nor in cortex architecture in either young (P30) or adult (P90) <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice compared with <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> mice (data not shown and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 1C</xref>). Therefore we initially concentrated on the hippocampus considering its role in learning and memory, which are the cognitive functions mainly impaired in patients with mutations in <italic>TM4SF2</italic>, and the results obtained in hippocampal culture neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C7">Bassani et al. 2012</xref>). Ultrastructural analysis of excitatory synapses revealed a significant reduction in the length and thickness of postsynaptic densities (PSDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C25">Dosemeci et al. 2001</xref>) in both young (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 1D</xref>) and adult <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F1">1</xref><italic>A</italic> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). To support these observations deriving from two-dimensional projections, we processed tissue blocks from the apical dendrite layer of the hippocampal CA1 region for serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM) and 3D volume reconstruction. From the stack of serial aligned images, volumes were reconstructed, and structures of interest (PSDs, dendritic spines and dendrites) were segmented, modeled and measured using AMIRA software. Consistent with the PSD reductions observed in the hippocampal sections from adult <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice, we observed a significant reduction in PSD volume in the corresponding samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F1">1</xref><italic>B</italic> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).

<p>Finally, we used SBFSEM series reconstruction (total of 500 μm<sup>3</sup> of hippocampal tissue) to evaluate differences in spine density between <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> and <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice in the apical dendrites of the CA1 region. In young animals, there was no difference in spine density in the apical dendrites of the CA1 region between genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 1D</xref>), whereas the spine density was significantly reduced in the CA1 region of adult <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice compared with control mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F1">1</xref><italic>B</italic> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). This difference between young and adult mice could be due to the fact that young animals have more plastic spines that undergo faster turnover than adult animals, which have remarkably stable spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C28">Grutzendler et al. 2002</xref>). To determine whether <italic>Tm4sf2</italic> ablation exclusively affects the postsynaptic compartment or more generally affects asymmetric synapses, we performed quantitative measurements of excitatory presynaptic terminals in the hippocampal CA1 regions of <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> and <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice. Once differences in individual synaptic vesicles were excluded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), we measured the presynaptic profile, synaptic vesicle density and vesicle distribution inside synaptic terminals. Regardless of mouse genotype or age, all these parameters were similar among the examined samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F1">1</xref><italic>A</italic> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that <italic>Tm4sf2</italic> gene disruption had no effect on the structure of inhibitory synapses within the same hippocampal region. Inhibitory synaptic profiles were identified on thin sections based on positive staining with antibodies against the neurotransmitter GABA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>). In these profiles, we measured the mean presynaptic surface and synaptic vesicle density. The absence of TSPAN7 had no effect on the structure of inhibitory terminals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we used western blotting to determine how lack of TSPAN7 expression changes the levels of endogenous pre- and postsynaptic proteins in the hippocampus. The results showed a significant reduction in the expression of the GluA2 and GluA2/3 AMPAR subunits (GluA2: <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> 1.000 ± 0.049 vs. <italic>Tm4sf2<sup>−</sup></italic><sup><italic>/y</italic></sup> 0.640 ± 0.043, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; GluA2/3: <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> 1.000 ± 0.032 vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−<italic>/y</italic></sup> 0.700 ± 0.027, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01. At least 6 mice per genotype were analysed). By contrast, GluA1, PSD95, Gephyrin, Neuroligin 2, PICK1, the α1 subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub>R, GluN1, GluK2, Homer and the presynaptic markers Synaptophysin and GAD65 were unaltered (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F1">1</xref><italic>C</italic>). Next, we determined whether a decrease in AMPAR subunit expression occurred at the neuron cell surface. BS3 crosslinking experiments were used to quantify the surface expression of membrane proteins, and the results showed that <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−<italic>/y</italic></sup> mice displayed lower levels of GluA2 and GluA2/3-containing AMPAR at the plasma membrane than <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> mice (GluA2: <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> 1 ± 0 vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> 0.85 ± 0.03, *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; GluA2/3: <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> 1 ± 0 vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> 0.57 ± 0.09, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test.) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F1">1</xref><italic>D</italic>). By contrast, the surface expression of the GluA1 subunit and the transferrin receptor was unaltered (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F1">1</xref><italic>D</italic>). These findings are consistent with the observed reductions in PSD size and spine number in the <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice.</p>

<p>To explore the physiological consequences of the structural modifications induced by <italic>Tm4sf2</italic> loss of function, we investigated basal synaptic transmission in the Schaffer collateral (SC)–CA1 pathway in hippocampal slices from <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> and <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice.</p>
<p>We found that <italic>Tm4sf2</italic> loss of function induced changes in the basal properties of AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (AMPAR-mEPSCs) compared with wild-type mice (Amplitude: <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> n<sub>cells</sub> = 7: 9.2 ± 0.9 pA vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> n<sub>cells</sub> = 10: 6.6 ± 0.4 pA; *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test; and frequency: <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> n<sub>cells</sub> = 7: 0.35 ± 0.07 Hz vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> n<sub>cells</sub> = 10: 0.17 ± 0.02 Hz; **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). Notably, <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice showed significant reduction in the amplitude and frequency of AMPAR-mEPSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F1">1</xref><italic>E</italic>). It has been well established that mEPSC amplitude is directly linked to postsynaptic function and that changes in this parameter are associated to changes in postsynaptic receptor efficacy and/or density. In the present study, the observed decrease in amplitude was in agreement with the reduced expression levels of the GluA2 and GluA2/3 AMPAR subunits. Furthermore, <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice showed an increased AMPAR RI relative to <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> mice (<italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> n<sub>cells</sub> = 7: 2.9 ± 0.5 vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> n<sub>cells</sub> = 6: 5.3 ± 0.8; *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F1">1</xref>F). AMPAR RI, calculated as the ratio between the current evoked at negative potential and the current evoked at positive potentials, is routinely used as a readout for modification in AMPARs subunit composition, taking advantage of the different channel conductance that GluA2 AMPAR subunit confers to the receptor. In particular, it is widely reported that GluA2-lacking AMPARs are more rectifying compared with GluA2-containing AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C2">Adesnik and Nicoll 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C24">Derkach et al. 2007</xref>). With our experiments, we showed that AMPAR RI was increased in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice compared with <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> mice reinforcing the evidence of a decreased number of GluA2-containing AMPARs in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C79">Washburn et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C36">Jackson and Nicoll 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>To further explore the effect of the absence of TSPAN7 on AMPA-mEPSC frequency, we performed paired pulse ratio (PPR) experiments to analyse the ratio between the second and first evoked response in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> and <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice. The results showed no significant difference in neurotransmitter release probability between genotypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F1">1</xref><italic>G</italic>), indicating that the reduction in AMPA-mEPSC frequency resulted either from the presence of under-threshold currents masked by background noise or a reduced number of functional synapses caused by the observed reduction in spine density. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic> loss of function had no effect on the basal properties of GABA-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (GABA-mIPSCs) compared with <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 2C, D</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess whether <italic>Tm4sf2</italic> disruption could affect the excitation-inhibition balance in the brain, we measured the excitability in brain slices from CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons from <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> and <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> mice. After the application of somatic depolarizing current stimuli, we evaluated action potential (AP) firing properties analysing parameters usually associated to neuronal excitability such as AP threshold, minimum current intensity (MCI) and AP firing frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C63">Pizzamiglio et al. 2016</xref>). AP threshold is defined as the membrane voltage at which AP firing starts, while the MCI is the current that has to be injected inside neurons to reach the threshold for AP. In presence of an unbalance between excitation and inhibition these parameters result altered. In particular, when the inhibition is prominent, as for example upon exaggerated GABAergic or decreased glutamatergic transmission, the threshold for AP results increased as well as more current has to be injected to reach the new threshold for AP. We showed that <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice resulted to be impaired for AP threshold, MCI and AP firing frequency (AP threshold: <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> n<sub>cells</sub> = 27: −51.3 ± 0.9 mV vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> n<sub>cells</sub> = 21: −47.8 ± 1.3 mV, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; MCI: <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> n<sub>cells</sub> = 27: 36.7 ± 4.7 pA vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> n<sub>cells</sub> = 20: 83.0 ± 10.5, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test ***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; AP frequency: <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> n<sub>cells</sub> = 28 vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> n<sub>cells</sub> = 19 two-way ANOVA RM, <italic>f</italic><sub>1-225</sub> = 15.92, ***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F2">2</xref>A). Altogether, these results indicate that <italic>Tm4sf2</italic> loss of function negatively modulates excitatory transmission and that hippocampal pyramidal neurons are less excitable in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice than in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> mice.

<title>Long-term Potentiation is Altered in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> Mice</title>
<p>Next, we examined whether the above alterations affected synaptic plasticity in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice. To accomplish this, we recorded field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F2">2</xref><italic>B</italic>) to study basal hippocampal synaptic activity and LTP in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> and <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> mice.</p>
<p>First, we stimulated SC with increasing intensity (0–1.0 mA) to generate input/output (I/O) curves. Then, we recorded fEPSPs from the <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> of the CA1 region and evaluated changes in fEPSP slopes as a percentage of the maximal response. The results showed that <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice have smaller evoked responses than wild-type mice, suggesting that these mice have weaker SC-CA1 synapses than <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> mice (<italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> n<sub>slices</sub> = 5 vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−<italic>/y</italic></sup> n<sub>slices</sub> = 6, two-way ANOVA RM with Bonferroni post hoc test, <italic>f</italic><sub>1-90</sub> = 5.66, *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F2">2</xref><italic>C</italic>). PPR experiments using the field potential configuration confirmed that there were no significant differences in the glutamate release probability between the genotypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F2">2</xref><italic>D</italic>). Next, we recorded fEPSPs at SC-CA1 synapses before and after NMDA-dependent LTP induction, using 10 min of recording of a half-maximal response as the baseline. Notably, LTP induction at the SC-CA1 synapse was severely impaired in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice compared with control animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F2">2</xref><italic>E</italic> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>). By contrast, when we removed Mg<sup>2+</sup> from the aCSF, we observed normal LTPs even in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice (<italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> n<sub>slices</sub> = 9: 203.8 ± 20.6% vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> n<sub>slices</sub> = 5: 115.4 ± 17.3% vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> Mg<sup>2+</sup> free n<sub>slices</sub> = 5: 185.2 ± 16.6%, *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 one-way ANOVA followed by Newman–Keuls post test) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F2">2</xref><italic>E</italic>), suggesting that AMPAR cannot induce the removal of Mg<sup>2+</sup> from NMDAR and thus prevents the induction of LTP.</p>
<p>Overall, these results suggest that TSPAN7 has a role in excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus.</p>

<sup>−/y</sup> Mice Have Defects in Hippocampal-Dependent Episodic, Spatial and Associative Memory</title>
<p>We monitored <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−<italic>/y</italic></sup> and <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> littermates to examine their explorative and emotional behaviors using a dark/light box, emergence tests and activity cages.

<p>In the novel object recognition task, <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice showed a reduced discrimination index when tested 5 min, 120 min and 24 h after familiarization compared with <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> mice [5 min delay: <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup>: 0.1329 ± 0.0300 vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup>: −0.0814 ± 0.0300; 120 min delay: <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup>: 0.2571 ± 0.0416 vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup>: −0.1557 ± 0.0300; 24 h delay: <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup>: 0.27 ± 0.04 vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup>: −0.03 ± 0.04; n<sub>mice</sub> = 7 per group, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, two-way ANOVA showed difference in the genotype (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,36</sub> = 27.30, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) in the time (<italic>F</italic><sub>2,36</sub> = 11.17, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) but not in the interaction genotype × time (<italic>F</italic><sub>2,36</sub> = 1.927, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05)] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F3">3</xref><italic>A</italic>). The mean exploration time to the novel object was increased in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> mice compared with the familiar in all tested intervals, while <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice showed no difference in mean exploration time between familiar and novel object (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 4A</xref>). This result suggests that the <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice had defects in recognition memory, which agrees with a previous report that damage to the hippocampus is sufficient to impair recognition memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C73">Squire et al. 2007</xref>).

<p>Finally the <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> and <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice were subjected to auditory fear conditioning, which measures mice associative learning. In this test, 2 procedures were used. Briefly, in the standard protocol, the unconditioned stimulus (US: foot shock) was superimposed for a short period of time with the presentation of the conditioned stimulus (CS: tone), while in trace fear conditioning protocol US presentation occurred a short while after the CS was presented and removed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F3">3</xref><italic>F</italic>). Notably, trace and standard conditioning are dependent on different mechanisms, and only trace fear conditioning depends on an intact hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C35">Huerta et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C69">Shors et al. 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In the standard conditioning protocol, no significant differences between genotypes were found. Repeated presentation of the CS significantly elicited freezing in both groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F3">3</xref><italic>G</italic>), and no differences were observed during CS acquisition (ANOVA genotype effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,33</sub> = 2.11; <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05), context (ANOVA genotype effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,33</sub> = 0.01; <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) or cue test (ANOVA genotype effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,33</sub> = 0.15; <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F3">3</xref><italic>G</italic>).

<title>Rescue of Synaptic Impairment by pep2-EVKI Treatment in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> Mice</title>
<p>We previously demonstrated that TSPAN7 modulates GluA2 binding to the PICK1 PDZ domain and thereby regulates the internalization of GluA2-containing AMPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C7">Bassani et al. 2012</xref>).

We found that pep2-EVKI, but not pep2-SVKE, increased the GluA2/3 surface expression (<italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup>+pep2-SVKE n<sub>mice</sub> = 4: 1 ± 0 vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup>+pep2-SVKE n<sub>mice</sub> = 3: 0.91 ± 0.01 vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup>+pep2-EVKI n<sub>mice</sub> = 3: 1.85 ± 0.03 vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup>+pep2-EVKI n<sub>mice</sub> = 3: 1.58 ± 0.07, *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, ***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 one-way ANOVA followed by Newman–Keuls post test) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F4">4</xref><italic>B</italic>) and restored RI (<italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup>+pep2-SVKE n<sub>cells</sub> = 10: 2.2 ± 0.3 vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup>+pep2-SVKE n<sub>cells</sub> = 12: 4.7 ± 0.6 vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup>+pep2-EVKI n<sub>cells</sub> = 7: 2.4 ± 0.3 vs. <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup>+pep2-EVKI n<sub>cells</sub> = 9: 2.5 ± 0.2, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, one-way ANOVA followed by Newman–Keuls post test) in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F4">4</xref><italic>C</italic>,<italic>D</italic>).

These data indicate that inhibiting the PICK1/GluA2 association leads to the complete recovery of synaptic plasticity in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice, likely due to decreased intracellular retention of AMPAR.

<p>Next, we investigated whether treatment with a positive modulator of AMPARs could rescue the impairments observed in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice. To accomplish this, we evaluated synaptic function after either acute or chronic systemic treatment with the CX516. This compound acts as a positive allosteric modulator of AMPARs and was previously demonstrated to ameliorate deficits in AMPAR function and to improve behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C29">Hampson et al. 1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C30">1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C39">Kanju et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C14">Broberg et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C72">Simmons et al. 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>CX516 Rescues ID-Like Behavior in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> Mice</title>
<p>After assessing the positive effects of chronic CX516 treatment on synaptic alterations in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice, we next examined whether this treatment could improve learning and memory defects in these mice.</p>
<p>The results showed that CX516 treatment did not modify motor function in either genotype based on the mean number of horizontal and vertical counts taken over 30 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 7A, B</xref>). Notably, chronic treatment of CX516 improved episodic memory defects of <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice in terms of increased discrimination index (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F5">5</xref><italic>H</italic> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 3B</xref>) and mean exploration time to the novel object (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 8A</xref>). Furthermore, CX516 treatment rescued defects in spatial memory in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice, as assessed by the spatial object recognition task for discrimination index (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F5">5</xref><italic>I</italic> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 3B</xref>) and mean exploration time to the displaced object (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 8B</xref>).</p>
<p>Chronic CX516 treatment also recovered associative memory in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice based on the results of auditory trace fear conditioning (ANOVA treatment effect <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−<italic>/y</italic></sup>: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,43</sub> = 5233, *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; ANOVA treatment effect <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> : <italic>F</italic><sub>1,44</sub> = 6,85, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bhx221F5">5</xref><italic>L</italic>). Importantly, no significant difference was observed between <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice treated with CX516 and <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> mice, supporting the efficacy of the treatment.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the current study, we focused on evaluating the role of TSPAN7 in synapse function in vivo. To accomplish this, we characterized the functional, behavioral, and molecular phenotypes of <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice. We found that neurons in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice have reductions in PSD length, thickness and volume as well as decreased excitatory synapse density. We also found that the absence of TSPAN7 causes reductions in the levels of GluA2- and GluA2/3-containing AMPARs at synapses but does not affect the presence of GluA1 or NMDAR subunit GluN1. Furthermore, <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice showed increased AMPAR RI compared with <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> mice indicating that the former had a decreased number of GluA2-containing AMPARs at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C36">Jackson and Nicoll 2011</xref>). As a result of this reduction and the observed decrease in spine density, the amplitude and frequency of AMPA-mEPSCs were decreased in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C4">Aoto et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C41">Lee et al. 2015</xref>). We hypothesize that the thinning and decreased number of PSDs in the <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice resulted from decreased synaptic activity due to reduced levels of GluA2- and GluA2/3-containing AMPARs. This is in agreement with previous reports indicating that PSDs are modified by synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C25">Dosemeci et al. 2001</xref>) and that increased expression of GluA3-containing AMPARs is linked to thicker PSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C21">Clarkson et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Alterations in AMPARs have been reported in several animal models of ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C16">Calfa et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C52">Mignogna et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C48">Li et al. 2016</xref>) as well as in postmortem brains from patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C64">Purcell et al. 2001</xref>). Additionally, AMPAR dysfunctions have been reported to alter the excitation/inhibition balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C43">Lee et al. 2017</xref>). In agreement with this relationship, we showed that CA1 pyramidal neurons in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice are less excitable than those in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> mice, suggesting an excitation/inhibition imbalance, which is a very common phenotype in neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C55">Nelson and Valakh 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C43">Lee et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C77">Uzunova et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C83">Zapata et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, LTP it is well known to depend on AMPARs and NMDARs activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C42">Neves et al., 2008</xref>). NMDA receptors at resting membrane potentials are blocked by Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which is removed by AMPARs-mediated depolarization. For these reasons, we hypothesize that LTP impairment observed in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice could be due to the reduction of AMPARs whose activation will result insufficient to remove NMDARs Mg<sup>2+</sup> block thereby preventing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from triggering synapse potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C49">Lu et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C44">Lee et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C57">Oren et al. 2009</xref>). Indeed, when we bypassed AMPARs activation inducing LTP in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free condition we observed a complete recovery of LTP in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−/y</sup> mice, suggesting that our hypothesis was correct.</p>
<p>In accordance with their impaired LTP, <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice showed defects in cognitive functions related to novel object recognition, spatial object recognition, water maze and fear conditioning tests. Moreover, fear conditioning task revealed that <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice were impaired in the trace-conditioning paradigm, suggesting they also had reductions in associative cue learning. This finding is in agreement with the severe impairments in spatial and non-spatial memory that have been observed in GluA2-knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C27">Gerlai et al. 1998</xref>). Furthermore, the disruptive effects on memory were due to nonspecific motor impairment because <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−<italic>/y</italic></sup> mice showed no impairment in locomotor activity. Notably, the <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice showed defects in both phases of the water maze test as well as in trace fear conditioning, suggesting that other brain areas could be affected in these animals in addition to the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C22">Darvas and Palmiter 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C54">Moustafa et al. 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, LTP and memory defects observed here are similar to the features of several neurodevelopmental disorders such as Angelman syndrome, Fragile X mental retardation (FMR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C40">Lauterborn et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C45">Lee et al. 2011</xref>), ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C13">Bozdagi et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C68">Schmeisser et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C81">Won et al. 2012</xref>) and Rett syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C10">Belichenko et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Mechanistically, we previously reported that TSPAN7 competes with PICK1 for the binding with GluA2, regulating AMPAR trafficking in cultured neurons. TSPAN7 knockdown increases PICK1–GluA2/3 binding, which in turn augments the intracellular retention or internalization of GluA2-containing AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C6">Bassani et al. 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that this mechanism occurs also in vivo. It is widely reported that AMPAR rectification increases when GluA2-containing AMPARs decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C79">Washburn et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C36">Jackson and Nicoll 2011</xref>). In line with these observations, we demonstrated an increased AMPAR RI in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice reflecting a reduction in GluA2-containing AMPARs expression.</p>
<p>Following our hypothesis of an increased GluA2 AMPAR subunit internalization, we mimicked the function of TSPAN7 in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice using a synthetic peptide (pep2-EVKI) that has previously been shown to compete with the PICK1–GluA2 interaction. This approach was able to increase GluA2 AMPAR subunit surface expression in both <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>+/y</italic></sup> and <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice and to restore AMPAR RI and a normal LTP in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice, thus confirming in vivo the previously demonstrated TSPAN7 involvement in AMPAR trafficking.</p>
<p>We also found that boosting synaptic activity through treatment with the ampakine CX516 partially rescued synaptic structure, function and plasticity and ameliorated learning and memory defects in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice. Several studies reported that, in general, ampakines are molecules that readily cross the blood–brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C74">Staubli et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C65">Ren et al. 2015</xref>) but no studies reported specifically the blood–brain barrier penetrance for CX516. However, CX516 was injected intraperitoneally in animals with positive effects on memory correlated to neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C29">Hampson et al. 1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C30">1998b</xref>) suggesting that also this molecule cross the blood–brain barrier. Furthermore, ampakines have previously been proposed as a pharmacological tool for the treatment of several neurological pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C56">Ogier et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C71">Simmons et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C70">Silverman et al. 2013</xref>); however, they have not been used to treat ID despite being shown to rescue AMPAR defects, enhance LTP, improve animal learning task performance and augment cognition in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C29">Hampson et al. 1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C30">1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C50">Lynch and Gall 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C80">Wezenberg et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bhx221C17">Chang et al. 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is not surprising that CX516 rescued the aberrant phenotype in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice. Functionally, in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup><italic>−/y</italic></sup> mice, the administration of CX516 enhances AMPAR activity that could trigger the insertion of additional GluA2-containing AMPARs into the plasma membrane or drive extrasynaptic GluA2-containing AMPARs to the synapse, thereby recovering LTP, learning and memory.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results indicate that positive allosteric modulation of AMPAR rescues the ID-like phenotype in <italic>Tm4sf2</italic><sup>−<italic>/y</italic></sup> mice and suggest that AMPAR could be a potential therapeutic target for ID.</p>
