<abstract>
<p>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscle-wasting disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene encoding dystrophin, expressed mainly in muscles but also in other tissues like retina and brain. Non-progressing cognitive dysfunction occurs in 20 to 50% of DMD patients. Furthermore, loss of expression of the Dp427 dystrophin isoform in the brain of <italic>mdx</italic> mice, the most used animal model of DMD, leads to behavioral deficits thought to be linked to insufficiencies in synaptogenesis and channel clustering at synapses. <italic>Mdx</italic> mice where the locomotor phenotype is mild also display a high and maladaptive response to stress. Recently, we generated <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats carrying an out-of frame mutation in exon 23 of the DMD gene and exhibiting a skeletal and cardiac muscle phenotype similar to DMD patients. In order to evaluate the impact of dystrophin loss on behavior, we explored locomotion parameters as well as anhedonia, anxiety and response to stress, in <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats aged from 1.5 to 7 months, in comparison to wild-type (WT) littermates. Pattern of dystrophin expression in the brain of WT and <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats was characterized by western-blot analyses and immunohistochemistry. We showed that dystrophin-deficient <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats displayed motor deficits in the beam test, without association with depressive or anxiety-like phenotype. However, <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats exhibited a strong response to restraint-induced stress, with a large increase in freezings frequency and duration, suggesting an alteration in a functional circuit including the amygdala. In brain, large dystrophin isoform Dp427 was not expressed in mutant animals. <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rat is therefore a good animal model for preclinical evaluations of new treatments for DMD but care must be taken with their responses to mild stress.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a X-linked neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene, leading to a lack of dystrophin expression, a cytoskeletal protein mainly expressed in muscles, but also in other tissues like retina and brain. This disease is characterized by skeletal muscle pathology, but also cognitive and behavioral issues for around 20–50% of patients. Indeed, in addition to cognitive impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref001">1</xref>], a subset of DMD patients suffer from attention-deficit/hyperactivity, anxiety, autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy and obsessive-compulsive disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref005">5</xref>]. The reasons explaining these impairments rely on the variable location of mutations in the DMD gene, affecting shorter brain dystrophin isoforms normally produced from independent promoters. The more severe cognitive impairments in patients are, the more distal part of this gene is affected with mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref006">6</xref>]. As opposed to muscular symptoms, cognitive disabilities are not progressive, and not a consequence of muscle alterations. Cognitive functioning in DMD also includes deficits in linguistic functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref007">7</xref>], short- and long-term memories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref009">9</xref>]. Impairments in different types of memories have been underlined in DMD patients, even with a normal IQ, suggesting a link with the full-length brain dystrophin commonly lost in all patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref011">11</xref>]. In the brain, it is expressed in areas involved in cognition and emotional behavior, such as hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum and sensory cortices. More precisely, those impairments seem to be related to the absence of dystrophin in hippocampal, cerebellar and prefrontal cortex synapses. In neurons, dystrophin selectively localizes to the postsynaptic membrane in inhibitory synapses and acts as an actin-binding postsynaptic scaffold in GABAergic synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>In the classical DMD model <italic>mdx</italic> mouse, the absence of the full-length brain dystrophin deficiency induces molecular, structural and physiological alterations in central inhibitory synapses, like an abnormal synaptic clustering and density of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in CA1 hippocampal dendritic layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref018">18</xref>], thus facilitating NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity and also inducing an abnormally increased hippocampal LTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref019">19</xref>]. We have to note, as an aside, that t the clinical level, an abnormal distribution of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors has also been found in brain of Duchenne patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref020">20</xref>]. In <italic>mdx</italic> mouse, long term object recognition memory is altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref022">22</xref>], as well as the acquisition and long-term retention of fear memories, depending on the amygdala, and hippocampal-dependent learning strategy in the water maze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref023">23</xref>]. However, no deficits are encountered in this model for spatial working memory, flexibility, perception and sensorimotor gating of auditory inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref023">23</xref>]. This model of <italic>mdx</italic> mice is also known for their enhanced fearfulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref024">24</xref>]. Indeed, they display elevated levels of freezing behavior in response to mild behavioral stress or electric shock, in an independent way from skeletal muscle impairment, but dependent on brain dystrophin, as fear responses can be reduced by rescuing brain dystrophin expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>The role of dystrophin in the brain is still not fully understood. It is thought to have a role in executive functions, perception and information processing, but has not yet been extensively studied. In this study, we used the <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rat model, which was recently generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref026">26</xref>] in order to counteract the minor clinical dysfunction of <italic>mdx</italic> mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref027">27</xref>] and the fact that their small size imposes limitations in the analysis of several aspects of the disease. Moreover, rats display complex social traits and have a convenient size since they are 10 times larger than mice, allowing the possibility to collect large quantities of biological tissues compared to mice. But rats remain a small laboratory animal model and allow studies with high statistical power. In this model, muscular function has been investigated. We previously showed that at 3 months, forelimb, hindlimb, diaphragm and cardiac muscles displayed severe fiber necrosis. At 7 months, in skeletal muscles regeneration activity was decreased with muscle showing abundant peri- and endomysial fibrosis with some adipose tissue infiltration as in skeletal muscles from DMD patients. Furthermore, in <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats muscle, strength and spontaneous activity were decreased and fatigue was a prominent finding of muscle function analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref026">26</xref>]. The purpose of this work is to characterize in detail locomotion parameters, anxiety behavior and freezing response of <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats emerging in response to a short restraint stress. Indeed, quantitative evaluation of fearfulness in animal models may provide a relevant readout in preclinical assessment of therapies targeting the skeletal but also central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref028">28</xref>].</p>

<p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Experimentation of the Pays de la Loire Region, France, in accordance with the guidelines from the French National Research Council for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Permit Numbers: APAFIS#10792–2017061316021120). All efforts were made to minimize suffering. Sprague-Dawley (SD/Crl) rats were obtained from Charles River (L’Arbresle, France) and <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> (KO) littermates animals of different ages were generated as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref026">26</xref>]. The rats were housed in a controlled environment (ventilated racks, ambient temperature of 21°C, ambient hygrometry of 55%, 12 h light/dark cycle (dark at 8 pm, light at 8 am)), with several animals per cage, all males. Diet consisted of a standard diet (SAFE A04, Safe, Augy, France) given <italic>ad libitum</italic>, sterilized and filtrated water also given <italic>ad libitum</italic>. All behavioral tests were performed blind to animal identities.</p>

<title>Ledged beam-walking test</title>
<p><italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> and WT animals aged 7 months were trained on a tapered/ledged beam-walking test, adapted from the procedure previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref029">29</xref>]. This test is sensitive to dopaminergic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref032">32</xref>]. Rats walked along a 165 cm-long, progressively narrowing (6.5 cm wide at the wide end, 1.5 cm at the narrow end) Plexiglas beam, elevated above the floor on an incline of 15°, to reach their home cage. Two cm below the beam was a 2.5 cm-wide Plexiglas ledge that provided a platform to step on when there was a motor deficit. This ledge allowed rats to express their motor deficit, and removed the need for postural compensation to prevent falling off the beam. Taking a step with only one or two toes on the main surface of the beam (and the other four or three toes overhanging the ledge) was scored as a half foot-fault, whereas stepping with the entire foot on the ledge rather than on the main surface of the beam was scored as a full foot-fault. Before testing, each animal was allowed one refresher trial, which was not videotaped. One test consisted of 3 consecutive trials videotaped from the rear to allow a clear observation of the hindlimbs.</p>

<title>Elevated plus-maze</title>
<p>The elevated plus-maze is used to measure the level of anxiety-like behavior. The maze was made of 4 arms, two with high walls and two without walls and was elevated 1 meter above the floor, with an light intensity of 300 Lux in open arms. The behavioral model is based on the general aversion of rodents to open spaces. This aversion leads to thigmotaxis, a preference for remaining in enclosed spaces or close to the edges of a bounded space. In the elevated plus maze, this translates into the animals limiting their movement to the enclosed arms. At the start of each test, the rat was placed in the center of the maze, nose facing an open arm, and was allowed to explore it for 10 minutes. Each trial was videotaped, and the number of arm entries and the time spent in the opened and the closed arms were measured. The maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials. Time spent in open arms was calculated, equal to (time spent in open arms) / (time spent in closed arms + time spent in open arms). This value is proportional to the anxiety level of the animal. Also, total number of entries into each arms, which is linked to global locomotion, was recorded.</p>

<title>Sucrose preference</title>
<p>Sucrose preference is a locomotor-independent test in which the relative preference for a sucrose-sweetened solution (<italic>vs</italic>. water) gives a measure related to the anhedonia observed in depressive patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref033">33</xref>]. Rats were given a choice between two bottles containing either tap water or 2% sucrose solution in their home cages during 48 h. The position of the two bottles was switched after 24 h in order to avoid a side preference. Water and sucrose consumptions were measured each day at the end of the afternoon by weighing the bottles. Sucrose preference (sucrose solution consumption (g) / water consumption (g) + sucrose solution consumption (g)) was calculated over the 48 h period and compared between both groups.</p>

<title>Restraint-stress and open-field</title>
<p>6 weeks-old <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> and WT rats were weighed and then restrained for 10 seconds by grasping the scruff and back skin between thumb and other fingers, and tilting the animal upside-down in order that the ventral part of its body faced the experimenter. Immediately after they were placed in the center of the open-field arena (Bioseb) and recorded from above during 5 minutes, at a light intensity of 100 Lux. Non-stressed rats were removed from cage, weighed, and directly placed in the arena center.</p>
<p>Unconditioned fear responses induced by this short restraint stress were characterized by periods of tonic immobility (freezing) and quantified during the 5 min recording period. Complete immobilization of the rat, except for respiration, was regarded as a freezing response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref034">34</xref>].

<p>After euthanasia (deep anaesthesia and analgesia following i.p. injection of a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg, Imalgene, Merial, Lyon, France) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, Rompun, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) and then decapitation), brains from 6 weeks old animals from each genotype were extracted from the skull. For western blot analysis, samples from different brain regions were manually dissected, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &lt;-70°C: medial prefrontal cortex (P), amygdala (A), dorsal hippocampus (D), ventral hippocampus (V), cerebellum (C). Finally, spinal cord (SC) was dissected, sampled as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref035">35</xref>], rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &lt;-70°C.

<title>Central nervous system preparation for immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>For immunohistochemistry, whole brain from one to 3 months old animals was immediately cut into 5 slices at the level of respectively (i) the frontal pole, (ii) the optic chiasm, (iii) the oculomotor nerve, (iv) the midbrain and (v) the occipital pole. Each slice was immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen cooled isopentane and stored at &lt;-70°C. Brain slices were cut with a cryostat. Mouse monoclonal antibodies NCL-DYSB (1:25, Novocastra Laboratories (NL), Newcastle, UK), MANEX5556 (1:50, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) and NCL-DYS2 (1:50, NL) were respectively used for the detection of Dp427, Dp427/Dp140 and Dp427/Dp140/Dp71 isoforms. For DYSB only, transverse cryosections were placed in 0.01 M citric acid, 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 6) and placed in a water bath for 15 min at 98°C. For all immunolabellings, sections were pre-incubated in PBS with 5% normal goat serum (Dako) for 30 min at room temperature (RT) and then incubated with primary antibody in 5% rat serum overnight at 4°C. After washing, primary antibody was revealed using a biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:300, Dako) in PBS with 5% rat serum for 1 hour at RT. Bound antibodies were detected with streptavidin (Dako) and DAB Liquid Substrate (Dako) for immunoperoxidase. Slides were counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin and mounted. All slides evaluations were performed by a skilled pathologist certified by the European College of Veterinary Pathology.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Total proteins from different brain areas were extracted using 400 μL of RIPA extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche) and ground with TissueLyser II (Qiagen). 80 μg (for MANEX 1011C antibody) or 30 μg (for NCL-DYS2 antibody) of protein extracts were loaded on a 3–8% Tris-Acetate Precast polyacrylamide gel of NuPAGE Large Protein blotting kit (Invitrogen). Additionally, controls were loaded on each gel: muscle protein extract (<italic>biceps femoris</italic>) from a WT rat for detection of Dp427 and total brain protein extract for Dp71 and Dp140. In order to compare dystrophin levels between brain areas, these samples were loaded on one unique gel for the same animal. After Red Ponceau staining, membranes were incubated with two different mouse anti-Dystrophin antibodies: NCL-DYS2 (1:100, Novocastra), for the detection of Dp71 and Dp140 isoforms, MANEX 1011C (1:250, MDA Monoclonal Antibody Resource) for the detection of Dp427 isoform. An anti-GAPDH antibody (1:10000, Imgenex) was also used as a loading control. Detection was performed using either a secondary anti-mouse IgG HRP-conjugated antibody P0447 (1:5000, Dako) for dystrophin primary antibodies or secondary anti-goat IgG HRP-conjugated antibody P0449 (1:2000, Dako) for GAPDH primary antibody. Immunoblots were revealed with ECL Western blotting substrate (Pierce) and exposed to ECL-Hyperfilm (Amersham). For the semi-quantification analysis of the data, levels of dystrophin isoforms in each central nervous system region (n = 4 per genotype) were first normalized to GAPDH levels using ImageJ software, and then values were normalized to dystrophin Dp427 control muscle levels or to total brain Dp71 and Dp140 levels.</p>

<title>Anhedonia in the sucrose preference test and anxiety levels in the elevated plus maze are not affected in <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats</title>
<p>The sucrose preference test is usually used to evaluate anhedonia, indicated by a decrease in sucrose consumption, a typical depression-like behavior in rats and mice. Here evaluated this parameter at 2 different ages in terms of disease progression, 3 and 7 months. At 3 months and 7 months, no age nor genotype effect on sucrose preference was found, indicating that <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats had the same level of preference that WT rats over time (age: F(1,20) = 0.0125, p = 0.912; genotype: F(1,20) = 2.537, p = 0.127, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230083.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), despite a large variability for older <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> animals, with some of them having a very low sucrose preference.

<title>Behavioral response to restraint-induced mild stress</title>
<p>Locomotion was studied in an open-field arena for younger (6 weeks old) <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> mutants and WT rats. We used this age in order to assess if the response to stress is affected at an early timepoint. Duration of stress-induced tonic immobility, considered as a measure of unconditioned fearfulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref024">24</xref>], was also analyzed. For the retention group, animals were gently scruff-restrained for 10 seconds, in a way similar to the one used for the immobilization of rats for standard examination or intraperitoneal injections, whereas control animals were directly placed inside the open-field arena. <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats walked a shorter distance that WT littermates, and when looking at the effect of retention stress, we found that it only had an effect on <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> animals, because mutants from the retention group were less mobile than the unstressed <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> and WT animals (stress: F(1,52) = 3.9, p = 0.0536; genotype: F(1,52) = 54.38, p &lt; 0.0001, Tukey’s multiple comparison test, p &lt; 0.05 for <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> control vs. <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> retention, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230083.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

All animals from each group had the same levels of anxiety, as indicated by similar levels of thigmotaxis, with no effect of genotype nor stress (stress: F(1,52) = 0.259, p = 0.613; genotype: F(1,52) = 0.746, p = 0.392, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230083.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).

When freezing behavior was normalized to basal immobility, the same significant effect of stress was found throughout the 5-min testing period (stress: F(1,52) = 12.82, p = 0.0008; genotype: F(1,52) = 58.24, p &lt; 0.0001, Tukey’s multiple comparison test, p &lt; 0.001 for <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> control vs. <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> retention, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230083.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> animals, as opposed to WT littermates, display a maladaptive response to moderate stress, without being more anxious. These performances in the open-field cannot be attributed to overt changes in the behavioral expression of the fear response, as excessive grooming behavior was not observed during the sessions (stress: F(1,52) = 0.215, p = 0.645; genotype: F(1,52) = 0.276, p = 0.602, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230083.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

<title>Dp71, Dp 140 and Dp427 levels in different regions of central nervous system</title>
<p>Western blot analysis of dystrophin levels and immunolabelling of dystrophin in different areas of central nervous system were performed using two antibodies directed against epitopes located at the C-terminus (for Dp71 and Dp140 detection) and within exons 10–11 (for full dystrophin Dp427 detection). A normalization step was added by using total WT rat brain for Dp71 and Dp140, because these isoforms are absent from WT muscles, and by using WT skeletal muscle extract for Dp427 quantification, this isoform being highly expressed in muscle.</p>
<p>Using western blot in WT animals, Dp71isoform, implicated in transmembrane receptor binding and vascular development, was found equally distributed throughout brain areas and spinal cord, as expected. Due to the point mutation in exon 23, <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> and WT animals displayed the same absence of regional specificity of Dp71 expression in central nervous system (genotype: F(1,42) = 1.526, p = 0.224; region: F(6,42) = 1.218, p = 0.316, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230083.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Concerning Dp140 isoform, which participates to early development via regulation of neuron differentiation, neuron projection morphogenesis and chromatin modification, we found in WT animals the highest levels in cerebellum, which happen to be significantly higher than amygdala levels. Dp140 levels in the same areas from <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> animals were not different than WT littermates (genotype: F(1,42) = 3.944, p = 0.054; region: F(6,42) = 11.99, p &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230083.g006">Fig 6A and 6C</xref>). Interestingly, Dp140 was found at very low levels in spinal cord of animals from both groups, compared to other brain areas. Finally, we found that Dp427 isoform, which is found to the synaptic membrane of neurons with a function revolving around transmembrane transport and signal transmission, was unequally distributed throughout central nervous system areas of WT rats, with higher levels in cerebellum and spinal cord (genotype: F(1,42) = 73.90, p &lt; 0.0001; region: F(6,42) = 74.24, p &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230083.g006">Fig 6A and 6D</xref>). This is in line with previous mouse studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref008">8</xref>], where this isoform was found to be expressed in the cerebellum. As anticipated, using western blot no Dp427 was found for <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats, confirming the effectiveness of the generated mutation.</p>

Western-blot of total proteins was incubated with either monoclonal antibodies NCL-DYS2 and 30 μg protein loading for Dp71 and Dp140) or Manex1011C and 80 μg protein loading for Dp427 (A). Quantification on western-blot of dystrophin isoforms in each central nervous system region (n = 4 per genotype) were normalized to GAPDH levels, and then to dystrophin Dp427 control muscle levels (B, C). This revealed identical levels of 71 kDa (A, B) and 140 kDa (A, C) dystrophin isoforms in all studied central nervous system areas from WT and <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> animals.

<p>After immunohistolabelling using DYSB antibody, Dp427 was observed in WT animals with a faint intensity in large neuronal bodies of the hippocampal and cerebellar areas of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230083.g007">Fig 7</xref>). This isoform was absent from the <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> littermates. Immunolabelling of Dp427/Dp140 isoforms, using MANEX5556 antibody, was similar in WT and <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> animals, therefore indicating that this marking is probably Dp140 specific, as we showed before that Dp427 is absent from mutant animals. This isoform was found with a light intensity in smooth muscle layer of blood vessels present in the whole brain area, but we cannot exclude the presence of a glial marking around vessels. Lastly, immunolabelling of Dp427/Dp140/Dp71 isoforms was found with similar intensities in WT and <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup>, therefore indicating that this marking is probably Dp71 specific, as we showed before that Dp427 is absent from mutant animals and that Dp140 is only visible smooth muscle layers. Dp71 isoform was found exclusively in endothelial cells of blood capillaries throughout the entire brain area. No associated histologic lesions were identified.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study describes the neuromotor, anxiety and anhedonia characterization of the recently described dystrophin deficient rat model, <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref026">26</xref>]. It was previously demonstrated that cardiac and skeletal phenotypic properties of this model are very close to the human DMD pathology. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common neuromuscular disorder, representing about 30% of muscular dystrophies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref037">37</xref>], without any curative treatment to date. The present results demonstrate that <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats display neuromotor alterations at 7 months, as shown with the transversal beam test, in which mutant animals spent more time to cross the beam. However, no significant changes were found in the number of errors, neither for frontlimbs nor hindlimbs. This function mainly relies on the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, which is known to control the dexterity of movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref038">38</xref>], correlated with the number of errors performed upon crossing the beam. Locomotor measurements are important parameters allowing to define phenotypes of animal models with muscular dystrophies. Motor deficit underlined here may therefore be a consequence of dystrophin absence in muscles from the limbs, but we cannot exclude they may also result from reduced levels of cerebellar dystrophin, as demonstrated by western blot.</p>
<p>In DMD patients, clinically significant internalizing disorders including anxiety and depression have been demonstrated, so that even a Duchenne muscular dystrophy neuropsychiatric syndrome has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref039">39</xref>]. Indeed, a specific study on DMD patients demonstrated that 24% and 19% of them displayed anxiety and depression disorders, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref040">40</xref>]. Therefore, in order to measure anhedonia in mutant <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> animals, we used the sucrose preference test, reflecting the hedonic drive in a locomotor-independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref041">41</xref>]. The preference for sucrose solution was found to be unmodified in 3 months animals and not significantly reduced in 7 months old animals lacking dystrophin. This further supports the idea that this model does not manifest any depressive-like phenotype. In <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats, sucrose preference appears to decrease in a non-significant manner over time, this could be linked to the behavior of some animals that did not show any interest for the sucrose solution. Moreover, <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats performances in the elevated plus maze display a high variability indicating that anxiety-like behavior is absent in this model, as confirmed by the same level of thigmotaxis and grooming behavior in the open-field test between both groups. In this study, we have to report that motor impairment revealed in the beam test might have biased the assessment of emotional behaviors, which in many tests with a high-motor demand is dependent on mobility. Indeed, total number of entries into the elevated plus maze arms, an indicator of global locomotion, is significantly reduced at each studied timepoint. However, time in open arms did not differ between groups, so no misleading interpretation could be made. Contrasting results have been found on anxiety in the classical model of <italic>mdx</italic> mice. Indeed, in 2009 a group showed that this model did not display an anxiety-like phenotype in the elevated plus maze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref024">24</xref>]. However, other recent studies indicate a deficit in the light-dark choice anxiety test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref042">42</xref>]. Moreover, another group demonstrated anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in <italic>mdx</italic> mice, associated with decreased BDNF (Brain derived neurotrophic factor) levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref043">43</xref>]. It may therefore be useful to evaluate BDNF levels and perform light-dark choice anxiety tests to fully characterise the anxiety phenotype in <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats.</p>
<p>The open-field test was used to assess horizontal (distance and speed) and vertical (rearing) activities, which were shown to be reduced in 6 weeks-old <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats compared to WT rats. This reduced locomotion in the open-field arena has been previously reported for <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref026">26</xref>], as opposed to studies using <italic>mdx</italic> mice, which do not display any motor deficit before 6 months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref044">44</xref>], thus confirming the early locomotor deficit in this rat DMD model. It was previously shown that the rodent normal defensive behavior in response to danger or a threat is enhanced in <italic>mdx</italic> mice, showing potent defensive freezing responses to a short stress restraint, as opposed to WT animals, in a way independent from hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref024">24</xref>]. Here we show for the first time that a 10 seconds restraint stress on young <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats has an effect on exploratory behavior. Indeed, freezing, defined as a lasting tonic immobility involving a brain circuit including the amygdala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref024">24</xref>], is increased by retention for <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats in terms of freezing time and number of freezing events, while this effect is absent on WT littermates. It is important to notice that this effect is also found at a lower level in non-stressed <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> animals compared to WT. Therefore we have an exacerbation of freezing behavior following a brief stress event. This maladaptive response to stress confirms freezing behavior as an important and reliable study parameter in <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rat. These analyses were performed on young animals at the age of 6 weeks, and we cannot exclude that this phenotype will be exacerbated at later timepoints, which has to be taken into account in the design and follow-up of preclinical studies using this model. In <italic>mdx</italic> mice, this behavior has been shown to increase with age and is thought to be underlined by an alteration of amygdala GABAergic circuits in dystrophin deficient animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref025">25</xref>]. We may hypothesize the same thing is occurring in our model, as well as alterations of central serotonin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref045">45</xref>] and cholinergic functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref046">46</xref>]. Reduced mobility of dystrophin deficient animals is often attributed to muscle wasting inducing fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref047">47</xref>]. Here we show that for <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats, this should be interpreted with care because this reduced mobility may indeed be a result of higher stress reactivity. For instance, when performing an intra-peritoneal injection, scruff restraint might appear to be a relatively mild stress, but in fact leading to confounding effects on locomotion parameters often used to evaluate treatments efficacies in preclinical studies. Indeed, this stress response is characterized by a strong motor inhibition which may be critical in the interpretation of functional measures based on quantification of mobility. One might hypothesize that this higher stress response in <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats is due a higher pain sensitivity, but during the evaluation animals did not show any paw rigidity while being in a tonic immobility state, and they reacted to sudden noises occurring in the animal house or touching, therefore interrupting their freezing behavior.</p>
<p>To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these behavioral deficits, we performed studies of dystrophin isoforms expression level and localization in different brain areas. As demonstrated with the immunohistolabelling study, Dp427 isoform was present in large neuronal bodies in WT rats, and we found an absence of Dp427 isoform in all studied regions from <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats, which is consistent with the mutation generated on exon 23, inducing a complete loss of this large isoform and indicates that <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats are indeed dystrophin deficient animals, in muscles as well as in central nervous system. In WT animals, the highest levels of Dp427 isoforms were detected in the cerebellum and spinal cord, which is in agreement with studies demonstrating strong dystrophin expression in cerebellum, but also cortex and hippocampus in WT mice and rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref049">49</xref>]. As prefrontal cortex and amygdala are known to communicate and be both involved in stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref051">51</xref>], dystrophin levels in these brain areas might participate in a typical adaptive stress response for WT rats. It was previously shown that brain dystrophin Dp427 is associated with a subpopulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at inhibitory synapses, and that in <italic>mdx</italic> mice, an impaired clustering of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref026">26</xref>] has been associated with altered synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref052">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref053">53</xref>]. Therefore, brain dystrophin deficiency in <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rats may also affect synaptic transmission and GABAergic communication between cortex and amygdala, and more generally, the integrity of several brain areas might be compromised. Concerning the hippocampus, spatial memory needs to be evaluated in this model in order to assess potential specific short-term memory deficits. The known functional segmentation between dorsal hippocampus and ventral hippocampus, with the ventral part being involved with emotion and the dorsal part regulating information processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref055">55</xref>] is also found here with dystrophin levels that seem to be higher in the ventral hippocampus. Behavioral and physiological consequences of this observation still need to be evaluated. Other structures expressing Dp427 in WT animals are implicated in stress response, like entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, hippocampus or cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0230083.ref056">56</xref>], so the dystrophin deficiency induced in these regions in our model may contribute to the abnormal contention response and to the locomotor deficits detailed in this study. Additionally, levels of other dystrophin isoforms Dp140, expressed in smooth muscle layer of blood vessels and Dp71, exclusively expressed in endothelial cells of blood capillaries from both groups, are not impacted by the dystrophin-deficient phenotype in comparison to control animals.</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings provide insights into the relevance of using the <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rat model, with freezing confirmed as a good readout to assess dynamics of therapeutics targeting brain functions in DMD models. Moreover, given the robust clinical relationship between muscular and locomotion deficits already demonstrated in this model and human Duchenne pathology, present data further emphasize a potential beneficial role of <italic>Dmd</italic><sup><italic>mdx</italic></sup> rat model to better understand human central nervous system symptoms to stress conditions in a Duchenne disease context.</p>

<p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
<p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This work by Caudal et al focuses on the behavioral characterization of the dystrophin deficient DMD rat model previously described by some of the authors.</p>
<p>The manuscript is relatively well written, with experiments and results well designed and easy to follow. The figures are also very clear. Overall, this is an interesting study which confirms a behavioral phenotype observed in another animal model of DMD, the mdx mouse and is therefore of interest to the research community in the DMD field.</p>
<p>However, the authors draw conclusions that may be premature based on the presented results. Some experiments do not strongly support the conclusions drawn by the authors and I have several concerns that should be addressed before this work could be considered acceptable for publication.</p>
<p>Major comments</p>
<p>1- The main behavioral characterization of this work is the enhanced response to restraint-induced mild stress (similar to the one described in the mdx mouse). Unfortunately, this test was only performed in 6-wk old animals. While the authors explain that they “used this age in order to assess if the response to stress is affected at an early timepoint”, it is also necessary to include later time points. Especially considering that other tests were performed in older animals, it is extremely surprising to not show this test in 3 month- and 7 month-old animals. These data should absolutely be included since 1) it is known that the response to mild stress increases with age in mdx mice and 2) if this model of rat is used for therapeutic purpose, it is very likely that the tests may be used at much later time points than 6 weeks.</p>
<p>2- The conclusion of the authors that the DMD rat model does not show major cognitive deficit is not supported by their experimental data. Learning and memory tasks need to be performed to document this assumption. Tests previously used in the mdx mouse, which holds comparable genetic defect, should be used for comparison. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of the enhanced fear response to mild stress are not characterized, but studies in mdx mice suggest they may involve altered cognitive processes.</p>
<p>3- Anxiety: Using only the elevated plus-maze test is inadequate to conclude that the DMD rats do not exhibit enhanced anxiety. Indeed, although mdx mice show normal behaviour in plus maze, other studies indicate a deficit in the light-dark choice anxiety test (Remmelink et al., 2016; Chaussenot and Vaillend, 2017). As the DMD rat shows enhanced fear responses comparable with mdx mice, one may expect similar phenotypes in other tests not included in the present study. At least the light-dark test should be performed before concluding on anxiety in this model. Moreover, please indicate the intensity of the light which participates as an aversive stimulus to induce anxiety, and refer to publication using same conditions and demonstrating the protocol induces anxiety in rats.</p>
<p>4- The authors insist on the effect observed in the ledged beam-walking test but the experimental data do not support this conclusion that strongly, and the conclusions are therefore misleading. For example: the authors write: “this was correlated with a non-significant increase in the total number of steps to cross the beam (p = 0.1229, Fig. 1B)” and just after they conclude “This indicates that mutant animals spend more time to perform this task, with more and slower steps.” However, here there is no significant difference in the number of steps and on the figure the difference is minimal from a quantitative point of view (16 steps versus 17 steps). The conclusions should therefore be toned down.</p>
<p>5- Western blots and figure 5: there is, in addition to a normalization with the GAPDH, a normalization with a positive control named “Control” in fig5B, C and D. Hovere this is not the same control for Dp71, Dp140 and DP427 (as stated in the figre legend). For more clarity, it should be written on the figure what the positive control is (WT total brain for B and C, and WT skeletal muscle for D) and probably explained in the results section why this normalization is being carried out and what it provides.</p>
<p>Moreover, the authors affirm that there is no dp140 in the spinal cord, yet a small band is visible in the western blot, so this shows that there seems to be a slight expression and not an absence of expression of dp140 in the spinal cord.</p>
<p>6- Regarding motor deficit, the authors say: "Hence, motor deficit underlined here only seems to be a consequence of dystrophin absence in muscles from the limbs, and not in the brain”. This conclusion is false, indeed the cerebellum is involved in motor coordination and dystrophin is expressed in the cerebellum, so it is wrong to say that this is due only to muscular dystrophin. Moreover, the authors themselves show that the brain structure in which dp427 seems to be most expressed is the cerebellum. It is therefore inappropriate to conclude that cerebral dystrophin is not involved, especially since one of the tests used (the ledged beam-walking test) involves motor coordination and therefore potentially the cerebellum.</p>
<p>7- Introduction: The author should explain why the rat model could be more suitable than mouse models for preclinical studies</p>
<p>8- The number of tested animals appears different depending on the test (n=8 and 10 in figure 1, then n=7 and 6 in fig2, etc). N numbers should be clearly indicated in all figure legends.</p>
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>1- Introduction : « abnormal distribution of GABAA receptors has also been found in brain of Duchenne patients [19], thus facilitating NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity and also inducing an abnormally increased hippocampal LTP [20] » ; here the authors mix data from patients and from mdx mice to give a general conclusion on patients. This is awkward as no LTP not NMDA studies have been done in patients.</p>
<p>2- Discussion: “The highest levels found in prefrontal cortex compared to amygdala, although non-significant, still tells us a possible explanation for the highest stress sensitivity for Dmdmdx rats”; this is a highly speculative assumption. Also, “levels of other dystrophin isoforms Dp140, expressed in smooth muscle layer of blood vessels and Dp71, exclusively expressed in endothelial cells of blood capillaries from both groups”: It has not been demonstrated that Dp140 is expressed in smooth muscles nor that Dp71 is expressed in endothelial cells (rather, many publications indicate localization in glial endfeet contacting blood vessels).</p>
<p>3- Figure 3 and 4 were inversed in the manuscript</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript describes a series of experiments designed to assess the behavioural phenotype of the Dmdmdx rat model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The results show a clear locomoter deficit but no clear behavioural defects, other than a marked freezing response following mild handling stress, similar to that described in the mdx mouse model of DMD. The experiments appear competently performed and sufficiently powered (in most cases), although the 7 month old Dmdmdx rats showed a great degree of variation in the sucrose and water consumption assays and consequently these specific studies were underpowered.</p>
<p>The data presented in this paper support assays for future studies of therapeutics targeting muscle and brain function in this rat model.</p>
<p>Specific questions for the authors:</p>

</p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for his positive feedback and his/her constructive comments. We understand his concerns and hope that the answers that we give below will satisfy him.</p>
<p>Major comments</p>
<p>1- The main behavioral characterization of this work is the enhanced response to restraint-induced mild stress (similar to the one described in the mdx mouse). Unfortunately, this test was only performed in 6-wk old animals. While the authors explain that they “used this age in order to assess if the response to stress is affected at an early timepoint”, it is also necessary to include later time points. Especially considering that other tests were performed in older animals, it is extremely surprising to not show this test in 3 month- and 7 month-old animals. These data should absolutely be included since 1) it is known that the response to mild stress increases with age in mdx mice and 2) if this model of rat is used for therapeutic purpose, it is very likely that the tests may be used at much later time points than 6 weeks.</p>
<p>Indeed, restraint-induced mild stress is only performed in 6 weeks young animals, as it was the objective of this study. The other tests included in this study, performed in older animals, were done on a previous cohort of animals, more than a year before thinking about performing restraint stress on these animals. This explains why we did not study response to stress in older animals. We deeply agree that this should be done in the future on other cohorts of rats (3 and 7 months). The objective of this work is to offer answers to people asking questions about the quantification and evaluation of brain dystrophin. Moreover, we found an early hyper responsivity to stress during the behavioral evaluation, so we thought it was important to quickly communicate about this finding to teams already using this model. This is a first step characterizing neuronal aspects on this model that was only previously studied for muscle and heart disease aspects, and we think that this is an important message to share, without waiting for data at more advanced ages, that will be long to obtain. We have added a few words about this aspect in the discussion, from lines 420 to 422: </p>
<p>These analyses were performed on young animals at the age of 6 weeks, and we cannot exclude that this phenotype will be exacerbated at later timepoints, which has to be taken into account in the design and follow-up of preclinical studies using this model. In mdx mice, this behavior has been shown to increase with age and is thought to be underlined by an alteration of amygdala GABAergic circuits in dystrophin deficient animals [25].</p>
<p>2- The conclusion of the authors that the DMD rat model does not show major cognitive deficit is not supported by their experimental data. Learning and memory tasks need to be performed to document this assumption. Tests previously used in the mdx mouse, which holds comparable genetic defect, should be used for comparison. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of the enhanced fear response to mild stress are not characterized, but studies in mdx mice suggest they may involve altered cognitive processes.</p>
<p>As previously explained, cognitive exploration was not extensively performed on these animals, but this is planned for a later study, especially in order to characterize fear response following stress. We have therefore removed mentions about cognition in the paper.</p>
<p>3- Anxiety: Using only the elevated plus-maze test is inadequate to conclude that the DMD rats do not exhibit enhanced anxiety. Indeed, although mdx mice show normal behaviour in plus maze, other studies indicate a deficit in the light-dark choice anxiety test (Remmelink et al., 2016; Chaussenot and Vaillend, 2017). As the DMD rat shows enhanced fear responses comparable with mdx mice, one may expect similar phenotypes in other tests not included in the present study. At least the light-dark test should be performed before concluding on anxiety in this model. Moreover, please indicate the intensity of the light which participates as an aversive stimulus to induce anxiety, and refer to publication using same conditions and demonstrating the protocol induces anxiety in rats.</p>
<p>We agree that EPM and dark-light box assess two different types of anxiety. EPM measures acrophobia-induced anxiety (fear of height) and light-dark test evaluates photophobia-induced anxiety (repulsion for light). Since rodents are naturally acrophobic and photophobic, these tests are good models to study anxiety in rats. As these tests focus on different kinds of anxiety, they can dissociate. One may find a pathological phenotype in one of the tests but not in the others.</p>
<p>In the light-dark box test and in the EPM, animals have a place where to hide, whereas in the open-field, the whole arena is exposed to light, so the open field may be considered as more stressful than the light-dark box of EPM, especially if the brightness is the same in the open field as in the light compartment of the light-dark box. In this study, for the open-field, light intensity was set at 100 Lux, as the main objective was not to study anxiety, but rather evaluate locomotion and response to restraint-stress. In the EPM, light intensity was higher (300 Lux). These details have been added in the manuscript on line 158 and 184.</p>
<p>4- The authors insist on the effect observed in the ledged beam-walking test but the experimental data do not support this conclusion that strongly, and the conclusions are therefore misleading. For example: the authors write: “this was correlated with a non-significant increase in the total number of steps to cross the beam (p = 0.1229, Fig. 1B)” and just after they conclude “This indicates that mutant animals spend more time to perform this task, with more and slower steps.” However, here there is no significant difference in the number of steps and on the figure the difference is minimal from a quantitative point of view (16 steps versus 17 steps). The conclusions should therefore be toned down.</p>
<p>We agree with this remark concerning a mitigated effect, therefore we have simply removed the last sentence in this result part, on lines 262 and 263.</p>
<p>5- Western blots and figure 5: there is, in addition to a normalization with the GAPDH, a normalization with a positive control named “Control” in fig5B, C and D. Hovere this is not the same control for Dp71, Dp140 and DP427 (as stated in the figure legend). For more clarity, it should be written on the figure what the positive control is (WT total brain for B and C, and WT skeletal muscle for D) and probably explained in the results section why this normalization is being carried out and what it provides.</p>
<p>Moreover, the authors affirm that there is no dp140 in the spinal cord, yet a small band is visible in the western blot, so this shows that there seems to be a slight expression and not an absence of expression of dp140 in the spinal cord.</p>
<p>We have modified Fig 5 by adding the type of control used for Dp71, Dp140 and Dp427 normalization: total muscle (Dp427) or total brain (Dp71 and Dp140) of WT animal. Also, in the Methods section (not the Results section as suggested by the reviewer), we have explained why we used either brain or muscle for this normalization, from lines 327 to 330:</p>
<p>A normalization step was added by using total WT rat brain for Dp71 and Dp140, because these isoforms are absent from WT muscles, and by using WT skeletal muscle extract for Dp427 quantification, this isoform being highly expressed in muscle.</p>
<p>Concerning Dp140 in spinal cord, this comment is true, so we have changed this point in the text on line 341.</p>
<p>6- Regarding motor deficit, the authors say: "Hence, motor deficit underlined here only seems to be a consequence of dystrophin absence in muscles from the limbs, and not in the brain”. This conclusion is false, indeed the cerebellum is involved in motor coordination and dystrophin is expressed in the cerebellum, so it is wrong to say that this is due only to muscular dystrophin. Moreover, the authors themselves show that the brain structure in which dp427 seems to be most expressed is the cerebellum. It is therefore inappropriate to conclude that cerebral dystrophin is not involved, especially since one of the tests used (the ledged beam-walking test) involves motor coordination and therefore potentially the cerebellum.</p>
<p>This is a true and very relevant comment. We have revised the text accordingly in the discussion part from lines 376 to 378:</p>
<p>Motor deficit underlined here may therefore be a consequence of dystrophin absence in muscles from the limbs, and / or of reduced levels of cerebellar dystrophin, as demonstrated by western blot. </p>
<p>7- Introduction: The author should explain why the rat model could be more suitable than mouse models for preclinical studies</p>
<p>An explanation has been added on lines 109 to 115:</p>
<p>In this study, we used the Dmdmdx rat model, which was recently generated [26] in order to counteract the minor clinical dysfunction of mdx mouse [27] and the fact that their small size imposes limitations in the analysis of several aspects of the disease. Moreover, one of the advantages of rat over mice in preclinical studies is that rat behavior is much better characterized. They have finer and more accurate motor coordination than mice and exhibit a richer behavioral display, including more complex social traits. Moreover, rats have a convenient size since they are 10 times larger than mice but are still a small laboratory animal model and allow studies with high statistical power.</p>
<p>8- The number of tested animals appears different depending on the test (n=8 and 10 in figure 1, then n=7 and 6 in fig2, etc). N numbers should be clearly indicated in all figure legends.</p>
<p>We have indeed added the N values in each figure legend.</p>
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>1- Introduction : « abnormal distribution of GABAA receptors has also been found in brain of Duchenne patients [19], thus facilitating NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity and also inducing an abnormally increased hippocampal LTP [20] » ; here the authors mix data from patients and from mdx mice to give a general conclusion on patients. This is awkward as no LTP not NMDA studies have been done in patients.</p>
<p>We totally agree with the reviewer, as it is a mistake from our side that slipped through our internal correction process. We have therefore modified this part from lines 92 to 94: </p>
<p>[…] like an abnormal synaptic clustering and density of GABAA receptors in CA1 hippocampal dendritic layer [13, 16-18], thus facilitating NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity and also inducing an abnormally increased hippocampal LTP [19]. We have to note, as an aside, that t the clinical level, an abnormal distribution of GABAA receptors has also been found in brain of Duchenne patients [20] […]</p>
<p>2- Discussion: “The highest levels found in prefrontal cortex compared to amygdala, although non-significant, still tells us a possible explanation for the highest stress sensitivity for Dmdmdx rats”; this is a highly speculative assumption. Also, “levels of other dystrophin isoforms Dp140, expressed in smooth muscle layer of blood vessels and Dp71, exclusively expressed in endothelial cells of blood capillaries from both groups”: It has not been demonstrated that Dp140 is expressed in smooth muscles nor that Dp71 is expressed in endothelial cells (rather, many publications indicate localization in glial endfeet contacting blood vessels).</p>
<p>We have toned down the first speculation concerning the comparison between prefrontal cortex and amygdala from lines 448 to 452:</p>
<p>Moreover, although quite speculative at the moment, the highest levels found in prefrontal cortex compared to amygdala, could tell us a possible explanation for the highest stress sensitivity for Dmdmdx rats. Indeed, as prefrontal cortex and amygdala are known to communicate and be both involved in stress response [49, 50],</p>
<p>Concerning the second comment, it is strictly based on our histology observations (Fig. 6), where the immunolabelling was very clear on the endothelium and the smooth muscles (including for the vessels outside the nervous tissue like the meninges, therefore showing that it is not associated with glial cells, at least for this localization). For the smallest vessels in the nervous tissue, glial cells and endothelial cells are very close, so it has been interpreted as endothelial tissue but we maybe cannot exclude the presence of a glial marking around the vessels. This remark has been added on line 355.</p>
<p>3- Figure 3 and 4 were inversed in the manuscript</p>
<p>Actually, the name of the figures submitted during the submission process was reversed. The nomenclature in the paper is indeed the correct one.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript describes a series of experiments designed to assess the behavioural phenotype of the Dmdmdx rat model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The results show a clear locomoter deficit but no clear behavioural defects, other than a marked freezing response following mild handling stress, similar to that described in the mdx mouse model of DMD. The experiments appear competently performed and sufficiently powered (in most cases), although the 7 month old Dmdmdx rats showed a great degree of variation in the sucrose and water consumption assays and consequently these specific studies were underpowered.</p>
<p>We agree with this point, a high variability is observed, as already mentioned in the text.</p>
<p>The data presented in this paper support assays for future studies of therapeutics targeting muscle and brain function in this rat model.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this positive feedback.</p>
<p>Specific questions for the authors:</p>
<p>1. What sex of rats was used for the experiments? If both sexes were used, please show the number of each sex in each experiment.</p>
<p>All animals used were males. This has been added in the text on line 137:</p>
<p>The rats were housed in a controlled environment (ventilated racks, ambient temperature of 21°C, ambient hygrometry of 55%, 12 h light/dark cycle (dark at 8 pm, light at 8 am)), with several animals per cage, all males.</p>
<p>2. Please give details of the diet for the rats (as suggested by the ARRIVE guidelines).</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing us to these guidelines, that are indeed really useful when reporting work performed with animals. Details on the diet have been added in the Methods section from line 137 to 139:</p>
<p>Diet consisted of a standard diet (SAFE A04, Safe, Augy, France) given ad libitum, sterilized and filtrated water also given ad libitum.</p>
<p>3. Were the video analyses of behaviour analysed blind to animal identity?</p>
<p>Yes, all analyses were performed blind the animal identities. This has been added to the text on line 139:</p>
<p>All behavioral tests were performed blind to animal identities.</p>

<p>Dystrophin-deficient Dmdmdx rat model displays an increased behavioral response to</p>
<p>restraint-induced mild stress</p>
<p>Reviewer #1: This work by Caudal et al focuses on the behavioral characterization of the</p>
<p>dystrophin deficient DMD rat model previously described by some of the authors.</p>
<p>The manuscript is relatively well written, with experiments and results well designed and easy</p>
<p>to follow. The figures are also very clear. Overall, this is an interesting study which confirms</p>
<p>a behavioral phenotype observed in another animal model of DMD, the mdx mouse and is</p>
<p>therefore of interest to the research community in the DMD field.</p>
<p>However, the authors draw conclusions that may be premature based on the presented results.</p>
<p>Some experiments do not strongly support the conclusions drawn by the authors and I have</p>
<p>several concerns that should be addressed before this work could be considered acceptable for</p>
<p>publication.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for his positive feedback and his/her constructive comments. We</p>
<p>understand his concerns and hope that the answers that we give below will satisfy him.</p>
<p>Major comments</p>
<p>1- The main behavioral characterization of this work is the enhanced response to restraint induced mild stress (similar to the one described in the mdx mouse). Unfortunately, this test</p>
<p>was only performed in 6-wk old animals. While the authors explain that they “used this age in</p>
<p>order to assess if the response to stress is affected at an early timepoint”, it is also necessary to</p>
<p>include later time points. Especially considering that other tests were performed in older</p>
<p>animals, it is extremely surprising to not show this test in 3 month- and 7 month-old animals.</p>
<p>These data should absolutely be included since 1) it is known that the response to mild stress</p>
<p>increases with age in mdx mice and 2) if this model of rat is used for therapeutic purpose, it is</p>
<p>very likely that the tests may be used at much later time points than 6 weeks.</p>
<p>Indeed, restraint-induced mild stress is only performed in 6 weeks young animals, as it was</p>
<p>the objective of this study. The other tests included in this study, performed in older animals,</p>
<p>were done on a previous cohort of animals, more than a year before thinking about</p>
<p>performing restraint stress on these animals. This explains why we did not study response to</p>
<p>stress in older animals. We deeply agree that this should be done in the future on other cohorts</p>
<p>of rats (3 and 7 months). The objective of this work is to offer answers to people asking</p>
<p>questions about the quantification and evaluation of brain dystrophin. Moreover, we found an</p>
<p>early hyper responsivity to stress during the behavioral evaluation, so we thought it was</p>
<p>important to quickly communicate about this finding to teams already using this model. This</p>
<p>is a first step characterizing neuronal aspects on this model that was only previously studied</p>
<p>for muscle and heart disease aspects, and we think that this is an important message to share,</p>
<p>without waiting for data at more advanced ages, that will be long to obtain. We have added a</p>
<p>few words about this aspect in the discussion, from lines 420 to 422:</p>
<p>The reviewer finds this answer acceptable however since 1) the authors confirm that “The objective of this work is to offer answers about the quantification and evaluation of brain dystrophin” and 2) agree that the restraint-induced mild stress should be done in older animals to fully characterize this phenotype, the title of the manuscript should be changed to a more general title (not only focusing on the behavioral response to restraint-induced mild stress which is only partially characterized here).</p>
<p>Maybe something like: “Characterization of brain dystrophins absence and its impact in Dystrophin-deficient Dmdmdx rat model” or</p>
<p>“A first characterization of the impact of brain Dp47 dystrophin deficiency in the dystrophin-deficient Dmdmdx rat model”. (these are just suggestions)</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and have therefore modified the title accordingly.</p>
<p>2- The conclusion of the authors that the DMD rat model does not show major cognitive</p>
<p>deficit is not supported by their experimental data. Learning and memory tasks need to be</p>
<p>performed to document this assumption. Tests previously used in the mdx mouse, which</p>
<p>holds comparable genetic defect, should be used for comparison. Moreover, the underlying</p>
<p>mechanisms of the enhanced fear response to mild stress are not characterized, but studies in</p>
<p>mdx mice suggest they may involve altered cognitive processes.</p>
<p>As previously explained, cognitive exploration was not extensively performed on these</p>
<p>animals, but this is planned for a later study, especially in order to characterize fear response</p>
<p>following stress. We have therefore removed mentions about cognition in the paper.</p>
<p>The authors took into consideration the criticisms concerning the cognitive part of the disease, they decided to nuance their remarks. OK.</p>
<p>3- Anxiety: Using only the elevated plus-maze test is inadequate to conclude that the DMD</p>
<p>rats do not exhibit enhanced anxiety. Indeed, although mdx mice show normal behaviour in</p>
<p>plus maze, other studies indicate a deficit in the light-dark choice anxiety test (Remmelink et</p>
<p>al., 2016; Chaussenot and Vaillend, 2017). As the DMD rat shows enhanced fear responses</p>
<p>comparable with mdx mice, one may expect similar phenotypes in other tests not included in</p>
<p>the present study. At least the light-dark test should be performed before concluding on</p>
<p>anxiety in this model. Moreover, please indicate the intensity of the light which participates as</p>
<p>an aversive stimulus to induce anxiety, and refer to publication using same conditions and</p>
<p>demonstrating the protocol induces anxiety in rats.</p>
<p>We agree that EPM and dark-light box assess two different types of anxiety. EPM measures</p>
<p>acrophobia-induced anxiety (fear of height) and light-dark test evaluates photophobia-induced</p>
<p>anxiety (repulsion for light). Since rodents are naturally acrophobic and photophobic, these</p>
<p>tests are good models to study anxiety in rats. As these tests focus on different kinds of</p>
<p>anxiety, they can dissociate. One may find a pathological phenotype in one of the tests but not</p>
<p>in the others.</p>
<p>In the light-dark box test and in the EPM, animals have a place where to hide, whereas in the</p>
<p>open-field, the whole arena is exposed to light, so the open field may be considered as more</p>
<p>stressful than the light-dark box of EPM, especially if the brightness is the same in the</p>
<p>open field as in the light compartment of the light-dark box. In this study, for the open-field,</p>
<p>light intensity was set at 100 Lux, as the main objective was not to study anxiety, but rather</p>
<p>evaluate locomotion and response to restraint-stress. In the EPM, light intensity was higher</p>
<p>(300 Lux). These details have been added in the manuscript on line 158 and 184.</p>
<p>The reviewer accepts the authors answer but a comment about previous studies in mdx mice should be added in the discussion where they mention:</p>
<p> “Contrasting results have been found on anxiety in the classical model of mdx mice. Indeed, in 2009 a group showed that this model did not display an anxiety-like phenotype in the elevated plus maze (24). However, other recent studies indicate a deficit in the light-dark choice anxiety test (Remmelink et al., 2016; Chaussenot and Vaillend, 2017). Moreover, another group demonstrated anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in mdx mice, associated with decreased BDNF (Brain derived neurotrophic factor) levels [42]. It may therefore be useful to evaluate BDNF levels and perform light-dark choice anxiety tests to fully characterise the anxiety phenotype in Dmdmdx rats.” </p>
<p>Please amend accordingly.</p>
<p>We have amended the text according to reviewer’s comment.</p>
<p>4- The authors insist on the effect observed in the ledged beam-walking test but the</p>
<p>experimental data do not support this conclusion that strongly, and the conclusions are</p>
<p>therefore misleading. For example: the authors write: “this was correlated with a non significant increase in the total number of steps to cross the beam (p = 0.1229, Fig. 1B)” and just after they conclude “This indicates that mutant animals spend more time to perform this</p>
<p>task, with more and slower steps.” However, here there is no significant difference in the</p>
<p>number of steps and on the figure the difference is minimal from a quantitative point of view</p>
<p>(16 steps versus 17 steps). The conclusions should therefore be toned down.</p>
<p>We agree with this remark concerning a mitigated effect, therefore we have simply removed</p>
<p>the last sentence in this result part, on lines 262 and 263.</p>
<p>Ok, but please also remove the following sentence from the discussion: “The present results demonstrate that Dmdmdx rats display neuromotor alterations at 7 months, as shown with the transversal beam test, in which mutant animals spent more time to cross the beam, as they did slightly more steps to reach the other extremity.</p>
<p>We have amended the text according to reviewer’s comment.</p>
<p>5- Western blots and figure 5: there is, in addition to a normalization with the GAPDH, a</p>
<p>normalization with a positive control named “Control” in fig5B, C and D. However this is not</p>
<p>the same control for Dp71, Dp140 and DP427 (as stated in the figure legend). For more</p>
<p>clarity, it should be written on the figure what the positive control is (WT total brain for B and</p>
<p>C, and WT skeletal muscle for D) and probably explained in the results section why this</p>
<p>normalization is being carried out and what it provides.</p>
<p>Moreover, the authors affirm that there is no dp140 in the spinal cord, yet a small band is</p>
<p>visible in the western blot, so this shows that there seems to be a slight expression and not an</p>
<p>absence of expression of dp140 in the spinal cord.</p>
<p>We have modified Fig 5 by adding the type of control used for Dp71, Dp140 and Dp427</p>
<p>normalization: total muscle (Dp427) or total brain (Dp71 and Dp140) of WT animal. Also, in the Methods section (not the Results section as suggested by the reviewer), we have explained why we used either brain or muscle for this normalization, from lines 327 to 330:</p>
<p>A normalization step was added by using total WT rat brain for Dp71 and Dp140, because</p>
<p>these isoforms are absent from WT muscles, and by using WT skeletal muscle extract for Dp427 quantification, this isoform being highly expressed in muscle.</p>
<p>Concerning Dp140 in spinal cord, this comment is true, so we have changed this point in the</p>
<p>text on line 341.</p>
<p>Reviewer accepts this change, however still finds unfortunate that the authors do not have the same control tissues for the different tissues analyzed. Concerning cerebral Dp427, why did they use a WT control from muscle tissue since Dp427 is expressed in the CNS? This is what the reviewer implied when asking “explain in the results section why this normalization is being carried out and what it provides”. Did the author intend to comment on the difference of expression between muscle and brain? Because if no explanation is given, it seems inappropriate to use muscle as control (since DP427 is expressed in total brain).</p>
<p>This muscle control was used as an internal control for Dp427. Indeed, at the beginning of western blot experiments, we had no idea how Dp427 would appear on the gels, therefore we had to choose an internal control that was used routinely in our lab. This allowed us to validate our brain dystrophin extraction protocol, protein dosing, and also, and more importantly revelation by ECL. Indeed, as we did several gels, and therefore several films, the exposure time could vary from a few seconds betwwen films, so this well established internal control was important for us. The objective here is not to compare Dp427 levels between brain and muscles, but rather to remove an experimental bias that could occur before we knew anything about rat brain dystrophin western blotting study in our samples with our experimental conditions. Moreover, we have cautioulsy performed another normalization with GAPDH. </p>
<p>6- Regarding motor deficit, the authors say: "Hence, motor deficit underlined here only seems</p>
<p>to be a consequence of dystrophin absence in muscles from the limbs, and not in the brain”.</p>
<p>This conclusion is false, indeed the cerebellum is involved in motor coordination and</p>
<p>dystrophin is expressed in the cerebellum, so it is wrong to say that this is due only to</p>
<p>muscular dystrophin. Moreover, the authors themselves show that the brain structure in which</p>
<p>dp427 seems to be most expressed is the cerebellum. It is therefore inappropriate to conclude</p>
<p>that cerebral dystrophin is not involved, especially since one of the tests used (the ledged</p>
<p>beam-walking test) involves motor coordination and therefore potentially the cerebellum.</p>
<p>This is a true and very relevant comment. We have revised the text accordingly in the</p>
<p>discussion part from lines 376 to 378:</p>
<p>Motor deficit underlined here may therefore be a consequence of dystrophin absence in muscles from the limbs, and / or of reduced levels of cerebellar dystrophin, as demonstrated by western blot.</p>
<p>The authors have taken into consideration the remarks concerning the possible impact of cerebellum in the motor dysfonction and have revised the text. The reviewer suggests to rephrase as follow for more clarity: </p>
<p>“Motor deficit underlined here may be a consequence of dystrophin absence in muscles</p>
<p>from the limbs, but we cannot exclude they may also result from reduced levels of cerebellar dystrophin, as demonstrated by western blot.”</p>
<p>We have amended the text according to reviewer’s comment.</p>
<p>7- Introduction: The author should explain why the rat model could be more suitable than</p>
<p>mouse models for preclinical studies</p>
<p>An explanation has been added on lines 109 to 115:</p>
<p>In this study, we used the Dmdmdx rat model, which was recently generated [26] in order to</p>
<p>counteract the minor clinical dysfunction of mdx mouse [27] and the fact that their small size</p>
<p>imposes limitations in the analysis of several aspects of the disease. Moreover, one of the</p>
<p>advantages of rat over mice in preclinical studies is that rat behavior is much better</p>
<p>characterized. They have finer and more accurate motor coordination than mice and exhibit a</p>
<p>richer behavioral display, including more complex social traits. Moreover, rats have a</p>
<p>convenient size since they are 10 times larger than mice but are still a small laboratory animal model and allow studies with high statistical power.</p>
<p>Ok but Authors should supplement their arguments with bibliographical references. Specifically to argue that rat behavior is better characterized and has richer behavioral display, which may not be obvious regarding the major advances made in characterizing complex cognitive functions in transgenic mice since the 90’s. In addition, it would be appreciated if they could better detail the positive points of their model compared respectively to the murine model (how is being 10 times larger better?)</p>
<p>We have removed the sentence concerning rat behavior which is indeed a bit exaggerated. The nex text is now: </p>
<p>In this study, we used the Dmdmdx rat model, which was recently generated [26] in order to counteract the minor clinical dysfunction of mdx mouse [27] and the fact that their small size imposes limitations in the analysis of several aspects of the disease. Moreover, rats display complex social traits and have a convenient size since they are 10 times larger than mice, allowing the possibility to collect large quantities of biological tissues compared to mice. But rats remain a small laboratory animal model and allow studies with high statistical power.</p>
<p>8- The number of tested animals appears different depending on the test (n=8 and 10 in figure</p>
<p>1, then n=7 and 6 in fig2, etc). N numbers should be clearly indicated in all figure legends.</p>
<p>We have indeed added the N values in each figure legend.</p>
<p>OK</p>
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>1- Introduction : « abnormal distribution of GABAA receptors has also been found in brain of</p>
<p>Duchenne patients [19], thus facilitating NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity and</p>
<p>also inducing an abnormally increased hippocampal LTP [20] » ; here the authors mix data</p>
<p>from patients and from mdx mice to give a general conclusion on patients. This is awkward as</p>
<p>no LTP not NMDA studies have been done in patients.</p>
<p>We totally agree with the reviewer, as it is a mistake from our side that slipped through our</p>
<p>internal correction process. We have therefore modified this part from lines 92 to 94:</p>
<p>[…] like an abnormal synaptic clustering and density of GABAA receptors in CA1 hippocampal dendritic layer [13, 16-18], thus facilitating NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity and also inducing an abnormally increased hippocampal LTP [19]. We have to note, as an aside, that t the clinical level, an abnormal distribution of GABAA receptors has also been found in brain of Duchenne patients [20] […]</p>
<p>OK</p>
<p>2- Discussion: “The highest levels found in prefrontal cortex compared to amygdala, although</p>
<p>non-significant, still tells us a possible explanation for the highest stress sensitivity for</p>
<p>Dmdmdx rats”; this is a highly speculative assumption. Also, “levels of other dystrophin</p>
<p>isoforms Dp140, expressed in smooth muscle layer of blood vessels and Dp71, exclusively</p>
<p>expressed in endothelial cells of blood capillaries from both groups”: It has not been</p>
<p>demonstrated that Dp140 is expressed in smooth muscles nor that Dp71 is expressed in</p>
<p>endothelial cells (rather, many publications indicate localization in glial endfeet contacting</p>
<p>blood vessels).</p>
<p>We have toned down the first speculation concerning the comparison between prefrontal</p>
<p>cortex and amygdala from lines 448 to 452:</p>
<p>Moreover, although quite speculative at the moment, the highest levels found in prefrontal</p>
<p>cortex compared to amygdala, could tell us a possible explanation for the highest stress</p>
<p>sensitivity for Dmdmdx rats. Indeed, as prefrontal cortex and amygdala are known to</p>
<p>communicate and be both involved in stress response [49, 50],</p>
<p>Reviewer still feels that this is highly speculative and based on a non-significant result, and therefore advises to remove the entire sentence.</p>
<p>As suggested, we have removed the speculative part of the sentence, but not the part mentioning the relationship between both regions, which is still true:</p>
<p>In WT animals, the highest levels of Dp427 isoforms were detected in the cerebellum and spinal cord, which is in agreement with studies demonstrating strong dystrophin expression in cerebellum, but also cortex and hippocampus in WT mice and rats [48, 49]. As prefrontal cortex and amygdala are known to communicate and be both involved in stress response [50, 51], dystrophin levels in these brain areas might participate in a typical adaptive stress response for WT rats.</p>
<p>Concerning the second comment, it is strictly based on our histology observations (Fig. 6),</p>
<p>where the immunolabelling was very clear on the endothelium and the smooth muscles</p>
<p>(including for the vessels outside the nervous tissue like the meninges, therefore showing that</p>
<p>it is not associated with glial cells, at least for this localization). For the smallest vessels in the</p>
<p>nervous tissue, glial cells and endothelial cells are very close, so it has been interpreted as</p>
<p>endothelial tissue but we maybe cannot exclude the presence of a glial marking around the</p>
<p>vessels. This remark has been added on line 355.</p>
<p>The reviewer acknowledges that the authors find that the “immunolabelling was very clear on the endothelium and the smooth muscles (including for the vessels outside the nervous tissue like the meninges, therefore showing that it is not associated with glial cells, at least for this localization)”, however it cannot be stated without showing either the data mentioned by the authors, or co-staining data of endothelium and smooth muscles to conclude about the expression of dystrophin there. </p>
<p>As mentioned by the authors themselves, the main objective of this work is to characterize the expression and localization of dystrophin in the brain of this novel dmd-mdx rat model and the reviewer completely agrees that this work is very important and will likely serve as reference for future work in the field. As such, it is crucial to characterize properly the localization of the various isoforms using appropriate controls.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to adding co-staining, it is also necessary to better explain the choice of antibodies as this may be a little confusing for the reader:</p>
<p>-Dys2 was chosen to detect Dp71 but as a C-ter Ab, it will stain all isoforms of dystrophin (including Dp427 and Dp140 – even in the dmd-mdx model for the latter one). The authors should therefore provide controls that the staining shown for Dp71 is not Dp427 or Dp140 staining (for Dp427, this can be compared with dmd-mdx tissues and explained in the text but for Dp140, how can the authors be sure that this is not Dp140 staining for example?)</p>
<p>-Similar point for Mannex5556 which is specific of exon55-56 and which should stain both Dp140 and Dp427. The authors should better explain and justify why they consider the staining to be Dp140 specific. </p>
<p>Also, since it is the first time that Manex5556 is used in rats (at least to the reviewer’s knowledge), it would be better to provide at least one negative control without primary antibody as supplemental data.</p>
<p>Maybe this was not clear in the text, but the main objective of this immunolabelling with these 3 antibodies is of course not to be specific of a given isoform, we agree with the reviewer on this aspect, despite immunolabelling were different between three antibodies and between two genotypes, indicating that they recognize different epitopes. These antibodies have been chosen to cover three different regions of dystrophin protein, not to be specific of a given region. As such, we have modified the text in the Methods section accordingly to erase the idea that these antibodies are specific. Concerning co-staining, it is rather difficult to perform with our monoclonal antibodies, and we have to mention that all these analyses and distinction between endothelial cells and smooth muscles is very typical and was performed by a skilled anatomopatholgist. We have added this sentence at the end of Methods section:“All slides evaluations were performed by a skilled pathologist certified by the European College of Veterinary Pathology.”</p>
<p>We also add below, as requested by the reviewer, a table showing the negative controls (x20) that were performed for the 3 antibodies in parallel, but we don’t think this needs to be added into a supplemental figure. Light non-specific binding is detected on some collagen fibers. </p>
<p> Negative control for NCL-DYSB</p>
<p> Negative control for MANEX5556</p>
<p> Negative control for NCL-DYS2</p>
<p>The addition of a schematic representation of the dystrophin epitopes recognized by the different antibodies used would be very useful here. </p>
<p>We have added a figure in order to show this representation (Figure 7).</p>
<p>3- Figure 3 and 4 were inversed in the manuscript</p>
<p>Actually, the name of the figures submitted during the submission process was reversed. The</p>
<p>nomenclature in the paper is indeed the correct one.</p>
