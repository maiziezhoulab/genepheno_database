<abstract>
<p>There is increasing evidence that the gut microbiota plays a major role in host health and disease. In this study, we examined whether perturbation of the maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy, induced by administration of non-absorbable antibiotics to pregnant dams, influences the behavior of offspring. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of fecal bacterial composition showed that the relative abundance of the bacterial order <italic>Lactobacillales</italic> was lower in offspring born from antibiotic-treated dams (20.7±3.4%) than in control offspring (42.1±6.2%) at P24, while the relative abundance of the bacterial family <italic>Clostridium</italic> subcluster XIVa was higher in offspring born from antibiotic-treated dams (34.2±5.0%) than in control offspring (16.4±3.3%). Offspring born from antibiotic-treated dams exhibited low locomotor activity in both familiar and novel environments, and preferred to explore in the peripheral area of an unfamiliar field at postnatal week 4. At postnatal weeks 7–8, no difference was observed in the level of locomotor activity between control offspring and offspring from antibiotic-treated dams, while the tendency for the offspring from antibiotic-treated dams to be less engaged in exploring the inside area was still observed. The behavioral phenotypes of the offspring from antibiotic-treated dams at postnatal week 4 could be rescued to a considerable extent through fostering of these offspring by normal dams from postnatal day 1. Although the detailed underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated, the present results suggest that administration of non-absorbable antibiotics to pregnant dams to perturb the maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy leads to alterations in the behavior of their offspring.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many lines of evidences indicate that the gut microbiota plays a major role in host health and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref002">2</xref>]. The gut microbiota is involved in immunomodulation, drug disposition and detoxification, nutrition, and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref002">2</xref>], and also interacts with the central nervous system, possibly through neural, endocrine, and immune pathways, to influence host brain functions and behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref008">8</xref>]. There is also emerging evidence that the gut microbiota contributes to host brain development. Germ-free mice display increased hyperactivity and reduced anxiety compared with specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice with normal gut biota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref009">9</xref>]. Germ-free mice also exhibit robust social impairments including social avoidance and diminished preference for social novelty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref010">10</xref>]. Depletion of the gut microbiota by applying antibiotics (AB) to adolescent mice from weaning was shown to reduce anxiety and induce cognitive deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref011">11</xref>]. Germ-free pregnant mice have fetuses that show increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, and this increased permeability is also observed in adult germ-free mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref012">12</xref>]. To explore whether and how the function of the maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy contribute to the brain development of offspring, we applied non-absorbable AB to pregnant mice to perturb the gut microbiota for the period of embryonic day (E) 9 to E16 and performed behavioral analyses on their offspring. Our findings showed that administration of non-absorbable AB to pregnant dams to perturb the gut microbiota during pregnancy leads to alterations in the behavior of their offspring.</p>

<title>Animals and non-absorbable AB treatment</title>
<p>SPF timed-pregnant C57BL/6J mice were purchased from SLC Japan (Hamamatsu, Japan). Embryonic and postnatal stages were calculated with the day of vaginal plug detection as E0 and with the day of birth of offspring as P0. We attempted to deplete mice of their gut microbiota by providing a combination of non-absorbable AB according to the published protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref013">13</xref>]. Non-absorbable AB become concentrated in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby reducing the production of intestinal microbiota with limited serum concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref015">15</xref>]. Pregnant C57BL/6J mice received a solution of non-absorbable AB, comprising 5 mg/ml neomycin trisulfate salt hydrate (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; N6386-25G), 5 mg/ml bacitracin (Sigma–Aldrich; B0125-1250KU), 1.25 μg/ml pimaricin (Sigma–Aldrich; P9703-25MG; 5 mg/ml solution in acetic acid used as a stock), and 0.075% (v/v) acetic acid (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan; 08885–45) dissolved in drinking water, which was administered by voluntary drinking on E9–E16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref005">5</xref>]. Intraperitoneal administration of the non-absorbable AB solution to SPF mice or oral administration of the non-absorbable AB solution to germ-free mice did not induce any apparent effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref005">5</xref>], implying that the non-absorbable AB solution used in this study had minimal collateral effects. Control mice received normal drinking water. Throughout the period of AB administration, mice consumed AB solution constantly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s009">S1 Fig</xref>). Control and AB-treated mice gave birth to pups and nurtured them <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The litter sizes of control and AB-treated dams, sex ratios of their offspring at P7, and scatter plots showing the relationships between litter sizes and body weights of individual offspring are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s010">S2 Fig</xref>. Offspring from control and AB-treated mice were weaned from their mothers at P23, and 2–5 sex-matched mice from control or AB-treated mice were housed in a single cage. The offspring from control dams and AB-treated dams were never cohoused in the same cage. A sex bias has been observed in several neurodevelopmental disorders in humans, in which males are at greater risk than females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref017">17</xref>]. Therefore, we determined to perform the measurements of body weights and behavioral tests on male offspring only after weaning. In the experiments shown in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s010">S2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s012">S4</xref> Figs, we measured the body weight of a male mouse at the time when it was subjected to its initial behavioral test, Therefore, the body weights of some mice were measured at P28, while those of other mice were measured at P29. The total body weight data of the male offspring from control dams and AB-treated dams obtained at P28 or at P29 are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s002">S2 Data</xref> labelled as ‘Body weight litter size P28–29’. Mice were tested in a single behavioral test per day in postnatal week (PW) 4 or PW 7–8. Most of the mice were subjected to three (experiments shown in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s011">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s013">S5</xref> Figs) or two (experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g006">Fig 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s015">S7 Fig</xref>) behavioral tests, although some mice were subjected only to one or two of the tests. Lists of mice subjected to the behavioral tests are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s008">S8 Data</xref>. In the ‘cross-fostering’ experiments, pups were swapped between a control mother and an AB-treated mother at P1. We made it a rule to exchange the whole litters from a control mother and the whole litters from an AB-treated mother when swapping pups, with an exceptional case in which a control mother fostered the pups from two AB-treated dams (see raw data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s005">S5 Data</xref>). The pups were then nurtured by their foster mother, weaned from their foster mother, and housed as described above. The litter sizes of the group of offspring, sex ratio of the groups of offspring at P7, and scatter plots showing the relationships between litter sizes and body weights of individual offspring in the groups in the cross-fostering experiments are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s014">S6 Fig</xref>. In the cross-fostering experiments, the body weights of all male mice at PW4 were measured specifically on P28 unless they were not subjected to behavioral tests on P28. The average room temperature fluctuates seasonally in our animal facility (from 23°C in winter to &gt;26°C in summer) because of influences from the outside temperature, which may have affected the offspring growth and basal level of general locomotor activity. Therefore, care was taken that experiments for comparison of specific groups were carried out during the same season. Specifically, the experiments shown in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s010">S2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s013">S5</xref> Figs were mainly performed during July–August (tests for a few mice were performed in November–December), while those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g006">Fig 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s014">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s015">S7</xref> Figs were performed in December–January.</p>

<p>Spontaneous activity in a familiar environment was assayed using a home cage activity monitoring system (O’Hara &amp; Co., Tokyo, Japan), which included a home cage (29 × 18 × 12 cm) and an infrared video camera. A 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle using LED illumination was programmed (08:00–20:00, light period; 20:00–08:00, dark period). Each mouse was separately housed in a cage by 09:30, and images from each cage were captured at a rate of 1 frame/s for 27 h until 12:30 of the next day.

<title>Gut bacterial flora analyses</title>
<p>Analyses of the mouse gut flora using mouse fecal specimens were outsourced to TechnoSuruga Laboratory (Shizuoka, Japan). Bacterial DNA extraction from fecal specimens was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref019">19</xref>]. The copy numbers of bacteria contained in the fecal specimens were calculated from a standard curve based on the known copy numbers of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> JCM 1649<sup>T</sup> by quantitative real-time PCR of the 16S rRNA gene using the PCR primers: 341f, 5′-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′, and 534r, 5′-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3′ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref020">20</xref>]. The bacterial flora composition was examined by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref021">21</xref>]. The detailed protocols for these analyses were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref023">23</xref>]. In brief, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR from fecal bacterial DNA using fluorescently labelled primers 516F (5′-TGCCAGAGCCGCGGTA-3′) and 1510R (5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′). The purified PCR products were digested with <italic>Bsl</italic>I, and the T-RF lengths were analyzed with an ABI PRISM 3130<italic>xl</italic> genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The fragment sizes were estimated using GeneMapper software (Applied Biosystems). The major T-RFs with similar sizes of 1–3 bp were summarized according to operational taxonomic units (OTU). OTU data were used to identify phylotypes by matching with those predicted from various phylotypes in a database based on the literature ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref024">24</xref>]; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tecsrg.co.jp/t-rflp/t_rflp_hito_OTU.html">http://www.tecsrg.co.jp/t-rflp/t_rflp_hito_OTU.html</ext-link>). Relative abundance of bacteria belonging to each phylotype was determined as the percentage of individual OTU per total OTU areas. A two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, two-tailed unpaired Welch’s corrected <italic>t</italic>-test or two-tailed unpaired Mann–Whitney test was used to compare mean values of the relative abundance of each bacterial phylotype between two groups as described below [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref026">26</xref>]. Cluster analyses were performed using Gene Maths (Applied Maths, Kortijk, Belguim) based on the <italic>BsI</italic>I T-RFLP patterns. Distances were calculated to determine the similarity among samples, and were represented by dendrograms. Pearson’s similarity coefficient analysis and unweighted pair-group methods with arithmetic means (UPGMA), and Dice’s similarity coefficient analysis and the Ward algorithm were used to prepare dendrograms.</p>

<title>Effects of administration of non-absorbable AB to pregnant mice on E9–E16</title>
<p>During development, neurogenesis from neural stem cells starts to occur around at E10 and lasts until E17–E18 in the rodent telencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref029">29</xref>]. We administered non-absorbable AB to pregnant mice on E9–E16 to observe the effect of perturbation of the maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy on neural development of offspring. During this period of AB administration, weight gain in AB-treated mice was reduced compared with that in control pregnant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). By day 4 of the 7-day period of AB administration, the mean copy number of the microbiota in feces of AB-treated mothers was reduced to 2.317% of that in control mothers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Examination of the bacterial flora composition by T-RFLP analysis showed that the gut flora composition was affected by AB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The relative abundance of <italic>Clostridium</italic> cluster XI was significantly lower in AB treated mice than in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The relative abundances of the bacterial order <italic>Lactobacillales</italic> and the bacterial family <italic>Clostridium</italic> subcluster XVIII were lower in AB-treated dams, although the differences did not reach the statistical siginificane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The relative abundance of the bacterial family <italic>Prevotella</italic> was decreased to zero in AB-treated dams, although the statistical evaluation could not be performed on this difference because standard deviation of the data from AB-treated dam was totally zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).

<title>Effects on the body weight and the gut microbiota of offspring by administration of non-absorbable AB to pregnant dams</title>
<p>The sex ratios of offspring born from control dams (control offspring) and those born from AB-treated dams (AB offspring) did not differ (Fig a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s010">S2 Fig</xref>). The mean litter size was slightly lower in AB-treated mice (5.50 ± 0.49) than that in control mice (6.63 ± 0.29), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s010">S2B Fig</xref>). The mean body weight of AB offspring was lower than that of control offspring at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g002">Fig 2A</xref>; the mean body weights of female offspring at P7 are shown in Fig c in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s010">S2 Fig</xref>). Although AB offspring had reduced the gap in body weight by PW4, the difference in body weight between control and AB offspring remained significant at P28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). No difference was observed for the estimated copy numbers of fecal bacteria between AB offspring and control offspring at P24, which is 1 day after weaning from dams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The bacterial flora composition analyses showed that the relative abundance of the bacterial order <italic>Lactobacillales</italic> was lower in AB offspring (20.7±3.4%) than in control offspring (42.1±6.2%), while the relative abundance of the bacterial family <italic>Clostridium</italic> subcluster XIVa was higher in AB offspring (34.2±5.0%) than in control offspring (16.4±3.3%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). However, the mean relative abundances of the other bacterial families in control offspring were similar to those in AB offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). A cluster analysis of fecal microbiota compositions performed by two different methods revealed contrasting branching patterns of dendrograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>), supporting the idea that the gut flora compositions in control offspring and AB offspring differed in some parts and resembled each other to a certain extent in other parts. Overall, we conclude that perturbation of the maternal microbiota during pregnancy leads to moderate changes in the gut flora composition at P24, primarily driven by alterations in the relative abundances of the bacterial order <italic>Lactobacillales</italic> and the bacterial family <italic>Clostridium</italic> subcluster XIVa.</p>

<title>Effects on the behaviors of offspring at PW4 after administration of non-absorbable AB to the dams during pregnancy</title>
<p>To determine whether administration of non-absorbable AB to pregnant dams affected the brain development of their offspring, we performed behavioral tests on offspring from control and AB-treated dams at PW4. The 24-h home cage activity tests revealed that the activity level in a familiar environment in the dark phase was generally lower in AB offspring than that in control offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The reduced activity in AB offspring compared with that in control offspring was also observed in the open field test to measure spontaneous locomotor activity in a novel environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g004">Fig 4C</xref>; Fig a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s011">S3 Fig</xref>). Notably, AB offspring engaged less and spent a shorter amount of time undertaking exploratory locomotive behavior in the inside area, compared with control offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>; Fig b in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s011">S3 Fig</xref>). Rearing is considered to be an exploratory behavior induced by novel stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref030">30</xref>]. Consistent with the reduced exploratory locomotive behavior in AB offspring, the frequency of rearing behaviors in a novel environment was lower in AB offspring than in control offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Next, we performed three-chambered social interaction tests on control and AB offspring. The control offspring and AB offspring spent a similar amount of time around the cage housing the stranger mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s012">S4 Fig</xref>), suggesting that the two types of offspring showed similar levels of interest in the stranger mice in the three-chamber social interaction tests.

Notably, the mean body weight of FMControl TMAB offspring remained slightly lower than that of control offspring, whereas the body weight of FMAB TMControl offspring was even lower than those of control offspring and FMControl TMAB offspring at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g006">Fig 6B</xref>; the body weights of female offspring at P7 are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s014">S6C Fig</xref>). This low body weight of the FMAB TMControl group compared with the other groups was still observed at P28, and even at P76–P77 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g006">Fig 6C</xref>; Fig a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s015">S7 Fig</xref>). The 24-h cycle rhythm of spontaneous locomotor activity in a familiar environment of FMControl TMAB offspring was mostly similar to that of control offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). FMAB TMControl offspring exhibited a lower level of spontaneous locomotor activity in the dark phase than did control offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). The level of locomotor activity, spatial preference for locomotion, and frequency of rearing behavior in an unfamiliar environment of FMControl TMAB offspring were similar to those of control offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g006">Fig 6E–6G</xref>; Figs b, c in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s015">S7 Fig</xref>). The locomotor activity of FMAB TMControl offspring in the open field test had a tendency to be lower than those of control offspring and FMControl TMAB offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g006">Fig 6E</xref>; Fig b in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s015">S7 Fig</xref>). The frequency of rearing behavior in FMAB TMControl offspring was significantly less than those in the other groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s015">S7C Fig</xref>). FMAB TMControl offspring tended to engage in less exploratory behavior in the inside area of the open field compared with control offspring and FMControl TMAB offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g006">Fig 6F and 6G</xref>). These findings show that low body weight, low level of spontaneous behavior in both familiar and unfamiliar environments, and spatial preference for locomotion in the inside area, which were observed in AB offspring at PW4, were recovered to a considerable extent by fostering of the offspring by control dams from P1. Furthermore, control offspring fostered by AB-treated dams exhibited similar phenotypes to those of AB offspring at PW4.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the importance of the gut microbiota in shaping brain development and behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref033">33</xref>]. The aim of this study was to explore the contribution of the maternal gut microbiota to the brain development of offspring by examining whether perturbation of the maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy can affect the development of the central nervous system of offspring by performing behavioural analyses on the offspring born from AB treated mice. Our data showed that administration of non-absorbable AB to dams during pregnancy to perturb the maternal gut microbiota led to reduced body weight and alterations in the behavior of their offspring at PW4. It is evident that the gut microbiota has a balanced compositional signature that provides the host with health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref006">6</xref>]. Several factors and events can potentially affect the gut microbial composition, including host genetics, dietary shifts, infection, disease, surgery, drug treatments (including AB-treatment), and transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref034">34</xref>]. Although our study did not fully elucidate the detailed mechanisms underlying the development of the phenotypes of AB offspring, our results imply that it is important to take care of the maternal gut microbiota during perinatal periods for healthy development of offspring.</p>
<p>In our study, T-RFLP analyses of the gut flora composition showed that the relative abundance of the bacterial order <italic>Lactobacillales</italic> was lower in AB offspring than in control offspring, while the relative abundance of the bacterial family <italic>Clostridium</italic> subcluster XIVa was higher in AB offspring than in control offspring at P24. The question then arises as to whether these alterations in the gut flora profile of AB offspring are associated with the abnormal behavior of AB offspring. One of the experiments to answer this question involves examination of whether oral treatment of AB offspring with a species of the bacterial order <italic>Lactobacillales</italic> can rescue the low body weight and abnormal behavior of AB offspring. It was recently reported that administration of <italic>Lactobacillus fermentum</italic> NS9 reduced anxiety-like behavior in rats that were also administered with ampicillin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref035">35</xref>], implying that oral treatment of AB offspring with a species of the bacterial order <italic>Lactobacillales</italic> is promising. Other important questions are how the alterations in the gut flora composition at P24 are generated and how long these alterations continue. The relative abundance of the bacterial order <italic>Lactobacillales</italic> was also lower in the feces of AB-treated dams than in those of control dams, although no statistical significance was obtained in the difference. It is possible that the alteration in the gut microbiota profiles of AB-treated dams is associated with that in AB offspring. Performance of comparative studies on the temporal profiles of the colonization of the gut bacterial microbiota of control offspring and AB offspring after birth and the temporal profiles of the compositions of the gut microbiota in control and AB-treated dams after the end of AB administration would give answers to this question.</p>
<p>In this study, the phenotypes of offspring born from AB-treated dams could be rescued to a considerable extent at PW4 by fostering of the offspring by control dams from P1. Offspring from control dams fostered by AB-treated dams (FMAB TMControl) exhibited similar phenotypes to those of offspring born from AB-treated dams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0138293.g006">Fig 6</xref>). These findings suggest that the effects of administration of non-absorbable AB to pregnant mice during E9–E16 to perturb the maternal gut microbiota may influence the development of offspring, principally after birth. Notably, the mean body weight of offspring from control dams fostered by AB-treated dams became even lower than that of control offspring at P7, implying that there is a critical effect of administration of non-absorbable AB to perturb the maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy on the postnatal development of offspring, particularly in the first week after birth. The gut microbiota contributes significantly to host nutrient metabolism, such as dietary fibre metabolism, lipid uptake and deposition, breakdown of indigestible polysaccharides to absorbable monosaccharides, and vitamin synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref037">37</xref>]. Epidemiological data in clinical studies in animals have revealed that maternal perinatal undernutrition increases the subsequent risk of deficits in the brain and behavioral function in offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref044">44</xref>]. Food restriction of rat dams during perinatal periods induced hyperactivity of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis with increased plasma glucocorticoid level, and decreased the level of locomotor activity in the offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref044">44</xref>]. Notably, maternal food restriction only during lactation period influenced the activity of the HPA axis, suggesting that this early postnatal period is a sensitive target of maternal undernutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref042">42</xref>]. Furthermore, cross-fostering experiments suggested that nursing the offspring born from food-restricted dams by control mothers during lactation normalized the alteration in decreased locomotor activity of offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref044">44</xref>]. Maternal perinatal undernutrition could influence the composition of breast milk. For example, it has been reported that maternal undernutrition during perinatal periods leads to reduced concentrations of leptin (a peptide hormone to regulate metabolism and appetite) in breast milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref044">44</xref>]. One possible mechanism for the postnatal effect of AB administration during pregnancy is that the AB-treated dams were in poor nutritional condition throughout the perinatal periods because of the perturbed condition of the gut microbiota, leading to the production of low-nutrition breast milk with an untoward influence on the postnatal development of their offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref047">47</xref>]. Another possible mechanism is related to the source of the microbiota in offspring as mentioned above. The infant gut is considered to be mostly sterile at birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref048">48</xref>]. Colonization of the gut with microbes begins immediately after birth. Infants born by vaginal delivery have microbial communities that resemble those found in the maternal vaginal microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref002">2</xref>]. Microbes from the mouth and skin of mothers can also be transferred vertically to offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref049">49</xref>]. Furthermore, breast milk contains particular oligosaccharides that act as prebiotics for <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic>, and is also known to contain multiple bacteria species that are thought to be transferred to offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref050">50</xref>]. Thus, mothers are the first and most important source of microbes for their offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref048">48</xref>]. As the maternal gut microbiota was disturbed by AB treatment during the perinatal periods, the colonization of gut microbes in offspring after birth would be disrupted, which could possibly lead to disruption of the brain development of offspring after birth because the vertical transmission of maternal microbes to offspring and the subsequent bacterial colonization of the neonatal gut overlap with a critical period of brain development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref053">53</xref>]. Another possible mechanism is associated with the maternal stress caused by administration of non-absorbable AB to pregnant dams to perturb the maternal gut microbiota and the subsequent nurturing behavior in the postnatal period. Germ-free mice exhibit exaggerated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) response to stress, suggesting that the gut microbiota has a role in the development of the HPA axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref006">6</xref>]. Administration of non-absorbable AB to pregnant dams to perturb the gut microbiota may induce increased responses to stress in the dams, which could possibly lead to significant alterations in maternal care after the birth of their offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref054">54</xref>]. Clinical researches in human have shown that maltreatment early in childhood can cause a lifelong reduction in cognitive performance, alteration in stress response, and an increase in the risk of mood- and stress-related disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref056">56</xref>]. Animal models of aberrant maternal care or maternal separation have also demonstrated alterations in behavior and brain structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref059">59</xref>]. Therefore it may be possible that perturbation of the maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy affect maternal care after birth of offspring, resulting in alteration of behavior of offspring.</p>
<p>In the current study, we used T-RFLP method for the analyses of the composition of gut microbiota. This method is widely used in investigating the gut microbiota of the rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref060">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref067">67</xref>]. However, this method has limitations that analyses are based on the database of human gut microbiota with rather low resolution. We have to take into consideration these limitations when we evaluate the results of the comparisons of the gut microbiota profiles between control dams and AB-treated dams or between control and AB offspring. In the future experiments, we should have to undertake sequencing-based methods in combination with appropriate metagenomic analyses to identify the phylogenic profiles of the gut microbiota of AB dams and AB offspring with higher resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref068">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref069">69</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we did not control the number of animals to be fostered by a mother throughout the experiments. Control and AB-treated mice gave birth to pups and nurtured them <italic>ad libitum</italic>. In cross-fostering experiments, whole litters of a control mother and whole pups of an AB-treated mother were exchanged with an exception. Litter sizes of dams vary to a considerable extent both in control dams and in AB-treated dams (Fig b in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s010">S2 Fig</xref>). Normalizing the numbers of pups fostered by a mother to a certain number in each litter was practically difficult under normal experimental conditions in which we had to produce as many pups as possible with limited numbers of pregnant dams. No statistical significance was obtained in the mean litter size between in control dams (6.63 ± 0.29) and in AB-treated dams (5.50 ± 0.50; Fig a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s010">S2 Fig</xref>). The difference in the numbers of offspring fostered by each mother in cross-fostering experiment was not statistically significant among control (6.29 ± 0.28), FMAB TMControl (7.22 ± 0.40) and FMControl TMAB offspring (5.00 ± 0.82), either (Fig b in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s014">S6 Fig</xref>). Distributions of body weights in each litter size imply that there is no apparent effect of litter size on the body weight at P7 or P28 (Figs d-i in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s010">S2 Fig</xref> and Figs d-l in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0138293.s014">S6 Fig</xref>). However, it might be expected that we evaluate more correctly the effect of perturbation of the maternal gut microbiota or the effect of cross-fostering on the development of offspring by minimizing the differences in the numbers of offspring fostered by a mother. We might have to consider this in the future experiment.</p>
<p>In the open field test, the level of anxiety in a novel environment can be measured by the preference to stay near a wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref070">70</xref>]. Notably, AB offspring engaged less and spent a shorter amount of time undertaking exploratory locomotive behavior in the inside area, compared with control offspring. Widely used mouse assays for anxiety-related behaviors include the elevated plus–maze, elevated zero–maze, light–dark exploration, marble burying, shock–probe burying, stress–induced hyperthermia and the operant Vogel thirsty–lick conflict test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref070">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0138293.ref071">71</xref>]. In future studies, we would ascertain if AB offspring exhibit apparent anxiety-related behaviors using some of these behavioral tests.</p>
<p>The results of our study suggest that administration of non-absorbable antibiotics to pregnant mice to perturb the maternal gut microbiota is associated with alterations in offspring behavior, although the detailed underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. It can be expected that such hidden aspects of the functions of the gut microbiota in the maintenance of healthy maternal metabolism and/or healthy mother–infant relationships during the perinatal periods will be revealed by investigation of the detailed mechanisms whereby the behavioral phenotypes of AB offspring are developed.</p>
