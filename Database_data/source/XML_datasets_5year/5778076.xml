<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Stress requires regulation of gene expression. There is increasing evidence for spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. This often involves the formation of specialized membraneless compartments, or ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules, also called liquid organelles, which are formed by proteins containing RNA-binding and low complexity sequence domains (LCDs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. There are different types of non-membranous compartments: stress granules and processing bodies in the cytoplasm; nucleoli and Cajal bodies in the nucleus; and mitochondrial RNA granules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. All of these structures are highly dynamic and often form or increase in size and number upon specific changes in the cellular or organismal environment.</p>
<p id="Par4">There must be a simple and robust signaling cascade in place that quickly accommodates cellular metabolism to respond to reversible stress. miRNAs are candidates for such a role, since they can simultaneously regulate multiple targets. Multiple components of the miRNA-induced silencing complex are detected in RNP granules, implying that miRNA-based regulation predominantly happens in these non-membranous subcellular compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Recently, miRNAs have been implicated as major stress-response factors in many organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. It has been demonstrated that stress-dependent alterations in miRNA expression can affect multiple mRNAs simultaneously via direct targeting. However, the idea that miRNAs can also regulate multiple RNAs indirectly by targeting a LCD-containing protein involved in the formation of various RNP granules, thus regulating RNA metabolism, has not been explored. Moreover, knowledge of the functional role of non-membrane compartments in regulating gene expression, especially in multicellular organisms, is largely missing. In particular, oogenesis is a very well-studied process that is known to be extremely sensitive to stress, and in which miRNAs have been shown to play critical roles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Using <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis as a readout model for starvation-induced stress, we describe new characteristics for Rbfox1 protein as a structural component of RNP granules. We show that Rbfox1 levels are adjusted by the stress-sensitive miRNA, <italic>miR-980</italic>, which significantly influences the stress response. Rbfox1 has previously been implicated in ovarian germline differentiation; moreover, recently it has been shown that <italic>Rbfox1</italic> is regulated by <italic>miR-980</italic> in the process of memory formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">Rbfox1 is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of human RBFOX1/Ataxin2-binding protein 1 (Rbfox1/A2bp1), which is known to be involved in alternative splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In addition, it has been shown that mammalian RBFOX1 can be found not only in the nucleus, but also in the cytoplasm, where it binds to <italic>3′UTRs</italic> of multiple mRNAs, regulating their stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Dysfunctions of human RBFOX proteins are associated with various medical conditions, including spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, mental retardation and epilepsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, hand osteoarthritis, congenital heart defects, obesity, and diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The wide range of RBFOX1-associated diseases suggests that RBFOX1 alterations could have a more general effect on regulation of gene expression and that its expression must be tightly controlled.</p>
<p id="Par6">Here we find that apart from the highly evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding (RRM) domain, Rbfox1 contains multiple LCDs that can be differentially included by alternative splicing. Based on our in vivo and in vitro analyses, we show that depending on its expression level and specific isoforms, Rbfox1 assembles in various RNP granules, which differ in their content, subcellular localization, and function. RNP granules can range from liquid droplets to amyloid-like fibers, and we detect Rbfox1 in all these states in a living organism. In this study, we also find that Rbfox1 promiscuously associates with the nucleolus and Cajal bodies in the nucleus, as well as stress granules and processing bodies in the cytoplasm, possibly, via its multiple LCDs. We uncovered an elegant mechanism by which Rbfox1 levels are adjusted by a stress-dependent miRNA<italic>. miR-980</italic> buffers Rbfox1 levels, since it can target only the portion of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> transcripts that contain extended 3′UTRs. This prevents the reduction of Rbfox1 levels below a certain threshold, which is also detrimental for cellular homeostasis. Reduced <italic>miR-980</italic> expression during stress leads to increased Rbfox1 levels, followed by widespread formation of RNP granules, promoting cell survival. In addition, our informatics analyses on human RBFOX proteins show that they also contain multiple LCDs, and data from human fibroblasts and neurons suggest that human RBFOX1 can associate with various RNP granules, assembly of which is augmented by stress. This demonstrates that similar functions exist for human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> RBFOX1 and suggests a putative molecular mechanism explaining how multiple human disorders develop due to RBFOX1 deregulation upon stress.</p>

<title>Stress-responsive <italic>miR-980</italic> targets Rbfox1 in vitro and in ovaries</title>
<p id="Par7"><italic>Drosophila miR-980</italic> was previously identified as stress-linked in a screen for miRNAs that are differentially expressed in response to stress and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. <italic>miR-980</italic> was found to be downregulated upon various stresses (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>), suggesting that it could play a role in stress tolerance. To investigate <italic>miR-980</italic> function, we generated loss-of-function mutants by imprecise P-element excision (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>A–E, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>) and analyzed the phenotypes caused by <italic>miR-980</italic> deficiency using the newly generated mutants (<italic>miR-980</italic><sup><italic>Ex1-1</italic></sup>, <italic>miR-980</italic><sup><italic>Ex1-2</italic></sup> and <italic>miR-980</italic><sup><italic>Ex1-3</italic></sup>) and an additional <italic>miR-980</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> allele<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par8">We found that <italic>miR-980</italic> is expressed in the ovarian germline and soma (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>E, F). In addition, the ovaries of <italic>miR-980</italic> mutants seemed to be enlarged, and their size did not decrease as apparently as in controls in response to starvation stress (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>), suggesting that the miRNA <italic>miR-980</italic> is involved in fine-tuning of the dietary stress response during oogenesis. Therefore, next, we used <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis as an in vivo model to address <italic>miR-980</italic> stress-related functions. Using the miRNA target prediction database TargetScan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, we found three predicted conserved target sites for <italic>miR-980</italic> in the <italic>3′UTR</italic> of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> mRNA. The <italic>Rbfox1</italic> gene encodes different isoforms (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>A, B) that also differ by the <italic>3′UTR</italic> choice, and only the extended <italic>3′UTRs</italic> (medium and long) contain <italic>miR-980</italic> binding sites (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>C, D). To test if <italic>miR-980</italic> targets <italic>Rbfox1</italic> via the predicted miRNA binding sites, we cloned different <italic>Rbfox1 3′UTR</italic> regions containing <italic>miR-980</italic> binding sites into luciferase reporters (P1 and P2, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2D</xref>). We found the expression of both reporters to be substantially reduced upon <italic>miR-980</italic> overexpression in S2R+ cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>). This miRNA-based regulation was <italic>miR-980</italic>-specific, since overexpression of other miRNAs that are not predicted to target <italic>Rbfox1</italic> (<italic>miR-966</italic> and <italic>miR-278</italic>) did not result in the downregulation of the luciferase reporter containing <italic>Rbfox1 3′UTR</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>). Similar to in vitro results, in vivo, <italic>Rbfox1</italic> mRNA levels in ovaries were increased upon <italic>miR-980</italic> loss, confirming that <italic>miR-980</italic> regulates <italic>Rbfox1</italic> during oogenesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">3</xref>). <italic>miR-980</italic> and Rbfox1 expression depends on stress: <italic>miR-980</italic> levels are substantially reduced, while <italic>Rbfox1</italic> mRNA levels are increased in response to metabolic stress (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>, Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Rbfox1 levels depend on <italic>miR-980</italic> and stress. <bold>a</bold> Schematics of ovaries and a single ovariole (lower panel), where the germline (blue) is surrounded by the somatic follicular epithelium cells, in which at st.7, Notch signaling-dependent mitotic-to-endocycle and at st.10b, endocycle-to-amplification transitions occur.

<p id="Par9">To determine whether stress-dependent miRNA-based regulation of Rbfox1 also occurs at the protein level, we analyzed Rbfox1 protein levels and cellular localization, using two different antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. First, we tested Rbfox1 protein levels in ovarian lysates from sated and starved wild type and <italic>miR-980</italic> mutant animals. We found that Rbfox1 protein levels in general were noticeably increased in response to starvation stress (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>). Moreover, higher Rbfox1 levels were detected in both sated and starved <italic>miR-980</italic> mutant ovaries, and this upregulation was isoform-specific (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">3A</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>). While some of the isoforms maintained unchanged expression levels regardless of differences in genotypes or conditions, others responded specifically to either miRNA deficit or starvation. In particular, Rbfox1 isoforms that migrated at ~50 kDa, ~65 kDa, ~75 kDa, and ~120 kDa showed increased expression levels in <italic>miR-980</italic> mutants in comparison to controls at normal conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>). Among these, Rbfox1 ~50 kDa isoform was specifically upregulated upon <italic>miR-980</italic> loss (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">3A</xref>). At the same time, an <italic>Rbfox1</italic> isoform that runs at ~110 kDa was upregulated in controls and <italic>miR-980</italic> mutants only upon starvation, while ~60 kDa isoform levels did not show any significant fluctuations at different conditions and in the studied genotypes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">3A</xref>). Unfortunately, currently annotated transcripts do not represent all possible combinations of alternative isoforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>; therefore, it is not possible to conclusively assign the behavior of different bands on the western blots to the specific Rbfox1 isoforms.</p>
<p id="Par10"><italic>miR-980</italic> can target <italic>Rbfox1</italic> cell-autonomously, since its clonal overexpression in the ovarian follicular epithelium resulted in the reduction of Rbfox1 protein levels compared to neighboring wild type cells (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">3</xref>B,D). This miRNA-based regulation of Rbfox1 protein expression was comparable to the effect of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> RNAi (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">3B and E</xref>). Altogether, these data show that stress and <italic>miR-980</italic> affect Rbfox1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels.</p>
<p id="Par11">In the germline and somatic cells of developing egg chambers, Rbfox1 protein has a very distinctive expression pattern that depends on the developmental stage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref>). This is especially evident in the follicular epithelium, which undergoes major transitions in cell cycle mode during differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a, f</xref>). In <italic>miR-980</italic> mutants, elevated Rbfox1 levels were detected at all developmental stages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>), demonstrating that <italic>miR-980</italic> is responsible for the control of the highly dynamic Rbfox1 expression during the entire process of oogenesis.</p>
<p id="Par12">Since <italic>miR-980</italic> mutants showed abnormal response to starvation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>), next, we analyzed whether <italic>miR-980</italic> targeting of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> has a functional role in the dietary stress response. The delay in the termination of egg production upon starvation caused by <italic>miR-980</italic> deficiency can be fully rescued by the reduction of the <italic>Rbfox1</italic> gene by one copy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>h, i). This demonstrates that the <italic>miR-980</italic> diet-sensitive ovarian phenotype is Rbfox1-dependent and that the higher levels of Rbfox1 are beneficial for oogenesis progression upon nutritional stress.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec4">
<title>Rbfox1 promotes cell survival and ovarian cell differentiation</title>
<p id="Par13"><italic>Rbfox1</italic> mRNA has the possibility of having alternative <italic>3′UTRs</italic> – two short and two long <italic>3′UTRs –</italic> and all three conserved <italic>miR-980</italic> target sites are found only in the alternative extended <italic>3′UTR</italic> (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>C, D). mRNA isoforms with shorter <italic>3′UTRs</italic> are less available for miRNA regulation. Therefore, we wanted to address how important is the presence of alternative <italic>3′UTRs</italic>, thus, targeting of Rbfox1 by <italic>miR-980</italic>, and what effect this regulation has on cellular status. To test what happens if <italic>Rbfox1</italic> is not subjected to <italic>miR-980</italic>-based regulation, we analyzed mutants overexpressing one of the Rbfox1 isoforms lacking the extended <italic>3′UTR</italic> (<italic>Rbfox1-RE</italic>, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2B</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par14">It has been shown that upon starvation, to ensure animal survival, both the germline and somatic cells die and the entire egg chamber content is recycled<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Since <italic>miR-980</italic> deficiency results in higher Rbfox1 levels, we analyzed the consequence of <italic>miR-980-</italic>insensitive Rbfox1 isoform upregulation in follicle cell clones upon stress. We found that the follicle cells that had higher levels of Rbfox1 did not die upon starvation (green cells, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). This was in sharp contrast to the surrounding non-clonal wild type cells that show fragmented DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>, lower panel, arrows). In addition, in Rbfox1-overexpressing cells, the levels of the autophagy marker Atg8 were upregulated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>), while the levels of the apoptosis marker Caspase3 were downregulated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>). This was accompanied by slower growth, perceived by noticeably decreased Myc levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). We also observed that the clonal cells with increased Rbfox1 express higher levels of cell adhesion proteins (Cadherin and Armadillo/, β-catenin) and delaminate from the monolayered follicular epithelium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e, f</xref>). Moreover, they failed to properly differentiate, as they express higher levels of the transmembrane receptor Notch (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">3</xref>F, G). Notch signaling activation is essential for proper follicle cell differentiation and to switch their cell cycle mode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In clonal cells overexpressing Rbfox1, Notch signaling activation (monitored by the repression of the Notch-regulated transcription factor Cut) was delayed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2g, h</xref>). Together, these data show that elevated Rbfox1 affects cellular status at multiple levels: it slows cell differentiation and growth, alters autophagy, and downregulates apoptosis.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Rbfox1 is a pro-survival factor that regulates follicular epithelium differentiation. <bold>a</bold> In starved females, Rbfox1-overexpressing clones (<italic>Rbfox1 OE</italic>, GPF-positive, <italic>hsFlp; UAS-Rbfox1-RE/ + ; act &gt; CD2 &gt; Gal4 UAS-GFP</italic>) have higher cell density and decreased cell death.

At the same time, significantly higher percentages, 80% and 70% of clonal cells with overexpressed or downregulated Rbfox1, failed to turn on Cut expression during amplification stages (<italic>n</italic> = 19 and 43 clones for <italic>Rbfox1 OE</italic> and <italic>Rbfox1 KD</italic>, respectively). <bold>j</bold> Scheme represents <italic>miR-980</italic>/Rbfox1 function in response to nutritional stress.

<p id="Par15">We also examined follicle cell clones in which Rbfox1 was downregulated via RNAi. Rbfox1 downregulation also delayed cell differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2h, i</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">3</xref>G, H). However, contrary to its upregulation, Rbfox1 downregulation in follicle cell clones increased cell death (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">3H</xref>). Even more, in <italic>Rbfox1</italic> hypomorphic mutants, both the germline and somatic cells were completely unable to differentiate (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">3</xref>I, J). Instead of forming one oocyte and 15 nurse cells with large nuclei per one egg chamber, Rbfox1 mutant egg chambers contained many small, undifferentiated germline cells (compare st.8 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">3I</xref>). In addition, they were encased by a layer of improperly differentiated epithelial cells that failed to enter the endocycle, as their nuclei were smaller and their number was higher when compared to the control egg chambers of the same size (compare Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">3J</xref>). This suggests that Rbfox1 is required for ovarian cell differentiation, and it would be unfavorable for all <italic>Rbfox1</italic> isoforms to be subjected to <italic>miR-980</italic> regulation. Thus, having a choice of alternative <italic>3′UTRs</italic> maintains the precision of Rbfox1 expression.</p>
<p id="Par16">In summary, these data show that upon starvation, the regulation of Rbfox1 expression is partially achieved via stress-dependent <italic>miR-980</italic>-based buffering and that increased Rbfox1 levels modulate cell growth, differentiation, autophagy, and apoptosis.

<title>RNA-binding protein Rbfox1 contains multiple LCDs</title>
<p id="Par17">Human Fox family proteins and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rbfox1 have a highly evolutionarily conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">4</xref>).

These amino acids in the Rbfox1 protein are polar (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">4A</xref>, green), and in general, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rbfox1 contains multiple glutamine-rich (polyQ) stretches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, a composition similar to prion-like proteins (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">4</xref>A, B).

<title>Rbfox1 forms liquid-like aggregates upon stress</title>
<p id="Par18">Since Rbfox1 has both a conserved RRM and LCDs, we hypothesized that it can aggregate into subcellular RNP granules with different physical and biochemical properties. Also, since GO term analysis identified stress-related functions for Rbfox1 (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">4C</xref>) and our data show that it has a role in ovarian response to stress (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>), we presumed that Rbfox1 aggregation could be stress-dependent. The biochemical isolation of stress granules in vivo has not been developed to date; however, it has been discovered that a biotinylated version of isoxazole (b-isox) can precipitate LCD-containing RNA-binding proteins from cell lysates, mimicking stress in vitro and resulting in the cell-free formation of RNP granules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par19">To test whether Rbfox1 can aggregate via its LCDs, we analyzed cell lysates from control ovaries that were treated with different b-isox concentrations. This indeed resulted in Rbfox1 precipitation in a b-isox concentration-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>), establishing that Rbfox1 shares chemical characteristics with multiple previously described LCD-containing proteins that form hydrogels and amyloid-like fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Therefore, similar to other LCD-containing RNA-binding proteins, Rbfox1 aggregates via LCDs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Upon stress Rbfox1 aggregates in higher-order subcellular structures in cells. <bold>a</bold> Western blot demonstrates the behavior of Rbfox1 protein in response to b<italic>-</italic>isox treatment.

<p id="Par20">In addition, we tested if the efficiency of Rbfox1 precipitation by b-isox depends on Rbfox1 concentration by overexpressing one of the Rbfox1 isoforms, Rbfox1-PE. The advantage of experimenting with this Rbfox1 isoform, apart from the absence of the extended <italic>3′UTR</italic>, lies in the assortment of protein domains that are included in Rbfox1-PE (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">5</xref>). First of all, it contains the RRM binding domain that has been previously shown to be important for interaction of RBFOX proteins with RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Second, it has ten out of thirteen predicted LCDs, which vary in their lengths and types. In particular, the coiled-coil domain, LCD1, and LCD7 contain poly(Q), while LCD10 and LCD13 are enriched for poly(A), LCD2 for poly(N), and LCD3 and LCD6 for poly(G) stretches (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">5</xref>). Thus, the Rbfox1-PE isoform has the major protein domains that we assume have important roles in Rbfox1 protein function as an RNP granule component. We used the heat-shock inducible <italic>hsFlp; act&gt;CD2&gt;Gal4</italic> system to overexpress Rbfox1-PE in follicle cell clones. Comparison of the cell lysates from control and Rbfox1-PE-overexpressing ovaries that were precipitated with different b-isox concentrations shows that upon Rbfox1 overexpression, more Rbfox1 is precipitated by b-isox, demonstrating the specificity of this interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>, lower panel). These data show that Rbfox1, similarly to other LCD-containing proteins, precipitates with b-isox in a concentration-dependent manner.</p>
<p id="Par21">To check the solubility of Rbfox1-positive aggregates, we used semi-denaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE), which allows the resolution of a wide size range of SDS-resistant aggregates, including amyloids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. We prepared ovarian lysates from wild type and <italic>miR-980</italic>-deficient animals that were well-fed or starved. As a negative control, samples were incubated at high temperature, which causes restoration of most of the amyloids to monomer state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Indeed, Rbfox1 formed SDS-resistant aggregates, most of which were disintegrated by boiling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>). The amount of Rbfox1-positive aggregates detected by the SDD-AGE was dependent on stress and <italic>miR-980</italic> presence, since the increase in Rbfox1 aggregations was observed in starved control and in well-fed and starved <italic>miR-980</italic> mutant ovaries in comparison to well-fed controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>, experiment). We noticed that under stress, some of the Rbfox1-positive aggregates remained stable even after high temperature treatment, suggesting their insoluble nature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>, negative control). Together, these data show that first, it is possible to reconstitute the cell-free assembly of Rbfox1-positive aggregates using b-isox crystals, which specifically bind to LCDs. Second, the amount and the solubility of SDS-resistant Rbfox1-positive aggregates were condition-dependent, suggesting that the increase in Rbfox1 levels due to stress and <italic>miR-980</italic> loss promotes the formation of Rbfox1 aggregates and their transition into a less soluble, possibly amyloid-like state.</p>

<title>Rbfox1 forms liquid-like compartments upon stress in cultured cells</title>
<p id="Par22">Next, we tested if Rbfox1-positive aggregates can be observed in vivo. First, cultured S2R+ <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells were treated with sodium arsenite, a commonly used inducer of stress-dependent compartments and processing bodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In non-transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>), low endogenous Rbfox1 protein levels were detected with anti-Rbfox1 antibodies in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Treatment with sodium arsenite stimulated Rbfox1 aggregation into cytoplasmic and nuclear granular structures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>c, d). To investigate whether Rbfox1-positive granules are of liquid state, we applied 1,6-hexanediol to the stressed cells. 1,6-hexanediol can disintegrate associations formed through weak transient interactions and dissolve assemblies that have liquid- and hydrogel-like properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Indeed, 1,6-hexanediol addition led to the partial disintegration of sodium arsenite-induced Rbfox1 granules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c, e</xref>). Thus, these data suggest that in response to stress, Rbfox1 protein assembles into granules that have liquid droplet properties. These results were also confirmed using S2R+ cells expressing FLAG-tagged Rbfox1-PE isoform, which, when expressed under normal conditions predominantly localizes in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d, e</xref>). Upon stress, Rbfox1-PE also assembled into nuclear and cytoplasmic granules, appearance of which could be reduced upon 1,6-hexanediol treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d, e</xref>). Sometimes, even long, filamentous Rbfox1-positive aggregates were observed in the starved, Rbfox1-expressing S2R+ cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3f</xref>). To test whether Rbfox1-positive granules contain RNA, we performed in situ hybridization in S2R+ cells stressed by sodium arsenite to detect <italic>poly(A)</italic> tails of mRNAs. We found that Rbfox1 colocalized with polyadenylated mRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3g, h</xref>), confirming that Rbfox1-positive granules contain RNA and indeed are <italic>bona fide</italic> RNP granules.</p>

<title>Rbfox1 forms higher order structures in <italic>Drosophil</italic><italic>a</italic> ovaries</title>
<p id="Par23">Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that upon prolonged starvation stress, Rbfox1 assembled into round, granular structures in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>, arrows). The abundance of these structures was increased in <italic>miR-980</italic> mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>), which, as we have shown above, express higher Rbfox1 levels. In addition, similar to the starved S2R+ cells overexpressing Rbfox1-PE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3f</xref>), notable long filamentous structures were observed in stressed <italic>miR-980</italic> ovaries (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c, d</xref>).

To check whether Rbfox1 fibers have amyloid characteristics, we stained ovaries with an amyloid marker, ThioflavinT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. We found that a portion of ThioflavinT-positive cytoplasmic and nuclear assemblies also co-stained with anti-Rbfox1 antibodies, confirming that Rbfox1 protein forms amyloid-like fibers and aggregates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4f, g</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Upon stress Rbfox1 aggregates in higher-order subcellular structures in ovaries. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Upon prolonged protein starvation (1–3 weeks) in <italic>Control</italic> (<bold>a</bold>) and <italic>miR-980</italic> (<bold>b</bold>) ovaries, Rbfox1 aggregates in cytoplasmic and nuclear droplets of various size and shape. <bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold> Sometimes, Rbfox1 can form various phase-separated long fibers in both germline (<bold>c</bold> lower panel) and somatic follicle cells (<bold>d</bold>) of <italic>miR-980</italic> mutants. <bold>e</bold> Similar higher order structures can be found in starved mitochondrial stress-linked <italic>parkin</italic> mutant ovaries. <bold>f</bold>, <bold>g</bold> Rbfox1-positive fibers (<bold>f</bold>) and round granules (<bold>g</bold>) formed in starved ovaries co-stain with Thioflavin T, a benzothiazole dye that exhibits enhanced fluorescence upon binding to amyloid fibrils. <bold>h</bold>–<bold>j</bold> FRAP experiments performed on ovaries of flies with GFP-tagged Rbfox1 protein (<italic>Rbfox1</italic><sup><italic>CC00511</italic></sup><italic>/TM3</italic>). <bold>h</bold> Images of germline cell at different time points; prebleached (−1 s), postbleached (0 s), and after recovery (7 s).

<p id="Par24">If Rbfox1 is capable of assembly of the liquid-like structures, then their recovery kinetics after photobleaching of the fluorescently labelled Rbfox1 protein should be fast. We performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments using Rbfox1::GFP, which is efficiently incorporated into granules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4h</xref>). We found that Rbfox1-positive granules were quite heterogeneous and differed by their initial intensity, bleaching efficiency, mobile fraction, and half-time of fluorescence recovery (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4i</xref>). We found that Rbfox1-positive granules could be divided into two distinct groups based on their recovery time (Group 1: <italic>n</italic> = 33, <italic>t</italic><sub>half</sub> = 0.96 ± 0.85 s and Group 2: <italic>n</italic> = 10, <italic>t</italic><sub>half</sub> &gt; 6.93 s). Thus, FRAP analyses showed that Rbfox1 protein can re-assemble within RNP granules on timescales of seconds (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4j</xref>), which, based on the analysis of the previous data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, leads us to propose that Rbfox1-positive granules belong to the category of liquid droplets showing medium recovery speed.</p>

<title>Rbfox1 localizes to nuclear RNA-containing compartments</title>
<p id="Par25">To reveal the identity of Rbfox1-positive granules, we characterized its subcellular localization in vivo. As mentioned above, Rbfox1 expression in ovaries is extremely dynamic and depends on the developmental stage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref>). For example, in the soma, Rbfox1 can be detected in the cytoplasm, the nucleus, or both, and it can be assembled into small or large round granules or fibril-like aggregates (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">6A</xref>). In <italic>miR-980</italic> mutant ovaries, Rbfox1 protein levels as well as the size and number of Rbfox1-positive aggregates were apparently increased at all developmental stages in the germline and somatic cells (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>f, g, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">6</xref>). To address the characteristics of Rbfox1-positive assemblies, we used multiple molecular markers. In particular, we tested for association of Rbfox1 with the subcellular liquid organelles known to be important for cellular stress response and differentiation and to be assembled via phase separation, such as the nucleolus and Cajal bodies in the nucleus.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Rbfox1 colocalizes with membraneless nuclear organelles associated with RNA metabolism. <bold>a</bold> In follicle cell nuclei, Rbfox1 is associated with chromatin and enriched in the granular component of the nucleolus.

<p id="Par26">The nucleolus is the largest membraneless organelle in the nucleus and exhibits liquid droplet characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. While it is known that the nucleolar ultrastructure organization is highly specific for the cell type and its metabolic status, it is still difficult to correlate its appearances with cellular metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. We observed that germline cells exhibit stage-specific variations in nucleolar appearance, and the somatic epithelial cells organize their nucleoli differently depending on whether they are endocycling or amplifying (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">6A</xref>), demonstrating that nucleolar organization correlates with the developmental status of the cell. The size and shape of the nucleolus is highly uniform in the follicular epithelial cells surrounding the same stage oocytes. For example, at st.9–10 A, when follicular epithelial cells undergo endoreplication and actively grow, most of them (95%) have a nucleolus with a regular or doughnut-shaped appearance (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">6B</xref>). Co-staining of the nucleolar marker Fibrillarin with Rbfox1 revealed that at st.9, nuclear Rbfox1 is predominantly localized around and sometimes within the nucleolus in controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">6A</xref>). However, in <italic>miR-980</italic> mutants, Rbfox1 association with the nucleolus is even more evident (yellow in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>). Moreover, <italic>miR-980</italic> deficiency and Rbfox1 overexpression caused changes in nucleolar morphology, as higher percentages of nucleoli appeared to have an inkblot-like shape or to be more segregated and dispersed in mutants in comparison to controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a, b</xref>). Similarly, in the <italic>miR-980</italic>-deficient germline, the appearance of the nucleoli in the nurse cells was changed in comparison to control nurse cells of the same stage (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">6</xref>C–F). Even more, overexpression of <italic>miR-980</italic>-insensitive Rbfox1-PE isoform in the follicle cells had an effect on the nucleolar size and shape (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b, c</xref>). These data show that Rbfox1 can be localized in the nucleolus and that Rbfox1 levels affect nucleolar ultrastructure.</p>
<p id="Par27">The other important stress-responsive organelle in the nucleus is the Cajal body (CB). It has been shown that Rbfox proteins are involved in alternative splicing, implying that Rbfox1 could be associated with the CBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. We found Rbfox1 levels have an effect on CB size and number (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c, d</xref>). At st.10, the majority of the follicular epithelial cells (70%) contain one large CB, while upon Rbfox1 overexpression, more than 80% of cells have more than one CB per nucleus. In most of the cells (65%) with higher Rbfox1 levels, the number of CBs per cell ranged from 3 to &gt;10 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c, d</xref>). In addition, we found that colocalization of Rbfox1 with the CB marker, Coilin, depends on the presence of <italic>miR-980</italic>. The percentage of CBs that also co-stained with Rbfox1 was increased in <italic>miR-980</italic> mutants that express higher Rbfox1 levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>). In addition, Coilin and Rbfox1 colocalization increases upon stress. In controls, under normal conditions, less than 10% of CBs in the st.8 follicle cells were positive for Rbfox1, while upon starvation, &gt;60% of CBs were Rbfox1-positive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5f</xref>). This tendency was even more pronounced in <italic>miR-980</italic> mutants, in which more than 80% of CBs were Rbfox1-positive under stress (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5f</xref>). Similarly, in the germline, Rbfox1 colocalized with CBs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5g</xref>, blue arrowheads) and the size and the number of CBs were increased in the starved and <italic>miR-980-</italic>deficient ovaries. Thus, our analyses of Rbfox1 nuclear localization demonstrate that Rbfox1 associates with the nucleolus and CBs and that Rbfox1 levels affect the organization of these nuclear, membraneless organelles. This association with the nucleolus and CBs becomes more pronounced under conditions that lead to increased Rbfox1 expression, such as <italic>miR-980</italic> loss or starvation stress. Similarly, in the cytoplasm, the appearance of Rbfox1-positive granules depends on both stress and <italic>miR-980</italic>-based Rbfox1 regulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e–g</xref>). We found that Rbfox1 assembles even longer fiber-like structures in the nuage of starved <italic>miR-980</italic> mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5g</xref>, yellow arrow). Similar Rbfox1-positive, elongated assemblies were also seen in the somatic follicle cells at late oogenesis stages in wild type and <italic>miR-980</italic> deficient animals (st.11-12, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">6A</xref>). Therefore, next we analyzed the nature of Rbfox1-positive aggregates in the cytoplasm.</p>

<title>Rbfox1 localizes to various cytoplasmic RNP granules</title>
<p id="Par28">Since in eukaryotes there are two major classes of cytoplasmic RNP granules: processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules (SGs), we tested whether the cytoplasmic Rbfox1-positive RNP granules belong to either of these two major classes. As a marker for P-bodies, we used antibodies against a key enzyme in RNA turnover, Pacman, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of XRN1 (a 5′-3′ processive exoribonuclease that degrades decapped mRNAs and also functions in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and degradation of mRNAs after miRNA or siRNA targeting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>). We analysed co-expression of Pacman and Rbfox1 in the nurse cells of developing oocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). Normally, Pacman is present everywhere in the cytoplasm and assembles into large granules around the nurse cell nuclei. We found that all Pacman-positive P-bodies also contain Rbfox1 protein; however, not all Rbfox1 granules contain Pacman (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). In general, Pacman expression levels and the assembly of Pacman-positive P-bodies were enhanced upon Rbfox1 level increase achieved by <italic>miR-980</italic> loss and starvation stress (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b, c</xref>), showing that the increase in Rbfox1 expression positively affects P-body formation.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Rbfox1 colocalizes with P-bodies and stress granules in the cytoplasm. <bold>a</bold> In the germline, Rbfox1 co-stains with the P-body marker Pacman.

<p id="Par29">To test whether Rbfox1 is also present in stress granules, we subjected animals to temperature stress, which led to formation of Hsp70/Hsc70-positive cytoplasmic granules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d, e</xref>). The Hsp70/Hsc70 complex is known to act as a stress chaperone for cellular proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. We found that in temperature-stressed ovaries, Rbfox1 colocalizes with granules that also immunostain for Hsp70/Hsc70 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6d</xref>). These data show that similar to Rbfox1 localization in the nucleus, in the cytoplasm, its localization is also condition- and genotype-dependent. In response to different stresses or <italic>miR-980</italic> loss, more Rbfox1-positive granules could be detected in the cytoplasm (P-bodies and stress granules). However, Rbfox1 did not localize to the histone locus body in the nucleus that is responsible for processing of histone pre-mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> or stress-dependent cytoophidia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">7</xref>), demonstrating that some degree of specificity exists for Rbfox1 inclusion into different membraneless compartments. In summary, these data demonstrate that depending on developmental stage and environmental conditions, Rbfox1 can associate with membraneless organelles that have previously been described to have a liquid droplet character and to contain proteins regulating cytoplasmic RNA metabolism (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6f</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par30">To understand the possible mechanism of how Rbfox1 interacts with various nuclear and cytoplasmic liquid-like organelles, we investigated the protein structure of the factors that we found in the Rbfox1-positive RNA granules. Using the SMART database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/">http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/</ext-link>), we analyzed domain structures of the nuclear liquid compartment markers: Fibrillarin (nucleolus), and Coilin (Cajal body) and also markers of the cytoplasmic RNA granules, Pacman (P-body), as well as Hsc70-3, Hsc70-4, Hsc70-5, and Hsc70Cb (stress granule). Notably, all these proteins are predicted to have multiple LCDs that vary in their length and composition (Supplementary Figure 8. Among these proteins, Fibrillarin, Hsc70-3, Hsc70-4, Hsc70-5, Hsc70Cb were also identified as proteins precipitated by b-isox in a liquid droplet component screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Since LCD-containing proteins are known to promiscuously aggregate and self-aggregate via LCDs, we propose that Rbfox1 interacts with multiple LCD-containing proteins, which, in a concentration-dependent manner, promotes formation of various liquid organelles, globally regulating the cellular stress response.</p>

<title>Human RBFOX1 contains LCDs and forms RNP aggregates</title>
<p id="Par31">We hypothesized that similarly to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rbfox1, its human counterparts may also be linked to stress-induced RNP granule formation. To test this, we first analyzed human Fox family protein sequences for the presence of LCDs. Apart from the evolutionarily conserved RNA recognition motif (RMM, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>), we identified LCDs in all human RBFOX proteins, albeit in lower numbers than in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rbfox1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">5</xref>). Also, similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, various isoforms of human RBFOX1, RBFOX2, and RBFOX3, generated by alternative splicing, had different numbers of detected LCDs (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">5</xref>). To address their functionality, we utilized an in vitro model for RNA granule formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> and found that human RBFOX1 protein from human fibroblast cell lysates precipitated with b-isox, validating that it can form RNP granules in vitro (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7c</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Human RBFOX proteins also contain multiple LCDs. <bold>a</bold> Protein sequence alignment of RNA recognition motifs (RRM) of human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rbfox1 reveals high conservation. <bold>b</bold> Schematic view of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rbfox1 and human Fox family proteins (RBFOX1, RBFOX2, and RBFOX3).

<p id="Par32">To test whether these granules are stress-inducible and of liquid state, we analyzed RBFOX1 subcellular distribution in human fibroblast cells, either unstressed or stressed by sodium arsenite (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8a–c</xref>). RBFOX1 was detected in small nuclear and cytoplasmic foci, the size of which was significantly increased by stress (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8d</xref>). In particular, we found that, similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, human RBFOX1 incorporates into larger protein assemblies in the nucleus and in the perinuclear area of the cytoplasm and many of these granules were mitochondria-associated (arrows, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8a–c</xref>). While the number of RBFOX1 granules did not change upon different conditions, their size increased in response to stress and was restored to normal as a result of 1,6-hexanediol treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8c, d</xref>). It has been shown that stress granules contain a stable core structure surrounded by a more dynamic shell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. The fact that RBFOX1-positive subcellular compartments in human cells could only be partially disassembled by application of 1,6-hexanediol suggests a complex structure that possibly consists of both more stable and more liquid components (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8c</xref>). Moreover, in late passage cells, in addition to small nuclear and cytoplasmic foci, RBFOX1 accumulated in the nucleolus and formed large cytoplasmic aggregates even without additional stress induction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8e, f</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>Conserved biological function of human RBFOX1 as a component of stress-induced subcellular compartments. <bold>a</bold> In human fibroblasts, RBFOX1 is detected in small cytoplasmic and nuclear speckles in normal conditions. <bold>b</bold> Treatment by the stress-promoting chemical sodium arsenite induces formation of larger RBFOX1-positive granules. <bold>c</bold> Moreover, application of 1,6-hexanediol, which dissociates non-amyloid RNP assemblies, causes partial disaggregation of RBFOX1-positive stress granules. <bold>d</bold> The number of RBFOX1-positive foci increases upon stress.

<p id="Par33">Multiple age- and stress-related diseases, especially neurodegenerative disorders, are commonly coupled with defects in mRNA processing in neuronal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Therefore, we investigated whether RBFOX1 shows a similar pattern of behavior and forms stress-inducible, soluble RNP granules in neuronal cells differentiated from human iPS cells. In human neurons, RBFOX1 was also detected in nuclear and cytoplasmic foci, assembly of which was augmented by stress and could be moderately disturbed by 1,6-hexanediol (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>g–i). These results suggest that in human neurons, RBFOX1 forms granules with differential substructures. In addition, we noted that upon stress, RBFOX1 has a tendency to be relocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>g–i). Intriguingly, bioinformatics predicts that human <italic>Rbfox</italic> mRNAs contain multiple miRNA binding sites (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">6</xref>), suggesting that they can be subjected to miRNA-based regulation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par34">Our results show that a miRNA, <italic>miR-980</italic>, and its target, Rbfox1, interact to have a profound effect on cell survival, growth, and differentiation, and subsequently, on organismal viability upon stress. Together they are integrated in a new stress-responsive signaling cascade (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>), in which alterations in miRNA expression in response to stress result in the upregulation of a protein with broad pro-survival properties. We found that Rbfox1 is a LCD-containing, RNA-binding protein, which associates with different nuclear, cytoplasmic and possibly mitochondrial RNP granules that have diverse functions including RNA processing, translation, splicing, storage, and decay. Our data demonstrate that Rbfox1 not only associates with these membraneless organelles, but also affects their assembly. The widespread inclusion of Rbfox1 to different subcellular organelles can be explained by the presence of multiple LCD sequences in the Rbfox1 protein. It has been shown that liquid droplet formation involves many promiscuous, weak interactions of different proteins with sticky LCDs in a concentration-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Our data show that in response to stress, alternative Rbfox1 isoforms are generated and Rbfox1 expression levels are increased. We propose that these alterations in Rbfox1 expression lead to redistribution of various Rbfox1 isoforms between the nucleus and cytoplasm and to the assembly of liquid droplet compartments, which occurs in an Rbfox1 concentration-dependent manner via Rbfox1 self-aggregation and aggregation with other LCD-containing proteins.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>The <italic>miR-980/Rbfox1-</italic>mediated stress-responsive signaling cascade. Stress-dependent <italic>miR-980</italic> regulates Rbfox1, amending cell survival. <italic>miR-980</italic> can target only the portion of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> mRNAs with the alternative extended <italic>3′UTRs</italic>. This prevents the reduction of Rbfox1 levels below a certain threshold, which is detrimental for cellular homeostasis. Rbfox1 is a LCD-containing protein that phase-separates into liquid droplets and amyloid-like fibers in vivo and promiscuously joins nuclear and cytoplasmic RNP granules. Their assembly depends on Rbfox1 concentration and the presence of alternatively spliced isoforms. Since upon stress or <italic>miR-980</italic> loss, the levels of Rbfox1 generally increase, this, via LCD-mediated interactions, stimulates aggregation of other LCD-containing proteins that have specific functions in the nuclear and cytoplasmic liquid organelles. Since Rbfox1 levels globally influence RNA granule dynamics, we propose that the cell survival and differentiation defects observed as a result of Rbfox1 up- or down-regulation could be caused by Rbfox1 function as a liquid droplet-assembling LCD-containing protein</p></caption><graphic id="d29e2294" xlink:href="41467_2017_2757_Fig9_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par35">Furthermore, Rbfox1 phase-separation and RNP granule formation is concentration dependent, since Rbfox1 aggregates more often under conditions that increase its cellular levels, such as <italic>miR-980</italic> deficiency or stress, as well as Rbfox1 overexpression. This is in agreement with recent findings for the human FUS protein, where differences in protein concentration determine whether FUS forms liquid droplets, gels, or fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. In addition, Rbfox1 isoform specificity is adjusted by stress and <italic>miR-980</italic> deficiency. Therefore, it would be interesting to further study Rbfox1 isoform composition and functionality under stress and normal conditions. Since Rbfox1 differential expression influences the formation of different subcellular, membraneless organelles that have previously been shown to be involved in RNA processing, maintenance of its isoforms and precise cellular concentrations should be of great importance.</p>
<p id="Par36">Human Rbfox proteins associate with a multimeric protein complex called a large assembly of splicing regulators (LASR), which contains hnRNP M, hnRNP H, Martin3, hnRNP U-like-2, hnRNP C, NF 110, NF45, and DDX5/17<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Half of these proteins (hnRNP M, hnRNP H, hnRNP C, DDX5/17) that complex with Rbfox were also identified as proteins precipitated by b-isox in the liquid droplet screen performed by the McKnight lab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. It has been demonstrated that Rbfox proteins are associated with the LASR complex in the specific nuclear fractions: particularly, in the insoluble high molecular weight fraction containing chromatin, nuclear speckles, and unspliced RNA. Altered Rbfox expression changes activity of hnRNP M, thus affecting splicing through indirect interaction with the RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. An Rbfox splice variant lacking most of the RNA binding domain, but retaining the N- and C-terminal domains can block splicing activation, but not splicing repression, suggesting that domains other than RRM in Rbfox have important roles in regulation of RNA metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Recently, it has been shown that Rbfox interacts with LASR via its C-terminal domain containing repeated tyrosines that mediate higher-order assembly of Rbfox/LASR, which is essential for splicing activation by Rbfox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. These data imply that alternative splicing choices depend on the higher-order assembly of splicing regulators within the nucleus.</p>
<p id="Par37">In addition to their nuclear function as splicing regulators, Rbfox proteins have cytoplasmic function. For example, a recent study showed that human Rbfox2 is included in the specific SGs that contain a subset of cell cycle-related genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Also, in the cytoplasm, Rbfox1 competes with miRNAs for the binding sites in the <italic>3′UTRs</italic>. Thus, cytoplasmic Rbfox1 binding increases stability and translation of target mRNAs, especially mRNAs involved in cortical development and autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. It is known that the components of the miRNA machinery in the cytoplasm are found in P-bodies, and our data show that Rbfox1 is involved in P-body assembly; thus, we propose that this completion between miRNAs and Rbfox protein for the binding sites in <italic>3′UTRs</italic> occurs in these liquid organelles.</p>
<p id="Par38">Our data also show that Rbfox1 is itself subjected to miRNA-based regulation. Importantly, cellular stress and miRNA deficiency have the same effect on Rbfox1, demonstrating that regulation by the stress-sensitive miRNA is used as a major mechanism securing proper Rbfox1 regulation upon stress. Interestingly, <italic>miR-980</italic> is shut down by any stress we tested: muscular dystrophy and aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, temperature, and starvation (this study). The resulting increase in Rbfox1 expression levels triggers RNA granule assembly, which consequently affects nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA biogenesis and promotes cell survival (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>). Recently, the <italic>miR-980</italic>/<italic>Rbfox1</italic> interaction in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain has also been shown to regulate memory via the modulation of calcium responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, further demonstrating the wide range of physiological processes dependent on <italic>miR-980</italic>/<italic>Rbfox1</italic> interaction.</p>
<p id="Par39">Notably, we also found that only a part of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> mRNA could be subjected to <italic>miR-980</italic>-based regulation, since only a part of Rbfox1 transcripts have the extended <italic>3′UTRs</italic> containing <italic>miR-980</italic> target sites. Messenger RNAs containing alternative <italic>3′UTRs</italic> are very common and are often expressed differentially depending on the developmental stage and cell type, adding an extra level to mRNA diversification. Currently, the understanding of the mechanisms controlling the <italic>3′UTR</italic> length in different cell types is largely missing, but recent studies suggest that <italic>3′UTR</italic> length could have a profound effect on protein localization, levels, and functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Theoretically, by changing <italic>3′UTR</italic> sequences, <italic>Rbfox1</italic> mRNA can be associated with different trans-regulatory factors that interact with the translation machinery, thus regulating its expression. For example, by varying the length of the <italic>3′UTR</italic>, <italic>Rbfox1</italic> becomes more or less accessible for regulation by miRNAs, including <italic>miR-980</italic>. Now we have shown that the ability to have alternative <italic>3′UTRs</italic> advances the mechanism of Rbfox1 regulation upon stress.</p>
<p id="Par40">A recent model proposes that LCD-mediated protein aggregation, which results in the formation of functional, higher-order RNP assemblies that allow accumulation of RNA-binding proteins and RNA in defined space, can be beneficial for various regulatory processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. We found that Rbfox1 protein can be promiscuously included in different types of liquid RNA granules, which normally regulate RNA metabolism. At the same time, keeping Rbfox1 levels high for extended periods of time (for example, prolonged starvation or constant mitochondrial stress) could result in the formation of insoluble beta-amyloid-like fibers that are considered to be detrimental. Therefore, turning <italic>miR-980</italic> “on” in a timely fashion could potentially prevent toxic fiber formation.</p>
<p id="Par41">Thus, our data show that the miRNA acts upstream of a crucial cellular pro-survival mechanism that allows temporal adjustment to stress.

To photobleach Rbfox1-positive speckles, a 20-millisecond laser pulse was applied to selected regions of interest (ROI). Confocal images were obtained before and after photobleaching with 1 s intervals.</p>
<p id="Par67">To determine the raw FRAP data, the average intensity of each bleached Rbfox1-positive speckle (ROI1) was measured for each time point by ZEN 2011 image processing software. Then, background subtraction was performed by subtracting the average intensity of non-bleached background area (ROI2) from the average intensity of ROI1 for each time point. Acquisition photobleaching was corrected for the gradual fluorescence decrease in the prebleach or postbleach images by dividing the intensity value of bleached Rbfox1-positive area by the average fluorescence of non-bleached bright control area (ROI3). After background subtraction and correction, fluorescent intensity values were normalized to one by dividing the intensity of all time points by the average prebleach intensity. Then, the mobile/immobile fractions were determined as following: <italic>F</italic><sub>M</sub> = (<italic>I</italic><sub>E</sub>−<italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub>)/(<italic>I</italic><sub>I</sub>−<italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub>), where <italic>F</italic><sub>M</sub>—mobile fraction, <italic>I</italic><sub>E</sub>—end value of the recovered fluorescence intensity, <italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub>—first postbleach fluorescence intensity, and <italic>I</italic><sub>I</sub>—initial fluorescence intensity.

The last can be converted to the half-life time as <italic>t</italic>1/2 = tau*ln(2). The errors have been obtained from the 95% confidence bounds returned by the fitting routine. MATLAB software was used for curve fitting. Scattered blots were build using OriginPro 9.1.</p>

<title>Microscopy and image analysis</title>
<p id="Par69">Images of ovaries and S2R+ cells were obtained using a Zeiss LSM700 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Protein expression patterns and phenotypes were analyzed from confocal images taken in a z-stack (1 µM step) of ovarioles/egg chambers/follicle, S2R+, or human cells. Reproducible results are presented. For the whole fly, pupae, and larvae imaging, a SteREO Discovery V8 stereomicroscope with Zeiss AxioCam ICc1 camera was used. Images were processed with ZEN 2009 and Adobe Photoshop software.</p>
<p id="Par70">The immunostaining intensities for anti-Atg8 and anti-Cas3 were measured by ZEN 2011 software in Rbfox1-expressing follicular epithelium cells (GFP-positive) and compared to the neighboring control cells (non-clonal, GFP-negative) in the same egg chamber (intensity per cell). Values are normalized to the control and are presented as AVE ± AD. At least 25–50 cells from 3 to 5 clonal egg chambers of comparable developmental stages were analyzed. The immunostaining intensities for anti-Myc, anti-Cad, anti-Arm and anti-Rbfox1 were measured per GFP-positive clone and compared to the same size neighboring control area (non-clonal, GFP-negative) within the same egg chamber (intensity per area). AVE ± AD values obtained from 5 to 17 clonal areas of comparable stage egg chambers are presented normalized to the control. The efficiency of Notch signaling activation was evaluated as following: first, the intensity of anti-Notch staining was measured in <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-overexpressing or <italic>Rbfox1</italic><sup><italic>RNAi</italic></sup>-expressing clones (GFP-positive), and also in two neighboring control areas of the same size within the same egg chamber. Obtained values were normalized to one of the control areas and are presented as absolute values. Measurements obtained from 11 clones for each experiment were averaged and presented as AVE ± AD. The two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used for statistical analysis. Dynamics of Cut expression in developing follicle cells was quantified for <italic>Rbfox1</italic>-overexpressing (<italic>n</italic> = 19) and <italic>Rbfox1</italic><sup><italic>RNAi</italic></sup>-expressing (<italic>n</italic> = 43) clones and compared to the control (neighboring non-clonal cells) within the same egg chamber. The frequency of Cut expression was evaluated in st.6-10a and in st.10b-12 clonal egg chambers. The two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was applied for statistics.</p>
<p id="Par71">The numbers of Coilin-positive speckles were quantified per cell from z-sections of Rbfox1-expressing clones and compared to the numbers observed in non-clonal neighboring cells within the same egg chamber. Coilin and Rbfox1 colocalization was scored from z-sections of st.7-8 egg chambers. Nucleolar types were quantified from maximum intensity projections of st.9-10 egg chambers immunostained with anti-Fibrillarin. Chi square and Two-Way Tables analysis was applied for statistics. The Rbfox1 and ATPsyn colocalization was counted from z-sections per st.9-10 follicle cell (<italic>n</italic> = 110 and 154 cells for <italic>Control</italic> and <italic>park</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> mutant, respectively).

Ovaries were rapidly dissected in ice-cold PBS and homogenized in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 125 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1% NP40, 0.5% Sodium-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 25 mM NaF, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail. Protein extracts were separated by SDS–PAGE and subjected to standard western blotting for Rbfox1 detection with polyclonal guinea pig anti-Rbfox1 (1:5000) antibodies. Gels were analyzed with ImageJ. Rbfox1 isoform band intensities were measured and normalized to Actin levels and to the control at normal conditions.

In <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries, Rbfox1 overexpression was induced in follicle cell clones by applying 1-h heat shock for two consecutive days 3 days prior dissection. Control animals were treated analogously. Ovaries were rapidly dissected in ice-cold PBS and homogenized in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 125 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1% NP40, 0.5% Sodium-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 25 mM NaF, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail. Human fibroblast cells were first briefly washed with PBS and then collected in the same lysis buffer. Samples were tumbled at 4 °C for 20 min, and cell lysates were precleared with a centrifugation at 14000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 °C. B-isox (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in DMSO was added to cell lysates to 10, 30, and 100 µM final concentrations. DMSO was added to the mock control. For b-isox-mediated protein precipitation, samples were rotated gently at 4 °C for 1 h. The incubated reaction was then spun at 14000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min to pellet the precipitate. The pellet was washed twice in lysis buffer and resuspended in 2 × SDS loading buffer. The supernatant and precipitate were each separated by SDS–PAGE and subjected to standard western blotting to identify Rbfox1/Fox-1 among b-isox-precipitated proteins. Polyclonal guinea pig anti-Rbfox1 (1:5000) antibodies were used for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rbfox1 detection, and monoclonal mouse anti-Fox-1 (1:1500) was used for detection of human RBFOX1 protein.</p>

<title>Semidenaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis</title>
<p id="Par74">Semidenaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE) was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> with minor modifications. In brief, a 1.5% agarose gel containing 0.1% SDS was cast using a standard gel casting tray for horizontal DNA electrophoresis and placed into a gel tank containing 0.1% SDS and 1 × TAE buffer.</p>
<p id="Par75">To prepare the cell lysates for SDD-AGE, 15 female adult flies were homogenized in 70 µl of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 125 mM NaCl; 0.5% NP-40; 0.25% sodium-deoxycholate; 25 mM NaF; 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>; 1 mM DTT; 2 mM EGTA at pH 8.0; 1 mM EDTA at pH 8.0; 1× protease inhibitor cocktail) and then incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature. The lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 4000 rcf for 20 min. Protein concentration was measured using Bradford Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). 300 µg of cell lysates were added to 4× sample buffer (2 × TAE; 20% glycerol; 8% SDS; 1% bromophenol) to a final 1× concentration.</p>
<p id="Par76">In SDS-containing buffers, amyloid-like aggregates are stable at room temperature but can be disrupted by boiling. Therefore, samples were incubated for an additional 10 min either at RT or at 95 °C as negative control. Electrophoresis was performed at 4.5 V/cm-gel length for 6 h. Protein transfer was performed to a nitrocellulose membrane for 12-16 h using capillary action. The membrane was used for western blot analysis.</p>
