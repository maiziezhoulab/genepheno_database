<title>Summary</title>
<p>Differences in the growth and maturation of diverse forebrain tissues depend on region-specific transcriptional regulation. Individual transcription factors act simultaneously in multiple regions that develop very differently, raising questions about the extent to which their actions vary regionally. We found that the transcription factor Pax6 affects the transcriptomes and the balance between proliferation and differentiation in opposite directions in the diencephalon versus cerebral cortex. We tested several possible mechanisms to explain Pax6's tissue-specific actions and found that the presence of the transcription factor Foxg1 in the cortex but not in the diencephalon was most influential. We found that Foxg1 is responsible for many of the differences in cell cycle gene expression between the diencephalon and cortex and, in cortex lacking Foxg1, Pax6's action on the balance of proliferation versus differentiation becomes diencephalon like. Our findings reveal a mechanism for generating regional forebrain diversity in which one transcription factor completely reverses the actions of another.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="p0030">The mechanisms that create the brain's enormous inter-regional diversity of structure and function remain poorly understood. Early in embryogenesis, the anterior neural plate is patterned by the regional expression of transcription factors whose actions are essential for each part to acquire its correct size and cellular composition. These transcription factors are sometimes referred to as “master regulators” or “selectors” to reflect their powerful ability to control the hierarchies of gene expression that specify region-specific growth and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allan and Thor, 2015</xref>). Although some transcription factors are expressed in discrete regions of the central nervous system, many of them do not instruct the development of unique regions but are expressed simultaneously in multiple regions whose morphologies and functions develop very differently. This raises questions about the degree to which the actions and mechanisms of action of individual transcription factors vary between different brain regions. Does a transcription factor regulate a particular process, such as cell proliferation, similarly in all regions? To what extent and how are its actions modified by the context in which it is expressed?</p>
<p id="p0035">The transcription factor Pax6 is expressed simultaneously by large populations of progenitors in both major components of the forebrain, the telencephalon (rostrally) and the diencephalon (caudally) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stoykova and Gruss, 1994</xref>). During this time, the telencephalon expands much more than the diencephalon, which it engulfs as it forms the cerebral cortex dorsally and the basal ganglia ventrally. The diencephalon forms the thalamus (Th) and prethalamus (PTh), which process and transmit signals to and from the overlying cortex. Pax6 regulates the proliferation of cortical cells by limiting the rate at which progenitors progress through the cell cycle. Pax6 deletion promotes a higher rate of proliferation of cortical radial glial progenitors (RGPs), whereas the opposite occurs if Pax6 is overexpressed within a physiological range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Georgala et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Georgala et al., 2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manuel and Price, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mi et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies have shown that Pax6 is required for normal thalamic and prethalamic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stoykova et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Warren and Price, 1997</xref>), but whether it controls thalamic and prethalamic progenitors in the same way it regulates cortical RGPs is unknown.</p>
<p id="p0040">We began by addressing this question. We compared the effects of acute Pax6 deletion on the transcriptomes of cells from embryonic cortex, Th, and PTh and found that the expression levels of genes associated with cell proliferation and differentiation were altered in opposite directions in the cortex and diencephalon. We went on to show that this corresponded with an opposite effect of Pax6 deletion on the balance between proliferation and differentiation in these two regions. We next explored the mechanisms that might account for these tissue-specific differences, including the possibility that the actions of Pax6 are affected by the presence or absence of another high-level transcription factor, Foxg1. Foxg1 regulates the cell cycles of cortical progenitors, is expressed by all telencephalic (cortical and basal ganglia) cells including RGPs, but is not expressed by diencephalic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fasano et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumamoto and Hanashima, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mariani et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martynoga et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xuan et al., 1995</xref>). We first showed that Foxg1 deletion from cortical cells makes their profile of cell cycle gene expression more diencephalon like. We went on to test how <italic>Foxg1</italic>-null cortical cells respond to Pax6 deletion. We found that this caused cell-autonomous changes that were opposite to those in Foxg1-expressing cortex and similar to those in diencephalic tissues, indicating that the region-specific actions of Pax6 on the balance of proliferation and differentiation in developing forebrain are Foxg1 dependent.</p>

<title>Quality Control of RNA-Seq Data</title>
<p id="p0045">We started by using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to study the effects of tamoxifen-induced <italic>Pax6</italic> deletion on gene expression in the cortex, Th, and PTh at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5). We dissected only the anterior half of the cortex (ACtx), where cortical levels of Pax6 are higher. Administration of tamoxifen at E9.5 to <italic>Pax6</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> embryos ubiquitously expressing Cre recombinase from a <italic>CAG</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup> allele caused Pax6 loss from E11.5 onward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>A–1D). These embryos are referred to here as <italic>CAG</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup>
<italic>Pax6</italic> cKOs (conditional knockouts), and they are compared with <italic>CAG</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup>
<italic>Pax6</italic><sup><italic>fll+</italic></sup> littermate controls, which continue to express Pax6 in a normal pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>A and 1C). Heterozygosity for <italic>Pax6</italic> does not detectably affect forebrain Pax6 protein levels or the proliferation of Pax6-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S1</xref>A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mi et al., 2013</xref>). Accurate and consistent dissection of the Th, PTh, and the ACtx was guided by the <italic>DTy54</italic> transgene, which expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of all known <italic>Pax6</italic> regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tyas et al., 2006a</xref>). This transgene faithfully reports the levels of <italic>Pax6</italic> gene expression in cells in which the endogenous <italic>Pax6</italic> locus can be either normal or null. PTh and ACtx are distinguished by high levels of <italic>Pax6/</italic>GFP expression; PTh has a sharp posterior boundary with Th, which expresses <italic>Pax6/</italic>GFP at lower levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S1</xref>B–S1E′).<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Effects of Pax6 Deletion on Transcriptomic Differences between Embryonic Anterior Cortex (ACtx), Thalamus (Th), and Prethalamus (PTh)</p><p>(A–D) Pax6 immunohistochemistry at (A and B) E11.5 and (C and D) E13.5 showing <italic>CAG</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup>-induced loss of Pax6 throughout the forebrain following tamoxifen administration at E9.5.

<p id="p0050">Before RNA-seq, we quality controlled the accuracy and consistency of the separation of PTh and Th using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to measure the levels of expression of <italic>Dlx2</italic>, which is highly expressed in PTh, but not in Th, and <italic>Neurog2</italic>, which is highly expressed in Th and in only a small proportion of PTh cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S2</xref>A and S2B). None of the PTh samples included in the analysis contained mRNA for <italic>Wnt8b</italic>, confirming that they were not contaminated by adjacent eminentia thalami, which is <italic>Wnt8b</italic>-rich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adutwum-Ofosu et al., 2016</xref>). At least three quality-controlled replicate samples representing each tissue and genotype from independent litters were analyzed by RNA-seq. After sequencing, we re-confirmed the accuracy of our diencephalic dissections by extracting the expression values of several reference genes with well-characterized differential expression between the PTh and Th. We found low levels of prethalamic markers (<italic>Dlx2</italic>, <italic>Gsx2</italic> and <italic>Ascl1</italic>) in both control and cKO thalamic samples (red arrows, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S2</xref>C, S2E, and S2G) and low levels of thalamic markers (<italic>Neurog2</italic>, <italic>Gbx2,</italic> and <italic>Dbx1</italic>) in control and cKO prethalamic samples (red arrows, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S2</xref>D, S2F, and S2H).

Principal component analyses (PCA) showed individual samples separating according to genotype along the axes of greatest variation in all three tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec2.2">
<title>Major Inter-regional Differences of Gene Expression in Control Embryos</title>
<p id="p0055">We examined differences between the transcriptomes of ACtx, Th, and PTh in control embryos. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc2">Table S1</xref> lists all genes showing significant (adjusted p &lt; 0.05) enrichment in each control tissue over its level in each of the other two control tissues. There were about 3,000 significant differences between Th and PTh and about 10,000–11,000 between ACtx and Th or PTh. The expression patterns of genes showing the greatest inter-regional differential expression are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S4</xref>. Many encode transcription factors or other molecules involved in regulating developmental processes. This analysis shows the great divergence in molecular identities and hence the context in which Pax6 operates in these three regions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2.3">
<title>Major Inter-regional Differences of Gene Expression Remain after <italic>Pax6</italic> Deletion</title>
<p id="p0060">We then repeated this analysis on data from <italic>CAG</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup>
<italic>Pax6</italic> cKOs to compare the differences between the transcriptomes of ACtx, Th, and PTh when Pax6 was deleted. The numbers of inter-regional differences increased to over 4,000 between Th and PTh and to over 12,000 between ACtx and either Th or PTh (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc3">Table S2</xref>). We then paired the regions—ACtx with Th, ACtx with PTh, Th with PTh—and calculated differential expression (in the form of log<sub>2</sub> fold changes [LFCs]) between the members of each pair in controls and in cKOs. For each pair, we plotted control LFCs and cKO LFCs against each other, including all genes significantly differentially regulated by Pax6 loss in both members of each pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>E–1G). The graphs showed that the vast majority of genes retained the direction of their inter-regional differential expression in cKOs (i.e., if they were higher in one region in controls, the same was true in cKOs). Exceptions included <italic>Gsx2</italic>, which is known from previous work to have its normally strong expression in PTh extinguished by Pax6 loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Caballero et al., 2014</xref>), and Dlx family members, which are upregulated in cKO ACtx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>E and 1F); a full list of exceptions is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc4">Table S3</xref>. We conclude that Pax6 is not required to maintain the vast majority of fundamental differences in molecular identity between these forebrain regions.</p>

<p id="p0065">We next studied gene expression changes between controls and <italic>CAG</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup>
<italic>Pax6</italic> cKOs within each individual tissue. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc5">Table S4</xref> lists, for each tissue, all genes showing significant differential expression between controls and cKOs (adjusted p &lt; 0.05). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>A–2C plots, for each tissue, each gene's LFC in expression over its average expression (those with adjusted p &lt; 0.05 in red), and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>D summarizes the numbers of significantly up- and downregulated genes in cKOs.

PTh showed the greatest number of differentially expressed genes, probably because <italic>Pax6</italic> is expressed not only by all progenitors but also by many postmitotic neurons in PTh, whereas it is expressed only by progenitors in the cortex and Th. This likelihood is supported by the observation that genes showing the largest differential expression values in PTh include many encoding ion channels and receptors associated with postmitotic neurons, whereas these genes showed little or no significant differential expression in ACtx or Th (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc5">Table S4</xref>). Quite similar numbers of genes showed significant differential expression in ACtx and Th (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>D). The numbers of significantly upregulated genes were ∼40%–60% higher than the numbers of downregulated genes in both Th and Pth, whereas this ratio was reversed in ACtx.<fig id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The Effects of Pax6 Deletion on the Transcriptomes of Prethalamic, Thalamic, and Anterior Cortical Cells</p><p>(A–C) Scatter plots of log<sub>2</sub> fold changes (on the y-axis) versus the mean of normalized counts (on the x-axis) in prethalamus (A), thalamus (B) and anterior cortex (C); red dots indicate statistically significant changes between genotypes (adjusted p values &lt;0.05).</p><p>(D) An overview of the numbers of significantly differentially expressed (DE) genes resulting from Pax6 deletion in each region.</p><p>(E) Venn diagram showing the numbers of significantly DE genes in each region and common to multiple regions.</p><p>(F) Heatmap representing the results of hierarchical clustering of RNA-seq data from each sample from control and <italic>CAG</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup><italic>Pax6</italic> cKO.</p><p>(G–I) The 10 most highly enriched, non-redundant gene ontology (GO) terms with obvious relevance to developmental processes for up- and downregulated genes in each region.</p><p>See also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc5">Tables S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc6">S5</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr2"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="p0070">A surprisingly small number of genes (255 of 5,539) showed significant differential expression across all three tissues (referred to here as “commonly deregulated genes”) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>E). Forty-five of these genes were upregulated, and only 12 were downregulated in all three tissues (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc6">Table S5</xref>). Many of these 57 genes encode molecules implicated in intercellular interactions such as cell adhesion, cell-cell communication, and axon guidance. For example, proteins involved in Wnt signaling were strongly represented. <italic>Wnt3a</italic>, <italic>Wnt5a</italic>, <italic>Lrg4</italic>, <italic>Wif1,</italic> and <italic>Wls</italic> were commonly upregulated, and <italic>Dkk3</italic> was commonly downregulated. Among the commonly downregulated genes were two related to retinoic acid signaling: <italic>Rlbp1</italic> and <italic>Ripply3</italic>. To see the expression levels of any regulated gene in our dataset, visit <italic>Gene Expression Plots</italic> at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" id="intref0020" xlink:href="https://pricegroup.sbms.mvm.ed.ac.uk/Pax6_diencephalon/">https://pricegroup.sbms.mvm.ed.ac.uk/Pax6_diencephalon/</ext-link>. Interestingly, 8 of the 12 genes that are commonly downregulated have been reported to be directly regulated by Pax6 (<italic>Dkk3</italic>, <italic>Rlbp1</italic>) and/or show a peak in Pax6 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) (<italic>Bmpr1b</italic>, <italic>Cldn12</italic>, <italic>Dkk3</italic>, <italic>Mlc1</italic>, <italic>Nr2e1</italic>, <italic>Rypply3</italic>, <italic>Rlbp1,</italic> and <italic>Sema3a</italic>; references in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc6">Table S5</xref>). The scarcity of commonly deregulated genes and the fact that the direction of change of 198 of 255 of them (i.e., whether they were up- or downregulated) varied between tissues suggests that Pax6 deletion affects aspects of cortical, thalamic, and prethalamic development in substantially different ways.</p>

<sec id="sec2.5">
<title>Pax6 Loss Affects Gene Expression Profiles Oppositely in Cortex and Diencephalon</title>
<p id="p0075">To discover global similarities and differences in the inter-regional effects of Pax6 on gene expression, we carried out distance-based hierarchical clustering on our RNA-seq data. This identified two major clusters representing samples from the cortex and diencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>F), suggesting that the reactions of the two diencephalic tissues, Th and PTh, to Pax6 loss might be more similar to each other than to that of the cortex.</p>
<p id="p0080">To predict how Pax6 removal might affect biological processes in ACtx, Th, and PTh and to look for possible similarities and differences in how these regions respond to the deletion, we first carried out gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis on all genes showing significant differential expression in each tissue. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>G–2I show the 10 most highly enriched, non-redundant GO terms with obvious relevance to developmental processes for up- and downregulated genes in each tissue. Regarding genes upregulated in the cortex, 3 of 10 terms contained “cell proliferation” with one being “positive regulation of cell proliferation” and 3 of 10 terms contained “differentiation” with one being “negative regulation of cell differentiation.” Regarding genes downregulated in the cortex, no terms related to proliferation but 2 of 10 terms contained “differentiation” and a further 4 of 10 terms related to processes that occur in differentiating cells, such as “axonogenesis” or “projection development.” By contrast, in diencephalic tissues, terms including “differentiation,” “axonogenesis,” or “projection development” were associated only with upregulated genes (5 of 10 in PTh and 4 of 10 in Th), whereas terms related to proliferation were associated only with downregulated genes (6 of 10 terms contained “cell cycle” in PTh). Overall, this analysis suggests that the effects of Pax6 loss on at least some developmental processes are likely to be opposite in the cortex and diencephalon. Pax6 loss might promote proliferation in the former but promote differentiation in the latter.</p>
<p id="p0085">We tested this idea further by hierarchically clustering all genes showing significant differential expression in at least one tissue according to the direction and magnitude of their LFCs across all three tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>A). Most genes showed LFCs in the same direction in PTh and Th, but in an opposite direction in ACtx. The dendrogram was cut to produce 14 clusters suitable for GO term analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>A lists highly enriched, representative functional terms alongside each cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc7">Table S6</xref> contains a complete list of functional terms associated with each cluster). In Clusters 1 and 4, most of the genes showed positive LFCs in ACtx, but negative LFCs in Th and PTh. These clusters were strongly associated with the GO term “cell cycle.” Cluster 4 contains 21 cell-cycle-related terms with significant enrichment; cell cycle terms were exclusively enriched in these two clusters and not in others. Trends were opposite in clusters 6–8, with most genes showing negative LFCs in ACtx but positive LFCs in Th and PTh. These clusters were strongly associated with GO terms containing or related to “differentiation.” Many genes in clusters 5, 6, and 8, which are strongly associated with terms related to differentiation, showed the greatest LFCs in PTh, in agreement with the continued function for Pax6 in postmitotic neurons in this region. Interestingly, cluster 8 also showed enrichment for “Wnt signaling pathway,” indicating that this pathway might be upregulated specifically in the diencephalon.<fig id="fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Pax6 Deletion Has Opposite Effects on the Transcriptomes of Cortical and Diencephalic (Thalamic and Prethalamic) Cells</p><p>(A) Hierarchical clustering of all genes that showed significant differential expression in at least one tissue according to the direction and magnitude of their log<sub>2</sub> fold change (LFC) across all three tissues.

<p id="p0090">Finally, we plotted the LFCs of all genes showing significant differential expression (adjusted p &lt; 0.05) in (1) PTh and Th against each other, (2) ACtx and PTh against each other, and (3) ACtx and Th against each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>B–3E). Genes associated with particular GO terms (“cell cycle,” “neuron differentiation,” “axonogenesis,” and “Wnt signaling pathway”) are marked on the graphs (in red). The LFCs of most genes associated with these and similar GO terms were directly related in Th and PTh (first column of graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>B–3E).

<p id="p0095">These analyses showed that Pax6 deletion caused many genes to alter their expression levels in opposite directions in cortical versus diencephalic regions. They indicate that many of these oppositely regulated genes are associated with cell proliferation and differentiation. They suggest that Pax6 loss is likely to promote proliferation over differentiation in cortex but to have the opposite effect in both diencephalic regions.</p>

<title>Pax6 Has Opposite Effects on Neurogenesis in Cortex and Diencephalon</title>
<p id="p0100">We then tested this prediction directly in embryonic brain. As before, we created <italic>CAG</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup>
<italic>Pax6</italic> cKOs and littermate controls by giving tamoxifen at E9.5. We carried out the analysis at three different ages for all tissues (E11.5, E12.5, and E13.5), thereby allowing for the fact that diencephalic tissues develop slightly ahead of telencephalic tissues, with neurogenesis starting by E11.5 in the former (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Suzuki-Hirano et al., 2011</xref>) and by E12.5 in the latter. We injected a single pulse of the S-phase marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) 24 hr before collecting tissue for analysis using markers of proliferating cells (Ki67) and differentiating neurons (Tuj1). We counted from two regions of ACtx, one lateral and one medial, and one region each of Th and Pth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>A–4D′). We measured the proportions of BrdU+ cells that (1) remained proliferative (BrdU+, Ki67+, Tuj1−; white arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>E and 4F), (2) had started to differentiate (BrdU+, Ki67−, Tuj1+; red arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>E and 4F), and (3) were in an intermediate state (BrdU+, Ki67−, Tuj1−; green arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>E) in ACtx, Th, and PTh of control and <italic>Pax6</italic> cKO embryos.<fig id="fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>The Effect of Pax6 Deletion on Proliferation and Differentiation in Cortical versus Diencephalic Neurons Is Opposite and Not Age Dependent</p><p>(A–D) Immunohistochemistry for BrdU and Tuj1 on E12.5 cortical (A and B) and diencephalic (C and D) tissues.

The data from all ages, regions, and genotypes were fitted to a generalized linear mixed model to test the effects of Pax6 inactivation depending on age and tissue. ANOVA was used with Tukey's method for multiple pairwise comparisons to obtain test statistics for contrasts in question.

<p id="p0105">Very few cells were BrdU+, Ki67− and Tuj1− in any condition, and their numbers changed in proportion to the fraction of differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S5</xref>). Most likely these cells had only recently entered G0 en route to undergoing differentiation. As there was no evidence that Pax6 deletion caused their numbers to increase, we decided to combine all BrdU+, Ki67− cells into one group, representing those that had exited the cell cycle to differentiate.</p>
<p id="p0110">The data from all ages, regions, and genotypes were fitted to a generalized linear mixed model to test the effects of Pax6 inactivation depending on age and tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>G). In the cortex, the proportions of mitotic (BrdU+) cells that remained proliferative (Ki67+) after 24 hr were significantly higher in cKOs than in controls and the proportions that had exited the cell cycle were significantly lower in cKOs, with the sole exception of the medial cortex at E12.5, where we detected no significant effect. It appeared that Pax6 had less effect in the medial than the lateral cortex at all three ages, which might be explained by the normally lower levels of Pax6 in medial regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>A and 1C). In both Th and PTh, effects of Pax6 loss were opposite to those in the cortex: the proportions of mitotic cells that remained proliferative after 24 hr were significantly lower in cKOs than in controls and the proportions that had exited the cell cycle were significantly higher.</p>
<p id="p0115">These data also allowed us to compare the states of maturation of tissues of different ages in control animals. In E13.5 lateral cortex, for example, ∼45% of mitotic cells had exited the cell cycle during the last 24 hr. Similar rates of exit are found at E12.5 in Th and are likely to be reached between E11.5 and E12.5 in PTh. This validates our premise that the range of ages included in these experiments allows comparison of the effects of Pax6 at equivalent developmental stages in the three tissues. The effect observed is therefore tissue specific and not age dependent. The results agree with our prediction from the RNA-seq experiments that the effects of Pax6 on the balance between proliferation and differentiation are opposite in the cortex versus diencephalon.</p>

<title>Inter-regional Variation in Pax6 Levels and Exon Usage Do Not Correlate Closely with Its Function</title>
<p id="p0120">We next considered possible mechanisms by which Pax6 might regulate the balance between proliferation and differentiation in opposite directions in cortical and diencephalic regions. The first possibility was that regional variation in attributes of the transcription factor itself causes it to operate differently in the cortex and diencephalon. Variation in Pax6's level and the ratio between its two major splice variants might modify its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haubst et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manuel et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0125">Regional variation in levels of Pax6 protein in normal forebrain did not correlate with the effects of Pax6 on the balance of proliferation versus differentiation. Levels of Pax6 are the highest in PTh and ACtx, which show opposite changes in proliferation versus differentiation following Pax6 deletion, and are relatively low in Th, which shows changes in the same direction as PTh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>A–1D). Regarding alternative splicing, previous studies have suggested that the two major isoforms, Pax6 and Pax6(5a), the latter containing an additional 14 amino acids inserted into the paired domain, affect gene expression differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chauhan et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haubst et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pinson et al., 2005</xref>). We used our RNA-seq data to compare exon 5/5a usage in control ACtx, Th, and PTh (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S6</xref>). In each sample, we measured the average coverage across exons 5 and 5a and found that the only significant difference was an ∼2-fold difference in the 5/5a ratio between ACtx and PTh, with the ACtx having higher relative counts for exon 5a and therefore a lower 5/5a ratio. As with Pax6 levels, variation in relative levels of exon 5/5a usage did not correlate closely with the effects of Pax6 on the balance of proliferation versus differentiation. Pax6 is pro-proliferative in both Th and PTh and the opposite in ACtx, whereas the exon 5/5a ratio differed significantly between ACtx and only one of the diencephalic regions. Although regional differences in the exon 5/5a ratio might play a role, on their own they are unlikely to explain regional differences in Pax6 action on the balance of proliferation and differentiation. We went on to consider further possible mechanisms.</p>

<title>Pax6 Loss Causes Canonical Wnt Signaling Deregulation</title>
<p id="p0130">We then considered the possibility that Pax6 might affect the balance between proliferation and differentiation in opposite directions in the cortex and diencephalon because of its differential effects on intercellular signaling. We examined Wnt signaling, because the aforementioned results identified it as a GO function that is regulated differentially between the cortical and diencephalic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0135">A number of genes involved in Wnt signaling were commonly deregulated across all three tissues, sometimes in different directions but sometimes in the same direction. <italic>Lrp1</italic>, which encodes low-density lipoprotein receptor-1, a potential negative regulator of canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Willnow et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zilberberg et al., 2004</xref>), was upregulated in Th and PTh but downregulated in ACtx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>E). These changes correlated with regional differences in the effects of Pax6 on the balance of proliferation versus differentiation, whereas the others did not. Wnt3a and Wnt5a were upregulated across all three regions.

<p id="p0140">To see if the changes in expression of individual Wnt pathway genes produced a net effect that correlated with regional differences in the effects of Pax6 on the balance of proliferation versus differentiation, we examined the expression of two bona fide readouts of the Wnt canonical pathway, <italic>Lef1</italic> and <italic>Axin2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>H–5P).

<p id="p0145">These analyses suggest that the effects of Pax6 loss on canonical Wnt signaling are largely restricted to the diencephalon, where the effects were greatest in PTh. These changes would likely affect the behaviors of diencephalic progenitors, whereas they do not provide a clear explanation for the effect of Pax6 loss on cortical progenitors. We went on, therefore, to explore other factors that might be important for explaining the nature of Pax6's cortical effect.</p>

<title>Foxg1-Null Cortex Develops a Diencephalon-like Profile of Cell Cycle Gene Expression</title>
<p id="p0150">We next examined the possibility that Pax6 operates differently in the cortex because another transcription factor in this tissue moves the transcriptomes of cortical cells away from those of diencephalic cells, thereby altering the context within which Pax6 operates, thus modifying its actions. We postulated that such a factor should be present in the cortex and not the diencephalon and that it should not be regulated by Pax6. Transcripts for transcription factor Foxg1 showed the highest log<sub>2</sub> fold enrichment between ACtx and Th (11.67) and the third highest between ACtx and PTh (9.57) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc2">Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S4</xref>Y).

<p id="p0155">We first tested whether differences between the transcriptomes of cortical and diencephalic cells are created by Foxg1's presence in the cortex.

This caused loss of Foxg1 from almost all cortical cells by E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>C and 6G). We carried out RNA-seq in E13.5 control (<italic>Emx1</italic><sup><italic>CreER</italic></sup>; <italic>Foxg1</italic><sup><italic>fl/</italic>+</sup>) and <italic>Foxg1</italic> cKO cortices (in these experiments the entire cortex was used).

<p id="p0160">PCA showed that data from individual samples clustered by genotype along the axis of greatest variation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S7</xref>A). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc8">Table S7</xref> lists all genes with significant differential expression in <italic>Foxg1</italic> cKOs (adjusted p &lt; 0.05), and the numbers of up- and downregulated genes are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S7</xref>B and S7C.

This effect is unlikely to be mediated by an effect of Foxg1 on Pax6 levels or alternative splicing. Pax6 levels were only marginally decreased at the RNA level (LFC = −0.18; adjusted p = 0.007), Pax6 protein remained expressed in a normal pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figure S7</xref>D), and there was no significant effect of Foxg1 deletion on the relative usage of Pax6's exons 5 and 5a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc1">Figures S7</xref>E and S7F). We conclude that both Foxg1 and Pax6 operate largely independently with only very limited effects of either gene on the expression of the other.</p>
<p id="p0165">To find out whether Foxg1 shifts the context within which Pax6 operates toward that in diencephalic tissues, we compared RNA-seq data from the cortex of <italic>Foxg1</italic> cKOs with those from control cortex, Th, and PTh.

<p id="p0180">Pax6 and Foxg1 regulate many of these genes in the same direction. Included in this group are many downregulated genes with roles in cortical neurogenesis and differentiation, such as <italic>Neurog1</italic>, <italic>Neurod2</italic>, <italic>Neurod4,</italic> and <italic>Satb4</italic>. Pax6 and Foxg1 might act synergistically to promote the expression of these genes and drive neuronal precursors toward differentiation. Among the genes upregulated by either Pax6 or Foxg1 deletion, we found genes involved in signaling (<italic>Wls</italic>, <italic>Bmp2</italic>, <italic>Bmp5</italic>, <italic>Wnt3a,</italic> or <italic>Wnt8b</italic>) and several encoding transcription factors (<italic>Arx</italic>, <italic>Pax7</italic>, <italic>Zic3,</italic> or <italic>Sp5</italic>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc11">Table S10</xref>). Pax6 and Foxg1 regulated others in opposite directions, and we focused on these genes for our subsequent analyses. We argued that this group would be the one most likely to include genes whose regulation by Pax6 is reversed by Foxg1.</p>
<p id="p0185">Of the genes whose expression was deregulated in opposite directions by cortical deletion of Pax6 or Foxg1, 15 had GO annotations relating them with cell cycle control (red dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>A). These genes are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>B along with the direction of their expression change when either Pax6 or Foxg1 was removed from each region. Seven of these genes showed directions of change in <italic>CAG</italic><sup><italic>CerER</italic></sup>
<italic>Pax6</italic> cKOs that were opposite in ACtx versus Th and/or PTh. These gene expression changes, individually or collectively, might make a significant contribution to changing the balance between proliferation and differentiation in opposite directions in cortex versus the diencephalon after Pax6 deletion.</p>
<p id="p0190">One of these genes was the cell cycle regulator <italic>Ccnd1</italic>, which we took as an exemplar of the principles outlined above. In our RNA-seq data, <italic>Ccnd1</italic> showed significant Pax6-loss-induced differential expression in opposite directions in the cortex (upregulated) and diencephalon (downregulated in both Th and PTh) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>C). These changes can be seen with <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>D–7I. Ccnd1 is a G1 phase cyclin, which promotes entry into S-phase and hence cell cycle progression over cell cycle exit in many systems and cell types. Several previous studies have shown that altering its expression levels in the embryonic cortex alters the balance between proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artegiani et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferguson et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kollmann and Sexl, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lange et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matsushime et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Morgan, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pilaz et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zerjatke et al., 2017</xref>). In the light of these findings, we studied changes in <italic>Ccnd1</italic> expression further because they were likely to be good predictors of cellular responses to Pax6 removal in different contexts.</p>
<p id="p0195">To test whether Foxg1 affects the actions of Pax6 on <italic>Ccnd1</italic> expression, we tested the effect of deleting Pax6 from <italic>Foxg1</italic>-null cortex.

<p id="p0200">Altogether, these results increased the likelihood that Pax6's effects on the balance of proliferation versus differentiation in the cortex are Foxg1 dependent. We went on to test the hypothesis that in cortex lacking Foxg1, Pax6's effects would be more like those normally seen in the diencephalon.</p>

<title>Absence of Foxg1 Alters the Cellular Response of Cortex to Pax6 Removal</title>
<p id="p0205">We first counted the proportions of cortical cells that were proliferative (Ki67+) in E13.5 control, <italic>Pax6</italic> cKO, <italic>Foxg1</italic> cKO, and <italic>Pax6</italic>;<italic>Foxg1</italic> dcKO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>A–8E). We found that, in contrast to the consequences of removing Pax6 from normal Foxg1-expressing cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>A, and 8B), removing Pax6 from <italic>Foxg1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mutant cortex caused a significant reduction in the proportion of proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>E; Student's t test, p = 0.02). This response was opposite to that of Foxg1-expressing cortex and in the same direction as that of Th and PTh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0210">We then tested the effect of Pax6 deletion from <italic>Foxg1</italic>-null cortex on the production of Tbr1-expressing cells. Tbr1 marks cortical cells as they transition from a proliferative progenitor state to a postmitotic neuronal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Englund et al., 2005</xref>). In our RNA-seq data, <italic>Tbr1</italic> levels were significantly reduced in cortical <italic>Pax6</italic> cKOs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="mmc3">Table S2</xref>), fitting with the shift to proliferation. This was also clear with immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>F–8H). Here we compared the effects of Pax6 removal from <italic>Foxg1</italic>-null versus Foxg1-expressing cortical cells on their production of Tbr1+ cells at E15.5.</p>
<p id="p0215">We observed that in some E13.5 and E15.5 <italic>Foxg1</italic> cKOs and <italic>Pax6</italic>;<italic>Foxg1</italic> dcKOs, small clusters of cells continued to express Foxg1 protein. These clusters comprised only a few cells in the ventricular zone at E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>I) but were larger by E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>J–8P), as expected because their failure to delete <italic>Foxg1</italic> would enhance their proliferation relative to <italic>Foxg1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells. Foxg1+ clusters in <italic>Pax6</italic>;<italic>Foxg1</italic> dcKOs did not express Pax6 (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>I, and 8I′), suggesting that the floxed <italic>Pax6</italic> allele deleted more efficiently than the floxed <italic>Foxg1</italic> allele. This mosaicism allowed us to compare how the presence or absence of Foxg1 in neighboring cortical cells affected their response to Pax6 deletion.</p>
<p id="p0220">In clusters that retained Foxg1 expression in E15.5 <italic>Pax6</italic>;<italic>Foxg1</italic> dcKOs (i.e., single <italic>Pax6</italic> cKO cells), only a small percentage of cells expressed Tbr1 (12% ± 3 SD). These had reached the outermost layer of the cortical plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>J–8M), agreeing closely with the pattern and proportions of Tbr1-expressing cells (11% ± 2 SD) seen in E15.5 <italic>Pax6</italic> single cKO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>G and 8H). On the other hand, the majority (59% ± 7 SD) of cells that were null for both <italic>Pax6</italic> and <italic>Foxg1</italic> in dcKOs expressed Tbr1, indicating that neuronal differentiation was much more advanced in this population. To confirm that the differential outcome between Foxg1-positive and Foxg1-negative cells was a consequence of Pax6 removal, we compared clusters of Foxg1-positive and Foxg1-negative cells in <italic>Foxg1</italic> single cKOs, in which <italic>Pax6</italic> expression was normal. In these embryos, large proportions of both Foxg1-positive and Foxg1-negative cells throughout the cortical plate were Tbr1 positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>N–8P).</p>
<p id="p0225">These results indicate that although Pax6 normally promotes differentiation over proliferation in embryonic cortex, this effect is Foxg1 dependent. If Foxg1 is absent, Pax6 promotes cortical cell cycle progression, and Pax6 removal is anti-proliferative and pro-differentiative.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="p0230">Previous studies on non-neural cells from the lens of the eye, β-cells of the pancreas, and neural cells from the forebrain have reported that Pax6 has partially overlapping effects on the transcriptomes of these highly divergent Pax6-expressing cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mitchell et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sun et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xie et al., 2013</xref>). How the molecular actions of Pax6 compare between subdivisions of the forebrain was not clear. In this study, we first explored the differences between the transcriptomes of embryonic cortical and diencephalic (thalamic and prethalamic) cells in control brains and in brains from which Pax6 had been deleted. In controls, there were many more differences between cortical and diencephalic cells (from either Th or PTh) than between thalamic and prethalamic cells. The gene expression changes that Pax6 deletion introduced within cortex were substantially different from those in the diencephalic tissues.</p>
<p id="p0235">We found that whereas Pax6 regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation in all three forebrain regions, it affects this process in opposite directions in cortex versus diencephalon. When we tested possible mechanisms to explain this, we found that the presence of Foxg1 in the cortex is a major factor. In vertebrates, the presence of Foxg1 protein is a hallmark of telencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumamoto and Hanashima, 2017</xref>), the anteriormost part of the developing forebrain, which gives rise to the cerebral cortex dorsally and basal ganglia ventrally. Its expression is restricted to the telencephalic anlage in the anterior neural plate as this region folds, closes, and expands. It is present in the nuclei of telencephalic progenitors and affects their proliferation, maintaining a normal rate of cell cycle progression and preventing their exit from the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martynoga et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xuan et al., 1995</xref>). Its ability to bind DNA is required for it to keep progenitors in a proliferative state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanashima et al., 2002</xref>). This requirement is cell autonomous, as evidenced by our previous work on the cortex of <italic>Foxg1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>;<italic>Foxg1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> chimeras showing that abnormalities of proliferation occur in <italic>Foxg1</italic>-null cells even if they are surrounded by wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manuel et al., 2011</xref>). Foxg1 is highly conserved not only in vertebrates but also in invertebrates that lack a telencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bredenkamp et al., 2007</xref>). In invertebrates, Foxg1 or its homologs are expressed in, and have an instructive role in the development of, cells situated anteriorly in the developing nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grossniklaus et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pani et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Toresson et al., 1998</xref>). It is likely that the acquisition of Foxg1 by anterior neural tissue has been an important driver of this region's evolutionary expansion.</p>
<p id="p0240">Like Foxg1, Pax6 is highly conserved across the animal kingdom and is essential for normal anterior neural development in both invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Manuel et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>). Unlike Foxg1, however, Pax6 promotes exit from the cell cycle in the mammalian cerebral cortex. On the face of it, this seems paradoxical because it would limit the production of progenitors and hence, ultimately, the numbers of neurons in a structure, one of whose major defining features is its rapid evolutionary expansion. It is conceivable that Pax6 actually evolved as a promoter of cell cycle re-entry, a feature that it demonstrates in the diencephalon, but that the superimposition of Foxg1 expression in the telencephalon has had the effect of reversing this activity. In a context where Foxg1 is generating a powerful drive to cell cycle re-entry, Pax6, although possessing the potential to promote proliferation, might have become a brake to Foxg1's drive, preventing the counterproductive retention of large numbers of cells in a progenitor state.</p>
<p id="p0245">More broadly, the effects of the transcription factor Pax6 on the cell cycle are far from clear. For example, its role in different tumor cell types is contradictory. It has been shown to have both oncogenic and tumor suppressor effect depending on the tissue affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hegge et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Muratovska et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>). Here we show one mechanism by which this versatile transcription factor can control the cell cycle in opposite ways, depending on the presence or absence of another important transcription factor. This might be important for determining the nature of Pax6's role in different tumor types.</p>
<p id="p0250">How the expression of Foxg1 leads to a reversal of Pax6's actions on proliferation is likely to be complex, with some or all of a number of possible mechanisms operating. Pax6 and Foxg1 might converge directly on the same downstream cell cycle genes to regulate their expression. For example, ChIP-seq studies on Pax6 and Foxg1 have shown that both transcription factors can bind genomic regions likely to regulate the expression of cell cycle regulators including <italic>Ccnd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulstrode et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). In the absence of Foxg1, Pax6 binding might activate expression of genes such as <italic>Ccnd1</italic> that promote cell cycle re-entry. Pax6 binding might have an opposite effect if Foxg1 is present because Pax6 binding, although pro-proliferative, might interfere with a potentially more powerful pro-proliferative effect of Foxg1 binding, resulting in an inhibition of cell cycle re-entry. In other words, removal of Pax6 might allow Foxg1 freer rein to drive proliferation. This could occur through direct competition between Pax6 and Foxg1 for binding, a phenomenon observed in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hong and Wu, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ilsley et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ngondo-Mbongo et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Norton et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wan et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zabet and Adryan, 2013</xref>). Another possibility is that, in common with other Fox transcription factors, Foxg1 might be a chromatin remodeling (or pioneer) transcription factor that opens the chromatin to allow proteins such as Pax6 to access sites that they would not otherwise be able to bind, thereby changing its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Golson and Kaestner, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iwafuchi-Doi and Zaret, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Magnani et al., 2011</xref>). Another possibility is that Foxg1 modifies Pax6's function by binding to it rather than to DNA.</p>
<p id="p0255">Although <italic>Ccnd1</italic> emerges as a clear example of a gene that may explain the context-dependent role of Pax6, it is likely to be just one of a cohort of genes that act as effectors of Pax6 and Foxg1. Genes showing opposite regulation in cortex versus diencephalon and opposite regulation in cortex after Foxg1 versus Pax6 loss, such as <italic>Chek1</italic> or <italic>Ccnc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>B), could represent good candidates. Fgfr1 emerges as a powerful contender to be directly co-regulated by both transcription factors because ChIP-seq data show it has overlapping peaks for Pax6 and Foxg1 binding in an intronic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulstrode et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sun et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p id="p0260">Pax6 and Foxg1 might not converge directly on the same downstream cell cycle genes, rather they might act on progenitors independently through separate routes. Our data indicate that there are many more differences than similarities in the genes regulated by Pax6 and Foxg1, with both regulating many other transcription factors that have actions on progenitor proliferation. It is possible that these Pax6-and Foxg1-regulated transcription factors then control the activity of more direct cell cycle regulators. Indeed, given the breadth of Pax6's and Foxg1's actions, it seems likely that multiple mechanisms will need to be invoked to explain how Pax6 affects the balance of proliferation and differentiation in opposite directions in cortex and diencephalon. In the future, it would be interesting to assess the interplay between Pax6 and Foxg1 by co-misexpression experiments, for example, in neural stem cell culture or by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation.</p>
<p id="p0265">One possibility we considered was that regional variation in an attribute of Pax6 itself, such as its expression level or its exon usage, might cause it to operate differently in the cortex and diencephalon. Variation in Pax6's level and the ratio between its two major splice variants, Pax6 and Pax6(5a), can modify its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chauhan et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haubst et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manuel et al., 2006</xref>). We found, however, that regional variation in levels of Pax6 protein and in the ratio between exon 5/5a usage did not correlate in a straightforward way with the effects of Pax6 on the balance of proliferation versus differentiation. Previous work has shown that both Pax6 and its rarer variant Pax6(5a) can suppress proliferation and that the level of suppression is dose dependent across the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haubst et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manuel et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mi et al., 2013</xref>). Levels of Pax6 are, however, very high in PTh, where our new evidence indicates that Pax6 promotes proliferation, an effect that is shared with neighboring Th, where Pax6 levels are relatively low. It is unclear how the ∼2-fold difference in exon 5/5a usage between ACtx and PTh, but not between ACtx and Th, might contribute to the opposite effects of Pax6 on proliferation in ACtx versus both PTh and Th. It is conceivable that the actions of the two forms might oppose each other in the context of prethalamic cells and that higher levels of Pax6 relative to Pax6(5a) in PTh might promote proliferation in this region, but at present there is no evidence for or against this possibility.</p>
<p id="p0270">We also considered the possibility that a differential effect on canonical Wnt signaling might contribute. In eye development, Pax6 directly and positively regulates the expression of Wnt inhibitors, such as <italic>Sfrp1</italic>, <italic>Sfrp2,</italic> and <italic>Dkk1</italic>, thereby suppressing canonical Wnt signaling, with absence of Pax6 leading to aberrant canonical Wnt activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Machon et al., 2010</xref>). In the forebrain, our results indicated that Pax6 loss caused significant upregulation of canonical Wnt signaling (indicated by increased <italic>Lef1</italic> and <italic>Axin2</italic> expression) in diencephalic structures but not in the cortex. It appears that Pax6's effects on canonical Wnt signaling are largely restricted to the diencephalon, where many are striking, such as the almost complete loss of the Wnt antagonist <italic>Sfrp2</italic> from PTh progenitors. Although these changes would likely affect the behaviors of diencephalic progenitors, previous studies would predict increased canonical Wnt signaling to promote proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stolz and Bastians, 2015</xref>), whereas we observed the opposite following Pax6 loss from Th and PTh. It seems very likely that multiple synergistic and antagonistic factors combine to generate the tissue specificity of Pax6's net cellular effects, but we need a much better understanding of how contributing factors act and interact in the different contexts presented by different brain regions.</p>
<p id="p0275">In conclusion, we have discovered that Pax6 has opposite molecular and cellular effects on the balance of proliferation and differentiation in two major forebrain regions, the cortex and diencephalon. We provide evidence that a major reason for these differences is the presence of Foxg1 in cortical cells, which reverses the cortical actions of Pax6 so that they occur in the same direction as in the diencephalon.</p>

We know the cortex, and probably the Th, contain at least two main classes of progenitors (apical and basal) with different functions and dynamics. With our tools, we could not discern between these two types of progenitor pools. In the future it would be very interesting to use <italic>in vivo</italic> cell imaging or single-cell transcriptomics to tackle this matter.</p>
