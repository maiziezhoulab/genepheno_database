<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most prevalent inherited intellectual disability, resulting from a loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Patients with FXS suffer lifelong cognitive disabilities, but the function of FMRP in the adult brain and the mechanism underlying age-related cognitive decline in FXS is not fully understood. Here, we report that a loss of FMRP results in increased protein synthesis of histone acetyltransferase EP300 and ubiquitination-mediated degradation of histone deacetylase HDAC1 in adult hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs). Consequently, FMRP-deficient NSCs exhibit elevated histone acetylation and age-related NSC depletion, leading to cognitive impairment in mature adult mice. Reducing histone acetylation rescues both neurogenesis and cognitive deficits in mature adult FMRP-deficient mice. Our work reveals a role for FMRP and histone acetylation in cognition and presents a potential novel therapeutic strategy for treating adult FXS patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Fragile X syndrome (FXS), resulting from CGG expansion in the fragile X mental retardation (<italic>FMR1</italic>) gene and functional loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), is the most prevalent single gene cause of autism and heritable developmental disability, affecting 1 in 4000 males and 1 in 6000 females worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. FMRP is a brain-enriched RNA-binding protein and plays a critical role in learning and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Extensive efforts have been devoted to the understanding of the function of FMRP in neurons, which led to a number of therapeutic targets and clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, the outcomes have been disappointing, and no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatment is available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. More importantly, although FXS is categorized as a neurodevelopmental disorder, FXS patients have a normal lifespan, and their neurological symptoms and cognitive deficits persist throughout their adult life into old age. However, nearly all FXS research has focused on developing and young adult brains. The role of FMRP in cognitive maintenance in mature and older adults remains unexplored. Therefore, identifying novel mechanisms underlying FMRP regulation of brain function, especially those relevant to mature adult brain functions, is important for both a complete understanding of FMRP function in the brain and for developing effective treatments.</p>
<p id="Par4">Extensive evidence from animal and human studies support potentially important roles of hippocampal neurogenesis for information processing, acquisition of new memories, and behavioral adaptations to the ever-changing environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Neurogenesis is altered in a number of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, strategies targeting adult neurogenesis have been proposed as potential therapies for treating human brain disorders with cognitive dysfunctions; however, such treatment remains absent. Hippocampal neurogenesis requires a permanent pool of neural stem cells (NSCs) that exist in a balanced state of quiescence versus activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Abnormally elevated NSC activation leads to exhaustion of the NSC pool over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. It has been shown that hippocampal neurogenesis in the rodent declines with age, and much of this decline is a result of reduction in the number of NSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Recently, age-dependent decline in adult new neuron production has also been shown in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Therefore, restoring the NSC pool might be a sound strategy for enhancing neurogenesis and cognitive functions in older adults with cognitive deficits. We have shown that FMRP deficiency leads to aberrant adult NSC activation and cognitive deficits in young adult mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>; however its impact on the adult NSC pool and cognitive maintenance in mature adult brains remains unexplored.</p>
<p id="Par5">Acetylation of histone H3 and H4, controlled by balancing the activity of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), is one of the key epigenetic modifications controlling gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Both HATs and HDACs are critical for brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and altered histone acetylation has been found in embryonic cortical neurons lacking FMRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In adult brains, histone acetylation also has important roles in brain plasticity and cognitive functions, and abnormal histone acetylation profiles are associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders, including aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, whether abnormal histone modifications contribute to cognitive deficits seen in FXS patients remains unknown.</p>
<p id="Par6">Here, we showed that a loss of FMRP led to depletion of hippocampal NSCs and age-related cognitive impairment. We showed that the loss of FMRP resulted in elevated protein synthesis of histone acetyltransferase EP300 and downregulation of histone deacetylase HDAC1 through ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Both elevated EP300 and reduced HDAC1 resulted in abnormally high levels of histone H3 and H4 acetylation. Rebalancing histone acetylation by either reducing EP300 activities or enhancing HDAC1 levels rescued both neurogenic and cognitive deficits in fragile X syndrome mice. Our data reveal a previously unknown role for FMRP and balanced histone acetylation in maintaining the NSC pool and adult cognitive ability and present new therapeutic targets for treating FXS.</p>

<title>FMRP deficiency leads to the depletion of NSCs in mature adults</title>
<p id="Par7">We have previously found that 2-month-old (young adult) <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) mice have increased NSC activation in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, which is coupled to reduced neuronal differentiation, overall reduction in neurogenesis, and cognitive impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Since high levels of NSC activation may lead to NSC depletion in the adult brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>; we investigated whether FMRP is important in maintaining the NSC pool in adult mice. Because adult hippocampal neurogenesis declines from 2 to 6 months of age in mice, which is associated with reduction of cognitive abilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, we decided to assess NSC maintenance in 6-month-old (6-mo) mature adult mice. We used <italic>Fmr1</italic> mutant (KO) mice crossed with <italic>Nestin</italic> promoter-driven green fluorescent protein (<italic>Nes</italic>-GFP) transgenic mice in which GFP was expressed in both NSCs and intermediate progenitors (IPCs) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a, b</xref>). We found that 6-mo <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice had a decreased number (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>) and density (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>) of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the DG compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates, without significant changes in the overall volume of the DG (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). We next analyzed different populations of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the subgranular zone. <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice had 40.8% fewer type 1 radial glia-like NSCs (GFP<sup>+</sup>GFAP<sup>+</sup>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b, e</xref>) and 63.9% fewer IPCs (TBR2+ or GFP+ GFAP−) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1c–e</xref>) compared to their WT littermates. Using MCM2 as a marker for cell cycle initiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>), we found that the proportion of activated NSCs (GFP<sup>+</sup>GFAP<sup>+</sup>MCM2<sup>+</sup>) was significantly lower in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice compared with age-matched WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref>). <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO also had reduced proliferation (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) in both NSCs and IPCs when compared to WT mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1f–h</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>FMRP deficiency leads to hippocampal NSC depletion in mature adult mice. <bold>a</bold> Sample confocal images of brain sections from 6-month-old <italic>WT;Nes-GFP</italic> and <italic>Fmr1 KO;Nes-GFP</italic> mice.

<p id="Par8">To determine whether NSC depletion was due to FMRP intrinsic regulation of NSCs, we crossed <italic>Fmr1</italic>-floxed (<italic>cKO</italic>) mice with inducible <italic>Nestin</italic> promoter (<italic>Nes</italic>)-driven Cre transgenic mice (<italic>Nes-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>) and <italic>Rosa26-STOP-tdTomato</italic> (<italic>Ai14</italic>) reporter mice to create triple transgenic mice (<italic>Nes-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup><italic>;cKO;Ai14</italic>, simplified as <italic>Cre;cKO;Ai14</italic>) and control littermates (<italic>Cre;Ai14</italic>) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>). Tamoxifen injections of 2-month-old mice leads to targeted deletion of FMRP and selective expression of tdTomato (tdT) specifically in adult NSCs and their subsequent progenies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g, h</xref>). We found that at 4 months post tamoxifen injection, 6-month-old <italic>Cre;cKO;Ai14</italic> mice had significantly fewer number (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1i</xref>) and lower density (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1j</xref>) of tdT+ cells, fewer NSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1k</xref>), and lower proportion of activated NSCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1l</xref>) compared to control <italic>Cre;Ai14</italic> mice without significant changes in the overall volume of the DG (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2b</xref>). Thus, in contrast to our previous finding that FMRP deficiency led to increased NSC activation in 2-month-old (young adult) FMRP-deficient mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, a loss of FMRP leads to depletion of NSCs and decreased NSC activation when mice reach 6 months of age (mid-age). These results suggest that FMRP plays a critical role in the maintenance of NSCs in the adult hippocampus.</p>

<title>FMRP controls EP300 protein synthesis</title>
<p id="Par9">To explore the molecular mechanism underlying NSC depletion in FMRP-deficient mice, we assessed NPCs isolated from the DG of 6-mo <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO and littermate control mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>) and found that 6-mo <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO NPCs exhibited decreased proliferation and decreased neuronal differentiation compared with WT NPCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a–d</xref>), which is consistent with our in vivo observations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). We then used these 6-mo NPCs to investigate the mechanism underlying FMRP regulation of NSC maintenance in mature adult mice. Among the predicted FMRP targets in dividing cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, MDM2 and EP300 are ranked as the top 1 and 2 regulators for NSC activation and maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. We found that although the levels of both MDM2 and activated MDM2 (phosphorylated- or P-MDM2) were elevated in 6-mo <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO NPCs compared to WT cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3b–d</xref>), the levels of the canonical target of MDM2, P53, exhibited no significant difference (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3e, f</xref>). On the other hand, EP300 protein levels were significantly elevated in 6-mo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e–g</xref>) Fmr1 KO NPCs. The elevated EP300 was not found in either hippocampal and cortical tissues dissected from 6-mo <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3g, h</xref>) or in NPCs isolated from the DG of 2-mo <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3i, j</xref>).

<p id="Par10">To determine whether FMRP directly regulates EP300, we performed RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation and identification of co-precipitated RNA (RNA-IP) with an FMRP antibody coupled with real-time PCR analysis.

<title>FMRP maintains HDAC1 protein levels in NPCs</title>
<p id="Par12">We next investigated whether elevated MDM2 and P-MDM2 could also affect histone acetylation levels in 6-mo NPCs. Since the levels of P53, the canonical target of MDM2, did not change in 6-mo <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO NPCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>), we searched for other potential candidate MDM2 targets that may regulate NSC activation and maintenance. We compared a list of 335 “Neurogenic Regulators” we have curated previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> to a list of 31 proteins that are either downstream targets or cooperating proteins of MDM2 based on literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We identified a set of 17 common factors which represented candidates mediating MDM2 regulation of NSC activation. Candidates were ranked by the number of literature-supported interactions with neurogenic regulators, reflecting the likelihood of their involvement in NPC activity. Among them, EP300, NUMB, XIAP, CBP, and HDAC1 were the top 5, while P53 was ranked number 6 (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). We found that neither mRNA levels nor protein levels of NUMB, XIAP, and CBP exhibited differences in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO NPCs.

<p id="Par13">Next, we determined whether FMRP directly regulates HDAC1. We found that FMRP was not associated with <italic>Hdac1</italic> mRNA but was associated with <italic>Mdm2</italic> mRNA (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4b, c</xref>) in NPCs. Indeed, FMRP repressed MDM2 protein synthesis as assessed by BONCAT assay (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5c, d</xref>). Since MDM2 catalyzes ubiquitination and degradation of HDAC1 in other cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> and HDAC1 protein levels were significantly reduced in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO NPCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>), we investigated whether HDAC1 downregulation in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO NPCs was a result of elevated MDM2 levels. We first assessed protein stability of HDAC1 in NPCs in the presence of cycloheximide to block protein synthesis. Indeed, HDAC1 protein levels decreased significantly faster in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO NPCs compared to WT NPCs during an 8 h culturing period (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c, d</xref>). Next, using co-immunoprecipitation followed by western blotting analysis, we confirmed that endogenous MDM2 physically interacted with endogenous HDAC1 in NPCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e, f</xref>). To determine whether MDM2 catalyzes ubiquitination of HDAC1 in NPCs, we acutely knocked down MDM2 using lentivirus small hairpin RNA (shRNA; s<italic>hMdm2</italic>) in WT NPCs and collected protein lysate in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor (MG132) to preserve ubiquitinated proteins. We then pulled down total ubiquitinated proteins from the same amount of WT or KO NPC protein lysate using the same amount of purified glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST)-tagged four concatenated ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and then assessed the levels of ubiquitinated HDAC1 in the pull-down samples using western blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3g</xref>). We found that NPCs with MDM2 knockdown (<italic>shMdm2</italic>) had reduced ubiquitination of HDAC1 compared to NPCs treated with control (<italic>shNC</italic>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3h</xref>), while global ubiquitination remained the same (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). These results suggest that MDM2 mediates ubiquitination and degradation of HDAC1 in NPCs, and that elevated MDM2 is likely the reason why HDAC1 levels are downregulated in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO NPCs. Therefore, these results indicate that FMRP maintains the balance of histone acetylation by regulating both EP300 and HDAC1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3i</xref>).</p>

<p id="Par14">We next determined whether rebalancing histone acetylation might correct deficits of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO NPCs.

Curcumin, a natural product and food color, has been evaluated extensively for its therapeutic potential and mechanism of action in human cancers and neurodegenerative disease, and is currently in a number of clinical trials including Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov">https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>).

Based on literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and pilot experiments, we selected the dosages for curcumin or C646 that exhibit minimal or no effect on WT cells. We found that both curcumin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a–e</xref>) and C646 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10a–e</xref>) treatment reduced acetylation of histone H3 and H4 in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO NPCs to levels similar to those in WT NPCs, with no significant effect on WT NPCs. We then determined whether they could rescue neurogenic deficits of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO NPCs. Indeed, both curcumin and C646 treatment enhanced proliferation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4f, g</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10f, g</xref>) and neuronal differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4h, i</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10h, i</xref>) of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO NPCs without affecting WT NPCs.

<title>Rebalancing histone acetylation rescues neurogenesis of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice</title>
<p id="Par16">We next investigated whether rebalancing histone acetylation could rescue the neurogenic deficits in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. We decided to use curcumin instead of C646 to inhibit EP300 in vivo, because curcumin is already undergoing clinical trials for a large number of diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In addition, curcumin is isolated from plants instead of being chemically synthesized, and therefore represents a potentially safe and low-cost option for future treatment. We also included a group of animals treated with Nutlin-3 as another way to rebalance histone acetylation through enhancing HDAC1. For this, we used a low-dosage Nutlin-3 treatment scheme we developed previously for young adult mice (10× lower dosage than used in cancer treatment)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that both curcumin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> and Nutlin-3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> cross mouse blood–brain barrier within 60 min when given peripherally. Consistent with literature, we detected both curcumin (2.12 ng g<sup>−1</sup> tissue) and Nutlin-3 (1297.03 ng g<sup>−1</sup> tissue) at 60 min after a single injection at the dosage we planned to use (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>). Subsequently, we treated mice with either of these compounds at 5 months of age, when neurogenesis is actively declining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. We found that both curcumin and Nutlin-3 treatment reduced acetylation of histone H3 in Nestin-expressing cells to WT levels with no significant effect on WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a–d</xref>). When analyzed at 1 day after curcumin or Nutlin-3 treatment, NSC activation in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice was rescued to WT levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6e–h</xref>). In order to assess the fate of these NSCs, another cohort of mice received both chemical (curcumin or Nutlin-3) treatment and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) injections to label dividing neural progenitors, which were analyzed at 4 weeks after the last treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6i</xref>).

<title>Rebalancing histone acetylation rescues cognition of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice</title>
<p id="Par17">It has been shown that age-dependent neurogenic decline is accompanied by age-associated decreases in spatial learning and memory in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. We therefore investigated whether rescuing adult neurogenesis is associated with restoring cognitive functions in mature adult <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. Because NeuN-positive neurons in the DG and the cortex of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice also exhibited elevated H3 acetylation compared to those in the WT mice, which could be corrected by curcumin or Nutlin-3 treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>), we decided to assess whether curcumin or Nutlin-3 treatment requires adult neurogenesis. We therefore treated some of the mice with temozolomide (TMZ), a DNA alkylating agent that has been used successfully to inhibit adult neurogenesis without significant effects on overall animal health and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. We treated 5-month-old <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice and their WT littermates with TMZ prior to and during curcumin or Nutlin-3 treatment and assessed their cognitive functions using novel location test (NLT) and object recognition test (NOR) 4 weeks after the last treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>). Curcumin, Nutlin-3, or TMZ treatments had no significant effect on overall health, locomotor activity, or anxiety (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>). <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice exhibited both impaired spatial learning in NLT and defective learning in a NOR compared to WT littermate control mice as shown in both reduced discrimination index and reduced percentage exploration time of the novel location/object (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>). Curcumin and Nutlin-3 treatments rescued deficits of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice in both NLT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b–h</xref>) and NOR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7i–o</xref>), while neither treatment affected WT mice. We found that inhibition of adult neurogenesis by TMZ abolished the rescue effect of both curcumin and Nutlin-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b–o</xref>). Therefore, the rescue effects of Nutlin-3 or curcumin require adult neurogenesis. To validate the results of TMZ, we created transgenic mice (<italic>Nes-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup><italic>;Fmr1-KO;Mdm2</italic><sup><italic>f/w</italic></sup>) that, upon tamoxifen injections, led to heterozygote deletion of <italic>Mdm2</italic> gene specifically in adult NESTIN-expressing NSCs and their progenies in <italic>Fmr1 KO</italic> mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">17a, b</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par19">Although FXS is categorized as a neurodevelopmental disorder, FXS patients have a normal lifespan, and their neurological symptoms and cognitive deficits persist throughout adult life into old age. However, most research and interventions have been focused on developing and young adult brains. In addition, although many FMRP candidate targets have been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, few have been validated for their biological functions, let alone therapeutic targets. We unveil a novel function of FMRP in balancing histone acetylation through the regulation of both histone acetylation and deacetylation pathways. We show that rebalancing histone acetylation using clinical trial compounds, particularly curcumin, rescues the cognitive functions of FXS mice. These exciting results represent a novel treatment strategy for FXS, especially for mature adult individuals with FXS.</p>
<p id="Par20">Histone acetylation plays important roles in chromatin structure and gene regulation. Altered histone acetylation has been found in a number of diseases, including both psychiatric disorders and neurological disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We found that FMRP deficiency led to elevated histone H3 and H4 acetylation in NPCs and neurons, which is consistent with a recent finding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Histone acetylation is controlled by balanced activity of histone acetyltransferases (e.g. EP300) and HDACs. Interestingly, our data show that a lack of functional FMRP leads to both elevated EP300 and reduced HDAC1 in NPCs, which significantly tilted the balance of histone acetylation. Both EP300 and HDAC1 seem to play important roles in adult brain plasticity and cognitive functions. Although forebrain-specific deletion of EP300 impairs memory formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, elevated EP300 has been associated with impaired memory and inhibition of EP300 restores memory formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In addition, EP300 activates transcription of P16, a CDK4/6 inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> which exhibited increased levels in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO NPCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). Elevated P16 levels can lead to cell cycle arrest and neurogenesis decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and are associated with aging and cognitive impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Among the large number of HDACs in mammals, HDAC1 is expressed highly in NSCs and plays an important role in maintaining NSC self-renewal during brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Acute knockdown of HDAC1 in adult hippocampus also leads to impaired contextual fear memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. The age-dependent decline of the HDAC1-containing NuRD complex has been associated with cognitive decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In the absence of FMRP, a combination of elevated EP300 and reduced HDAC1 lead to drastic increase in histone acetylation in NPCs, which can have significant impact on gene expression. Although we did not observe altered EP300 or HDAC1 in hippocampal and cortical neurons of 6-mo <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, we did find elevated H3 acetylation in DG and cortical neurons in 6-mo <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, which could result from alteration of other epigenetic regulators as demonstrated recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The postmortem hippocampal tissues from two patients with FXS also exhibited higher histone acetylation levels compared to those from age- and gender-matched healthy controls (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">18</xref>), suggesting that elevated histone acetylation might be a hallmark of FMRP deficiency. A comparison of mRNAs that are dysregulated in NPCs differentiated from human FXS patient-derived pluripotent stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> and genes bound by acetyl-histone H3 in mouse cortex (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR000CDD/">https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR000CDD/</ext-link>) show a significant overlap (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>). Our discovery of elevated histone acetylation in FXS opens up new possibilities for drug repurposing by targeting enzymes controlling histone acetylation.</p>
<p id="Par21">As an EP300 inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, curcumin is able to reverse impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition in animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Since our goal was to correct NSC activation and avoid potential side effects as much as possible, we chose a shortened injection period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> and a significantly lower (10–20×) dosage than what has been used previously to modulate neurogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. We found that a low dose of curcumin rebalanced histone acetylation and rescued neurogenic and cognitive deficits in adult FXS mice, which may extend the application of curcumin to the single-gene etiology of autism and provide a hope for FXS patients and their families by mitigating the high monetary- and time-related costs and risks of treating disease symptoms. Nutlin-3 is the prototype MDM2 inhibitor and has been used in clinical trials for cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. The fact that both curcumin and Nutlin-3 are effective for treating 6-mo mice suggests a potential therapeutic opportunity for mature adult and aging FXS patients, which are largely understudied. For treating brain disorders, a significantly lower dosage of Nutlin-3 and curcumin than those used for cancer treatment should be considered.</p>
<p id="Par22">Our studies characterize an important role of FMRP in cognitive maintenance in mid-age mature adults through preserving adult NSC pools, which has not been shown before. Our previous series of experiments showed that FMRP deficiency led to increased NSC activation through the MDM2–P53 pathway in 2-month-old (young adult) FMRP-deficient mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Here we show that a loss of FMRP leads to depletion of NSCs and decreased NSC activation when mice reach 6 months of age (mid-age). A remaining question is why these two populations of NSCs exhibit differential changes upon FMRP deficiency. It is possible that when the NSC population diminishes significantly, NSCs changes their responses to regulatory mechanisms. Another possibility is that NSCs have age-specific intrinsic regulatory programs, as demonstrated in both hematopoietic stem cells and NSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. An age-dependent decline of the NuRD complex (containing HDAC1) has been associated with cognitive decline, which can be rescued by expressing NuRD components in aged brains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. It is likely that FMRP deficiency exaggerated these age-dependent changes. Since 6 months of age in mice is roughly analogous to middle age in humans, we are not investigating the full extent of aging per se. It would be valuable to evaluate these animals at 12, 18, and 24 months of age. In our preliminary analysis of 6-mo and 12-mo mice, we found that adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice already reached low levels at 6 months, and it becomes difficult to discern any further differences between 6-mo and 12-mo mice. Therefore, we used 2-month and 6-month time points to study the temporal dynamics of NSC activity in the present study. When non-invasive methods become more readily available, it will be important to evaluate adult neurogenesis in aging and aged FXS and healthy human populations. In addition to P53 and HDAC1, MDM2 may target other proteins in an age-specific manner. However, a comprehensive analysis of MDM2 cofactors or targets have not been done in the nervous system, which we hope to initiate based on the present study. Our results underscore the importance of FMRP in cognitive maintenance in adult mammals, raising the question of FMRP function in aging populations.</p>
<p id="Par23">In summary, our data show that the clinical drugs can reverse the neurogenic and cognitive deficits of mature adult FXS mouse models through the rebalancing of histone acetylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig10">10</xref>). This observation not only provides a potential new treatment for adult FXS patients, but also for a broader range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. We did not observe significant changes in protein levels of HDAC1 or GSK3β in 6-mo <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO hippocampal or cortical tissues, with or without curcumin or Nutlin-3 treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">20</xref>). However, total protein levels do not reflect changes in activities. For example, elevated GSK3β activities, but not total protein levels, have been found in the DG but not the CA1 sub-regions of the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. In fact, GSK3β inhibitors can rescue cognitive deficit of Fmr1 KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. In addition, it remains possible that, when treated at young age especially juvenile period, curcumin and Nutlin-3 may still exert effects through targeting these molecules and through other cell types instead of adult new neurons, which may rescue adult neurogenesis-independent behavioral deficits found in juvenile mice, such as hyperactivity and social interaction, etc. Finally, FMRP is predicted to regulate a large number of targets and a number of treatments towards these targets may restore cognitive function in mouse models. There is likely a convergence of multiple pathways that can be manipulated by targeting each upstream component. A study of a shared downstream effector pathways should be performed for a better understanding of FMRP functions and therapeutic development.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Models for FMRP maintain histone acetylation through regulating both EP300 and HDAC1 expression levels, which impact adult neurogenesis and cognition</p></caption><graphic id="d29e2491" xlink:href="41467_2018_4869_Fig10_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>

<title>Real-time PCR assay</title>
<p id="Par32">Real-time PCR was performed using standard methods as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The first-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated by reverse transcription with Oligo (dT) primer (Roche). To quantify the mRNA levels using real-time PCR, aliquots of first-stranded cDNA were amplified with gene-specific primers and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad) using a Step-1 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The PCR reactions contained 1 μg of cDNA (except the cDNA for the IP, for which 5% of the cDNA was used for each gene examined), Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and 10 μM of forward and reverse primers in a final reaction volume of 20 μL. The mRNA level of different samples was calculated by the data analysis software built in with the 7300 Real-Time PCR System. For RIP-real-time PCR, cDNA from IP and input was used and IP samples were normalized to Input samples. The Sequences of primers are provided in Supplementary Methods.</p>

<title>Bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT)</title>
<p id="Par33">BONCAT experiment was carried out as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. NPCs were starved in conditional medium without Methionine for 1 h. Azidohomoalaine (AHA), an analog of Methionine, was added into NPCs and incorporated into nascent proteins for 2 h. Afterward, WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO NPCs were harvested using lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1% SDS) with 2× EDTA-Free protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche). The azide enables conjugation to beads for enrichment and purification.

<title>Novel location test</title>
<p id="Par38">This test measures spatial memory through an evaluation of the ability of mice to recognize the new location of a familiar object with respect to spatial cues. The experimental procedure was developed by the core facility of Waisman Center at UW-Madison, based on the description for a Novel Object exploration in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Mice were handled for approximately 5 min a day for a maximum of 5 days prior to the experiment. Testing consisted of five 6 min trials, with a 3 min intertrial interval between each trial. All procedures were conducted during the light cycle of the animal between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Before the trial session, mice were brought into testing room and were allowed to acclimate for at least 30 min. During the intertrial interval, the mouse was placed in a holding cage, which remained inside the testing room. In the first trial (Pre-Exposure), each mouse was placed individually into the center of the otherwise empty open arena (38.5 cm Long × 38.5 cm wide, and 25.5 cm high walls) for 6 min. For the next three trials (Sample Trials 1–3), two identical objects were placed equidistantly from the arena wall in the corners against the wall with the colored decal. Tape objects to the floor of the arena. Then, each mouse was placed individually into the center of the arena, and was allowed to explore for 6 min. At the end of the trial, the mouse was removed and returned to the home cages for 3 min. In the last trial (Test), one of the objects was moved to a novel location, and the mouse was allowed to explore the objects for 6 min, and the total time spent exploring each object was measured. During the test phase, exploration time was defined as any investigative behavior (i.e., head orientation, climbing on, sniffing occurring within &lt;1.0 cm) or other motivated direct contact occurring with each object. To control for possible odor cues, objects were cleaned with 70% ethanol solution at the end of each trial and the floor of the arena wiped down to eliminate possible scent/trail markers. During the test phase, two objects were wiped down prior to testing so that the objects would all have the same odor. Based on a study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>, the discrimination index was calculated as the percentage of time spent investigating the object in the new location minus the percentage of time spent investigating the object in the old location: discrimination index = (novel location exploration time/total exploration time × 100)−(old location exploration time/total exploration time × 100). A higher discrimination index is considered to reflect greater memory retention for the novel location object. All experiments were videotaped and scored by scientists who were blinded to experimental conditions to ensure accuracy.</p>

<title>Novel object recognition test</title>
<p id="Par39">This test is based on the natural propensity of rodents to preferentially explore novel objects over familiar ones. Mice were handled for approximately 5 min a day for a maximum of 5 days prior to the experiment. The experimental procedure was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> and was conducted during the light cycle of the animal between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Before the trial or test phase, mice were brought into testing room and were allowed to acclimate for at least 30 min. On the first day, mice were habituated for 10 min to the V-maze, made out of black Plexiglas with two corridors (30 cm long × 4.5 cm wide, and 15 cm high walls) set at a 90° angle, in which the task was performed. On the second day, mice were put back in the maze for 10 min, and two identical objects were presented. After 24 h, one of the familiar objects was replaced with a novel object, and the mice were again placed in the maze and were allowed to explore for 10 min, and the total time spent exploring each of the two objects (novel and familiar) was measured. During the test phase, the novel and familiar objects were wiped down prior to testing so that the objects would all have the same odor and exploration time was defined as the orientation of the nose to the object at a distance of less than 2 cm. The discrimination index was calculated as the difference between the percentages of time spent investigating the novel object and the time spent investigating the familiar objects: discrimination index = (novel object exploration time/total exploration time × 100)−(familiar object exploration time/total exploration time × 100). A higher discrimination index is considered to reflect greater memory retention for the novel object. All experiments were videotaped and scored by scientists who were blinded to experimental conditions to ensure accuracy</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p id="Par40">All experiments were randomized and blinded to scientists who performed quantification. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, unless specified, with the GraphPad Prism software. Two tailed and unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare two conditions. Two-way ANOVA was used for comparison among multiple experimental conditions. Tukey's post hoc test was used when comparing among each condition. For HDAC1 protein degradation assay, two-way ANOVA was used to evaluate protein decay rates. All data were shown as mean with standard error of mean (mean ± s.e.m). Probabilities of <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered as significant.</p>
