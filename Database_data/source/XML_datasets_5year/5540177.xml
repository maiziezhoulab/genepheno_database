<p id="P1">Human brain development involves complex interactions between different areas, including long distance neuronal migration or formation of major axonal tracts. 3D cerebral organoids allow the growth of diverse brain regions <italic>in vitro</italic>, but the random arrangement of regional identities limits the reliable analysis of complex phenotypes. Here, we describe a co-culture method combining various brain regions of choice within one organoid tissue. By fusing organoids specified toward dorsal and ventral forebrain, we generate a dorsal-ventral axis. Using fluorescent reporters, we demonstrate robust directional GABAergic interneuron migration from ventral into dorsal forebrain. We describe methodology for time-lapse imaging of human interneuron migration that is inhibited by the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100. Our results demonstrate that cerebral organoid fusion cultures can model complex interactions between different brain regions. Combined with reprogramming technology, fusions offer the possibility to analyze complex neurodevelopmental defects using cells from neurological disease patients, and to test potential therapeutic compounds.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P2">The cerebral cortex contains two main populations of neurons, excitatory glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, and inhibitory γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) producing interneurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>. Excitatory cortical neurons are predominantly generated by dorsal forebrain progenitors, while inhibitory GABAergic cortical interneurons are generated by ventral forebrain progenitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>. To integrate into cortical circuits, interneurons perform a long-distance migration from their ventral origin into their target dorsal cortical regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>. This long-range tangential migration is controlled by many signaling pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, and studies using animal models indicate that mutations in some neurological disease-associated genes can disrupt interneuron migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>. However, the relationship between patient-specific mutations and human brain development remains enigmatic without suitable experimental human model systems.</p>
<p id="P3">Three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture technology allows the development of complex, organ-like tissues reminiscent of <italic>in vivo</italic> development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>. Importantly, cerebral organoids recapitulate many aspects of embryonic cortical development including the generation of diverse cell types corresponding to different brain regional identities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>. For instance, cerebral organoids can produce dorsal and ventral forebrain progenitors that generate excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>. Moreover, cerebral organoids can be generated from human patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), and used for functional genomic studies of neurological disorders such as microcephaly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> and Autism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>. Therefore, cerebral organoids represent an exemplary experimental system to study the role of neurological disease-associated genes in brain development.</p>
<p id="P4">In the current study, we focused on expanding the cerebral organoid model system by enhancing the phenotypic analyses to include neuronal migration. We developed an organoid co-culture “fusion” paradigm to successfully combine independently patterned organoids into a single tissue. Using this approach, we recreated the dorsal-ventral forebrain axis, and by labeling one organoid with a fluorescent reporter, we observed robust migration of cells between fused organoids. The molecular taxonomy and migratory dynamics of these cells resembles that of cortical interneurons. Therefore, we developed an organoid fusion assay that allows analysis of human cortical interneuron migration. This technology enhances the repertoire of phenotypic assays available for cerebral organoids, and in turn the complexity of phenotypes that can be used to study the developmental cell biology of human neurological diseases.</p>

<title>Drug-patterning of cerebral organoids enhances the production of ventral forebrain identity</title>
<p id="P5">The cerebral organoid method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> is capable of producing many different brain regions, including dorsal and ventral forebrain. As it relies on intrinsic patterning, however, the production of some regions is variable and infrequent, especially more ventral (NKX2-1<sup>+</sup>) interneuron progenitor regions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>. To increase the consistency and yield of ventral-forebrain interneuron progenitor regions, we modified the organoid protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> to include a ventral drug-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Based on previous 2D-neuronal differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> protocols and recent 3D protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, we utilized a combination of WNT-inhibition and enhanced SHH signaling to promote a rostro-ventral forebrain identity. qPCR analysis of the ventral organoids revealed a significant increase in expression of the forebrain marker FOXG1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The dorsal forebrain marker TBR1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> became undetectable, while the ventral forebrain marker DLX2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> was dramatically increased in ventral organoids compared to control organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). To further confirm the successful ventralization of cerebral organoid tissue, we examined the expression of specific markers of ventral forebrain ganglionic eminence (GE) subregions that produce interneurons of different subtypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>. GSX2 is expressed in the dorsal-lateral GE (LGE) and caudal GE (CGE), NKX2-1 is expressed in the ventral-medial GE (MGE), while LHX6 is expressed in a subregion of the MGE producing more ventral-derived MGE (vMGE) interneurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). GSX2 was expressed in control organoids, but further increased in ventral organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Expression of NKX2-1 and LHX6 was undetectable in control organoids, but largely increased in ventral organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, immunostaining confirmed the qPCR results indicating widespread expression of FOXG1 in control and ventral organoids, but only ventral organoids expressed the ventral forebrain marker NKX2-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Ventral organoids also highly expressed the ventral markers DLX2 and GSX2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1E-F</xref>). Intriguingly, control organoids widely expressed dorsal forebrain markers for both progenitors (PAX6)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> and early born neurons (TBR1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Therefore rather than referring to these organoids as “control,” we refer to them as “dorsal<sup>Unt</sup>” to accurately depict their dorsal patterning while also conveying the reliance on an intrinsic (untreated) patterning protocol. In contrast, ventral organoids contained only small regions of PAX6<sup>+</sup> or TBR1<sup>+</sup> tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Additionally, we quantified the percentage of ventricular-zone (VZ) like progenitor regions expressing various dorsal and ventral markers in dorsal<sup>Unt</sup> and ventral organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). In both dorsal<sup>Unt</sup> and ventral organoids the number of FOXG1<sup>+</sup> VZ-like regions were similar. The dorsal<sup>Unt</sup> organoids were nearly all dorsal tissue (96% TBR1<sup>+</sup>, and 76% PAX6<sup>+</sup>) with only small amounts of ventral tissue (0% NKX2-1<sup>+</sup>, 5% DLX2<sup>+</sup>, and 6% GSX2<sup>+</sup>). In contrast, the ventral organoid progenitor regions were highly positive for ventral markers (73% NKX2-1<sup>+</sup>, 97% DLX2<sup>+</sup>, and 100% GSX2<sup>+</sup>). Therefore, these results confirm the successful production of ventral cerebral organoids at the expense of dorsal tissue upon ventral drug-treatment.</p>

<title>Fused cerebral organoids recapitulate a dorsal-ventral forebrain axis and long-distance cell migration</title>
<p id="P6">To recreate a dorsal-ventral identity axis in a single tissue, we developed an organoid co-culture method, which we termed organoid “fusion”. Dorsal<sup>Unt</sup> organoids produced mostly dorsal forebrain tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C,E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). However, inhibition of SHH activity with the smoothened receptor inhibitor cyclopamine A (CycA) can enhance dorsal forebrain identity in 2D neuronal differentiation from hPSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>. Therefore, to support dorsal identity, organoids were treated with CycA during the neural induction step of the cerebral organoid protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), and we refer to these organoids as “dorsal<sup>CycA</sup>.” In this approach, embryoid bodies (EBs) are individually patterned into either dorsal-(CycA) or ventral (IWP2+SAG) forebrain organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). After patterning treatments, a ventral and a dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> EB are embedded together within a single Matrigel droplet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), and over time the organoids grow together and become fused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The successful fusion of organoids occurred in more than 90% of attempts, therefore the fusion process is highly efficient. The structural organization of organoid fusion tissue was not affected by the fusion procedure with ventricular zone (VZ) like regions present in fusions around 45 and 60 days old. Fewer VZ-like regions were observed in 80 day old organoid fusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>), as occurs in the normal organoid protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. Immunostaining of fused ventral:: dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> organoids revealed the production of a continuous tissue where one side was highly positive for the ventral marker NKX2-1, while the opposite side was positive for the dorsal marker TBR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, the organoid fusion method allows dorsal and ventral forebrain regions to be juxtaposed in an arrangement similar to that occurring during brain development.</p>
<p id="P7">To test whether cells could migrate between the fused organoids, we used cell lines containing either a ubiquitous GFP or tdTomato reporter to create ventral/GFP<sup>+</sup>::dorsal<sup>CycA</sup>/tdTomato<sup>+</sup> organoid fusions. Many GFP<sup>+</sup> cells from the ventral organoid were observed within the tdTomato<sup>+</sup>/GFP<sup>-</sup> dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> organoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, very few tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells were observed migrating from the dorsal to ventral organoid tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Therefore, this data indicates a robust population of migrating cells that migrate in a ventral to dorsal direction. We next analyzed the time course of the ventral to dorsal migration using organoid fusions of different ages. Migrating cells were observed in small numbers around day 30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Their density drastically increased from day 30 to 46, but we did not observe a significant increase from day 46 to 80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Since organoids increase in size with age, the absolute numbers of migrated cells must increase over time to maintain a similar density. Alternatively, increased proliferation of the migrating cells could explain their increased cell density over time. To test this possibility, we examined the expression of a proliferating cell marker (Ki67) by the migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), and we observed that few (≤1%) of the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressed Ki67 at either day 46 or 80 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). Therefore, the migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cells are largely postmitotic. Moreover, the cells appeared more dispersed throughout the dorsal regions in 80 day old organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Therefore, based on these results, we focused our future analysis on organoids older than 60 days.</p>

<title>Mixing the tissue components of cerebral organoid fusions indicates directed ventral-to-dorsal cortical cell migration</title>
<p id="P8">During <italic>in vivo</italic> brain development, GABAergic interneurons originate in ventral forebrain progenitor regions before migrating to their dorsal forebrain target<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>. To test whether this directionality is recapitulated in fused organoids, we varied the identities of their individual tissue components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). We consistently labeled one organoid with GFP and the other with tdTomato, and delineated the fusions in an origin::target (GFP::tdTomato) arrangement. Using this paradigm, we analyzed the number of migrating cells when differentially controlling the dorsal/ventral identity of the origin and target regions of cerebral organoid fusions. Whole-mount imaging of ventral::dorsal<sup>Unt</sup> and ventral::dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> fusions indicated the occurrence of GFP<sup>+</sup> spots within the tdTomato<sup>+</sup> tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Conversely, the spots were rarely observed in dorsal<sup>Unt</sup>::dorsal<sup>Unt</sup> or dorsal<sup>CycA</sup>::dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This difference was even more striking when analyzing immunostained cryosections of organoid fusion tissue. The highest amount of migrating cells occurred in ventral::dorsal<sup>Unt</sup> and ventral::dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> fusions, while the least migration occurred in dorsal<sup>CycA</sup>::dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Although the average density of migrating cells in ventral::dorsal<sup>Unt</sup> fusions was not significantly different than ventral::dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> fusions, the ventral::dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> fusions were less variable in the amount of migrating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). These data confirm our initial observation of directionally biased migration from ventral into dorsal organoid tissue, and strongly suggests that the migration between fused organoids resembles interneuron migration. Finally, this experiment shows that ventral::dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> fused organoids produce the most robust migration between organoids.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S6">
<title>GABAergic interneurons migrate between fused cerebral organoids</title>
<p id="P9">Since our previous experiments suggested that the migration in ventral::dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> organoid fusions resembles interneuron migration, we first tested whether the migrating cells were GABAergic by examining whether the migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressed GAD1, one of the key enzymes for the synthesis of GABA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>. Immunostaining revealed that the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells that had migrated into the target organoid broadly expressed GAD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-C</xref>), and cell counting indicated that ~60% of the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells also expressed GAD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). Strikingly, when visualizing the entire organoid, GAD1 was expressed in a similar pattern as the GFP<sup>+</sup> migrating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Additionally, the expression of GAD1 appeared stronger in regions near the edge of the organoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), and farther away from the origin of the migrating cells. Therefore, interneurons can migrate from ventral into dorsal regions within organoid fusions.</p>
<p id="P10">Another major population of tangentially migrating cells in the developing human brain are the non-GABAergic Cajal-Retzius cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>. These cells are identified by the expression of Reelin (RELN)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>. The migratory GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in organoid fusions did not express RELN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>), despite the substantial presence of GFP<sup>-</sup>, RELN<sup>+</sup> cells in the dorsal target region of organoid fusions. Thus, our data indicate that the migratory GFP+ cells in organoid fusions are not Cajal-Retzius cells, and in combination with our previous results strengthens their identity as GABAergic interneurons.</p>
<p id="P11">Finally, we analyzed the expression of various neuronal markers by the migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in organoid fusions, including the pan-neuronal marker HuC/D<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, the immature migrating neuron marker DCX<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, the mature neuronal markers NeuN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, or MAP2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>. We observed that all the migrated GFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressed HuC/D, indicating their neuronal identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D,F</xref>). In addition, many GFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressed DCX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>), and a subset also expressed NeuN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>) or MAP2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>). This finding indicates that the migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cells are neurons (HuC/D<sup>+</sup> or DCX<sup>+</sup>), but also that they can become mature neurons (DCX<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup>, or MAP2<sup>+</sup>). In addition, we visualized the morphology of GFP<sup>+</sup> migrating interneurons. We observed cells with many branched processes and a circular cell body, which represents a more mature cell morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref>). Other cells exhibited a migratory morphology with an elongated cell body as well as a branched leading process and trailing process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Figure 6B-C</xref>). Therefore, the migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cells can express immature and mature neuronal markers, and exhibit both an immature, migratory morphology, or also an elaborate, mature morphology.</p>
<p id="P12">Since we observed that the migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cells had a range of maturity, and that not all of the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressed GAD1, we hypothesized that some of the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells may be immature, and therefore express markers of immature migrating interneurons. During normal mouse brain development, cortical interneurons downregulate the expression of NKX2-1 as they migrate toward dorsal cortical regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>. In migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cells within organoid fusions we observed that ~20% of the GFP<sup>+</sup> migrating cells in dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> organoid regions expressed NKX2-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E-F</xref>). The maintained expression of NKX2-1 could indicate an immature status, and also a difference between the development of mouse and human interneurons. Interestingly, many NKX2-1<sup>+</sup> or GAD1<sup>+</sup> cells that were GFP<sup>-</sup> were present within the dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> region of organoid fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>), indicating the production of ventral-derived interneurons within the dorsal organoid. Dorsal<sup>Unt</sup> organoids were nearly entirely of dorsal forebrain identity when not fused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C,E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, the tissue components of organoid fusions must be able to signal to each other. In support of this hypothesis, we observed NKX2-1<sup>+</sup> cells within the dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> organoid near the fusion midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that the ventral organoid can influence the patterning of the nearby dorsal tissue toward ventral forebrain tissue. Importantly, this does not affect the analysis of ventral to dorsal migrating cells, because these cells are uniquely labeled with GFP. Taken together, our results show that interneurons can migrate between fused ventral::dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> organoids, that many interneurons maintain expression of NKX2-1 after migrating into dorsal regions, and can become mature neurons.</p>

<title>Migrating interneurons produce various LGE/CGE and MGE-derived cortical interneuron subtypes in fused cerebral organoids</title>
<p id="P13">Since the migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cells can become mature neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>), and appear to be predominantly GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A,B,F</xref>), we next tested which interneuron subtypes are produced. Interneurons are particularly heterogeneous and multiple molecular markers can be used to identify various subtypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> that are generated by distinct progenitor subpopulations within the ventral forebrain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>. In humans, the majority of interneurons are generated from NKX2-1<sup>+</sup> regions of the MGE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>. Therefore, we tested whether the migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cells produce MGE-derived interneuron subtypes. In humans, SOX6 is expressed in the MGE and in immature and mature interneurons emerging from this region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>. In organoid fusions, we observed that ~40% of the migrating GFP<sup>+</sup>/GAD1<sup>+</sup> cells are SOX6<sup>+</sup> MGE interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A,I</xref>). Therefore, MGE-derived interneurons can be generated within cerebral organoid fusions. To confirm this finding, we also examined the expression of markers for MGE-derived interneurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>. We observed expression of somatostatin (SOM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B,I</xref>) in 6%, neuropeptide Y (NPY) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C,I</xref>) in 6%, calbindin D-28k (CB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D,I</xref>) in 20%, and parvalbumin (PV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E,I</xref>) in 5% of the migrated GFP<sup>+</sup>/GAD1<sup>+</sup> interneurons. Therefore, in organoid fusions, multiple MGE-derived interneuron subtypes can be generated.</p>

Similar to SOX6 for MGE, the transcription factors COUP-TFII/NR2F2 and SP8 can be used as LGE/CGE fate-mapping markers for cortical interneurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>. Both SP8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>) and COUP-TFII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>) were expressed by ~30-40% of the GFP<sup>+</sup> migrating interneurons (GAD1<sup>+</sup> or VGAT<sup>+</sup>) in organoid fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I-J</xref>). As confirmation of this result, we also analyzed the expression of markers for LGE/CGE-derived subtypes. Our previous data already indicated a lack of RELN expression by GFP<sup>+</sup> migrating cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>), which in addition to non-interneuron Cajal-Retzius cells is also expressed by subpopulations of GABAergic MGE and CGE-derived interneurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>. We also did not observe any vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing GFP<sup>+</sup> interneurons (data not shown). However, we did observe calretinin (CR) expression in 4% of the GFP<sup>+</sup> interneurons (VGAT<sup>+</sup>) in organoid fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H,J</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that organoid fusions contain many diverse interneuron subtypes originating from the major ventral forebrain subregions (MGE and LGE/CGE).</p>

<title>Neuronal migration in fused cerebral organoids resembles the features of migrating cortical interneurons</title>
<p id="P15">The migratory dynamics of migrating cortical interneurons has been extensively documented using time-lapse imaging experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>. Interneurons utilize different modes of neuronal migration throughout development. For instance, radial migration refers to cells migrating along radial glia fibers. In contrast, tangential migration occurs independent of a radial glia scaffold, and in the case of interneurons, largely perpendicular to the radial glia fibers. Radially migrating cells exhibit a bipolar morphology with a single leading process, whereas tangentially migrating cortical interneurons contain branched leading processes which sample the extracellular environment for chemotaxis cues that regulate migration dynamics and direction. Cortical interneurons undergo tangential migration from ventral into dorsal telencephalic regions, but at some point upon arriving in dorsal regions, the cells decide to move radially into their desired cortical layer, followed by dispersion throughout that layer. Therefore, migrating interneurons undergo many different modes of migration throughout their development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>.</p>
<p id="P16">To determine whether the behavior of migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in organoid fusions resembles that of cortical interneurons, we performed time-lapse recordings of migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in ventral::dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> organoid fusion slice-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). The GFP<sup>+</sup> ventral origin region of the organoid fusion could easily be distinguished from the GFP<sup>-</sup> dorsal target region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Thus, we could easily visualize the morphology of the sparsely labeled GFP<sup>+</sup> cells that had migrated into the dorsal organoid fusion region. Over 3 days, we observed both stationary and motile cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplemental movies 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">5</xref>), and surprisingly we also observed dynamic neuronal processes resembling axons that extended long distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">Supplemental movie 6</xref>). We clearly observed cells with a branched leading process that underwent extension and retraction followed by the cell body moving toward the extending branch (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplemental Movie 1</xref>). Some cells with this behavior exhibited abrupt changes in direction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplemental Movie 2</xref>). This behavior appears very similar to that described for tangentially migrating interneurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>. A different behavior was observed in other cells containing a long leading process that extends in a single direction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplemental Movie 4</xref>), which resembles radial migration. Intriguingly, we also observed cells that exhibited multimodal behavior with branched leading processes, but then switched to a single leading process and unidirectional migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supplemental Movie 5</xref>). In summary, the GFP<sup>+</sup> migrating cells within organoid fusions exhibit characteristics of different modes of migration resembling that of migrating cortical interneurons.</p>
<p id="P17">3D-culture systems can be effective experimental platforms for drug-screening<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>. Therefore, we developed a long-term slice culture assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) to highlight the amenability of our organoid fusion system for small-molecule application. Since we observed a large increase in migration from day 30-50 in ventral::dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> organoid fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure2F</xref>), we applied a drug during this period. The chemoattractant SDF-1 (CXCL12) and its receptor CXCR4 regulate the migration of interneurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>. To test if the migration we observed in cerebral organoid fusions is CXCR4-dependent, we created long-term slice cultures of organoid fusions that were treated with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100. Compared to untreated control slices prepared from the same organoid fusion, the density of migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cells into GFP<sup>-</sup> dorsal regions was significantly reduced upon AMD3100 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D-E</xref>). Therefore, the cell migration in cerebral organoid fusions depends on CXCR4 activity. This experiment highlights the usefulness of the organoid fusion method as an initial drug-screening platform, and opens the possibility for larger scale screening in the future.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P18">In this study, we developed a cell migration assay using fused cerebral organoids. The concept of fusing organoids is based on classical co-culture experiments. However, our method represents an adaptation and extension of this technique to study human neuronal cell migration with the experimental control allowed by <italic>in vitro</italic> 3D cell culture. Ventral::dorsal organoid fusions exhibit robust long-distance cell migration resembling that of ventral forebrain-derived cortical inhibitory interneurons. This is based on multiple pieces of data. First, we observed substantially more migration from ventral into dorsal forebrain regions in cerebral organoid fusions. Second, the migrating cells within organoid fusions express GABAergic markers (GAD1/VGAT). Third, the migrated GFP<sup>+</sup> cells can produce a variety of interneuron subtypes. In addition, the lack of RELN expression by migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cells supports a ventral forebrain-derived interneuron identity. Fourth, the migration dynamics of the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in fused organoids resembles the characteristic migratory behavior exhibited by cortical interneurons. Finally, the cell migration in organoid fusions was inhibited by CXCR4 inhibition, a known regulator of interneuron migration. Therefore, we have recapitulated the migration of human cortical interneurons from ventral into dorsal forebrain regions. Moreover, the observation that these cells exhibit both immature and mature neuronal markers indicates their ability to undergo maturation once arriving in their dorsal cortical forebrain target regions. This represents an exciting opportunity to recreate a developing human cortical circuit containing an enhanced repertoire of cellular diversity than was possible to achieve using the previous singular organoid method.</p>
<p id="P19">Cerebral organoid methodology exhibits variability, both between batches of differentiations and between different human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>. In the current study, we used an iPSC line that was previously used extensively for growing forebrain organoids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. As the organoid fusion method relies on proper patterning into dorsal and ventral brain regions for robust ventral to dorsal migration to occur, any future hPSC cell lines used should be tested for the ability to grow dorsal and ventral brain regions. The qPCR analysis we present can be used to address this caveat. Moreover, while we developed the organoid fusion method using a specific previously published cerebral organoid protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, the concept of organoid fusion should be compatible with any protocol which can grow 3D dorsal and ventral forebrain regions.</p>
<p id="P20">An interesting observation was the maintenance of NKX2-1 expression by GFP<sup>+</sup> cells migrating from ventral into dorsal organoid fusion tissue. This differs from mouse development where NKX2-1 is downregulated by cortical interneurons as they leave the ventral ganglionic eminence regions and proceed to their dorsal forebrain target regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>. However, NKX2-1<sup>+</sup> cells have been observed within the dorsal forebrain of embryonic human brain tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>. This data has been interpreted as evidence for the generation of interneurons within dorsal forebrain progenitor regions. An alternative possibility is the prolonged expression of NKX2-1 by migrating cortical interneurons. Our data from human organoid fusions supports the latter possibility. In addition, the strong effect of CXCR4 inhibition on the migration of cells within organoid fusions is also intriguing. In CXCR4 knockout and AMD3100 treated mice, interneurons retain the ability to migrate from ventral into dorsal forebrain regions, but the invasion of interneurons into the cortical layers is altered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>. Whether the CXCR4 effect in human cerebral organoid fusions is another difference between mouse and human interneurons is an interesting avenue of future study. Nonetheless, these two findings highlight the potential usefulness of using the organoid fusion method to understand the various aspects of human interneuron development.</p>
<p id="P21">An exciting future application of this technique will be to study human developmental biology and its relationship to neurological diseases. With this in mind while characterizing this assay, we present different experimental paradigms, each of which can be used to investigate various aspects and scientific questions related to neuronal cell migration. For instance, the labeling of the cells within one of the fused organoids with a fluorescent reporter allows the visualization of long-distance neuronal migration. This can even be continuously monitored over time through whole-mount imaging of intact organoid fusions. In addition, the identity of the cells can be easily examined using immunostaining for identification of neuronal subtypes. This is useful because many psychiatric diseases, such as Schizophrenia, are thought to involve selective deficits in specific interneuron subpopulations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>.</p>
<p id="P22">A second type of analysis is dissecting the role of specific molecules on neuronal migration to determine if they are acting in a cell-autonomous or cell non-autonomous manner. For instance, using our organoid mixing paradigm, organoids from either the origin of migration or the target can be genetically manipulated independently by deriving the origin and target organoids from distinct cell lines containing either mutant or wild-type alleles of a gene of interest. This is a powerful genetic tool routinely used in genetic model organisms, but can now also be utilized in 3D cultures of developing human brain tissue.</p>
<p id="P23">We also present an organoid fusion slice culture paradigm in which confocal time-lapse imaging can be used to analyze the short-term dynamics of neuronal cell migration. This is an important tool because some molecules such as GABA are known to affect the motility of migrating interneurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, which may produce a subtle phenotype in a long-term migration assay, and therefore instead require a higher time-resolution analysis of the dynamics of migrating cells. In addition, long-term slice cultures can be used to test how different drug-treatments can affect cell migration. This presents the opportunity to perform drug-screens to determine the effect of many different molecules on interneuron migration.</p>
<p id="P24">Finally, the organoid fusion method also presents unique applications beyond cell migration, which can be developed further in the future. As one example, we observed substantial neurite dynamics with the appearance of axon projections. In addition, although we specifically focused on ventral::dorsal forebrain fusions, the organoid fusion paradigm allows flexibility in the brain regional identities that can be grown together. Combined with the additional brain-region specific organoid protocols<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>, the possible brain circuits that could be modeled using organoid fusions is vast. Therefore, organoid fusion technology greatly enhances the phenotypic analyses possible in cerebral organoids, and the flexibility of the method immensely expands the future development of <italic>in vitro</italic> models of human neurological diseases.</p>

The protocol for generating ventral organoids was tested using a feeder-dependent iPSC line (Systems Biosciences, cat. no. SC101A-1). A drug-patterning treatment was applied during the neural induction step of the protocol (~day 5-11) using one of the following treatments: 1) dorsal<sup>Unt</sup>, no drugs, 2) Ventral, 2.5µM IWP2 (Sigma, cat. no. I0536) and 100nM SAG (Millipore, cat. no. 566660), 3) dorsal<sup>CycA</sup>, 5µM CycA (Calbiochem, cat. no. 239803). Stock drug solutions were created as follows: IWP2 (5mM in DMSO), SAG (1 mM in H<sub>2</sub>O), and CycA (5 mM in DMSO). Following embedding in Matrigel (Corning, cat. no. 356235<italic>)</italic>, organoids were grown in 10 cm cell culture dishes containing 25 mL of differentiation medium, and after the first media exchange maintained on an orbital shaker with medium exchange every 5-7 days. After day 40 of the protocol, when organoids begin to grow out of the Matrigel droplet, the differentiation medium was supplemented with 1% Matrigel.</p>
<p id="P29">To create organoid fusions, EBs were grown separately and individually patterned using either dorsal<sup>Unt</sup>, dorsal<sup>CycA</sup>, or ventral protocols as described above. During Matrigel embedding, two EBs were transferred into the same parafilm well and embedded in a single droplet (~30 µL) of Matrigel. The EBs were gently positioned as close together as possible using a 20 µL pipet tip to ensure the EBs would remain in close proximity within the middle of the solidified Matrigel droplet. The fusion process is very efficient, and occurs within a week when EBs are positioned as close as possible. If EBs were not positioned close enough, then visible space remained between organoids 1 week after embedding. These “failed” fusions were removed by aspiration. In addition, if the Matrigel droplet disassembles during the embedding process or during additional feedings before fusion has been completed, these organoids were also removed by aspiration.</p>

The GFP<sup>-</sup> area in organoid fusions was outlined with the ROI tool and the area calculated using the “measure” function. The cell counts were divided by the area to determine the density of migrated GFP<sup>+</sup> cells. For the migration time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E,F</xref>) and organoid fusion mixing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B,C</xref>) experiments, confocal tile scan images of tissue cryosections were used for quantification. For the long-term slice culture experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D,E</xref>), a wide-field 5x image containing the GFP<sup>-</sup> region was used for counting.</p>

<title>Marker expression quantification</title>
<p id="P42">For determining the percentage of ventricular zone (VZ)-like regions expressing various markers, immunostained organoid fusion cryosections were imaged on a spinning disk confocal microscope (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">microscopy</xref> section) using a 10x objective to collect single-plane, tile scan images of entire organoids. The VZ-like regions were identified in the DAPI channel as circular regions with a packed arrangement of cells in a radialized pattern. The VZ-regions were marked manually using the “Cell Counter” plugin of Fiji. Then the additional channels containing the signal from various marker immunostainings were overlaid, and the VZ-like regions scored for expression of each marker of interest. Two different sections of each organoid were counted and summed. Then the counts for each organoid were calculated as a percentage of total VZ-regions expressing a given marker. The percentages from 4 different organoids from 2 independent differentiations were averaged.</p>
<p id="P43">For determining the percentage of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressing various markers, immunostained organoid fusion cryosections were imaged on a spinning disk confocal microscope (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">microscopy</xref> section) using a 20x objective to collect z-stacks (1 µm step size) through the entire 20µm section. For each organoid, 2-3 positions were collected that included migrated GFP<sup>+</sup> cells within the dorsal region of an organoid fusion. The number of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressing various markers was counted manually using the “Cell Counter” plugin of Fiji. The cell counts for each organoid were summed and the percentage of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressing each marker was calculated. The percentages were averaged across 4 organoids.</p>

This movie is an example of a cell exhibiting many changes of direction involving the dynamic extension and retracting of several processes. As the cell body remains static, branches are extended in multiple directions, and then each of the main branches extends additional higher order branches. Finally, a branch is extended in a particular direction followed by the retraction of the other main branch. The cell body is then moved in the direction of the extending branch. The cycle is repeated as the cell decides which direction to migrate.

<p id="P53">A time-lapse movie of migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cells within the dorsal region of a ventral/GFP::dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> organoid fusion. This movie shows multiple migrating cells. 1) Initially a cell in the middle of the field of view is migrating upward. The upward process is retracted as a new leading process is extended downward and becomes branched. The cell migration direction is then changed downward. The bifurcated leading process is dynamic such that one process is extended as the other process is retracted. The cell body then moves toward the extended leading process. Prior to nucleokinesis, a swelling is observed moving from the cell body into the proximal portion of the leading process. Then the cell body is moved in parallel to the swelling, and finally the cell body moves into the swelling. 2) A second cell migrates from the left field of view toward the right, changes direction back toward the left, and then again changes direction toward the right, and finally changes once again back toward the left. With each change of direction, the trailing process becomes the leading process. The new leading process is extended toward the direction of travel as the trailing process is retracted.

<p id="P55">A time-lapse movie of migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cells within the dorsal region of a ventral::dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> organoid fusion. This movie shows multiple cells migrating. Around 6 hours a cell can be seen migrating into view from the bottom left corner of the field of view. This cell initially migrates left to right with a branched leading process. At multiple times, 3 branches are observed. As the cell progresses forward, branches are extended in the direction of travel, while other branches are retracted. Around 23 hours the cell changes direction abruptly from moving right to moving left. This involves an extension of a new process toward the left, while the previous leading process oriented to the right is retracted. The cell proceeds to the left, but around 39 hours, the leading process begins turning toward the right. The leading process makes a 180-degree turn, and then extends. The cell body then follows the leading process as the cell migrates rapidly from top to bottom and eventually proceeds out of view in the z-direction.

<title>Migrating cells in cerebral organoid fusions exhibit the migratory dynamics of tangentially migrating interneurons and are sensitive to CXCR4 activity.</title>
<p>(A) A schematic representation of the organoid fusion slice culture assay for either short-term time-lapse imaging of migratory dynamics, or long-term drug-treatments. A representative tile-scan image of an entire ventral::dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> organoid fusion slice is shown with the ventral GFP<sup>+</sup> regions labeled in green and the unlabeled or tdTomato dorsal regions outlined in red. A region containing the migrating cell shown in (B) is noted by a yellow box. (B) Still images from a 3-day time-lapse experiment showing a migrating GFP<sup>+</sup> cell. The branched leading process exhibits both extending (closed arrowheads) and retracting (open arrowheads) branches as the cell body follows one of the leading processes. (C) An extending neurite (closed arrowhead) with a tuft that appears to be an axon growth cone travels in one direction across the field of view. (D) A widefield image of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells that migrated into the tdTomato<sup>+</sup> dorsal region (red outline) from long-term organoid fusion slice cultures that were either untreated (control) or treated with a the CXCR4 inhibitor (AMD3100). (E) Quantification of the migrated GFP<sup>+</sup> cell density with data represented as mean±SD with statistical significance tested using the student’s t-test (df=4) comparing control (n=3 organoids) to AMD3100 (n=3) treatment. Slices from the same organoid were split between control and AMD3100-treatments, and 3 different organoids were used from 2 different independent differentiations. Each data point represents cell density counts from one slice. Fewer migrating cells are observed in AMD3100-treated slice cultures. Scale bars are (A) 500µm, (B-C) 50µm, and (D) 500µm. The images in (A-C) are from an organoid fusion created by fusing a ventral H9 hESC-derived organoid containing a CAG-eGFP-WPRE construct to a dorsal<sup>CycA</sup> iPSC-derived organoid. The images and data in (D-E) are from iPSC-derived organoid fusions.</p>
