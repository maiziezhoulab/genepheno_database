<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent human malignancies worldwide and has high morbidity and mortality. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC recurrence and metastasis is critical to identify new therapeutic targets. This study aimed to determine the roles of aminopeptidase N (APN, also known as CD13) in HCC proliferation and metastasis and its underlying mechanisms. We detected APN expression in clinical samples and HCC cell lines using immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, real-time PCR, and enzyme activity assays. The effects of APN on HCC metastasis and proliferation were verified in both in vitro and in vivo models. RNA-seq, phosphoproteomic, western blot, point mutation, co-immunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assays were performed to reveal the potential mechanisms. We found that APN was frequently upregulated in HCC tumor tissues and high-metastatic cell lines. Knockout of APN inhibited HCC cell metastasis and proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Functional studies suggested that a loss of APN impedes the ERK signaling pathway in HCC cells. Mechanistically, we found that APN might mediate the phosphorylation at serine 31 of BCKDK (BCKDK<sup>S31</sup>), promote BCKDK interacting with ERK1/2 and phosphorylating it, thereby activating the ERK signaling pathway in HCC cells. Collectively, our findings indicate that APN mediates the phosphorylation of BCKDK<sup>S31</sup> and activates its downstream pathway to promote HCC proliferation and metastasis. Therefore, the APN/BCKDK/ERK axis may serve as a new therapeutic target for HCC therapy, and these findings may be helpful to identify new biomarkers in HCC progression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the most common type of primary liver cancer with high morbidity and high mortality. As one of the most prevalent global human malignancies, the number of new HCC cases and related deaths worldwide in 2018 were ~841,000 and 781,000, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. More than 50% of liver cancer cases occur in China. Despite various advances in diagnosis and treatment, the high probability of metastasis makes its prognosis far from satisfactory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC development and metastasis is an urgent need for identifying new therapeutic targets and developing new approaches to reduce HCC mortality.</p>
<p id="Par3">Aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13, EC3.4.11.2) is a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane-bound peptidase that is widely distributed in many mammalian tissues, such as the intestine, kidney, liver, and central nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. APN can cleave peptides to release N-terminal neutral amino acids such as Ala, Phe, and Leu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Originally discovered during the search for specific markers for human leukemia classification, APN is now considered a multifunctional (“moonlighting”) protein with a hydrolytic ability. APN is involved in the activation or degradation of bioactive peptides, degradation of extracellular matrix, signal transduction, and antigen presentation and serves as a receptor for some human viruses (e.g., coronaviruses)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Although APN has been identified as a candidate HCC stem cell marker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, the exact mechanism of APN in the proliferation and metastasis of HCC is still unclear.</p>
<p id="Par4">The reversible phosphorylation of various proteins regulates function, subcellular localization, complex formation, and degradation of these signaling molecules. As a result of all of these modifications, the signal transduction network is mediated in cells. It is estimated that between 30% and 65% of all proteins may be phosphorylated, some multiple times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Phosphorylated proteins and mediators of these modifications may be useful molecular cancer markers that are invaluable for the diagnosis, prognosis prediction and discovery of therapeutic targets. Branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK) is a member of a distinctive family of mitochondrial protein kinases that is similar to prokaryotic histidine kinases, whose function is to inactivate BCKD complexes by phosphorylation, thereby preventing the catabolism of these essential regulatory metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. BCKDK plays an important role in many serious human diseases, such as Kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome (KOS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, obesity-associated insulin resistance (IR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and epilepsy in autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, there is little research linking BCKDK and cancer, and the relationship between BCKDK and HCC is unclear.</p>
<p id="Par5">In this study, we demonstrated that knockout of APN inhibits the migration, invasion and proliferation of HCC cells and suppresses HCC metastasis and growth in vivo. Functional studies suggested that loss of APN impedes the ERK signaling pathway in HCC cells. Mechanistically, we found that APN might mediate the phosphorylation of serine at position 31 of BCKDK, then promote BCKDK binding and phosphorylating ERK1/2, thereby activating the ERK signaling pathway in HCC cells. Taken together, these data support a role for APN as a promoting factor in HCC growth and metastasis, implying its potential as a therapeutic target.</p>

<sec id="Sec4">
<title>APN expression and activity assay</title>
<p id="Par8">To evaluate the expression of APN on the cell surface, HCC cells and normal hunman liver cell line THLE-3 were incubated with APC-conjugated anti-human APN/CD13 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) or APC Mouse IgG1, κ Isotype Ctrl (Biolegend) antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. Then, the cells were analyzed by using a FACS Canto<sup>TM</sup> II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).</p>
<p id="Par9">APN activities in different cell lines were estimated by measuring the hydrolysis of a fluorescent substrate derived from alanine conjugated to 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Ala-AMC, Bachem, Budendorf, Switzerland), as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The THLE-3 cell line was used as control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec5">
<title>RNA extraction and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)</title>
<p id="Par10">Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol Reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) and then reverse transcribed to cDNA using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the protocol of the suppliers. The expression levels of target genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using SYBR green mix (Applied Biosystems, USA). The data were calculated by the 2<sup>–ΔΔCt</sup> method and are representative of at least three independent experiments. The THLE-3 cell line was used as control. β-actin was used as a housekeeping gene. The primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">S1</xref>.</p>

<sec id="Sec6">
<title>Migration and invasion assays</title>
<p id="Par11">HCC cells were starved overnight, detached with trypsin, and resuspended in serum-free medium. For the transwell migration assay, 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> HCC cells were placed in the upper chamber of each insert (pore size 8 micros (μm), Corning, NY, USA) containing the noncoated membrane. For the invasion assay, cells were placed in the upper chamber of each insert that was coated with 100 microliters (μl) of Matrigel (BD biosciences), which was diluted 1:50 with serum-free medium. Then, medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was added to the lower chambers. After 24–48 h (h) of incubation, cells in the upper chamber were removed by wiping with a cotton swab. Cells on the lower surface in chamber were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 1 h and stained using 0.1% crystal violet for 15 minutes (min). Finally, the filters were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and images were taken using a Nikon ECLIPSE 90i microscope (Tokyo, Japan). Cell numbers were counted in five randomly selected fields (200×) from each well. The ERK inhibitor (HY-50846) used in transwell assays was obtained from MedChem Express (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) was purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA).</p>

<title>Animal studies/in vivo experiments</title>
<p id="Par17">Six-week-old female NOD/SCID (RRID: IMSR_ARC:NODSCID) mice were purchased from the Academy of Military Medical Science (Beijing, China). All experimental procedures involving animals in this study were reviewed and approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Tianjin Medical University. Six or five animals randomly assigned per group were used in each experiment. Sample size estimate was based on xenograft assays from literatures. The measurement and data processing were done with blinding. Except the survival assay, all animals were sacrificed at the end of the experiment and included into the analysis.</p>
<p id="Par18">For subcutaneous xenograft experiments, SK-HEP-1 APN knockout cells (SK-KO) and SK-HEP-1 control cells (SK-Con) were transfected with lentiviruses to express firefly luciferase and injected subcutaneously into the right flanks of NOD/SCID mice (5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per mouse). The mice were euthanized six weeks after injection, and tumors were removed and the volume was calculated using the following formula: tumor volume (cubic millimeters (mm<sup>3</sup>)) = (length × width<sup>2 </sup>× <italic>π</italic> × 1/6).</p>
<p id="Par19">For the in vivo liver metastasis model, HCC cells were implanted into the livers of NOD/SCID mice via injection into the spleen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. A small abdominal incision was made in the left flank to isolate the spleen and extract it. Luciferase-expressing cells (SK-Con and SK-KO) were injected into the spleen (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per mouse). Ten min later, the blood vessels of the spleen were ligated, the spleen was removed, and the abdominal wall was sutured. Seven weeks after the injection, the mice were sacrificed, and the livers, lungs, and kidneys were isolated and examined for metastasis with an IVIS Spectrum scanner.</p>
<p id="Par20">For the liver orthotopic xenograft model, NOD/SCID mice were anesthetized using 1.5% inhaled isoflurane, and the left lobe of the liver was exposed through an upper midline laparotomy. Luciferase-expressing cells (SK-Con, SK-KO and SK-KO overexpressing BCKDK<sup>S31D</sup>) in 30 μl of culture medium containing 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were injected into the left lobe (2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per mouse). Eight weeks after orthotopic HCC cell injection, all mice were euthanized. The livers, lungs, spleens, and kidneys of mice were isolated, and the bioluminescent signals of these organs were observed using an IVIS Spectrum scanner to verify tumor establishment and metastasis.</p>
<p id="Par21">For the survival assay, SK-KO cells and SK-Con cells were injected into the livers of NOD/SCID mice (2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per mouse). Mice injected with cells were fed normally until their death, and the date of death was recorded.</p>

<title>APN expression is upregulated in HCC tissues and high-metastatic cells, and correlated with HCC progression</title>
<p id="Par32">To investigate the role of APN in HCC progression, we analyzed its expression levels in a tissue microarray containing 90 samples of HCC patients by immunostaining. The expression levels of APN were significantly higher in HCC tumor tissues than in adjacent nontumor tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). Moreover, a clinical pathological analysis of the tumor tissues indicated that higher APN expression was significantly positively associated with tumor size (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>), cirrhosis occurrence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>) and patient age (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). To further demonstrate that APN is associated with HCC progression, we measured the expression levels of APN in seven HCC cell lines and a normal human liver cell line using flow cytometry and RT-qPCR. APN expression showed significant differences in different HCC cell lines, and APN levels in all HCC cell lines are significantly higher than that of normal liver cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e, f</xref>). The trend of APN enzyme activity detection is consistent with its expression level in different cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>). Then, we selected four HCC cell lines with different APN levels and evaluated their metastatic ability by a transwell assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref>). We found that high-APN HCC cells have a greater metastatic potential than low-APN HCC cells. These results supported the notion that increased APN expression is associated with human liver cancer metastasis and proliferation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>APN expression is upregulated in HCC tissues and high-metastatic HCC cells.</title><p><bold>a</bold> APN levels in HCC tumor tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (<italic>n</italic> = 90 in each group).

<title>APN promotes HCC cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo</title>
<p id="Par33">To ascertain the function of APN in HCC progression, we selected SK-HEP-1 cells with high-APN expression and Huh6 cells with low-APN expression for loss- and gain-of-function studies. APN was knocked out in SK-HEP-1 cells by CRISPR genome editing, and APN sgRNA-KO2 was verified and chosen as the best candidate for knocking out APN expression in SK-HEP-1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). Overexpression of APN in Huh6 cells was accomplished by lentivirus (LvAPN) transfection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). Compared with control cells (SK-Con), the migration and invasion ability of APN knockout cells (SK-KO) was greatly reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>). Corresponding to this loss-of-gain phenotype, overexpression of APN significantly promoted the migration and invasion of Huh6 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Alteration of APN can regulate liver cancer cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo.</title><p><bold>a</bold> After CRISPR genome editing, APN was knockout in SK-HEP-1 cells. <bold>b</bold> After lentivirus transfection, APN was overexpressed in Huh6 cells. <bold>c</bold> Transwell assays were used to evaluate the migration and invasion of SK-HEP-1 cell after knockout of APN. <bold>d</bold> Transwell assays were used to evaluate the migration and invasion of Huh6 cell after APN overexpression.

<p id="Par34">To investigate the effect of APN on the metastasis ability of HCC cells in vivo, we performed a liver metastasis experiment with splenectomy. The spleen is a highly vascularized structure from which tumor cells appear to readily travel into the liver via the splenic and portal veins. The mice injected with APN knockout SK-HEP-1 cells (SK-KO) exhibited fewer and smaller liver metastatic nodules and a lower rate of tumor metastasizing to other organs than did the SK-Con group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). Moreover, we applied a liver orthotopic xenograft model to simulate the progression of clinical liver cancer. SK-Con and SK-KO cells were implanted into the livers of NOD/SCID mice, respectively. The SK-KO group showed longer survival times (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>). These results provide further evidence that APN is involved in promoting HCC invasion and metastasis.</p>

<title>APN knockout inhibited proliferation of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo</title>
<p id="Par35">Colony formation assays were used to show that depleting the APN level significantly attenuated the growth of HCC cells in vitro. The SK-KO cells formed fewer and smaller colonies than the SK-Con cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>), while in the cells overexpressing APN (Huh6-LvAPN), the opposite trend was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>). We also found that knocking out APN reduced the antiapoptotic ability of SK-HEP-1. The proportion of apoptotic cells induced by cisplatin was significantly higher in SK-KO cells than in SK-Con cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>). Conversely, overexpressing APN in Huh6 led to an increase in the antiapoptotic ability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Alteration of APN can regulate HCC cells proliferation in vitro and in vivo.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Colony formation assay showed effect of APN knockout on cell proliferation in SK-HEP-1 cells. <bold>b</bold> Colony formation assay showed effect of APN overexpression on cell proliferation in Huh6 cells.

<p id="Par36">The in vivo experiment to observe the effect of APN on xenograft tumor growth was conducted in a subcutaneous model. We found that the SK-KO group tumors were significantly smaller than those in the control group, and the weights of the final resected tumors in the SK-KO group were significantly lower than those in the control group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>). Two mice in the control group died during the experimental observation, which may be related to the metastasis of the tumor in the body. Overall, these findings suggested that APN might promote tumor growth and cancer progression in HCC.</p>

<p id="Par38">Among the differentially expressed genes, we found that several genes related to cancer progression (HMGA2, PLD2, MMP9, GLI1, GLI2, SLUG and MDR1) were expressed at a low level after knocking out APN (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). The expression of these genes in SK-Con and SK-KO cells was verified by RT-qPCR analyses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>). Moreover, previous research suggested that these genes could be directly or indirectly regulated by ERK1/2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Since ERK1/2 is widely considered to be functional after being activated via phosphorylation, we speculated that APN might regulate cancer-associated genes downstream of ERK1/2 by modulating the phospho-ERK signaling pathway and then promoting the metastasis and proliferation of HCC.</p>
<p id="Par39">The KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that the MAPK pathway was significantly altered upon APN knockout (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>). A functional analysis of the RNA-seq data showed that there were mainly four cell processes that were altered in the APN knockout cells: cell growth and death, cell motility, cell community, and transport and catabolism (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>). These transcriptome changes are consistent with the phenotypes of APN knockout SK-HEP-1 cells, and this consistency validates and supports the viewpoint mentioned above that APN can regulate the metastasis and proliferation of HCC.</p>
<p id="Par40">To confirm this result, immunoblotting was performed to demonstrate that APN knockout in SK-HEP-1 cells indeed caused ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. Our results showed that APN knockout significantly decreased the phosphorylation protein levels of ERK1/2 and P90RSK, but there was no significant change in the phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4f</xref>). This result suggested that APN might activate the MAPK pathway by phosphorylation of ERK but not by phosphorylation of p38. In addition to immunoblotting, we carried out transwell and colony formation assays to examine whether APN-mediated HCC metastasis and growth were dependent on the activation of ERK1/2. ERK1/2 serves as a major phosphorylation pathway activated by EGF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, and we found that the colony formation and metastatic abilities of SK-KO cells were significantly increased in the absence of EGF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4g, h</xref>). Following treatment with an ERK inhibitor (SCH772984), Huh6-LvAPN cells showed a decline in colony formation and metastatic abilities (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4i, j</xref>). We speculated that the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway is crucial for APN-mediated HCC growth and metastasis and that ERK plays an important role downstream of APN.</p>

<title>APN-mediated BCKDK serine 31 phosphorylation during liver cancer progression</title>
<p id="Par41">To gain insight into the ERK signaling pathway regulated by APN during HCC progression, SK-KO and SK-Con cells were subjected to a tandem mass tag (TMT) quantitative proteomic analysis. Total peptides were enriched for phosphopeptides using immobilized TiO<sub>2</sub>, resulting in the quantification of 12,145 phosphopeptides from 7256 proteins, of which 6017 peptides have differential phosphorylation levels. Positioning abs (log<sub>2</sub> (protein abundance ratio)) &gt;log<sub>2</sub>1.2, in the range of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 359 peptides with increased phosphorylation levels and 179 peptides with decreased levels were obtained. We identified the phosphorylation of serine 31 (S31) in BCKDK as the most significant decrease in phosphorylated protein after APN knockout (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>), and this site on BCKDK appeared as a conserved sequence in multiple species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5b</xref>). Meanwhile, we generated an antibody that could recognize BCKDK containing phosphorylated S31 with high specificity. This anti-p-BCKDK<sup>S31</sup> antibody was used to detect SK-Con and SK-KO cells by immunoblotting, and the results were consistent with those of the phosphoproteomic analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>A phosphoproteomic screen identifies BCKDK<sup>S31</sup> as a candidate APN target during liver cancer metastasis.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Hierarchically clustering of differentially expressed phosphoproteins and volcano plot of –log (<italic>p</italic>-value) versus the log<sub>2</sub> fold change for quantified phosphopeptides.

<p id="Par42">Since BCKDK is a protein kinase, we sought to verify whether the activation of ERK1/2 mediated by APN is affected by the phosphorylation of BCKDK-S31. To test this hypothesis, we first created two 6×Myc-tagged BCKDK mutant plasmids, BCKDK-S31A and BCKDK-S31D, by using a 6xMcy-tagged normal BCKDK plasmid. Changing serine 31 in BCKDK to alanine (S31A) eliminated the ability of BCKDK-S31 to be phosphorylated, while Ser31→Asp (S31D) mimicked the phosphorylation of S31<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d–f</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par43">Subsequently, a series of recombinant plasmids containing 6×Myc-tag were transfected into SK-Con and SK-KO cells, including normal BCKDK, BCKDK<sup>S31A</sup>, BCKDK<sup>S31D</sup> and control vector. In the APN normally expressed SK-HEP-1 cells (SK-Con), transfection with a plasmid expressing normal BCKDK or BCKDK<sup>S31D</sup> resulted in a significant increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Transfection with the plasmid expressing BCKDK<sup>S31A</sup> did not increase the phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>). In the APN knockout SK-HEP-1 cells (SK-KO), only BCKDK<sup>S31D</sup><sub>,</sub> which mimicked S31 phosphorylated BCKDK can increase the phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5f</xref>). These results indicated that phosphorylation of serine 31 in BCKDK can increase ERK phosphorylation in HCC cells, and this effect was dependent on the presence of APN. Previous studies have shown that BCKDK can phosphorylate MEK1/2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and our experimental results were consistent with this. Our study also showed that, like ERK1/2, BCKDK can only phosphorylate MEK1/2 in the presence of APN (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e, f</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par44">We further injected luciferase-expressing SK-Con, SK-KO and SK-KO + BCKDK<sup>S31D</sup> (SK-KO cells overexpressing BCKDK<sup>S31D</sup>) cells into the left liver lobe of mice. Six weeks after the injection, the mice were sacrificed and examined for tumor growth at the transplantation site and metastasis to other major organs. Compared with the SK-Con mice, the SK-KO mice showed decreased levels of metastasis and tumor growth. However, both of these indicators were significantly higher in the SK-KO + BCKDK<sup>S31D</sup> group than in the SK-KO group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5g</xref>). The in vivo results suggested that overexpressing BCKDK<sup>S31D</sup> in APN knockout SK-HEP-1 cells could reverse the decline in tumor metastasis and the slower growth. Overall, these results provide further evidence that downregulation of APN significantly reduced the phosphorylation of ERK, thereby reducing the rate of HCC tumor development in vivo, whereas overexpression of BCKDK<sup>S31D</sup> can effectively reverse this phenotype.</p>

APN mediated the phosphorylation of BCKDK at serine 31, which in turn activated the ERK signaling pathway to promote the progression of HCC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6e</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par47">Aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13) is an important transmembrane metalloprotease that regulates multivariate cellular functions by different mechanisms, such as enzymatic cleavage of peptides, degradation of the extracellular matrix, signal transduction, antigen presentation, and many more<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Expression disorder of APN expression has been shown to promote many kinds of human cancer development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In addition, APN is commonly used as a candidate marker for liver cancer stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, and the APN/CD13<sup>+</sup> cell population in HCC might be associated with cancer cell chemoresistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Here, we showed that high expression of APN is associated with larger tumors in HCC patients and a stronger tumor cell metastatic ability than low expression of APN.</p>
<p id="Par48">Through gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we confirmed that APN positively regulated the migration, invasion, proliferation and antiapoptotic ability of HCC cells in vitro. Furthermore, in liver tumor metastasis models, the APN knockout group exhibited less and smaller intrahepatic metastatic nodules, lower incidence of tumors spreading to other organs outside the liver, and longer experimental animal survival time. In the subcutaneous HCC xenograft tumor experiment, the tumor volumes and weights in the APN knockout group were significantly smaller than those in the control group. Therefore, our results indicate that APN plays a significant role in both HCC metastasis and proliferation.</p>
<p id="Par49">On the molecular level, our investigation uncovered the role of APN in the metastasis and proliferation of HCC by regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. As APN knockout markedly decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in this study, we thought it served as a regulator to favor ERK1/2 phosphorylation, thus activating MAPK/ERK signaling. The MAPK/ERK signal transduction pathway can be activated in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli, including mitogens, growth factors and cytokines, and researchers believe it is an important target for cancer diagnosis and treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Overexpression or activation of components of the MAPK/ERK pathway has been reported to result in tumorigenesis, disease metastasis and tumor proliferation in a variety of solid tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. We found that APN was involved in the phosphorylation of the major proteins in the phospho-ERK1/2 pathway downstream of the MAPK signal transduction pathway, rather than the p38 pathway, in HCC cells. In addition, the pro-metastatic and pro-proliferative effects of APN can be offset by treating APN overexpressing HCC cells with an ERK inhibitor and treating APN knockout HCC cells with EGF.</p>
<p id="Par50">Activated ERK regulates the target protein in the cytoplasm and can also be transported into the nucleus to phosphorylate a variety of transcription factors that regulate gene expression in the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Along with the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 regulated by APN, we found that effector proteins regulated directly or indirectly by ERK1/2 are elevated in HCC cells, including HMGA2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, PLD2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, MMP9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, GLI1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, GLI2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, SLUG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, and MDR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. These proteins are important tumor growth and metastasis promoting factors, and this conclusion is consistent with the results of recent studies: in colon cancer, HMGA2 was upregulated by activated ERK1/2 and increased the expression of the transcription factor SLUG, thereby promoting migration, invasion and proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>; in breast cancer, ERK-mediated SLUG phosphorylation could regulate PLD2 to promote cancer invasiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>; in HCC, phospho-ERK can enhance tumor metastasis and growth by activating the level of GLI1 and MMP9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>; in human lung fibroblasts, the participation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1)/MEK1/ERK1/GLI-1/GLI-2 and activator protein-1 (AP-1) signaling pathways mediated hypoxia-induced CTGF expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>; in colon cancer tissues, SMYD2-OE could upregulate MDR1 expression depending on MEK/ERK/AP-1 signaling pathway activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, we speculated that phosphorylation activation of ERK1/2 is crucial for APN-mediated HCC metastasis and growth.</p>
<p id="Par51">Given the lack of kinase activity, we postulated that APN elevates ERK1/2 phosphorylation in an indirect manner. After phosphoproteomic analyses in this study, the most significant change in SK-KO cells was a decrease in the phosphorylation of branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK) on serine 31. BCKDK is an important regulatory enzyme in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. By dephosphorylating the E1 component of the branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex and inactivating it, BCKDK played a key role in the BCAA catabolic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Abnormalities in BCKDK activity often lead to many pathological conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. A previous study suggested that BCKDK enhanced the MAPK signaling pathway by directly phosphorylating MEK and activating downstream ERK to promote the progression of colorectal cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism by which abnormal BCKDK activity is produced in the course of cancer remains unclear. Our results showed that normal BCKDK produces the same effect as BCKDK<sup>S31D</sup> when APN is present. In addition, either a normal BCKDK protein or a S31-nonphosphorylated BCKDK protein (BCKDK<sup>S31A</sup>) cannot induce the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in APN knockout SK-HEP-1 cells. However, the BCKDK protein, in which the phosphorylation of serine 31 was simulated (BCKDK<sup>S31D</sup>) can phosphorylate and activate ERK1/2 in APN knockout SK-HEP-1 cells, thereby restoring their proliferation and metastatic phenotypes in a liver orthotopic xenograft tumor model. Our Co-IP and PLA experiments showed that BCKDK can directly bind to ERK1 and ERK2. This means that in addition to activating MEK to phosphorylate ERK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, BCKDK may also directly phosphorylate ERK1/2 through its kinase activity.</p>
<p id="Par52">Here, our experiments first showed that APN mediates the phosphorylation of BCKDK on serine 31, which in turn activates ERK1/2 and promotes HCC proliferation and metastasis. BCKDK is a vital tool to assist in the homeostasis of BCAA, including valine, leucine, isoleucine, etc., while APN is capable of producing these BCAAs by enzymatically hydrolyzing its substrate polypeptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Therefore, the APN-mediated regulation of BCKDK activity in liver cancer may be related to its abnormal enzyme activity affecting BCAA catabolism homeostasis, and we plan to investigate this hypothesis in the future.</p>
<p id="Par53">In summary, we demonstrated that APN is an important oncogene that contributes to HCC metastasis and proliferation. The APN-mediated promotion of cancer development is achieved by mediating the phosphorylation of BCKDK on serine 31 and then activating the ERK1/2 signaling pathway through the direct action of BCKDK. Our results provide a basis for understanding the mechanisms of HCC progression and may be helpful to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HCC.</p>
