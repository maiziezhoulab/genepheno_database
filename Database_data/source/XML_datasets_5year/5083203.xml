<abstract>
<p id="P2">Cortico-basal ganglia circuits are critical for speech and language and are implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in which language function can be severely affected. We demonstrate that in the striatum, the gene, <italic>Foxp2</italic>, negatively interacts with the synapse suppressor, <italic>Mef2C</italic>. We present causal evidence that Mef2C inhibition by Foxp2 in neonatal mouse striatum controls synaptogenesis of corticostriatal inputs and vocalization in neonates. <italic>Mef2C</italic> suppresses corticostriatal synapse formation and striatal spinogenesis, but can, itself, be repressed by <italic>Foxp2</italic> through direct DNA binding. <italic>Foxp2</italic> deletion de-represses Mef2C, and both intrastriatal and global decrease of <italic>Mef2C</italic> rescue vocalization and striatal spinogenesis defects of <italic>Foxp2</italic>-deletion mutants. These findings suggest that Foxp2-Mef2C signaling is critical to corticostriatal circuit formation. If found in humans, such signaling defects could contribute to a range of neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p id="P3">Speech and language endow human beings with unrivalled refinement and breadth in their social communications. In ASD, these communicative abilities can be severely compromised along with other problems related to social communication and repetitive behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The neural mechanisms underlying language difficulties in ASD individuals present a challenge to neuroscientists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, but neuroimaging studies have detected aberrant neuronal activity and connectivity in the neocortex and striatum of ASD individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. We were struck by the parallels between these findings in ASD individuals and findings linking mutations of the <italic>FOXP2</italic> gene to spoken language disabilities. In both, corticostriatal dysfunction has been found along with the behavioral problems in humans and in mutant mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. We therefore sought for signaling pathways within corticostriatal circuits that could link these two functional domains.</p>
<p id="P4">Human <italic>FOXP2</italic> has been shown to interact with several known ASD-risk genes, including <italic>CNTNAP2</italic>, <italic>MET</italic> and <italic>uPAR</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, but what links <italic>FOXP2</italic> and these ASD-risk genes to specific neural circuits with defined neurological functions has not been clear. Nor is it known how such interactions could alter the development of language-related circuits in ASD brains. Given the potential involvement of the striatum in both ASD and language dysfunction, we searched for evidence that might link influences of ASD-risk genes and language-linked <italic>Foxp2</italic> during postnatal striatal development, a time of particular vulnerability in ASD. We focused on ASD candidate genes associated with synapse formation, at risk in ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. We chose for study <italic>myocyte enhancer factor 2C</italic> (<italic>MEF2C</italic>), suggested to be a possible ASD risk gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, identified as one of 175 <italic>FOXP2</italic> targets identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip analysis of human basal ganglia during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and known to be a mental retardation risk gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. <italic>Mef2C</italic> has been shown to regulate negatively dendritic spines and excitatory synapses in hippocampal neurons and in cultured striatal neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrate that <italic>Mef2C</italic> also negatively regulates synaptogenesis in the striatum <italic>in vivo</italic>, but that negative interactions between <italic>Foxp2</italic> and <italic>Mef2C</italic> lead to repression of the effects of <italic>Mef2C</italic> coinciding spatially and temporally with the development of corticostriatal connections during early postnatal development. We show that <italic>Foxp2</italic> can suppress <italic>Mef2C</italic> through direct DNA binding, and that the negative Foxp2-Mef2C signaling interactions have specific synaptic and behavioral effects including control of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in young mouse pups. We suggest that negative Foxp2-Mef2C interactions could allow cortical fibers to synapse progressively onto striatal neurons, thus building the corticostriatal pathway by de-repression of synaptogenesis in the striatum. Such Foxp2-Mef2C signaling could provide a valuable model for identifying candidate molecular mechanisms underlying developmental defects in corticostriatal circuits.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Progressive dissociation of striatal Foxp2 and Mef2C</title>
<p id="P5">We performed immunostaining for Mef2C and Foxp2 in the mouse brain with antibodies validated by the absence of corresponding immunofluorescent signals in Mef2C and Foxp2 knockout striatum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a–f</xref>). Mef2C and Foxp2 were co-localized in many individual striatal projection neurons (SPNs) at birth, but their expression patterns soon became complementary and non-overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This inverse patterning was first evident in the striosome compartment of the striatum, where we found the earliest incoming corticostriatal terminals as marked by vesicular glutamate transporters 1 (VGluT1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). During the early postnatal (P) period, P0-P4, striosomes, marked by DARPP-32, were nearly devoid of Mef2C, despite strong Mef2C expression in the surrounding matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). Strong Foxp2 expression, by contrast, was found in striosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). By P8 and P14, the inverse expression patterns of Foxp2 and Mef2C had extended across the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b,c,f</xref>), paralleled by a progressive expansion of the corticostriatal innervation from the striosomes to the entire striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a–c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, dorsolateral expansion leading slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). This striking progression from co-localization to dissociation of Mef2C and Foxp2 expression coincided with the postnatal time-period during which corticostriatal axonal collaterals arborize and the dendritic spines of SPNs develop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, suggesting that Mef2C and Foxp2 might oppositely regulate corticostriatal synapse formation.</p>

<title><italic>Foxp2</italic> and <italic>Mef2C</italic> inversely control corticostriatal synaptogenesis</title>
<p id="P6">To examine the relationship of Foxp2 and Mef2C expression to the development of the corticostriatal projection system, we analyzed synaptogenesis in <italic>Mef2C</italic> knockout (<italic>Nestin-Cre;Mef2C<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and <italic>Foxp2</italic> knockout (<italic>Foxp2<sup>−/−</sup></italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> mice, and also in <italic>Foxp2</italic> humanized (<italic>Foxp2<sup>H/H</sup></italic>) mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> as a gain-of-function model. We identified corticostriatal synapses with VGluT1 as a pre-synaptic marker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) as post-synaptic markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1g</xref>). We focused on P12-P14, by which time Foxp2 was expressed throughout the striatum and Mef2C was nearly absent except far medially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>).</p>
<p id="P7">In the <italic>Foxp2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> knockout mice, western blots of striatal VGluT1 and PSD-95 proteins and immunostaining of striatal GluR1 showed that these synaptic markers all were reduced relative to those in wildtype mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a–c</xref>), but these markers were increased in the humanized <italic>Foxp2<sup>H/H</sup></italic> striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2d–f</xref>), suggesting that Foxp2 positively regulates striatal synaptogenesis. By contrast, <italic>Mef2C</italic> negatively regulated striatal synaptogenesis. VGluT1 and PSD-95 proteins and GluR1 immunostaining significantly increased in the striatum of <italic>Nestin-Cre;Mef2C<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> conditional <italic>Mef2C</italic> knockout mice relative to control <italic>Nestin-Cre;Mef2C<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2g–i</xref>). Thus, Foxp2 and Mef2C had opposite effects on synaptogenesis in the developing striatum.</p>
<p id="P8">Markers of striosomes (µ-opioid receptor 1, MOR1) and of the matrix (calcium and diacylglycerol-guanine nucleotide exchange factor I, CalDAG-GEFI) showed that striosome-matrix compartmentation was maintained in the three genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a–f</xref>). No abnormal cell death was found in P0 or P8 <italic>Foxp2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> knockouts, nor in <italic>Nestin-Cre;Mef2C<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> knockout mice at embryonic day (E) 18.5 and P8, as assayed by TUNEL staining and immunostaining for activated caspase3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3i–r</xref>). The alterations in synaptic markers were thus likely not secondary to loss of compartmentation or to widespread cell death in the mutant mice.</p>

<sec id="S5">
<title><italic>Foxp2</italic> and <italic>Mef2C</italic> oppositely regulate SPN spinogenesis</title>
<p id="P9">The dendritic spines of striatal SPNs are the main sites of corticostriatal synapses. We examined the development of these synapses in the three mouse genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d–f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1–3</xref>). Golgi-staining in P12 <italic>Foxp2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> knockout mice showed reductions in the total spine density of SPNs of 14.0% dorsolaterally and 19.1% dorsomedially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In heterozygous <italic>Foxp2<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice, only the most mature spine types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), a finding potentially relevant to pathophysiology in KE patients, who carry heterozygous <italic>FOXP2<sup>R553H</sup></italic> missense mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In the positive control mice carrying humanized <italic>Foxp2<sup>H/H</sup></italic>, SPN spine densities were increased both dorsolaterally and dorsomedially relative to those in wildtype littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). We microinjected HSV-Cre-GFP viruses into the striatum of P2 <italic>Foxp2<sup>H/H</sup></italic> mice carrying floxed human versions of <italic>Foxp2</italic> alleles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Immunostaining demonstrated a loss of Foxp2 protein expression in HSV-Cre-GFP virus-infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5d–e</xref>), and this postnatal deletion of <italic>Foxp2<sup>H/H</sup></italic> decreased spines by 68% in HSV-Cre-GFP virus-infected SPNs at P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). These findings suggested that Foxp2 positively regulated synaptogenesis, but that Mef2C negatively regulated synaptogenesis, as found in hippocampal neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P10">We used <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation to over-express mouse <italic>Foxp2</italic> gene in wildtype striatal cells. Introduction of Foxp2 plasmid co-expressing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) into the E13.5 striatal primordium increased dendritic spine numbers as tested by EYFP/GFP immunostaining of P14 SPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). Conversely, spine density was significantly increased in striatal SPNs in <italic>Nestin-Cre;Mef2C<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> conditional knockouts relative to control <italic>Nestin-Cre;Mef2C<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice for all but the least mature subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p id="P11">We also microinjected HSV-Cre-GFP virus into the striatum of P2 <italic>Mef2C<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> pups and examined their brains at P8. Immunostaining confirmed loss of Mef2C protein expression in HSV-Cre-GFP virus-infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a–c</xref>) and indicated significant increases in spine counts in the HSV-Cre-GFP virus-infected SPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>). Intrastriatal injection of HSV-Cre-GFP viruses in Mef2C<sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice at P14–15, when Mef2C expression already was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>), showed no detectable changes in dendritic spines of SPNs at P19-P20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3j</xref>). Finally, we over-expressed <italic>Mef2C</italic> by <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation of pcBIG-Mef2C–VP16 plasmids into the E12.5 striatal primoridum of wildtypes. This procedure decreased the number of spines in P14 SPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3k</xref>). These findings identify Mef2C as a negative regulator of spine and synapse formation in SPNs of the developing postnatal striatum, consonant with <italic>in vitro</italic> work on Mef2-class proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P12">In slice preparations, we analyzed miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) of dorsolateral SPNs in <italic>Foxp2<sup>H/H</sup></italic>, <italic>Foxp2</italic> knockout, and <italic>Nestin-Cre;Mef2C<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> knockout brains relative to their wildtype controls. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings indicated an increase in mEPSC frequency in 36.2% of SPNs in P14 <italic>Foxp2<sup>H/H</sup></italic> mice without significant change in mEPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3l</xref>). In P8 <italic>Foxp2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> knockout mice, mEPSC frequency was decreased in SPNs, but mEPSC amplitude was increased compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3m</xref>). In P14 <italic>Nestin-Cre;Mef2C<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> knockout brains, mEPSC frequency, but not amplitude, was increased in SPNs relative to control Nestin-Cre;Mef2C<sup>+/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3n</xref>). These findings demonstrated that synaptic activity in striatal SPNs is positively regulated by Foxp2, but negatively regulated by Mef2C, consistent with our anatomical findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Tables 1–3</xref>).</p>

<title>Foxp2 suppresses Mef2C expression in striatal SPNs</title>
<p id="P13">The opposing functions of <italic>Mef2C</italic> and <italic>Foxp2</italic> in regulating corticostriatal synapse formation and SPN spinogenesis, and their striking spatiotemporal dissociation during neonatal development, suggested that the positive regulation of spine and synapse formation in striatal SPNs by Foxp2 might depend on its ability to suppress <italic>Mef2C</italic>. As an initial probe for this potential interaction, we asked whether the near-absence of Mef2C expression in striosomes in the normal neonatal striatum could be reversed by deletion of <italic>Foxp2</italic>.

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p id="P25">Our findings provide causal evidence that Mef2C is directly implicated in the conjoint deleterious behavioral and morphological effects of reductions in Foxp2. We demonstrate that Mef2C is a negative regulator of synapse formation in the projection neurons of the developing striatum, and that Mef2C expression is itself a direct target of gene suppression by the <italic>Foxp2</italic> gene in these neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Thus Foxp2, by negatively regulating Mef2C, can promote the formation of the massive corticostriatal connectivity that is known to be functionally important in behavior.</p>
<p id="P26">Our findings suggest that Foxp2 acts in the early postnatal period by coordinately promoting corticostriatal synaptogenesis and retarding the expression of Mef2C in the striatum. Deletion of Foxp2 increased neonatal striatal Mef2C expression and, in parallel, decreased corticostriatal synaptogenesis and spinogenesis of striatal SPNs. Engineered expression of humanized Foxp2 in mouse had opposite effects on the developing corticostriatal circuits and striatal neurons. Our evidence that canonical Foxp2 binding sites are required for the Foxp2 inhibition of Mef2C expression suggests that there are direct molecular interactions between Foxp2 and Mef2C. We found that intrastriatal as well as genome-wide decreases in Mef2C can rescue defects in USVs and striatal spinogenesis otherwise occurring in <italic>Foxp2</italic> mutants. Finally, our study of USVs suggests that these Foxp2-Mef2C interactions exert orchestrated control over corticostriatal systems affecting social vocalization in neonates. Our findings are based on mouse models, and so might not be relevant to clinical conditions. Given that <italic>MEF2C</italic> has been suggested to be an ASD candidate risk gene and is known to be a gene related to mental retardation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, and that <italic>FOXP2</italic> has been identified as a language-associated gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, a plausible hypothesis raised by our findings is that the Foxp2-Mef2C interactions we demonstrate here, and their profound effects on corticostriatal circuitry, could be relevant to mechanisms underlying spoken language dysfunction in ASD. More generally, such interactions, controlling the development of the corticostriatal system, could be relevant to a range of normal and abnormal functions in which this massive corticostriatal circuitry has been implicated clinically, notably including Huntington’s disease.</p>

<title>Foxp2-Mef2C control of USVs and corticostriatal circuit</title>
<p id="P27">The potential behavioral significance of interactions between Foxp2 and Mef2C was demonstrated by assays of USVs in mice that lacked one allele of <italic>Foxp2</italic> and one allele of <italic>Mef2C</italic> (<italic>Dlx5/6-Cre;Foxp2<sup>+/−</sup>;Mef2C<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> mice).

The USV and spine formation deficits were also partially rescued by selective early postnatal reduction of Mef2C. While not ruling out other contributions, these findings support the striatal specificity of Foxp2-Mef2C interactions in regulating synaptogenesis in SPNs and vocalization behavior of the pups. We also found a clear correlation between synaptic alterations in <italic>Dlx5/6-Cre;Foxp2<sup>+/−</sup>;Mef2C<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (<italic>Foxp2</italic> heterozygotes) and the USV deficits in these mice, further linking anatomical and functional control by Foxp2-Mef2C signaling.</p>

<title>Foxp2 as a molecular key to unlock Mef2C–induced inhibition</title>
<p id="P28">Our findings demonstrate that interactions between <italic>Foxp2</italic> and <italic>Mef2C</italic> are required for establishing the normal synaptic connectivity of corticostriatal circuits. In the hippocampus, Mef2 protein interacts with the ASD-risk genes, <italic>FMRP</italic> and <italic>Pcdh10</italic>, to induce degradation of PSD-95 protein for elimination of excitatory synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. This work suggests a central role for Mef2 in negative regulation of hippocampal synapses. Our findings identify Foxp2 as a molecular key to unlock the inhibition of striatal synapse formation imposed by Mef2C, thereby allowing the initiation of synaptic connectivity of corticostriatal circuits within the striatum. Our data support a postnatal role, as early as P2, for Foxp2-mediated repression of Mef2C in the regulation of spinogenesis. As spines start to grow in postnatal SPNs, Mef2C, which inhibits spine formation, presumably must be down-regulated to permit the progression of spine formation in SPNs. The gradual decrease in Mef2C in the postnatal striatum and the maintenance of these low levels at least until P14 are consistent with this hypothesis. The evidence of increased spine formation in SPNs by postnatal deletion of <italic>Mef2C</italic> gene at P2 further supports this working model. Our experiments did not clarify whether Mef2C acts to prune exuberant striatal SPN synapses or to inhibit synapse formation in these SPNs. However, given our observation that Mef2C is strongly expressed in striatal matrix SPNs before these SPNs are innervated by corticostriatal axon terminals in newborn striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), an intriguing possibility is that Mef2C functions as a molecular gate to prevent immature synapse formation unless it is triggered by an appropriate input. This gate-control role for Mef2C would suggest that a rigorously timed and specific molecular mechanism is implemented for developmental control of synaptic wiring of corticostriatal circuits. We suggest that Foxp2 inhibition of Mef2C could provide such a mechanism, potentially through direct DNA binding of Foxp2 to <italic>Mef2C</italic>, and that defects in this inhibition by Foxp2 could have deleterious effects.</p>

Thin spine and filopodia were included in the same group as spine/filopodia, because it was difficult to distinguish them with light microscopy. Atypical spines were those that could not be assigned to a specific group. Spines were categorized as ‘stubby’ if the diameter of the neck was similar to the total length of the spine. Spines were categorized as ‘thin/filopodia’ if the length was longer than the neck diameter, and the diameters of the head and neck were similar or the head-neck ratio was less than two. Spines were categorized as ‘mushroom’ if the diameter of the head was at least 2.5 fold the diameter of the neck. Spines were categorized as ‘branched’ spines if they had two heads and as ‘multiple-branched’ if they had more than two heads. For photomicrographic illustration of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d–f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a–c</xref>), the images were processed with the AutoQuant de-convolution software (Media Cybernetics) to de-blur the images caused by spines oriented in different depths of focal planes.</p>

<title>Microscopic image analyses</title>
<p id="P56">Photomicrographs were acquired using Olympus BX51, BX63 fluorescence microscopes and a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope. Quantification of cell number was performed with the aid of Image J software. For comparison between the brains with different genotypes, we analyzed photomicrographs at matched anatomical levels. Fluorescence intensity was measured for single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>) or in the region of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g–i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) using the RGB measure plugins of ImageJ. For quantification of striatal compartmentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a–h</xref>), the sum of MOR1-positive striosome areas or CalDAG-GEFI-poor matrix areas was normalized with the total striatal area. For quantification of Foxp2- or Mef2C–positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), Foxp2- or Mef2C–positive cells were counted in six 0.05-mm<sup>2</sup> squares that were placed evenly in the striatum of each section, and the cell numbers averaged over 3 sections, from rostral to caudal striatal levels, were analyzed with statistical tests described below.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p id="P57">No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those generally employed in the field. For small number of samples, we assumed normal distribution because the number of samples was too small for normality tests. Statistical analyses for the data of cell counts, dendritic spine counts, and biochemical and immunochemical measurements of protein levels were done with <italic>Student’s</italic> two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Statistical analysis for electrophysiological data was done with Origin (V 8.6, OriginLab; Northampton, USA), by Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test and <italic>Student’s</italic> two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test. Statistical analysis for the USV data was performed with SPSS (IBM, version 21). The USV data were first assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normal distribution exploration. Normally distributed data were processed with one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test for post hoc comparisons between two groups. For the data sets without normal distributions, the data were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn’s pairwise multiple comparisons test between two groups. All statistical data were presented as mean ± s.e.m. A supplementary methods checklist is available.</p>
