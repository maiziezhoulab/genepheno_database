<p id="Par1">Chromatin remodelers have emerged as prominent regulators of epigenetic processes and potential drivers of various human pathologies. The multi-subunit chromatin-remodeling SWI/SNF complex determines gene expression programs and, consequently, contributes to the differentiation, maturation and plasticity of neurons. Here, we investigate the elusive biological function of Bcl7a and Bcl7b, two newly identified subunits of the SWI/SNF complex that are highly expressed throughout the brain. We generated ubiquitous and neuron-specific Bcl7a and Bcl7b single and double knockout mice. We provide evidence that Bcl7b is dispensable for animal survival as well as behavioral plasticity. Conversely, ubiquitous Bcl7a knockout results in perinatal lethality, while genetic deletion of <italic>Bcl7a</italic> in postmitotic neurons elicits motor abnormalities and affects dendritic branching of Purkinje cells, with no obvious synergistic relationship with Bcl7b. Collectively, our findings reveal novel insights into the cellular processes linked to BCL7-containing SWI/SNF complexes and their unrecognized roles in the brain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Chromatin structure regulates the accessibility to the genetic material. Multiple expression programs are established through the remodeling of chromatin components and the recruitment of the transcriptional machinery at target DNA sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. As a scaffolding unit of chromatin, each nucleosome comprises 147 bp of DNA coiled around particles of two copies each of histone H2A, H2B, H3 and H4.</p>
<p id="Par3">Chromatin remodeling complexes modulate the chromatin status primarily by affecting histone-DNA interactions. The SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermenting (SWI/SNF) complex is one of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers in eukaryotic cells. Initially characterized in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, the purified yeast SWI/SNF is a large multi-subunit complex of approximately 1.1 MDa and consists of eleven distinct polypeptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The catalytic core subunit Swi2/Snf2 has an ATP-dependent helicase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, while the other elements possess regulatory domains that control enzymatic activity, facilitate the binding to chromatin and confer functional specificity to the complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Following ATP hydrolysis, the SWI/SNF complex efficiently stimulates chromatin remodeling through the displacement and eviction of histones and exposure of nucleosomal DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Ultimately, the yeast SWI/SNF dictates the expression of a large subset of inducible genes through the recruitment of the transcriptional machinery</p>
<p id="Par4">The composition of SWI/SNF complexes underwent significant changes during metazoan evolution. While the yeast SWI/SNF complex positively enhances transcriptional activity in yeast, mammalian SWI/SNF complexes can both repress or activate target genes. As a response to the increased chromatin organization of multicellular organisms, SWI/SNF complexes gained and replaced distinct components, thus acquiring specialized activity and selectivity towards targeted genes. Contrary to its yeast counterpart, mammalian SWI/SNF complexes, also known as BAF (Brg/Brahma-associated factors) complexes, are heterogeneous and incorporate cell-type and developmental-specific subunits. The two mutually exclusive ATPases, SMARCA4/BRG1 (Brahma-related gene 1) and SMARCA2/BRM (Brahma), associate with various factors. The 2MDa polymorphic arrays include the five yeast homologs plus novel associated subunits gained during the course of evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Although isolated BRG1 and BRM are sufficient to promote ATP-dependent reactions, the reconstitution of the complex with the conserved subunits further stimulates nucleosome shift <italic>in-vitro</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In mammalian cells, the functional core unit consists of one of the two highly homologous BRG1 and BRM enzymes, together with BAF250a/b, BAF170/BAF155, BAF60a/b/c, BAF57, BAF53a/b, BAF47 and actin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. New additional non-exchangeable components of the SWI/SNF complexes were recently identified using proteomic-based approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, considerably increasing the number of theoretical combinatorial assemblies with potential biological significance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. As a distinct feature, mammalian SWI/SNF complexes seem to perform very specialized functions and critically control cell lineage specification.</p>
<p id="Par5">Given its importance in stemness and cell lineage commitment, it is perhaps not surprising that either inherited or arising <italic>de novo</italic> mutations have been associated with human pathologies, with nearly 20% of all human cancers harbouring a mutation in at least one of the SWI/SNF subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. One unifying interpretation is that aberrant residual SWI/SNF assemblies drive oncogenic processes through a dysregulated transcriptional state of the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Besides its tumor suppressor function, dominant mutations of SWI/SNF components have been also implicated in severe intellectual disabilities, including Coffin-Siris and Nicolaides-Baraitser syndromes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, altered SWI/SNF complex function seems to be causally linked to neurologic disorders in humans. In line with this possibility, a wealth of recent work in model organisms supports a fundamental role of the SWI/SNF complex in neurodevelopment and cognition (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>). In the nervous system, the tightly regulated recruitment of specific SWI/SNF assemblies allows for the engagement of transcriptional programs that ultimately results in diversified expression patterns. Consistently, the precise composition of these assemblies endows pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, while the exchange of certain dedicated subunits induces the transition to terminally differentiated neurons, further highlighting the little biological redundancy of these complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Despite the relevance of these biological aspects, the importance of individual SWI/SNF complexes in animal behavior and brain function has been only marginally addressed.</p>
<p id="Par6">The B-cell lymphoma/leukemia protein 7 A (or B-cell CLL/lymphoma 7 A protein) was initially cloned from a chromosomal translocation in a Burkitt lymphoma cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The BCL7-family members possess a distinctive N-terminal domain evolutionarily conserved throughout the animal kingdom, whereas there is little homology between family members in the remaining sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. This might result in functional divergences of the isoforms. Through independent proteomic approaches, the three human BCL7 proteins were purified as novel, non-exchangeable subunits of the SWI/SNF complex, in a stoichiometry very similar to other well-established components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Prior studies in invertebrates suggest a role of BCL7-like proteins as a transcriptional regulatory component of WNT/Wingless and Notch signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Yet, our knowledge on the molecular function of BCL7 proteins lags behind. Here, we sought to determine the importance of Bcl7-containing SWI/SNF complexes in the brain. As both <italic>Bcl7a</italic> and <italic>Bcl7b</italic> are highly expressed throughout the mouse brain, we generated conditional single and double knockout mice. We show that neuron-specific Bcl7a deficiency alters the highly branched dendritic trees of cerebellar Purkinje cells and impairs motor skills, whereas Bcl7b knockout has no obvious effect on animal survival and behavior. Taken together, our findings describe the contribution of Bcl7a and Bcl7b in mouse survival and brain physiology.</p>

<title>Bcl7a, but not Bcl7b, is required for mouse survival</title>
<p id="Par7">Since distinct chromatin remodelers regulate neural stem cell states, neuronal differentiation and plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, we sought to characterize the importance of Bcl7 isoforms in the mouse brain. As a first step, we tested whether the three <italic>Bcl7</italic> genes are expressed in the central nervous system. We performed quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) in samples from different mouse brain areas and lung (as a non-neuronal tissue). We detected <italic>Bcl7a/b/c</italic> mRNA in all the analyzed tissues, albeit <italic>Bcl7a</italic> and <italic>Bcl7b</italic> were much more expressed compared to <italic>Bcl7c</italic>, reaching an above 100-fold difference in the cerebellum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1A,B</xref>). Both <italic>Bcl7a</italic> and <italic>Bcl7b</italic> mRNAs were detected in neuronal and glial cells (data not shown). Next, we assessed the expression and subcellular localization of Bcl7a and Bcl7b proteins. We found a clear nuclear staining in various areas of brains from postnatal and adult animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1C,D</xref> and Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1A,B</xref>). Since <italic>Bcl7a</italic> and <italic>Bcl7b</italic> are abundantly expressed in the nervous system, we generated transgenic mice carrying floxed <italic>Bcl7a</italic>, <italic>Bcl7b</italic> and <italic>Bcl7a; Bcl7b</italic> alleles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1E,F</xref>). Mice harboring either <italic>Bcl7a</italic> or <italic>Bcl7b</italic> floxed alleles were crossed with a line ubiquitously expressing the bacterial Cre-recombinase (i.e., CMV-Cre<sup>tg/wt</sup>). While Bcl7b full knockout mice were obtained in a Mendelian manner (data not shown), ubiquitous Cre-mediated deletion of <italic>Bcl7a</italic> resulted in viable E16.5 embryos at almost expected distribution, however only approximately 4% of Bcl7a deficient pups survived until weaning and into adulthood (Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1C</xref>). We regularly surveyed pregnant females until parturition and recovered only a few partially consumed carcasses. Histological analyses of Bcl7a-deficient offspring as well as of E19.5-E20.5 embryos showed no obvious abnormalities. We speculate that newborn <italic>Bcl7a</italic>
<sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> pups fail to initiate normal respiration or to feed properly. To validate the successful Cre-mediated recombination of the floxed alleles, we performed qRT-PCR and showed the impaired expression of <italic>Bcl7a</italic> and <italic>Bcl7b</italic> mRNAs in the respective knockout animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1G,H</xref>). Consistent with our gene targeting strategy, Cre-mediated ablation caused the loss of Bcl7b (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1D</xref> and Supplemental Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1B</xref>) and Bcl7a proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1I,K</xref>). Of note, a monoclonal antibody recognized a 25 kDa band in immonoblots of tissue from both wild type and knockout brains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1I</xref>), although this band was absent in both wt and Bcl7a KO primary cortical neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1K</xref>). Based on our antibody validation (unpublished data) and pre-absorption experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1J</xref>), we can assert that the band is non-specific. Conversely, none of the tested Bcl7b antibodies were specific in immunoblot experiments (data not shown). In summary, our findings indicate that Bcl7a, but not Bcl7b, is required for mouse survival.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Bcl7a and Bcl7b are highly expressed in the mouse brain.

<title>Genetic ablation of <italic>Bcl7b</italic> does not compromise animal behavior</title>
<p id="Par8">To gain insights into the biology of Bcl7-family members, first we assessed animals lacking Bcl7b, given its high expression levels in the adult mouse brain. In general, <italic>Bcl7b</italic>
<sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> animals developed normally and did not differ from control littermates regarding body weight (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2A</xref>) and the overall brain morphology (data not shown). Behavioral experiments were performed with wild type and <italic>Bcl7b</italic>
<sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> male and female mice. Since we did not detect major sex differences in any of the behavioral parameters tested (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2A</xref>–<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">E</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), those data were pooled for the respective genotypes. In the open field test, <italic>Bcl7b</italic>
<sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> animals showed no alterations in locomotor activity levels or exploratory behavior (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2B,C</xref>). Also, loss of Bcl7b did not lead to motor coordination deficits as assessed via the rotarod test (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2D</xref>). When tested in the Morris water maze (MWM), a well-established test for spatial learning and memory, <italic>Bcl7b</italic>
<sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> mice performed similar to wild type animals in terms of swim speed, gradually decreasing escape latencies and swim distances (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2E,G</xref>). Likewise, no differences were seen in short- and long-term memory probe trials since both genotypes showed a similar preference for the target quadrant as well as comparable numbers of platform position crossings (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2H,I</xref>). As another hippocampus-dependent task, we then assessed contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Here, <italic>Bcl7b</italic>
<sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> mice did not differ from control littermates regarding contextual fear memory retrieval assessed 24 h after the conditioning trial (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2J</xref>). Based on our first set of data, it seems that Bcl7b does not severely compromise motor coordination and memory formation.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Genetic ablation of <italic>Bcl7b</italic> does not impair motor coordination or cognitive function.

In neurons, it was previously shown that BAF170 and BAF155 take part in brain development, since they influence Pax6-dependent neurogenesis and, consequently, cortical thickness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Similarly, BAF53b is required for the correct targeting of the SWI/SNF complex to genes involved in dendritic outgrowth during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Mice expressing mutant Baf53b with a deletion of the C-terminal hydrophobic domain as well as <italic>Baf53</italic>
<sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> animals show deficits in hippocampus-dependent spatial long-term memory formation. These cognitive deficits were accompanied by altered long-term potentiation and abnormalities in dendritic spine structure such as a decreased ratio of thin- and mushroom-type spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Despite their relevance in biology and medicine, so far only a limited number of studies have addressed the contribution of individual SWI/SNF complex components in the maintenance and plasticity of postmitotic neurons. In this exciting context, we sought to unveil the role of Bcl7a and Bcl7b, two newly recognized subunits of the SWI/SNF complex with unknown biological function. First, we assessed their expression levels and subcellular localization in the mouse brain. We show that Bcl7a and Bcl7b are nuclear proteins that are abundantly expressed throughout different brain areas. Using a small sized animal cohort, we provide the first line of evidence that ubiquitous <italic>Bcl7b</italic> knockout does not considerably affect animal survival and behavioral function. Conversely, the ubiquitous deletion of <italic>Bcl7a</italic> leads to perinatal lethality, with very few <italic>Bcl7a</italic>
<sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> escapers surviving until adulthood, which seem to have a normal wild type phenotype. At the current stage, however, we cannot rule out the possibility that these animals are somatic mosaic mutants. Furthermore, we describe the tissue-specific contribution of Bcl7a and Bcl7b to motor coordination and cognitive function. We report that genetic deletion of <italic>Bcl7a</italic> alleles in postmitotic neurons causes motor coordination impairment as indicated by significantly lower fall latencies in the rotarod test. Much to our surprise, we did not observe any differences regarding spatial learning and memory formation in single and double knockout mice compared to control littermates. Although we cannot rule out that the impaired motor function seen following neuron-specific deletion of <italic>Bcl7a</italic> affects the analysis of some behavioral tests to a certain extend (e.g. the MWM), we believe that loss of Bcl7a and/or Bcl7b has no major effect on spatial learning and memory function <italic>per se</italic>. In support of this notion, no major differences were seen in the hippocampus-dependent contextual fear-conditioning paradigm, suggesting that spatial memory-associated processes are intact in <italic>Bcl7a</italic>
<sup><italic>nKO</italic></sup> and B<italic>cl7</italic>
<sup><italic>nDKO</italic></sup> mice.</p>
<p id="Par13">As dendritic defects are common features of animals expressing mutated chromatin remodeling proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, we assessed the effect of Bcl7 deficiency on the dendritic complexity of Purkinje neurons, which are considered as the main output structure of the cerebellum. We found that neuron-specific Bcl7a knockout significantly reduced Purkinje cell arborization with no synergistic effects of Bcl7b deficiency, resembling the lack of additive responses on motor coordination following Bcl7a and Bcl7b loss. As recombination in Synapsin-Cre transgenic mice does not take place in neural progenitor cells, it seems that neuron-specific <italic>Bcl7a</italic> deletion has no effect on either the differentiation or the survival of cerebellar neurons. It may be that, upon neural commitment, Bcl7a becomes an auxiliary factor in certain neuronal subtypes. Future work is necessary to determine whether Bcl7a knockout in progenitor cells might lead to a more severe neuronal dysfunction in adult animals. Definitely, our neuron-specific single and double knockout animals show a relatively subtle phenotype compared to other chromatin remodeling mutants, such as <italic>Snf2h</italic> deficient mice, where Purkinje cells and granule neurons exhibit multiple defects that ultimately compromise their differentiation and survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par14">How does Bcl7a influence neuronal function? We have recently found that BCL7A knockout alters the expression of SWI/SNF complex subunits and compromises its binding to target transcriptional start sites in human tumorigenic cell lines (unpublished findings). Extending this concept to neurons, it is plausible to imagine that BCL7A knockout might affect gene transcription and, consequently, neuronal function because of diminished expression of, among others, BAF170 and BAF53, two SWI/SNF complex subunits that critically regulate neurogenesis and dendritic branching, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Our current data suggests that Purkinje neurons rely on Bcl7a for their correct development and/or maintenance. Given the limitation in terms of material and <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches, we attempted to recapitulate some of our findings in dissociated cortical and cerebellar granule neurons derived from control and knockout littermates. Disappointingly, in these cultured cells we could not identify any major phenotypic defects, including dendritic growth and branching as well as the response to excitatory stimuli (data not shown). Further work is required to understand how Bcl7a deficiency affects the SWI/SNF complex in a subset of cerebellar neurons (i.e., Purkinje cells).</p>
<p id="Par15">Thus, although our descriptive work does not provide any molecular mechanism underlying Bcl7a-mediated neuronal dysfunction, our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings clearly indicate that the loss of one single SWI/SNF component (i.e., Bcl7a) cannot be compensated for by other alternative chromatin remodeling complexes or variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Importantly, our data reveal that Bcl7a contributes to cerebellar plasticity, whereas neuron-specific loss of Bcl7a and Bcl7b has no major effect on spatial memory-related tasks, expanding our knowledge about the specialized roles of SWI/SNF assemblies in high-order brain functions.</p>

<title>Animal work</title>
<p id="Par16">All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the institutional animal welfare guidelines and were approved by the State Agency for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Mice were kept in groups of three in individual ventilated cages (Tecniplast) under standard ambient conditions (22 °C, 60% humidity) and a 12-hour light/dark-cycle (lights on at 6 a.m.). They had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to rodent chow (ssniff<bold>®</bold> V1534-300) and tab water. All behavioral testing was done during the animals’ light phase between 9:00 and 17:00.</p>

<title>Behavioral tests</title>
<p id="Par18">Behavioral analysis of <italic>Bcl7b</italic>
<sup><italic>KO/KO</italic></sup> animals was done in male and female mice. <italic>Bcl7b</italic>
<sup><italic>wt/wt</italic></sup>, CMV-Cre<sup>wt/wt</sup> and <italic>Bcl7b</italic>
<sup><italic>wt/wt</italic></sup>, CMV-Cre<sup>tg/wt</sup> animals were used as littermate controls. In the case of conditional <italic>Bcl7a</italic>
<sup><italic>nKO</italic></sup> and <italic>Bcl7</italic>
<sup><italic>nDKO</italic></sup> mice, behavioral tests were performed with males, and littermates carrying the floxed alleles but not the Synapsin-Cre transgene were used as controls. Prior to behavioral testing, mice were handled daily for seven days. Testing started when the mice were between 10 and 12 weeks old. To minimize the effects of previous tests on subsequent behavior, we performed the behavioral test battery in a specific order in which the less stressful tests preceded the more stressful ones. The individual behavioral tests were separated by one week. <italic>Open field</italic>. Spontaneous locomotor activity and exploratory behavior was assessed in open field boxes (27 cm × 27 cm × 27 cm) in an evenly lit room. Each mouse was placed individually in the centre of the box and its behavior was recorded for 20 min. The distance moved (cm), velocity (cm/s) as well as the time (s) spent in the centre of the box (a commonly used index for anxiety) were analysed using the EthoVision tracking system (Noldus, The Netherlands). <italic>Catwalk</italic>. Gait analysis of freely moving mice was performed with the CatWalk system (Noldus). Briefly, the CatWalk instrument consists of a glass walkway enclosed by dark plastic walls, a fluorescence lamp which emits light inside the glass plate, a high speed colour camera as well as a recording and analysis software. The recordings were carried out in the dark. Each mouse was placed individually in the CatWalk walkway and allowed to move freely and traverse from one side to the other. Where the mouse paw made contact with the glass plate, light was reflected down and the illuminated contact areas were recorded with a high-speed camera positioned underneath the glass plate. Mice were tested over four consecutive days with three blocks of two runs per day. After each block of runs, the animals were put back into their home cages and allowed to rest for 90 min. Trials in which the mouse stopped or changed the direction were excluded from subsequent analysis, and six uninterrupted trials with a maximum speed variation of 30% were analysed and averaged to obtain the final gait analysis value. Parameters such as stride length (cm), swing speed (cm/s), stand and paw overlap were measured using the CatWalk system software (Noldus). <italic>Rotarod</italic>. Motor coordination was assessed using a rotarod system (TSE Systems, Bad Homburg, Germany). Mice were trained to remain on the rod, which rotated with accelerating speed (4 to 40 rpm), over four consecutive days with three daily sessions and a maximum session duration of 5 min. A 30 min break was given between individual training sessions. When a mouse fell from the rod, infrared light beams at the bottom of the chamber were interrupted allowing for the measurement of the fall latency (s). <italic>Morris water maze</italic>. MWM is a commonly used behavioral test to assess hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory in rodents. Here, the test apparatus consisted of a white circular swimming pool (150 cm in diameter) filled with water that was maintained at 22 °C and made opaque with white paint. A transparent Plexiglas platform was positioned in a fixed location in the pool and submerged 0.5 cm below the water surface. Mice were trained to locate the platform position over five consecutive days with two to three blocks of two trials per day and a maximum trial duration of 60 s. Between each block of trials, animals were allowed to rest for at least 90 min. The starting positions were semi-randomized so that each trial started from a different quadrant. Short-term memory was tested in a 60 s probe trial 90 min after the last block of training trials on day 3, while long-term memory was assessed on day 6, 24 h after the last training session. During training sessions, the latency to find the platform (escape latency, s), the swim speed (cm/s) as well as the swim distance (cm) were analyzed using a video tracking system (EthoVision, Noldus, The Netherlands). Memory performance during probe trials was assessed via the time spent in the target compared to non-target quadrants (quadrant occupancy) as well as the number of platform position crossings. <italic>Three-chambered social interaction test</italic>. The three-chambered social test apparatus consisted of an acrylic box (63 cm × 42 cm × 23 cm) that was divided into three chambers with two acrylic walls. The dividing walls had retractable doors allowing access into each chamber. A wire cup made out of cylindric chrome bars (10 cm H, 10 cm in diameter) was used to restrain the stranger mouse. At the beginning of each trial, test mice were confined in the centre chamber, and a trial was initiated by opening the doors to the side chambers. During the habituation phase, an empty wire cup was placed into each side chamber and the mouse was allowed to explore all three chambers freely for 10 min. Thereafter, the mouse was placed back into the centre chamber with the doors to the side chambers closed. For the subsequent social interaction trial, an unfamiliar mouse was placed into the wire cup in one of the side chambers while an object was placed into the cup of the other side chamber. The location of the social interaction partner and the object were pseudo-randomized throughout the test sessions. The social interaction trial lasted 10 min, and the time spent in each chamber was video-recorded and analysed by an automatic tracking program (EthoVision, Noldus, The Netherlands). All stranger mice were habituated to being enclosed in the wire cups for 5 min daily two days before the experiment. <italic>Contextual fear conditioning</italic>. Fear conditioning was conducted in transparent plastic boxes (21.5 × 20 × 25 cm) with stainless-steel grid floors connected to an aversive stimulator (Med Associates). For fear conditioning, mice were placed individually into the chamber and allowed to habituate for 2 min. Thereafter, three shocks (0.75 mA, 2 s) with an inter-shock interval of 60 s were delivered. Animals were removed from the boxes 60 s after the last shock and placed back into their home cages. In order to examine memory retrieval, mice were re-introduced into the chambers 24 h after the conditioning procedure for 5 min without the presentation of foot shocks. During fear conditioning and retrieval, mice were video recorded and the time spent freezing was analysed.</p>

<sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> and <italic>Bcl7b</italic>
<sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice were generated by the inGenious Targeting Laboratory (USA).
