<abstract>
<p id="P2">By meta-analyzing rare coding variants in whole-exome sequences of 4,133 schizophrenia cases and 9,274 controls, de novo mutations in 1,077 trios, and copy number variants from 6,882 cases and 11,255 controls, we show that individuals with schizophrenia carry a significant burden of rare damaging variants in 3,488 genes previously identified as having a near-complete depletion of loss-of-function variants. In schizophrenia patients who also have intellectual disability, this burden is concentrated in risk genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. After excluding known neurodevelopmental disorder risk genes, a significant rare variant burden persists in other loss-of-function intolerant genes, and while this effect is notably stronger in schizophrenia patients with intellectual disability, it is also seen in patients who do not have intellectual disability. Together, our results show that rare damaging variants contribute to the risk of schizophrenia both with and without intellectual disability, and support an overlap of genetic risk between schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="P3">Schizophrenia is a common and debilitating psychiatric illness characterized by positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech and behaviour), negative symptoms (social withdrawal and diminished emotional expression), and cognitive impairment that result in social and occupational dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>. Operational diagnostic criteria for the disorder as described in the DSM-V require the presence of at least two of the core symptoms over a period of six months with at least one month of active symptoms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>. It is increasingly recognized that current categorical psychiatric classifications have a number of shortcomings, in particular that they overlook the increasing evidence for etiological and mechanistic overlap between psychiatric disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>.</p>
<p id="P4">A diverse range of pathophysiological processes may contribute to the clinical features of schizophrenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>. Indeed, previous studies have suggested a number of hypotheses about schizophrenia pathogenesis, including abnormal pre-synaptic dopaminergic activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, postsynaptic mechanisms involved in synaptic plasticity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, dysregulation of synaptic pruning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, and disruption to early brain development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>. This complexity is underpinned by the varied nature of genetic contributions to risk of schizophrenia. Genome-wide association studies have identified over 100 independent loci defined by common (minor allele frequency [MAF] &gt; 1%) single nucleotide variants (SNVs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, and a recent analysis determined that more than 71% of all one-megabase regions in the genome contain at least one common risk allele<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. The modest effects of these variants (median odds ratio [OR] = 1.08) combine to produce a polygenic contribution that explains only a fraction <inline-formula><mml:math display="inline" id="M1" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.274</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of the overall liability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. In addition, a number of rare variants have been identified that have far larger effects on individual risk. These are best exemplified by eleven large, rare recurrent copy number variants (CNVs) but evidence from whole-exome sequencing studies implies that many other rare coding SNVs and <italic>de novo</italic> mutations also confer substantial individual risk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>. There is growing evidence that some of the same genes and pathways are affected by both common and rare variants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>. Pathway analyses of common variants and hypothesis-driven gene set analyses of rare variants have begun to enumerate some of these specific biological processes, including histone methylation, transmission at glutamatergic synapses, calcium channel signaling, synaptic plasticity, and translational regulation by the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>.</p>
<p id="P5">In addition to exploring the biological mechanisms underlying schizophrenia, genetic analyses can also be used to understand its relationship to other neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. For instance, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (ASD) show substantial sharing of common risk variants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>. Sequencing studies of neurodevelopmental disorders suggest that this sharing of genetic risk may extend to rare variants of large effect. In the largest sequencing study of ASD to date, 20 of the 46 genes and all six CNVs implicated (false discovery rate [FDR] &lt; 5%) had been previously described as dominant causes of developmental disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>. Furthermore, an analysis of 60,706 whole exomes led by the ExAC consortium identified 3,230 genes with near-complete depletion of protein-truncating variants, and <italic>de novo</italic> loss-of-function (LoF) mutations identified in individuals with ASD or developmental disorders were concentrated in this set of “LoF intolerant” genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>. Similarly, evidence from rare variants for a broader shared genetic etiology between schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders has begun to emerge. Analyses of whole-exome data provided support for an enrichment of schizophrenia rare variants in intellectual disability genes, and schizophrenia cases were also found to have a higher concentration of ultra-rare disruptive SNVs in the ExAC LoF intolerant genes compared to controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>.</p>
<p id="P6">However, the contribution of these rare variants to risk in the wider population of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, including those without intellectual disability, remains unclear. Intriguingly, the 11 rare CNVs found to be highly penetrant for schizophrenia also increased risk for intellectual disability and other congenital defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, and more recently, a meta-analysis of whole-exome sequence data showed that LoF variants in <italic>SETD1A</italic> conferred substantial risk for both schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>. Concurrent analyses of autism whole-exome data found that <italic>de novo</italic> loss-of-function (LoF) mutations identified in ASD probands, particularly those that disrupt genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, were disproportionately found in individuals with intellectual disability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>. These emerging results raise the possibility that rare schizophrenia risk variants may be concentrated in a subset of schizophrenia patients with co-morbid intellectual disability. Here, we present the one of the largest accumulation of schizophrenia rare variant data to date, which we jointly analyze with phenotype data on cognitive function. Using this data set, we attempt to identify groups of genes disrupted by schizophrenia rare risk variants, and determine if a subset of patients disproportionately carry these damaging alleles.</p>

<title>Study design</title>
<p id="P7">To maximize our power to detect enrichment of damaging variants in schizophrenia cases in groups of genes, we performed a meta-analysis of three different types of rare coding variant studies: (1) high-quality SNV calls from whole-exome sequences of 4,133 schizophrenia cases and 9,274 matched controls, (2) <italic>de novo</italic> mutations identified in 1,077 schizophrenia parent-proband trios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), and (3) CNV calls from genotyping array data of 6,882 cases and 11,255 controls. The ascertainment of these samples, data production, and quality control were described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>. All <italic>de novo</italic> mutations included in our analysis had been validated through Sanger sequencing, and stringent quality control steps were performed on the case-control data to ensure that sample ancestry and batch were closely matched between cases and controls (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Online Methods</xref>).</p>
<p id="P8">For each data type, we used appropriate methods to test for an excess of rare variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Online Methods</xref>). In analyses of case-control SNV data, we applied an extension of the variant threshold burden test that corrected for exome-wide differences between cases and controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>. We tested all allele frequency thresholds below 0.1% observed in our data, and assessed statistical significance by permutation testing. In analyses of <italic>de novo</italic> SNV data, we compared the observed number of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations to random samples from an expected distribution based on a gene-specific mutation rate model to calculate an empirical <italic>P</italic>-value. For both types of whole-exome sequencing data, we restricted our analyses to loss-of-function variants. Finally, in analyses of case-control CNV data, we used a logistic regression framework that compares the rate of CNVs overlapping a specific gene set while correcting for differences in CNV size and number of genes disrupted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>. To ensure our model was well calibrated, we restricted our analyses to small deletions and duplications overlapping fewer than seven genes with MAF &lt; 0.1% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Online Methods</xref>).</p>
<p id="P9">We tested for an excess of rare damaging variants in schizophrenia patients in 1,766 gene sets (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Online Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, and detailed results below). Gene set <italic>P</italic>-values were computed using the three methods and variant definitions described above, and then meta-analyzed using Fisher’s Method to provide a single <italic>P</italic>-value for each gene set. Because we gave each data type equal weight, gene sets achieving significance typically show at least some signal in all three types of data. We observed a marked inflation in the quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot of gene set <italic>P</italic>-values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), so we conducted two analyses to ensure our results were robust and not biased due to methodological or technical artifacts. First, we observed no inflation of <italic>P</italic>-values when testing for enrichment of synonymous variants in our case-control and <italic>de novo</italic> analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Second, we created random gene sets by sampling uniformly across the genome, and observed null distributions in Q-Q plots regardless of variant class and analytical method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). These findings suggested that our methods sufficiently corrected for known genome-wide differences in LoF and CNV burden between cases and controls, and other technical confounders like batch and ancestry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Rare, damaging schizophrenia variants are concentrated in LoF intolerant genes</title>
<p id="P10">We first tested whether rare schizophrenia risk variants were consistently concentrated in genes defined loss-of-function intolerant across study design and variant type. Because some of our schizophrenia exome data was included in the ExAC database, we focused on the subset of 45,376 ExAC exomes without a known psychiatric diagnosis and that were not present in our study. From this subset, 3,488 genes were found to have near-complete depletion of such variants, which we defined as the LoF intolerant gene set. We found that rare damaging variants in schizophrenia cases were enriched in LoF intolerant genes (P &lt; 3.6×10<sup>−10</sup>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), with support in case-control SNVs (P &lt; 5×10<sup>−7</sup>; OR 1.24, 1.16-1.31, 95% CI), case-control CNVs (P = 2.6×10<sup>−4</sup>; OR 1.21, 1.15 – 1.28, 95% CI), and <italic>de novo</italic> mutations (P = 6.7×10<sup>−3</sup>; OR 1.36, 1.1 – 1.68, 95% CI). While this result was consistent with observations in intellectual disability and ASD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> the absolute effect size is smaller (e.g. <italic>de novos</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">5</xref>). We observed no excess burden of rare damaging variants in the remaining 14,753 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, this signal was spread among many different LoF intolerant genes: if we rank genes by decreasing significance, the enrichment disappears in the case-control SNV analysis (P &gt; 0.05) only after the exclusion of the top 50 genes. This suggests that the contribution of damaging rare variants in schizophrenia is not concentrated in just a handful of genes, but instead spread across many genes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S5">
<title>Schizophrenia risk genes are shared with other neurodevelopmental disorders</title>
<p id="P11">Given the significant enrichment of rare damaging variants in LoF intolerant genes in developmental disorders, autism and schizophrenia, we next asked whether these variants affected the same genes. We found that autism risk genes identified from exome sequencing meta-analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> and genes in which LoF variants are known causes of severe developmental disorders as defined by the DDD study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> were significantly enriched for rare variants in individuals with schizophrenia (<italic>P</italic><sub>ASD</sub> = 9.5 ×10<sup>−6</sup>; <italic>P</italic><sub>DD</sub> = 2.3 ×10<sup>−6</sup>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Online Methods</xref>). Previous analyses have shown an enrichment of rare damaging variants in genes whose mRNA are bound by FMRP in both schizophrenia and autism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, so we sought to identify further shared biology by testing targets of neural regulatory genes previously implicated in autism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>. We observed enrichment of both such sets: promoter targets of <italic>CHD8</italic> (<italic>P</italic> = 1.1×10<sup>−6</sup>) and splice targets of <italic>RBFOX</italic> (<italic>P</italic> = 1.3×10<sup>−5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We noted that some published gene lists attributed to same biological process differed due to choices of assay, cell type, method of sample extraction, and threshold of statistical significance, leading to distinct results in our gene set analyses. For example, we observed a significant enrichment in the published FMRP binding gene set based on mouse brain data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, but with no signal in one based on a human kidney cell line<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>.</p>
<p id="P12">We also tested an additional 1,759 gene sets from databases of biological pathways with at least 100 genes, as we lacked power to detect weak enrichments in smaller sets (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Online Methods</xref>). We observed enrichment of damaging rare variants in schizophrenia cases at FDR <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05 in 35 of these gene sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1, 2</xref>).

Furthermore, the gene sets most significantly enriched (FDR <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.01) for schizophrenia rare variants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) had all been previously linked to autism, intellectual disability, and severe developmental disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>. Our enrichment results matched some of the findings from a pathway analysis of common risk variants in psychiatric disorders, which also implicated neuronal and chromatin gene sets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>. However, unlike that study, we found no enrichment of rare variants in immune-related gene sets.</p>
<p id="P13">We noticed that the 1,759 gene sets we tested were collectively enriched with LoF intolerant genes when compared to a random sampling of genes from the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">7</xref>). For some of the gene sets associated with schizophrenia, this over-representation was quite substantial: 67% of the gene targets of FMRP and 74% of the genes associated with severe neurodevelopmental disorders are LoF intolerant. To better understand the consequences of this overlap on our results, we extended the gene set enrichment methods (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Online Methods</xref>) to condition on LoF intolerance and brain-expression for the 35 gene sets with FDR <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05 in the previous analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). We first observed that 22 of the 35 gene sets remained significant even after conditioning on brain expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Tables 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Online Methods</xref>), suggesting they represent more specific biological processes involved in schizophrenia. However, only known autism risk genes (<italic>P</italic> = 4.4×10<sup>−4</sup>) and neurodevelopmental disorder genes (<italic>P</italic> = 3×10<sup>−5</sup>) had an excess of rare coding variants above the enrichment already observed in LoF intolerant genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Thus, in addition to biological pathways implicated specifically in schizophrenia, at least a portion of the schizophrenia risk conferred by rare variants of large effect is shared with childhood onset disorders of neurodevelopment.</p>

<title>Schizophrenia patients with intellectual disability have a greater burden of rare damaging variants</title>
<p id="P14">In autism spectrum disorders, the observed excess of rare damaging variants has been shown to be greater in individuals with intellectual disability than those with normal levels of cognitive function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>. We observed a similar phenomenon in schizophrenia cases carrying <italic>SETD1A</italic> LoF variants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, so next sought to explore whether this pattern is consistent in gene sets implicated in schizophrenia. We acquired relevant cognitive phenotype data for 2,971 of the 4,131 schizophrenia patients with whole-exome sequencing data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). Of these individuals, 279 were clinically diagnosed with intellectual disability in addition to fulfilling the full diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia (SCZ-ID subgroup, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Online Methods</xref>). We also identified 1,165 individuals for whom we could rule out cognitive impairment (by excluding pre-morbid IQ &lt; 85, fewer than 12 years of schooling or lowest decile of composite cognitive measures, depending on available data, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Online Methods</xref>). Finally, we identified 1,527 individuals who were not diagnosed with intellectual disability, but in whom some cognitive impairment could not be excluded.</p>
<p id="P15">When stratifying into these three groups (intellectual disability, no intellectual disability but cognitive impairment not excluded, no cognitive impairment), we observed that the burden of rare damaging variants in LoF intolerant genes was significantly greater in the SCZ-ID subgroup than in the remaining schizophrenia cases (P = 2.6×10<sup>−4</sup>; OR 1.3, 1.12– 1.51, 95% CI) or controls (P &lt; 5×10<sup>−7</sup>; OR 1.61, 1.37 – 1.89, 95% CI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In the LoF intolerant gene set, 0.27 (0.2 – 0.35, 95% CI) extra singleton (defined as having an allele count of one in our data set) LoF variants were observed per exome in SCZ-ID cases compared to controls, while 0.10 (0.065 – 0.13, 95% CI) extra singleton LoF variants per exome were observed in the remaining schizophrenia cases compared to controls (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Online Methods</xref>). Furthermore, SCZ-ID individuals had significant enrichment of rare LoF variants in developmental disorder genes compared to the other cases (P = 9×10<sup>−4</sup>; OR 2.36, 1.41– 3.92, 95% CI) or to controls (P = 9.5×10<sup>−6</sup>; OR 3.43, 2.01– 5.86, 95% CI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Compared to controls, the SCZ-ID individuals carried 0.045 (0.03 – 0.06, 95% CI) extra singleton LoF variants in developmental disorder genes per exome, suggesting that around 4% of these cases had a LoF variant that is relevant to their clinical presentation. No enrichment in neurodevelopmental disorder genes was observed in schizophrenia patients without intellectual disability, suggesting that these genes were relevant only for that subset of schizophrenia patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Notably, even after excluding known developmental disorder genes from the set of LoF intolerant genes, we still observed an enrichment of rare variants in SCZ-ID patients compared to the remaining cases (P = 1×10<sup>−3</sup>; 1.26, 1.08 – 1.47, 95% CI) or to controls (P &lt; 5×10<sup>−7</sup>; OR 1.54, 1.31– 1.81, 95% CI; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). Rare variation in these genes contributes more to disease risk in the subset of patients with both schizophrenia and intellectual disability.</p>

<title>Rare variants confer risk for schizophrenia in individuals without intellectual disability</title>
<p id="P16">While rare damaging variants in LoF intolerant genes were most enriched in the subset of schizophrenia patients with intellectual disability, we still observed a weaker but significant enrichment in individuals with schizophrenia for whom we could confirm do not have intellectual disability (P = 5.5 × 10<sup>−4</sup>; 1.16, 1.05 – 1.27, 95% CI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, rare risk variants for schizophrenia follow the pattern previously described in autism: concentrated in individuals with intellectual disability, but not exclusive to that group. To produce a more accurate estimate of the effect of damaging rare variants on schizophrenia conditional on their effects on overall cognition, we recalculated the enrichment of rare variants in LoF intolerant genes in a subset of 2,161 schizophrenia cases and 2,398 controls for which data on years of education was available and for whom intellectual disability could be excluded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). After controlling for differences in educational attainment (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Online Methods</xref>), individuals with schizophrenia have a 1.26-fold excess of rare variants in LoF intolerant genes (P = 2 × 10<sup>−6</sup>; 1.14 – 1.38, 95% CI). This increase in our observed odds ratio is consistent with previous accounts that rare damaging variants also affect educational attainment in controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, thus biasing our unconditional estimate.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="P17">Our integrated analysis of thousands of whole-exome sequences demonstrates that rare damaging variants increase risk of schizophrenia both with and without co-morbid intellectual disability. While the identification of individual genes remains difficult at current samples sizes, we show that the burden of damaging <italic>de novo</italic> mutations, rare SNVs and CNVs in schizophrenia is not scattered across the genome but is primarily concentrated in 3,488 genes intolerant of loss-of-function variants. This observation is shared with autism, intellectual disability, and severe neurodevelopmental disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>. We recapitulate enrichment in previously published gene sets, including transmission at glutamatergic synapses and translational regulation by FMRP, and implicate other gene sets previously linked to autism, intellectual disability, and severe developmental disorders. However, we find that all of these gene sets share a large number of underlying genes, and are especially enriched with the 3,488 genes intolerant of LoF variants. These overlaps among gene sets originating from very different analyses, as well as the subtleties of how they are defined, suggest caution in interpreting biological explanations from observed enrichments.</p>
<p id="P18">We jointly analyzed the case-control SNV data with information on cognitive function for 2,971 patients, and find that LoF variants disrupting genes associated with severe developmental disorders are disproportionately found in individuals with schizophrenia with co-morbid intellectual disability, with 4% of these cases having a single LoF variant that is relevant to their clinical presentation. Even after excluding variants in known developmental disorder genes, rare variants contribute a greater degree to schizophrenia risk in the SCZ-ID subgroup of patients than the remaining schizophrenia population. These results show that some of these genetic perturbations have clear manifestations in childhood, and that rare risk variants in schizophrenia are particularly associated with co-morbid intellectual disability. Our observations are consistent with results in autism in which rare risk variants are associated with intellectual disability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>. Notably, a weaker but still significant rare variant burden was observed in schizophrenia patients without cognitive impairment, and this signal persists even after controlling for educational attainment. Together, these results demonstrate that rare variants have different contributions to schizophrenia risk depending on the degree of cognitive impairment. Importantly, they do not simply confer risk for a small subset of patients but contribute to disease pathogenesis more broadly.</p>
<p id="P19">Our study supports the observation that genetic risk factors for psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders do not follow clear diagnostic boundaries. Coding variants disrupting the same genes, and quite possibly, the same biological processes, increase risk for a range of phenotypic manifestation. This clinically variable presentation is reminiscent of LoF variants in <italic>SETD1A</italic> and 11 large copy number variant syndromes, previously shown to confer risk for schizophrenia in addition to other prominent developmental defects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>. It is possible that these genes contain an allelic series of variants conferring gradations of risk. A recent schizophrenia GWAS meta-analysis demonstrated that the common variant association signal was similarly enriched in LoF intolerant genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, suggesting that schizophrenia risk genes may be perturbed by common variants of subtle effects and disrupted by rare variants of high penetrance in the population. This possibility is also supported by the overlap in at least some of the pathways affected by both rare and common variation, such as chromatin remodeling. However, the most common deletion in the 22q11.2 locus and a recurrent two base deletion in <italic>SETD1A</italic> are associated with both schizophrenia and more severe neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting the same variants can also confer risk for a range of clinical features<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>. Ultimately, it may prove difficult to clearly partition patients genetically into subtypes with similar clinical features, especially if genes and variants previously thought to cause well-characterized Mendelian disorders can have such varied outcomes. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that LoF variants in genes under genic constraint result in a spectrum of neurodevelopmental outcomes with the burden of mutations highest in intellectual disability and least in schizophrenia, corresponding to a gradient of neurodevelopmental pathology indexed by the degree of cognitive impairment, age of onset, and severity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>.</p>
<p id="P20">Despite the complex nature of genetic contributions to risk of schizophrenia, it is notable that across study design (trio or case-control) and variant class (SNVs or CNVs), risk loci of large effect are concentrated in a small subset of genes. Previous rare variant analyses in other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have successfully integrated information across <italic>de novo</italic> SNVs and CNVs to identify novel risk loci<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>. As sample sizes increase, meta-analyses leveraging the shared genetic risk across study designs and variant types, including those we did not consider here, such as classical recessive inheritance, will be similarly well powered to identify additional risk genes in schizophrenia.</p>

<p id="P25">For the case-control SNV data set, we performed permutation-based gene set enrichment tests using an extension of the variant threshold method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>. This method assumed that variants with a MAF below an unknown threshold <italic>T</italic> were more likely to be damaging than variants with a MAF above <italic>T</italic>, and this threshold was allowed to differ for every gene or pathway tested. To consider different possible values for threshold <italic>T</italic>, a gene or gene set test statistic <italic>t(T)</italic> was calculated for every allowable <italic>T</italic>, and the maximum test-statistic, or <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>, was selected. The statistical significance of <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> was evaluated by permuting phenotypic labels, and calculating <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> from the permuted data such that different values of <italic>T</italic> could be selected following each permutation. In Price <italic>et al.</italic>, <italic>t(T)</italic> was defined as the <italic>z</italic>-score calculated from regressing the phenotype on the sum of the allele counts of variants in a gene with MAF &lt; <italic>T</italic>. We extended this method to test for enrichment in gene sets by regressing schizophrenia status on the total number of damaging alleles in the gene set of interest with MAF &lt; <italic>T</italic> (<italic>X<sub>in,T</sub></italic>) while correcting for the total number of damaging alleles genome-wide with MAF &lt; <italic>T</italic> (<italic>X<sub>all,T</sub></italic>). <italic>X<sub>in,T</sub></italic> controlled for exome-wide differences between schizophrenia cases and controls, ensuring any significant gene set result was significant beyond baseline differences. <italic>t(T)</italic> was defined as the <italic>t</italic>-statistic testing if the regression coefficient of <italic>X<sub>in,T</sub></italic> deviated from 0.

When selecting MAF cut-offs for case-control CNVs, we found that while the bulk of the test statistics were not inflated, the tail of gene set <italic>P</italic>-values were dramatically inflated even when testing for enrichment in the random gene sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). This inflation in the tail of the Q-Q plot was driven in part by very large (overlapping more than 10 genes), more common (MAF between 0.1% and 1%) CNVs observed mainly in cases or controls. Some of these, such as the known syndromic CNVs, likely harbored true risk genes. However, because these CNVs were highly recurrent in cases and depleted in controls, and disrupted a large number of genes, any gene set that included even a single gene within these CNVs would appear to be significant, even after controlling for total CNV length and genes overlapped. To ensure our model was well calibrated and its <italic>P</italic>-values followed a null distribution for random gene sets, we explored different frequency and size thresholds, and conservatively restricted our analysis to copy number events overlapping less than seven genes (excluding the largest 10% of CNVs) with MAF &lt; 0.1% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Our main conclusions remained unchanged even if we selected a more stringent (excluding the largest 15% of CNVs) or less stringent (excluding the largest 5% of CNVs) size threshold.</p>

<title>Robustness of enrichment analyses</title>
<p id="P31">We uniformly sampled genes from the genome (as defined by Gencode v.19) to generate random gene sets with the same size distribution as the 1,776 gene sets in our discovery analysis. For each random set, we calculated gene set <italic>P</italic>-values for the case-control SNV data, case-control CNV data, and <italic>de novo</italic> data using the appropriate method and frequency cut-offs across all variant classes. A Q-Q plot was generated using <italic>P</italic>-values from enrichment tests of each data set and variant type. Reassuringly, we observed null distributions in all such Q-Q plots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p>

We used the Poisson exact test to calculate differences in <italic>de novo</italic> rates in constrained genes between schizophrenia, ASD, and DD and controls.

<title>Conditional analyses</title>
<p id="P33">In each of the three methods we used for gene set enrichment, we restricted all variants analyzed to those that reside in the background gene list, and tested for an excess of rare variants in genes shared between the gene set of interest (<italic>K</italic>) and the background list (<italic>B</italic>). Brain-enriched genes from GTEx, and the ExAC LoF intolerant genes (pLI &gt; 0.9) were used as backgrounds (see above). For the case-control SNV data, we modified the variant threshold method to regress schizophrenia status on the total number of damaging alleles in genes present in both the gene set of interest and the background gene set (<italic>K</italic> ∩ <italic>B</italic>), while correcting for the total number of damaging alleles in the set of all background genes (<italic>B</italic>). The logistic regression model for the case-control CNV data was modified to: <disp-formula id="FD2"><mml:math display="block" id="M3" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>log</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext>case</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext>case</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.1em"></mml:mspace><mml:mo>∩</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.1em"></mml:mspace><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where <italic>g<sub>B</sub></italic> is the total number of background genes overlapping a CNV, and <italic>g<sub><italic>K</italic> ∩ <italic>B</italic></sub></italic> is the number of genes in the intersection of the gene set of interest and the background list overlapping a CNV. Finally, we determined the total number of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations within the background gene list observed in the 1,077 schizophrenia trios, and generated 2 million random samples with the same number of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations. For each gene set, one-sided enrichment <italic>P</italic>-values were calculated as the fraction of two million random samples that had a greater or equal number of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in genes in <italic>K</italic> ∩ <italic>B</italic> than what is observed in the 1,077 trios. Gene set <italic>P</italic>-values were combined using Fisher’s method.

<title>Rare variants and cognition in schizophrenia</title>
<p id="P34">Within the UK10K study, 97 individuals from the MUIR collection were given discharge diagnoses of mild learning disability and schizophrenia (ICD-8 and -9). The recruitment guidelines of the MUIR collection were described in detail in a previous publication<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>. In brief, evidence of remedial education was a prerequisite to inclusion, and individuals with pre-morbid IQs below 50 or above 70, severe learning disabilities, or were unable to give consent were excluded. The Schizophrenia and Affective Disorders Schedule-Lifetime version (SADS-L) in people with mild learning disability, PANSS, RDC, and DSM-III-R, and St. Louis Criterion were applied to all individuals to ensure that any diagnosis of schizophrenia was robust. Using the clinical information provided alongside the Swedish and Finnish case-control data sets, we identified additional 182 schizophrenia individuals who were similarly diagnosed with intellectual disability, for a total of 279 individuals.</p>
<p id="P35">Cognitive testing and educational attainment data available for a subset of samples were used identify schizophrenia individuals without cognitive impairment. For 502 individuals from the Cardiff collection in the UK10K study, we acquired their pre-morbid IQ as extrapolated from National Adult Reading Test (NART), and identified 412 individuals for analysis after excluding all individuals with predicted pre-morbid IQ of less than 85 (or below one standard deviation of the population distribution for IQ). We additionally acquired information on educational attainment in 54 schizophrenia individuals in the UK10K London collection, and retained 27 individuals without intellectual disability and who completed at least 12 years of schooling. Lastly, the California Verbal Learning Test was conducted on 124 Finnish schizophrenia individuals sequenced as part of UK10K, and a composite score was generated from measures of verbal and visual working memory, verbal abilities, visuoconstructive abilities, and processing speed. All individuals with intellectual disability had been excluded from cognitive testing. Within this set of samples, we additionally excluded any individuals who ranked in the lowest decile in CVLT composite score, and retained 92 individuals for analysis. According to these criteria, we identified 531 of 697 schizophrenia individuals from the UK and Finnish data sets with cognitive data as not having intellectual disability. We additionally acquired data on educational attainment for the Swedish schizophrenia cases and controls from the Swedish National Registry. After excluding individuals with intellectual disability, we identified 1,527 schizophrenia individuals who did not complete secondary school (less than 12 years of schooling), and 634 schizophrenia individuals who completed at least compulsory and upper secondary schooling (at least 12 years of schooling). The last group with the greatest educational attainment and without intellectual disability was defined as cases without cognitive impairment. In the Swedish sample, 49.4% of control samples had lower educational attainment than the 634 individuals with schizophrenia defined as having no cognitive impairment, suggesting that our definition was sufficiently strict. In total, combining the UK, Finnish, and Swedish data, we identified 1,165 schizophrenia individuals without cognitive impairment.</p>
<p id="P36">Using the variant threshold method, we tested for differences in rare LoF burden between the three case groups (intellectual disability, did not complete secondary school, no cognitive impairment) against controls. We restricted these analyses to three gene sets (LoF intolerant genes, genes in which LoF variants are diagnostic for severe developmental disorders, and LoF intolerant genes after excluding severe developmental disorders genes), and adjusted for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction (P = 0.0038, or 0.05/13 tests). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 4</xref> enumerated all the statistical tests performed. To estimate the per-exome excess of rare singleton (defined as having an allele count of one in our data set) LoF variants in cases compared to controls, we regressed <italic>X<sub>in</sub></italic> (the number of LoF variants in the gene set of interest) on case status (0 or 1) while controlling for <italic>X<sub>all</sub></italic> (the total number of LoF variants genome-wide) and population (UK, Finnish, and Swedish). The effect size and 95% CI of the regression coefficient of case status predictor were reported.</p>
