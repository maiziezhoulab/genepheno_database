<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Topoisomerases, known as the “magicians of the DNA world”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, can catalyze strand passage reactions for DNA, leading to relaxation of supercoils generated during replication or transcription, and decatenation of tangled DNA during recombination and chromosome segregation. Topoisomerase inactivation can lead to abnormal development, shortened lifespan, lethality, and human diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par4">Unlike the well-characterized DNA topoisomerases, RNA topoisomerases have drawn little attention for many years. The first eukaryotic RNA topoisomerase, human Top3β, was discovered only recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Since then, RNA topoisomerase activity has been observed in Type IA topoisomerases from all three domains of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The prevalence of this activity implies that it can provide growth advantage to its host, so that it is retained through millions of years of evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The findings also indicate that many Type IA topoisomerases are dual-activity enzymes, capable of solving topological problems for both DNA and RNA. In human, only one of the two Type IA enzymes, Top3β, possesses dual activities, whereas its paralog, Top3α, contains only DNA activity. Top3β but not Top3α contains a conserved RNA-binding domain, RGG-box; and it strongly depends on this domain to bind mRNAs in cells, catalyze RNA topoisomerase reactions, and promote synapse formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Top3β has been purified in a complex with TDRD3 (Tudor domain-containing 3); and this complex biochemically and genetically interacts with FMRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, an RNA-binding protein (RBP) that is inappropriately silenced in Fragile X syndrome and known to modulate translation of mRNAs important for neurodevelopment and autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Interestingly, <italic>Top3β</italic> gene mutation has been linked to schizophrenia and autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, suggesting that Top3β and FMRP may work together to prevent mental dysfunction. Top3β and FMRP bind common mRNAs, associate with mRNA translation machinery, and regulate gene expression at synapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">In addition to regulating mRNA translation, FMRP also interacts with RNAi machinery to facilitate both transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing of genes and transposable elements (TEs) in mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, FMRP has been purified as a component of an RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC), containing FMRP, Argonaute 2 (AGO2), p68 RNA helicase (encoded by <italic>Rm62</italic>), Vig (an RBP), and Tudor-staphylococcal nuclease (Tudor-SN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Mutations in RISC and other components of the RNAi machinery disrupt heterochromatic silencing of genes and TEs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">Here we report the purification of the Top3β–TDRD3 complex from <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, and find that it stably associates with RISC. We demonstrate that <italic>Top3β</italic> mutants display defective heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing, which resemble RISC mutants. Moreover, <italic>Top3β</italic> genetically interacts with RISC to promote heterochromatic gene silencing and recruitment of heterochromatin protein HP1. Our data reveal a function for a dual-activity topoisomerase in RNA metabolism.</p>

<title><italic>Drosophila</italic> Top3β–TDRD3 complex associates with FMRP and RISC</title>
<p id="Par7">We used two different antibodies against <italic>Drosophila</italic> TDRD3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and immunoprecipitated its complex with Top3β from S2 cell lysates. Both antibodies (TDRD3-A and C) isolated two major polypeptides with about equal molar ratio, which were identified as TDRD3 and Top3β by mass spectrometry (MS) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>) and immunoblotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). These results are identical to our previous findings for the human complex, and suggest that the complex is conserved in animals.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Top3β-TDRD3 stably associates with RISC in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. <bold>a</bold> Silver-stained SDS-PAGE analysis of the immunoprecipitated complexes of Top3β-TDRD3, FMRP, p68, and AGO2 from S2 cells; and a partial list of the number of peptides identified by MS analysis of each immunoprecipitate (bottom). The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation are indicated on the top, which include two against TDRD3 (A and C), one for FMRP, and HA antibodies for tagged p68-isoforms (RE and RC) and AGO2. Top3β, TDRD3, components of RISC, and FMRP-associated proteins are indicated by arrows on top and by brackets at the bottom. <bold>b</bold> IP-Western confirms co-IP of Top3β-TDRD3 with different components of RISC by two TDRD3 antibodies. <bold>c</bold> Reciprocal IP-Western shows that Top3β-TDRD3 co-IPs with HA-tagged p68, VIG, and AGO2 using transfected S2 cells and HA antibodies. Note that the level of TDRD3 in each IP is higher than that of Top3β, which is consistent with the MS data</p></caption><graphic id="d29e562" xlink:href="41467_2018_7101_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par8">To identify proteins that associate with the complex, we analyzed the entire TDRD3 immunoprecipitants by MS. We identified peptides from not only FMRP, but also other RISC components—AGO2, p68, and VIG; as well as other FMRP-associated proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). However, the number of peptides derived from RISC were fewer than from either Top3β or TDRD3; and with the exception of FMRP, RISC components were not detectable in the TDRD3 immunoprecipitate by silver-stained analysis. These data suggest that a minor fraction of Top3β–TDRD3 in cells associates with RISC. No peptides from p68 were detected in the immunoprecipitate of TDRD3-A antibody. This could be due to antibody disruption of their association, because this antibody was raised against the region of TDRD3 that binds p68 (see Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref> and  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). It should be cautioned that although the number of peptides recovered from MS often reflect the protein abundance, they are not always reliable for quantitative comparisons between different samples. We therefore performed IP-Western, which confirmed the presence of several RISC components in TDRD3 immunoprecipitates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>). These data are consistent with our previous findings that Top3β–TDRD3 associates with FMRP in <italic>Drosophila</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and further suggest that a fraction of Top3β–TDRD3 interacts with the FMRP-containing RISC.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>TDRD3 acts as a scaffold linking <italic>Drosophila</italic> Top3β to RISC. <bold>a</bold> A cartoon shows similarity and differences between human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Top3β-TDRD3 complexes (see Results for details). <bold>b</bold> Summary of domain-mapping experiment to show different mutants of TDRD3 (left), and their interactions with Top3β and components of RISC (right). The experiment was based on co-IP between different Flag-TDRD3 constructs and their interacting partners from transfected S2 cells.

The presence (+), absence (−), or reduction (down arrow), of interactions are indicated. <bold>c</bold> IP-Western shows that FLAG-Top3β co-IPs with reduced amount of FMRP and p68 in S2 cells depleted with TDRD3 by RNAi. A control experiment was included using RNAi that targets GFP. <bold>d</bold> IP-Western shows that FMRP co-IPs with reduced amount of Top3β, but normal amount of p68, in S2 cells inactivated of TDRD3 by CRISPR</p></caption><graphic id="d29e614" xlink:href="41467_2018_7101_Fig2_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par9">To verify the association, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) by transfecting Flag-tagged Top3β, a Flag-Top3β mutant deleted of its RGG-box, as well as Flag-TDRD3, into S2 cells; and immunoprecipitated the complex with the Flag antibody. MS detected the peptides from not only Top3β and TDRD3, but also FMRP, AGO2, and p68 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1A and B</xref>). As a control, these RISC proteins were absent in mock-IP using the Flag antibody from S2 cells lacking Flag-Top3β or Flag-TDRD3 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1B</xref>). The results indicate that the association between RISC and Top3β–TDRD3 is specific.</p>
<p id="Par10">We investigated whether the observed association is mediated by RNA by IP–MS using cell extracts untreated or treated with RNase A. We observed a 10-fold reduction in number of peptides derived from FMRP and p68 in TDRD3 IP from RNase A-treated than -untreated extracts (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1C</xref>). Similar reduction in RNase-treated extract was also observed in IP using Flag antibodies (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1B</xref>). These results differ from those of human studies, where RNase treatment has little effect on the association between Top3β–TDRD3 and FMRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, suggesting that the Top3β complex may have diverged interactions and functions with RNA during evolution. We noted that in IP–MS by Flag-Top3β or Flag-Top3β-ΔRGG mutant, the RNase treatment had no significant effect on the number of peptides derived from AGO2, even though the treatment completely eliminated the number of peptides from FMRP and p68 IP (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1B</xref>). In IP–MS by Flag-TDRD3 and the two TDRD3 antibodies, the number of AGO2 peptides was reduced by between 30 and 70%, which is smaller than the reduction of peptides from FMRP and p68 (about 90% or more). The data suggest that AGO2 may have direct protein–protein interactions with Top3β and/or TDRD3 that are not mediated by RNA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec4">
<title>A fraction of FMRP associates with RISC and Top3β–TDRD3</title>
<p id="Par11">We next performed reciprocal IP–MS with an FMRP antibody, and obtained three abundant polypeptides, which were identified as FMRP and its two known interactors, Caprin and Rin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). MS analyses of the entire immunoprecipitate obtained peptides from RISC (AGO2, p68), Top3β and TDRD3, supporting the notion that these proteins associate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>; table). Because the number of peptides from RISC, TDRD3, and Top3β were fewer than that of FMRP (about 5% or less), only a small fraction of FMRP may associate with RISC and Top3β–TDRD3.</p>
<p id="Par12">We also transfected epitope-tagged RISC components into S2 cells, and performed reciprocal IP with the antibody for the epitope. Silver-staining revealed TDRD3 as a minor polypeptide in the immunoprecipitates of two p68 isoforms (RE and RC) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). MS identified peptides from RISC, as well as TDRD3 and Top3β (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>; table). Immunoblotting further confirmed the presence of these proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). We noted that a previous IP–MS study detected Top3β and TDRD3 in the immunoprecipitate of Flag-AGO2 from S2 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In addition, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Protein Interaction Map (DPIM) project reported Top3β and TDRD3 peptides in IP by tagged VIG. Consistent with these results, transfection of epitope-tagged-AGO2 and VIG into S2 cells followed by IP-Western obtained TDRD3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). Overall, these data support the notion that a fraction of Top3β–TDRD3 associates with RISC. Because the number of TDRD3 peptides is higher than that of Top3β in the immunoprecipitates of FMRP and p68 (about 3–10-fold) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>; table), RISC may have more direct interactions with TDRD3 than Top3β.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec5">
<title><italic>Drosophila</italic> TDRD3 acts as a scaffold linking Top3β to RISC</title>
<p id="Par13">Human TDRD3 acts as a scaffold, interacting with Top3β and FMRP with its N and C terminal domains, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. We studied whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> TDRD3 acts similarly by mutating different regions of Flag-TDRD3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>), transfecting them into S2 cells, and testing their association with Top3β and RISC by co-IP. First, we found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> TDRD3 was identical to its human homolog in requiring the same intervening loop within its OB-fold to associate with Top3β (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2A and B</xref>; Δloop mutant). Second, <italic>Drosophila</italic> TDRD3 was similar to its human homolog in partial dependence on its Tudor domain for FMRP association (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2B</xref>; E772K mutant). However, <italic>Drosophila</italic> TDRD3 was independent of its C-terminal domain (CTD) for FMRP association (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2B</xref>; N790 (ΔCTD)), whereas human TDRD3 was dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the FMRP-interacting motif (FIM) in human TDRD3-CTD was absent in <italic>Drosophila</italic> TDRD3-CTD. Instead, a region at the N-terminus of Tudor, named TYD motif, was found to have sequence similar to human FIM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2C</xref>). Deletion of this motif (ΔTYD) reduced the amount of FMRP that co-IPs with Flag-TDRD3 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2D</xref>), suggesting that this motif could be the <italic>Drosophila</italic> FIM. Further mapping revealed that TDRD3 has another region that contributes to FMRP association (between 501 and 547) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2A, E, F</xref>; see N500 and N547).

Briefly, a PEV reporter that encodes <italic>white</italic> gene and localizes near heterochromatin can result in variegated red eyes due to spreading of heterochromatin from regions nearby and subsequent transcriptional silencing in some but not all cells. Mutations in histone methyltransferase (<italic>Su(var)3-9</italic>), RISC, and RNAi biogenesis enzyme <italic>Dcr-2</italic>, can dominantly suppress this phenotype by inhibiting heterochromatin spreading and gene silencing, leading to eyes with more red cells even uniform red eyes.

This result contrasts with those of their single heterozygous mutants, which produce more red cells and thus suppression of PEV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a, b</xref>). Extraction of the eye pigment and subsequent measurement confirmed that the red color was decreased in the double but increased in each single mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>, right graph).

Specifically, the percentages of AGO2 and Top3β ChIP islands in total heterochromatin were about 0.3% and 1.4%, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5g</xref>), which are substantially smaller than that of HP1 (72%), as well as that of HDIs in total heterochromatin of <italic>AGO2</italic> and <italic>Top3β</italic> mutants (37% and 13.6%, respectively; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5f</xref>). The data are consistent with a mechanism of “nucleation and spreading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>”: RISC and Top3β may bind a small number of loci to nucleate the initial assembly of heterochromatin, which may then recruit additional components to spread to other regions.</p>
<p id="Par31">Interestingly, almost all AGO2 islands (98%) in pericentric heterochromatin overlap with those of HP1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5g</xref>), supporting a role of chromatin-bound RISC in HP1 recruitment.

<title>Top3β promotes H3K9 methylation</title>
<p id="Par34">HP1 is known to bind H3K9me3 in heterochromatin. Our data that H3K9me2 immunostaining is reduced in the <italic>Top3β</italic> mutant prompted us to investigate whether H3K9 methylation is decreased in pericentric heterochromatin by ChIP-seq. We observed enrichment of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 in pericentric heterochromatin, which is similar to that of HP1 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">5A</xref>). SICER analysis revealed more decreased (blue) than increased (red) islands for both methylation marks in pericentric heterochromatin of the <italic>Top3β</italic> mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>), indicating that Top3β is needed for normal H3K9 methylation in heterochromatin. The percentages of islands with decreased H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 signals were 7.0% and 4.6%, respectively, among all their respective islands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>), which are about 18- and 23-fold higher than percentages of the islands with increased signals (0.4% and 0.2%, respectively; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b, c</xref>). These differences are smaller than that of HP1 (~500-fold) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>), suggesting that Top3β is more important for HP1 recruitment than H3K9 methylation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par40">Recent evidence suggests that Top3β has two functions: one for DNA, where it reduces negative supercoiling to resolve R-loops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>; and the other for mRNAs, where it associates with polyribosomes and FMRP to regulate translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Here we show that Top3β has an additional function—it interacts with RISC to facilitate heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing. Because Top3β is a dual-activity enzyme, one key question is whether it acts on DNA or RNA during this process. Our findings that <italic>Top3β</italic> mutant deleted of its RNA-binding domain (RGG-box) is deficient in promoting HP1 recruitment to heterochromatin and in silencing of TEs suggest that Top3β acts on RNA. This notion is further supported by the data that Top3β biochemically and/or genetically interacts with an RNA slicer (AGO2), an RNA helicase (p68), and an RNase (Dcr-2). However, because the RGG-box deletion mutant not only has defective RNA-binding activity, but also reduced catalytic activity for both DNA and RNA, it is possible that the reduced catalytic activity on either DNA, or RNA, or both, is responsible for the defective heterochromatin formation. A mutation that inactivates the catalytic activity of Top3β on one nucleic acid but not the other is needed to clarify this issue.</p>
<p id="Par41">Another question is whether Top3β acts as a topoisomerase or an RNA-binding protein. Our findings that <italic>Top3β</italic>-Y332F mutant, which has normal RNA binding but no catalytic activity, is deficient in promoting HP1 recruitment and TE silencing suggest that Top3β acts as a topoisomerase. The next question is where the topological problem may come from? The current hypothesis on heterochromatin formation postulates that siRNA-loaded RISC may guide histone methyltransferases and HP1 to their targets by base-pairing interactions with nascent RNAs transcribed from the heterochromatin locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. We predict that this process may produce RNA topological problems at some loci, which depend on Top3β to resolve. Possibly, the nascent RNA may generate complex structures by: base-pairing with itself, or other RNAs, or DNA. These structures may prevent the nascent RNAs from being base-paired by the siRNA-loaded RISC, so they need to be resolved by the topoisomerase activity of Top3β.</p>
<p id="Par42">How may Top3β solve RNA topological problems during RISC-mediated heterochromatin formation? One RISC component that interacts with Top3β is the p68 RNA helicase, which interacts with histone methyltransferase and is needed for heterochromatic gene silencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The biochemical and genetic interactions between a Type IA topoisomerase and helicase have been similarly observed for Top3α and BLM: their enzymatic activities are coupled to resolve complex DNA structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Based on this similarity, we hypothesize that Top3β and p68 may employ a mechanism mimicking their DNA counterpart—their enzymatic activities may be coupled to resolve complex RNA structures during heterochromatin formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig9">9</xref>). p68 may unwind secondary structures in nascent RNA transcribed at heterochromatin. This unwinding may generate topological stress, which may be relieved by Top3β to enable p68 to continue the unwinding reaction, making nascent RNA accessible to binding by siRNA-loaded RISC, and enabling subsequent recruitment of histone methyltransferases and HP1. When either p68 or Top3β is mutated, this process is defective, leading to defective heterochromatin, and increased <italic>white</italic> gene expression in PEV assay. However, this hypothesis is difficult to explain why the double mutant between <italic>Rm62</italic> and <italic>Top3β</italic> exhibits suppression of the PEV phenotype observed in each single mutant. We speculate that when both p68 and Top3β are mutated, alternative pathways may be activated to form heterochromatin. One alternative pathway may be mediated by PIWI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, which can interact with FMRP to promote heterochromatin silencing in somatic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Future work is needed to show whether activities of Top3β and p68 are coupled, and to identify the alternative pathway(s).<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Top3β promotes heterochromatin formation by interacting with RNAi machinery. A model illustrating how Top3β works with RISC in heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing. The nascent RNA transcribed from heterochromatin may form secondary and other structures by base-pairing with itself, which prevents access by siRNA-loaded RISC. These RNA structures are unwound by p68 helicase of RISC, and this process may produce torsional stress. Top3β may relieve this stress by facilitating the unwinding process and makes nascent RNA accessible to base pairing by siRNA-loaded RISC. Binding of RISC to the nascent RNA may recruit HP1 and H3K9 methyltransferases to assemble heterochromatin. The coordinated actions of p68-Top3β in resolving complex RNA structures may resemble those of their homologs, BLM-Top3α, in resolving complex DNA structures</p></caption><graphic id="d29e2368" xlink:href="41467_2018_7101_Fig9_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par43">Finally, our findings that Top3β depends on both RNA binding and catalytic activities for recruiting HP1 and silencing TEs are reminiscent of our previous data that Top3β requires the same two activities to promote synapse formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, suggesting that these Top3β-mediated processes may be connected. Indeed, misregulation of heterochromatin and TEs has been linked to abnormal brain development, schizophrenia, other neurological disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, and aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Notably, individuals carrying <italic>Top3β</italic> mutations have increased risks of schizophrenia and other mental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>; and <italic>Top3β</italic> mutant animals exhibit abnormal neurodevelopment and shortened lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Thus, regulation of heterochromatin formation and transcription silencing could be one mechanism used by Top3β to prevent mental dysfunction and shortened lifespan.</p>

<title>ChIP-seq and ChIP RT-qPCR</title>
<p id="Par47">ChIP and ChIP-seq library generation was carried out by standard protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Fly heads (100 μl) were isolated from fast freeze and sieving. The antibodies used are: HP1—Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB) C1A9; H3K9me2—Abcam ab1220; H3K9me3—Abcam ab8898; FLAG—Sigma-Aldrich F7425; Top3β—our own group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The homogenized and cleared samples were sonicated to a length between 200 and 500 bp. The sheared chromatin was precleared with Protein A beads (GE Healthcare 17-1279-01, Waukesha, WI, USA), and then incubated with 5 μl of each of the above antibodies and 30 μl of Protein A beads at 4 °C for 3 h. After thorough washing, the samples were eluted by 10% SDS and Protease K at 65 °C for 8 h. The eluted chromatin was extracted by phenol–chloroform clean-up followed by ethanol precipitation. For RT-qPCR, 2 μl of 10× diluted chromatin was used for 20 μl reaction using ABI7800HT. Given the reaction was run in triplicate, the threshold values (Ct) were converted to fold change difference in standard delta Ct method. The primers used in the analysis are in Supplemental Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>.</p>
<p id="Par48">ChIP-seq libraries were sequenced by the Hi-Seq 2000 at 50 bases. Reads were mapped to the dm6 fly genome with Bowtie<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> allowing maximum of 2 mismatches. Non-unique reads with 2 or 3 hits in the genome were assigned weights of 1/2 or 1/3, respectively. Reads with &gt;3 hits in the genome were not counted. The frequency of reads was calculated in 100-bp intervals across the genome in FPKM units. As a control, we used total DNA input samples for the same line of flies (<italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> or mutants), that were processed in the same way as the ChIP-seq samples. Input-subtracted positive ChIP-seq frequencies were visualized using the UCSC Genome Browser<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. For Flag-AGO2 ChIP analysis, the background noises were removed by subtracting Flag ChIP-seq signals from <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> control flies which do not express any Flag-tagged proteins. This subtraction is necessary because Flag ChIP-seq produces high background signals, which interfere with the real Flag-AGO2 ChIP signals. It is known that highly expressed loci are non-specific “hotspots” for ChIP-seq that may lead to misleading localization of proteins on chromatin by this technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. A large amount of Flag-ChIP signals from <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> control line are from transcription start sites of active genes in euchromatin, so that they are likely derived from the non-specific “hotspots”.</p>
<p id="Par49">For SICER analysis, the ChIP-seq results are quantitated by SICER 1.1 against <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome version dm6, with windows of 100 bp-width and 600 bp-gap. The regions with significant SICER scores obtained were referred to as “islands”. The scores for each mutant and control (<italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup>) were subtracted of their respective input signals. False discovery setting is &lt;5%, and islands with scores less than 200 are excluded from further analyses. The input-subtracted scores for each mutant were compared with those of the control (<italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup>) by using the bedtools suite <italic>intersect</italic>, with settings of 50% cross and 200 cut-off. Three categories of ChIP islands were obtained: the mutant-loss islands, mutant-obtained islands, and the mutant/wildtype-shared islands; in which the ChIP signals are decreased, increased, and of no change, respectively. These islands were combined to produce the bedgraph format files, which were loaded onto genome browser for manual analysis of ChIP signals for their chromosome location, base coverage area, relative levels, and distributions. Comparison of data of 3 samples or more used <italic>bedtools multiIntersectBed</italic> with the same cross criteria and cutoff score.</p>
<p id="Par50">For quantification, SICER signals from pericentric heterochromatin and euchromatin of chromosome 2 and 3 were separately calculated for the percentage of islands that are decreased, increased, or of no change in each mutant comparing to the control. The total length covered by each type of islands was also calculated for pericentric heterochromatin. The pericentric heterochromatin regions are distinguished from euchromatin based on chromosome band, which is largely consistent with our ChIP-seq data of HP1. They were manually set as: 2L: 22,090,000–23,513,711; 2R: 1–4,505,672; 3L: 23,247,000–28,110,226; 3R: 1–4,165,641. The remaining regions on the two chromosomes were treated as euchromatin in calculations. The quantification of HP1 data is based on average of SICER scores from 3 independent ChIP experiments for <italic>Top3β</italic>, 2 for <italic>AGO2</italic>, and 2 for <italic>Top3β/AGO2</italic> mutants. The quantification of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 data is based on SICER analysis from 3 independent ChIP experiments.</p>
<p id="Par51">The overlapping of ChIP islands between HP1, Top3β, and AGO2 was calculated based on the width of ChIP SICER peaks. To summarize, both heterochromatin and euchromatin SICER-predicted islands were selected depending on the subject. The overlaps between two ChIP SICER scores were obtained by crossing the two ChIP SICER islands using <italic>bedtools intersect</italic> with at least 50% overlap of the shortest island. The uncrossed portions were obtained by subtracting the crossed SICER island’s width from the total islands of either heterochromatin or euchromatin. The percentage of the SICER islands of a special protein in total heterochromatin was calculated by using the width of SICER islands divided by the length of total heterochromatin of chromosome 2 and 3 (14,956,269 bases).</p>

<title>RNA-sequencing and microarray analysis</title>
<p id="Par52">A total of 200 μl <italic>Drosophila</italic> heads/per sample were collected by fast freezing and sieving. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Three sets of independently prepared RNA samples were applied for RNA sequencing and microarray assay. For the microarray, RNA concentration and quality were measured by Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and the Agilent Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Chip (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Two hundred nanograms of total RNA was labeled using the Agilent Low-Input QuickAmp Labeling Kit, and was purified and quantified according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. A total of 600 ng Cy3-labeled cRNA was hybridized for 17 h to Agilent Unrestricted AMADID Release GE 4x44K 60mer <italic>Drosophila</italic> V2 oligo microarrays (G2519F). Following post-hybridization rinses, arrays were scanned using an Agilent SureScan microarray scanner at 3 micron resolution, and hybridization intensity data was extracted from the scanned images using Agilent’s Feature Extraction Software.</p>
<p id="Par53">Microarray data was analyzed using parametric statistical analysis approach and the JMP11 platform-based DIAINE 6.0 analysis suit. After normalization of the gene expression intensities by <italic>z</italic>-transformation and generation of <italic>z</italic>-scores, samples were first examined by sample scatter plots, sample hierarchical clusters, and principal component analysis. Possible outlier samples were excluded using pairwise analysis. Then, pairwise analysis between different gene groups were performed by pairwise <italic>z</italic>-test with multi-comparison correction to generate <italic>z</italic>-test <italic>p</italic>-value, <italic>z</italic>-ratio, fold-change, false discovery rate (FDR), and average gene expression levels for each comparison group. All microarray results were filtered globally by selecting probes with probe detection <italic>p</italic>-values ≤ 0.02, and sample group one-way independent ANOVA <italic>p</italic>-values &lt; 0.05. The results from probes not meeting the above criteria were excluded. The filtered probes were then further selected to create a list of significant probes that must pass all four criteria for each comparison: (a) <italic>z</italic>-test <italic>p</italic>-values &lt; 0.05, (b) FDR ≤ 0.30, (c) <italic>z</italic>-ratio or fold change absolute values &gt;=1.5, (d) average signal intensity for each comparison group ≥0. Only results from the list of significant probes were considered significant and used to produce the significant gene lists. When a gene has multiple significant probes, the maxium of the average signals of all probes was used as the levels of gene expression in subsequent calculations. The difference between levels of gene expression was then calculated, and the data obtained were utilized for gene set enrichment analysis with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene oncology database to find the significant functional/pathway level changes and gene–gene interactions.</p>
<p id="Par54">RNA-seq analysis was proceeded by genome mapping on dm6 version <italic>Drosophila</italic> standard genome by Tophat 2.0.9 with gene coordinators as template and standard parameters. The mapping result bam format files were aligned using Tuxedo tool suite and generated common alignment transcript files and each sample’s FPKM data for further study. The change of gene expression was calculated by Cuffdiff from Tuxedo tool suite and then summarized by mapping gene position. Largest transcript changes for each gene was selected with a <italic>p</italic>-value and <italic>q</italic>-value. The gene list was first filtered by ANOVA test on <italic>z</italic>-scores with <italic>p</italic>-value ≤ 0.05. Then the significant genes were selected on the filtered gene by (a) <italic>q</italic>-value ≤ 0.05, (b) fold change value ≥ 1.5. The sample correlation studies were performed by using FPKM of each gene as the raw gene signal and performed the log <italic>z</italic>-transform to obtain gene expression <italic>z</italic>-score as the normalized gene expression level for each gene on each sample. The Pearson correlation coefficients were analyzed and combined with the agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach with average distance method which was used to find possible sample group outliers. This group aggregation effect was further examined by principal component analysis to unveil the group separation patterns. The gene expression data were further used as the input to calculate gene set enrichment analysis by PAGE algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-6-144">https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471–2105–6–144</ext-link>) to monitor relative functional change with various comparison pairs.</p>
