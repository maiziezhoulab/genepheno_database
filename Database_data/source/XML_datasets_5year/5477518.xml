<abstract>
<p>Haploinsufficiency of progranulin (PGRN) due to mutations in the granulin (<italic>GRN</italic>) gene causes frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and complete loss of PGRN leads to a lysosomal storage disorder, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). Accumulating evidence suggests that PGRN is essential for proper lysosomal function, but the precise mechanisms involved are not known. Here, we show that PGRN facilitates neuronal uptake and lysosomal delivery of prosaposin (PSAP), the precursor of saposin peptides that are essential for lysosomal glycosphingolipid degradation. We found reduced levels of PSAP in neurons both in mice deficient in PGRN and in human samples from FTLD patients due to <italic>GRN</italic> mutations. Furthermore, mice with reduced PSAP expression demonstrated FTLD-like pathology and behavioural changes. Thus, our data demonstrate a role of PGRN in PSAP lysosomal trafficking and suggest that impaired lysosomal trafficking of PSAP is an underlying disease mechanism for NCL and FTLD due to <italic>GRN</italic> mutations.</p>

<body>
<p>Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the most prevalent form of early-onset dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD), and accounts for 20–25% of presenile dementias<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. A large subset of individuals with FTLD have evidence of ubiquitin-positive inclusions comprised of the protein TDP-43 (referred to as FTLD-TDP)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Haploinsufficiency of the <italic>granulin</italic> (<italic>GRN</italic>) gene is one of the major causes of FTLD-TDP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. <italic>GRN</italic> encodes an evolutionarily conserved, secreted glycoprotein of 7.5 granulin repeats (progranulin, PGRN), and its function in the nervous system is still not well understood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Emerging evidence suggests a role for PGRN in regulating lysosomal function. First, individuals who are homozygous for mutant <italic>GRN</italic> exhibit neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, which is a group of lysosomal storage diseases characterized by the accumulation of autofluorescent storage material (lipofuscin) in neurons and other cell types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Mice lacking PGRN also accumulate lipofuscin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> and share several common pathologies with animal models of other NCL disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Second, <italic>GRN</italic> is transcriptionally coregulated with a number of essential lysosomal genes by the transcriptional factor TFEB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Third, within cells, PGRN is localized to lysosomes and two independent PGRN lysosomal trafficking pathways have been identified<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. However, the precise lysosomal function of PGRN remains unclear.</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence also suggests that lysosomal dysfunction might serve as a common mechanism in NCL and FTLD-TDP associated with <italic>GRN</italic> mutations. A recent study has shown that FTLD patients with <italic>GRN</italic> mutations also exhibit typical pathological features of individuals with NCL, including accumulations of saposin D and subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase (SCMAS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Additionally, mice deficient in <italic>Ctsd</italic>, one of the NCL genes, develop TDP-43 aggregates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, a hallmark of FTLD-TDP, supporting the idea that FTLD and NCL are pathologically linked. Therefore, understanding how PGRN regulates lysosomal functions may be helpful in understanding the shared molecular mechanisms underlying FTLD and NCL with <italic>GRN</italic> mutations.</p>
<p>Here, we report that PGRN facilitates lysosomal trafficking of prosaposin (PSAP), the precursor of lysosomal saposin activators essential for glycosphingolipid degradation in the lysosome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, and determines the levels of saposins in neurons. Reduced PSAP and saposin levels are observed in neurons, both in mice lacking PGRN and in samples from humans haploinsufficient for PGRN. Furthermore, reduction in PSAP levels leads to FTLD-like phenotypes in mice, supporting the idea that impaired lysosomal trafficking of PSAP might be a shared disease mechanism in FTLD and NCL caused by <italic>GRN</italic> mutations.</p>

<title>PGRN bridges the interaction between PSAP and sortilin</title>
<p>In a proteomic screen searching for PGRN-binding partners<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, we uncovered a novel interaction between PGRN and PSAP, the precursor of saposin peptides (A, B, C and D) that are essential for glycosphingolipid metabolism in the lysosome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. PSAP or saposin deficiency is known to cause several distinct lysosomal storage disorders, including Gaucher disease, Krabbe disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Lysosomal PSAP and saposins can be derived from the biosynthetic pathway (sorting at trans-Golgi network) or from the extracellular space via the endocytic pathway since PSAP is a secreted glycoprotein. Several receptors have been shown to mediate PSAP lysosomal trafficking, including the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, sortilin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and LRP1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Since both PGRN and PSAP have been reported to bind to sortilin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, we investigated whether PSAP and PGRN compete with each other for sortilin binding. However, in contrast to published data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, we failed to detect an interaction between PSAP and sortilin by co-immunoprecipitation (IP) even when both proteins are overexpressed in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>) or in the COS-7 cell surface-binding assay with alkaline phosphatase (AP)-tagged PSAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Interestingly, PSAP and sortilin strongly associate with each other in the presence of PGRN in the co-IP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>) and in the COS-7 cell surface-binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), suggesting that PGRN bridges the interaction between PSAP and sortilin.</p>

<title>PGRN facilitates PSAP lysosomal delivery via sortilin</title>
<p>Sortilin has been shown to mediate lysosomal delivery of PGRN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Since PGRN mediates the interaction between PSAP and sortilin, we tested whether PGRN facilitates lysosomal trafficking of PSAP through sortilin. Previously, we showed that uptake of PGRN does not occur in COS-7 cells unless sortilin is exogenously expressed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Here we found that in COS-7 cells transfected with sortilin, exogenously added FLAG-tagged PSAP shows no detectable uptake and trafficking to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). However, the presence of recombinant PGRN greatly facilitates PSAP binding to sortilin-expressing COS-7 cells and subsequent lysosomal targeting as shown by colocalization with the lysosomal protease cathepsin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Furthermore, endocytosed PSAP is processed into intermediates and saposin peptides, confirming successful lysosomal delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm that PGRN facilitates PSAP lysosomal trafficking with endogenous levels of sortilin expression, we first examined the binding of exogenous PSAP to cultured cortical neurons at DIV12, which are known to express high levels of sortilin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. AP-tagged PSAP demonstrated specific binding to both neuronal cell bodies and processes that can be displaced by untagged PSAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). Binding of PSAP to the neuronal cell surface is greatly enhanced in the presence of recombinant PGRN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>), which results in much more PSAP uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c–e</xref>). To determine whether sortilin is the receptor for PGRN uptake in cortical neurons, we compared the uptake of full-length PGRN compared with PGRNΔ3aa, which has the sortilin-binding site in PGRN deleted<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. PGRNΔ3aa recombinant protein cannot be taken up by neurons and fails to enhance neuronal PSAP uptake, confirming that sortilin is the primary receptor for PGRN on the neuronal cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a–c</xref>). The presence of GST-RAP (glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase-tagged receptor-associated protein), which blocks LRP1 ligand interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, reduces PSAP uptake by ∼75% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a, 3c</xref>), suggesting that LRP1 is the main receptor for PSAP uptake in cortical neurons. GST-RAP also partially blocks PGRN uptake, in line with previous report that RAP blocks the interaction between sortilin and its ligands<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. In addition, PSAP enhances PGRN uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a, 3b</xref>) and facilitates the uptake of PGRNΔ3aa protein, which is not taken up by neurons on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). These data, together with our previous findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, strongly support that PGRN and PSAP facilitate each other's uptake and lysosomal trafficking via their respective receptors, sortilin and LRP1.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>PGRN facilitates neuronal uptake of glial-derived PSAP</title>
<p>To understand the physiological interactions of PGRN and PSAP <italic>in vivo</italic>, we examined PGRN and PSAP expression patterns in the mouse brain under normal conditions and in disease-like states. In the normal brain, PGRN is expressed in both neurons and microglia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), consistent with a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. PSAP and the PGRN receptor, sortilin, exhibit a punctate localization in neurons with minimal expression in microglia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Since the levels of PGRN are known to be upregulated in microglia under inflammatory conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, we also determined the expression of PSAP in response to injury. In response to an acute cortical stab injury, the protein levels of PGRN and, to a lesser extent, PSAP are upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a–c</xref>). Costaining with Iba1 showed that PGRN and PSAP are highly expressed in activated microglia in response to injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d, 4e</xref>). Additionally, increased PSAP levels are also detected in activated astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Furthermore, the expression of PGRN and PSAP is increased in activated glia during normal ageing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Consistent with these <italic>in vivo</italic> data, western blot analysis with cultured cortical neurons and microglia showed high levels of PGRN and PSAP proteins expressed and secreted from primary microglia and high levels of sortilin in neuronal cell lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a–c</xref>).</p>
<p>The expression pattern of PGRN, PSAP and sortilin suggests that neuronal sortilin mediates endocytosis of the glia-derived PGRN–PSAP complex. To determine the role of microglial PGRN in delivering PSAP to neurons, we collected conditioned medium (CM) from radiolabelled microglia from wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking PGRN and applied it to DIV12 primary cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Application of conditioned media from WT microglia to neurons leads to much more efficient PSAP uptake and processing than conditioned media derived from <italic>Grn</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> microglia 67.7% ±6.0 SEM relative to WT control, although PSAP levels are comparable in the CM of WT versus <italic>Grn</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>), suggesting that microglia-derived PGRN facilitates neuronal uptake of PSAP. Thus, despite the presence of PSAP receptors M6PR and LRP1 in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>), PGRN enhances PSAP neuronal uptake via sortilin-mediated endocytosis, possibly due to higher levels of sortilin on the neuronal cell surface compared with M6PR and LRP1.</p>
<p>To investigate the role of PGRN in regulating PSAP trafficking <italic>in vivo</italic>, we measured neuronal PSAP levels in adult neurons of WT and <italic>Grn</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice. Neuronal PSAP signal in neurons is significantly reduced in <italic>Grn</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>), despite an increase of PSAP levels in glial cells in <italic>Grn</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Similar results were seen when lysosomal PSAP signals were quantified in WT and <italic>Grn</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). However, PGRN does not appear to have a significant role in PSAP lysosomal trafficking in the biosynthetic pathway as neuroblastoma cells N2a lacking PGRN expression still traffic PSAP to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). These data together support a role of PGRN in facilitating PSAP lysosomal trafficking from the extracellular space <italic>in vivo</italic>. Consistent with this notion, PGRN deficiency leads to significant increases in serum levels of PSAP protein without changes in PSAP mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c,d</xref>). Similar results were obtained in sortilin-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c,d</xref>), supporting an <italic>in vivo</italic> role of PGRN-sortilin in PSAP uptake and lysosomal delivery.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Neuronal saposin levels are decreased in FTLD-<italic>GRN</italic></title>
<p>PGRN haploinsufficiency is a leading cause of FTLD-TDP. To assess whether PSAP trafficking is affected by <italic>GRN</italic> mutations in patients with FTLD-TDP, we stained PSAP and saposins in the orbitofrontal cortex of controls, and in patients with FTLD due to <italic>GRN</italic> mutations (FTLD-<italic>GRN</italic>), or AD. Increased levels of PSAP are detected in the microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a,d</xref>) and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b,e</xref>) in tissue from patients with FTLD-<italic>GRN</italic> and AD patients. Despite this increase, a marked reduction of neuronal PSAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a–c</xref>), saposin A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>), saposin B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>) and saposin C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>) signals is observed in FTLD-<italic>GRN</italic> compared with controls or AD, supporting our hypothesis that PGRN mutations lead to reduced neuronal saposin levels in FTLD. To determine whether decreased neuronal saposin levels are specific to FTLD-<italic>GRN</italic>, we also examined the levels of saposin B in more detail in controls, and individuals with AD, FTLD-<italic>GRN</italic> or corticobasal degeneration, a subtype of FTLD with tau inclusions (FTLD-tau). Normal levels of neuronal saposin B were detected in samples from individuals with FTLD-tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a,c</xref>), supporting the idea that decreased neuronal saposin levels in FTLD-<italic>GRN</italic> is not a general feature of all FTLD subtypes. Furthermore, neuronal PGRN levels are directly correlated with neuronal saposin B levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d</xref>), further supporting a critical role of PGRN in determining saposin levels in neurons. Consistent with a previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and the fact that saposin D is one of the main components of lipofuscin in a vast majority of NCL cases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, we observed accumulation of neuronal saposin D in FTLD-<italic>GRN</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Careful examination revealed that relatively healthy neurons have lower levels of saposin D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>), similar to other saposins but neurons with elevated LAMP1 levels and enlarged lysosomes show increased saposin D intensity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>), suggesting that lysosomal dysfunction leads to the accumulation of saposin D. The specific accumulation of saposin D but not other saposins in FTLD-<italic>GRN</italic> might reflect their different stability and aggregation properties in the lysosome.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Reduced PSAP function in mice leads to FTLD-like phenotypes</title>
<p>Since saposin levels are markedly decreased in FTLD-<italic>GRN</italic> patients, we asked whether loss of PSAP function could lead to FTLD-related phenotypes in mice. Because total loss of PSAP leads to death around weaning age in mice, we took advantage of another mouse line (<italic>Psap</italic><sup><italic>−/−NA</italic></sup>) that expresses low levels of PSAP (∼5–40% of WT), which can live up to 7 months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Accumulation of p62 and ubiquitin-positive aggregates is evident in these mice compared with age-matched WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a,b</xref>). Glial activation is also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9b</xref>). Although we failed to detect TDP-43 aggregation in the <italic>Psap</italic><sup><italic>−/−NA</italic></sup> mice, hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 accumulates in the insoluble fraction of brain lysates of <italic>Psap</italic><sup><italic>−/−NA</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9a</xref>). The lipophilic SCMAS is another main component of lipofuscin detected in many NCL patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, and was found to aggregate in patients with FTLD due to <italic>GRN</italic> mutations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. We found that SCMAS accumulates in aged PGRN-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>) and also in the 6-month-old <italic>Psap</italic><sup><italic>−/−NA</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9b</xref>), but not in the age-matched controls.

<p>PGRN deficiency in mice leads to FTLD-related behavioural deficits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. To determine whether loss of PSAP function could lead to FTLD-related phenotypes, we assessed the behaviour of aged <italic>Psap</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice. In the open-field test, 12-month-old <italic>Psap</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice show reduced distance travelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9c</xref>) and increased latency in the centre compared with littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9d</xref>), indicating disinhibition-like behaviour. Similar to <italic>Pgrn</italic> heterozygous knockout mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, sociability is affected in <italic>Psap</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice as they spent significantly less time with a stranger than control mice in the social interaction test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9e</xref>). In addition, the number of direct interactions with the stranger mouse is also reduced in <italic>Psap</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice compared with controls, without any significant changes in olfactory sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9f</xref> and data not shown). Next, we tested for short-term memory using the novel object recognition test. <italic>Psap</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice have a reduced preference score for a novel object compared with controls, showing that short-term memory is impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9g</xref>).

Thus, PSAP haploinsufficiency in mice also leads to FTLD-related behavioural changes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite accumulating evidence supporting a crucial role of PGRN in maintaining proper lysosomal function, how PGRN does so remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that PGRN determines the levels of neuronal saposins by facilitating neuronal uptake and lysosomal trafficking of PSAP through sortilin and that loss of saposin function contributes to FTLD-like phenotypes in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10</xref>). Our data provide insight into how PGRN regulates lysosomal function and suggest a novel disease mechanism for subsets of FTLD and NCL due to <italic>GRN</italic> mutations.</p>
<p>Saposins are essential for proper glycosphingolipid degradation in the lysosome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The saposin precursor PSAP can be delivered to lysosomes from the biosynthetic pathway or from the extracellular space. Since a large portion of PSAP is secreted, lysosomal delivery of PSAP from the extracellular space may be a significant source of lysosomal saposins in neurons, especially under glia activation, when the levels of PSAP are upregulated in glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) and most PSAP are secreted from glial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). PSAP strongly interacts with PGRN both within the cell and in the extracellular space<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Our studies with primary cortical neurons reveal two pathways for neuronal PSAP uptake, through LRP1 or through piggyback ride from PGRN and the PGRN receptor sortilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Given the strong dependence of neuronal PSAP levels on PGRN in the aged human brain, we speculate that the PGRN receptor, sortilin, might have a critical role in lysosomal delivery of PGRN-PSAP in such conditions. Unfortunately, the cell surface levels of trafficking receptors, which determine the endocytic trafficking routes for the PGRN–PSAP complex, are difficult to measure <italic>in vivo</italic>. Another possibility is that as PGRN levels increase in microglia during ageing, PGRN has a more critical role in neuronal uptake of PSAP via sortilin-mediated endocytosis.</p>
<p>In our previous work, we have demonstrated that PSAP facilitates lysosomal trafficking of PGRN via M6PR and LRP1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Consistent with our study, PSAP was shown to regulate plasma PGRN levels in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Thus, by forming a complex, PSAP and PGRN facilitate each other's lysosomal trafficking. Distinct trafficking mechanisms might be used by different cell types under certain conditions, depending on the availabilities of the three trafficking receptors involved.</p>
<p>Although this study focuses on the regulation of PSAP by PGRN in neurons, another interesting observation in the current study is that glial cells, including microglia and astrocytes, upregulates PGRN and PSAP levels on injury and inflammatory conditions, such as traumatic brain injury and during FTLD and AD disease progression, and during normal ageing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Whether PSAP–PGRN interaction regulates glial activation and whether that is related to the lysosomal functions of PSAP and PGRN remain to be explored. A role of PGRN in regulating lysosomal activity and complement activation in microglia has been demonstrated recently<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. It will be interesting to test whether the PSAP–PGRN interaction has a role in this.</p>
<p>In addition to facilitating PSAP lysosomal trafficking, PGRN may regulate other aspects of PSAP biology, such as PSAP processing, and PGRN may have other functions in lysosomes in addition to regulating PSAP. Proper lysosomal function is essential for long-term neuronal survival<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Emerging studies suggest an interesting link between early-onset lysosomal storage diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> and late-onset neurodegenerative diseases. The <italic>GRN</italic> gene is one example in which complete loss of PGRN causes NCL and haploinsufficiency of PGRN leads to FTLD. Another example is the glucocerebrosidase (<italic>GBA</italic>) gene. While loss-of-function mutations in <italic>GBA</italic> cause Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder, heterozygous mutation of <italic>GBA</italic> is associated with Parkinson's disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. These observations suggest that a generalized impairment of lysosomal function may be a key driver of pathogenesis in late-onset neurodegenerative diseases, including FTLD. Besides <italic>GRN</italic>, other FTLD-associated genes, <italic>VCP/p97</italic>, <italic>CHMP2B</italic>, <italic>SQSTM1</italic>, <italic>TBK1</italic> and <italic>OPTN</italic>, are involved in membrane trafficking and the autophagy–lysosome pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, our study demonstrates a role of the FTLD protein, PGRN, in determining neuronal saposin levels by facilitating lysosomal trafficking of PSAP and argues that impaired saposin function might be one of the disease mechanisms of FTLD-TDP with <italic>GRN</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10">Fig. 10</xref>). Our results underscore the importance of maintaining lysosomal saposin levels in preventing neurodegeneration in FTLD-TDP and give novel insights into the therapeutic development of FTLD-<italic>GRN</italic>.</p>

<title>A schematic drawing illustrating the proposed disease mechanism of FTLD with <italic>GRN</italic> mutations.</title>
<p>PGRN and PSAP are highly secreted by microglia and astrocytes. Through binding to sortilin on neuronal cell surface, PGRN facilitates neuronal uptake of extracellular PSAP. Lysosomal delivery of PSAP results in PSAP processing into individual saposins (SAPs), which helps maintain normal lysosomal function in neurons. PGRN mutations in FTLD results in reduced PGRN levels and thus less neuronal uptake of PSAP and reduced saposin levels in neuronal lysosomes, which leads to lysosomal dysfunction and eventually neuronal cell death and FTLD. PSAP receptors, LRP1 and M6PR, which mediates alternate pathways for PSAP lysosomal delivery, are not shown in the drawing.</p>
