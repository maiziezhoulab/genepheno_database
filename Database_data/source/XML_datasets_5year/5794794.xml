<p id="Par1">Maternal immune activation (MIA) contributes to behavioral abnormalities relevant to schizophrenia in adult offspring, although the molecular mechanisms underlying MIA-induced behavioral changes remain unclear. Here we demonstrated that dietary intake of glucoraphanin (GF), the precursor of a natural antioxidant sulforaphane, during juvenile and adolescent stages prevented cognitive deficits and loss of parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of adult offspring after MIA. Gene set enrichment analysis by RNA sequencing showed that MIA caused abnormal expression of centrosome-related genes in the PFC and hippocampus of adult offspring, and that dietary intake of GF improved these abnormal gene expressions. Particularly, MIA increased the expression of suppressor of fermentation-induced loss of stress resistance protein 1 (<italic>Sfi1</italic>) mRNA in the PFC and hippocampus of adult offspring, and dietary intake of GF prevented the expression of <italic>Sfi1</italic> mRNA in these regions. Interestingly, we found altered expression of SFI1 in the postmortem brains and <italic>SFI1</italic> mRNA in hair follicle cells from patients with schizophrenia compared with controls. Overall, these data suggest that centrosome-related genes may play a role in the onset of psychosis in offspring after MIA. Therefore, dietary intake of GF-rich vegetables in high-risk psychosis subjects may prevent the transition to psychosis in young adulthood.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">The onset of schizophrenia, a chronic and severe mental disorder, usually occurs in young adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Among three major symptoms (e.g. positive symptom, negative symptom, cognitive impairment), cognitive impairment is the core symptom of schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Interestingly, cognitive impairment can be detected before the onset of schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Therefore, there are increasing interests in the potential benefit of early intervention by nutritional antioxidants in schizophrenia since oxidative stress plays a role in the prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par3">The transcription factor Nuclear factor (erythroid 2-derived)-like 2 (Nrf2) and Keap1 (Kelch-like erythroid cell-derived protein with CNC homology [ECH]-associated protein 1) system plays a central role in cellular defense against oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Thus, the Keap1–Nrf2 system is involved in attenuating oxidative stress-associated pathogenesis of a number of disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The potent antioxidant and naturally occurring compound sulforaphane (SFN; 1-isothiocyanato-4-methylsulfinylbutane) is an organosulfur compound derived from a glucosinolate precursor glucoraphanin (GF) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>), which is found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We reported that SFN could attenuate behavioral abnormalities in mice after the administration of a psychostimulant methamphetamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> or <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist phencyclidine (PCP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we reported that dietary intake of 0.1% GF food pellet during juvenile and adolescent stages could prevent the onset of cognitive deficits after repeated PCP administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that SFN (or GF) may have prophylactic and therapeutic effects on cognitive impairment and psychosis in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Cognitive deficits in the juvenile offspring after prenatal poly(I:C) exposure.

<title>Behavioral data and PV-immunohistochemistry of juvenile offspring after MIA</title>
<p id="Par6">First, we performed behavioral tests (locomotion and NORT) and parvalbumin (PV) immunohistochemistry in juvenile offspring after MIA because the reduction of PV immunoreactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) might be related with cognitive impairment and psychosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.

In the open field test, there was no difference between the control and poly(I:C)-treated groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). In NORT, there was no difference between the two groups during the training session (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). However, during the retention session, the exploratory preference of the poly(I:C)-treated group was significantly lower than that of the control group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). PV-immunoreactivity (PV-IR) in the mPFC of juvenile offspring of the poly(I:C)-treated group was significantly lower than that in the saline-treated (control) group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>). These findings suggest that juvenile offspring of prenatal poly(I:C)-treated mice showed the reduction of PV-IR in the mPFC, resulting in cognitive deficits.</p>

<title>Effects of dietary intake of 0.1% GF food pellets during juvenile and adolescent stages on cognitive deficits and reduction of PV-IR in the mPFC of adult offspring after MIA</title>
<p id="Par8">We examined whether dietary intake of 0.1% GF food pellets during juvenile and adolescent stages could prevent cognitive deficits and reduction of PV-IR in the mPFC of adult offspring after MIA. Offspring (4-week-old) were divided into normal food pellet and 0.1% GF-containing food pellet groups. The mice were given free access to water and both the food pellets that were specifically designed for mice for 4 weeks (P28–P56). Subsequently, normal food pellets were given to both the groups. Behavioral tests of adult offspring were performed during adulthood (P70–P84) after prenatal poly(I:C) injections (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a</xref>). In the open field test, locomotion was unchanged among the four groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b</xref>). There was no difference among the four groups in NORT training sessions. However, in the retention session of NORT, the exploratory preference of the poly(I:C) + GF group was significantly higher than that of the poly(I:C) + control group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c</xref>). These findings suggest that dietary intake of 0.1% GF pellets from P28 to P56 improved cognitive deficits in adult offspring after MIA.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Effects of dietary intake of 0.1% GF on cognitive deficits in the adult offspring after prenatal poly(I:C) exposure.

<title>RNA-sequencing and GSEA</title>
<p id="Par10">To study the molecular targets for the beneficial effects of dietary intake of 0.1% GF food pellets, we performed RNA sequencing of the PFC and hippocampus from the four groups of adult offspring. The most important finding using gene set enrichment analysis was that centrosome-related genes played a key role in the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of GF dietary intake in the MIA model (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a–c</xref>). The centrosome is involved in many different cell processes, particularly cell division, cell migration, and differentiation. Accumulating evidence suggests a central role of centrosome at late stages of neuronal development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Among the centrosome genes, we found a significant change in suppressor of fermentation-induced loss of stress resistance 1 (<italic>Sfi1</italic>) expression, which is localized in the centriole and involved in cell division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. We measured the expression of <italic>Sfi1</italic> mRNA and SFI1 levels in subsequent experiments. The expression of <italic>Sfi1</italic> mRNA in the PFC and hippocampus of adult offspring was significantly increased by prenatal poly(I:C) injection, whereas dietary intake of 0.1% GF food pellets significantly blocked the increase in this gene expression (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a–c</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>RNA-sequencing analysis and GSEA of brain samples from adult offspring after prenatal poly(I:C) exposure.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par12">In the present study, we found that dietary intake of 0.1% GF food pellets during the juvenile and adolescent stages of offspring after MIA prevented cognitive deficits and reduction of PV-IR in the PrL of the mPFC at adulthood after MIA. Furthermore, centrosome signaling via Sfi1 might play a role in the development of behavioral abnormalities in adult offspring after MIA, as well as in the beneficial effects of 0.1% GF dietary intake. Finally, we found altered expressions of SFI1 in the parietal cortex and <italic>SFI1</italic> mRNA in hair follicle cells of patients with schizophrenia, suggesting that abnormal expression of SFI1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. These all findings suggest that altered centrosome signaling through Sfi1 might play a role in the development of behavioral abnormalities after MIA as well as in the beneficial effects of GF dietary intake. Therefore, it is likely that supplementation with GF-rich food in subjects with a high-risk for psychosis has prophylactic effects on the psychotic behaviors relevant to schizophrenia and related disorders in adulthood.</p>
<p id="Par13">We found cognitive deficits of juvenile offspring from poly(I:C)-treated mice, consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Since cognitive impairment is seen in adolescent and young adult with a high risk for psychosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, it seems that the juvenile offspring after MIA may be at the prodromal stage for psychosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we found reduction of PV-IR in the mPFC at juvenile offspring after MIA, which is consistent with the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. It is well known that reduction of PV-IR in the PFC may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is likely that reduction of PV-IR in the mPFC may play a crucial role in the cognitive deficits of juvenile offspring after MIA.</p>
<p id="Par14">Furthermore, we found abnormal expression of <italic>Keap1 and Nrf2</italic> genes in the hippocampus of juvenile offspring after prenatal poly(I:C) exposure, although expression of these genes in the PFC remained the same. Thus, it seems that abnormalities in the Keap1-Nrf2 system in the hippocampus might play a role in the cognitive deficits seen in juvenile offspring after MIA. Recently, we reported decreased gene expression of <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subtypes, <italic>Grin1</italic>, <italic>Grin2a</italic>, and <italic>Grin2b</italic> in the hippocampus (but not PFC) of juvenile offspring after prenatal poly(I:C) exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Taken together, it is likely that MIA can interfere with Keap1-Nrf2 system and NMDA receptor in the hippocampus during brain development, resulting in cognitive deficits in juvenile and adult offspring. A recent study showed that the expressions of Keap1 and Nrf2 in the parietal cortex from patients with schizophrenia were lower than those of controls, suggesting that Keap-Nrf2 signaling may play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, further detailed studies on how prenatal poly(I:C) exposure induces the Keap1-Nrf2 system and behavioral abnormalities in juvenile and adulthood are needed.</p>
<p id="Par15">We found reduction of PV-IR in the PrL, but not IL, of mPFC at adult offspring after MIA, consistent with the previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Reduction of PV-IR cells in the PFC is suggested to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we found that dietary intake of 0.1% GF food pellet at 4–8 weeks of age (similar to juvenile and adolescent stages in human) in poly(I:C) offspring could treat or prevent cognitive deficits and reduction of PV-IR at adulthood after MIA. Prenatal infection may contribute to the onset of neurodevelopmental disorders in their offspring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, and alterations in the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling in the hippocampus may play a role in MIA-induced abnormal brain neurodevelopment. Previously, we reported that dietary intake of 0.1% GF food pellet might prevent the onset of cognitive deficits and reduction of PV-IR in the mPFC after repeated PCP administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we also reported that dietary intake of 0.1% GF food pellet could prevent the onset of depression-like phenotype in mice after chronic social defeat stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> or inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Taken together, it is likely that early intervention with GF (or SFN)-rich foods during juvenile and adolescent stages might have prophylactic and therapeutic effects on abnormal behaviors in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par16">The centrosome is the main microtubule organizer in mammalian cells, participating in a variety of processes from cell polarization to cell division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In this study, <italic>SFI1</italic> mRNA expression in the hair follicle cells of patients with schizophrenia was lower than that of healthy controls although SFI1 protein expression in the parietal cortex from patients with schizophrenia was higher than that of controls. The reasons underlying this discrepancy are currently unclear, the findings are similar to the previous report (<italic>FABP4</italic> mRNA in hair follicle and postmortem brain)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Mutations in genes encoding centrosomal components are associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. For example, mutations in the centrosomal genes lissencephaly 1 (<italic>LIS1</italic>) and doublecortin (<italic>DCX</italic>), have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, while the centrosome gene disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 <italic>(DISC1</italic>) is a candidate susceptibility gene for schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. A recent study demonstrated that DISC1 regulates Ndel1’s kinetochore attachment, but not its centrosome localization, during mitosis, and that disrupting DISC1/Ndel1 complex formation prolongs mitotic length and interferes with cell cycle progression in human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Furthermore, alterations in the expression of <italic>Sfi1</italic> in the striatum and hippocampus of 39,X<sup>Y*</sup>O mice, a genetic model of neurodevelopmental disorder have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Moreover, copy number variants encompassing <italic>SFI1</italic> on chromosome 22q12.2 have been identified in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. It is noteworthy that beneficial effects of SFN have been shown in young subjects with ASD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par17">Adolescence is more vulnerable to psychiatric disorders since adolescence is a critical period of brain neurodevelopment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. The study also supports for the deleterious effects of early brain insult on abnormalities in brain neurodevelopment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it is known that adolescence is the peak time for the onset of a number of psychiatric disorders. Therefore, it seems that cognitive impairment at adolescence may present prodromal symptoms for later onset of these disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is likely that early intervention by the nutritional antioxidants in young peoples at high risk for psychosis might play a crucial role in preventing the onset of psychosis.</p>
<p id="Par18">This paper has some limitations: Postmortem interval (PMI) and storage days of postmortem brain samples were significantly different from the two groups. Furthermore, age from the hair-follicle samples was significantly different from the two groups. These parameters may affect the expression of SFI1 protein and <italic>SFI1</italic> mRNA in the human samples. Further study using controls with matched for these parameters will be needed.</p>
<p id="Par19">In conclusion, the present data suggest that abnormal modulation of centrosome-related genes plays a role in the behavioral abnormality and reduction of PV-IR in the mPFC of offspring after MIA. Interesting, through the centrosome modulation, dietary intake of 0.1% GF during juvenile and adolescent stage could prevent the onset of psychosis in the adult offspring after MIA. Finally, supplementation of SFN (or GF)-rich vegetables in young peoples at high risk for psychosis may prevent the transition to actual psychosis.</p>

Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a Trans Blot Mini Cell (Bio-Rad). For immunodetection, the blots were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in TBST (Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature (RT), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used: SFI1 (Cat#: 13550–1-AP, 1: 1,000, Proteintech Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The next day, the blots were washed three times with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000) for 1 hour at RT. After three final washes with TBST, the bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence plus the Western Blotting Detection system (GE Healthcare Bioscience). The blots then were washed three times with TBST and incubated with a primary antibody against β-actin. Images were captured with a Fuji LAS3000-mini imaging system (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) and immunoreactive bands were quantified.</p>

<title>RT-qPCR of <italic>SFI1</italic> mRNA in the hair follicle samples from patients with schizophrenia</title>
<p id="Par31">All samples (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab2">2</xref>) of scalp hair-follicle were used as described in the previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. As described, expression levels of <italic>SFI1</italic> gene (Hs01564965_m1) were measured. Total RNA was extracted by use of an RNAqueous-Micro kit (Ambion, Grand Island, New York). The RNA samples were used in the first strand cDNA synthesis with SuperScript VILO Master Mix (#11755050 Thermo Fisher Scientific, Yokohama, Japan). All samples were tested in triplicate and average values were used for quantification based on the standard curve method. The average values were normalized to <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA (Hs02758991_g1: VIC-labeled TaqMan Gene Expression Assays, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Yokohama, Japan).</p>
