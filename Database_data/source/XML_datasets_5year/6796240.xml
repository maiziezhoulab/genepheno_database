<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Patients with acute biliary pancreatitis may develop
cholangitis, organ failure and other life-threatening complications. Early
biliary decompression by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) and
biliary sphincterotomy may ameliorate the disease course, but previous
randomized trials have shown conflicting results. Recent guidelines advise
ERC in biliary pancreatitis only in case of cholangitis, and to consider ERC
in case of (persistent) cholestasis. Whether early ERC and biliary
sphincterotomy is beneficial in patients with predicted severe acute biliary
pancreatitis with or without cholestasis, but without cholangitis, remains
debated.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We randomized 230 patients in 25 Dutch hospitals
with predicted severe acute biliary pancreatitis (based on an Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE II] score of ≥8, a modified
Imrie score of ≥3 or a C-reactive protein level of &gt;150 mg/L within 24
hours of admission) and without cholangitis, to early ERC with biliary
sphincterotomy within 24 hours after presentation at the emergency
department or conservative treatment with on-demand ERC in case of
cholangitis or persistent cholestasis. The primary end point was a composite
of death or major complications (i.e. new-onset persistent organ failure,
cholangitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, pancreatic necrosis and pancreatic
insufficiency) during 6 months of follow-up. Patients were stratified for
the presence of cholestasis (based on a bilirubin level of &gt;40µmol/L or a
dilated common bile duct (defined as &gt;8mm in patients ≤75 years or
&gt;10mm in patients &gt;75 years)).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The primary end point occurred in 45 of 117 patients
(39%) in the early ERC group compared with 50 of 113 patients (44%) in the
conservative group (risk ratio 0.89; 95% confidence interval 0.68-1.15;
p = 0.37). 112 patients (96%) in the early ERC group underwent ERC at a
median of 20 hours after presentation at the emergency department
(interquartile range [IQR] 14-23 hours), and after a median of 29 hours
after onset of symptoms (IQR 22-44 hours). Biliary sphincterotomy was
performed in 90 patients (78%). In 35 of the 113 patients (31%) allocated to
conservative treatment, ERC was performed later in the disease course for
cholangitis or persisting cholestasis after a median of 8 days (IQR 3-34
days) after randomization. In the early ERC group, cholangitis occurred less
often compared with conservative treatment (2% versus 10%; p = 0.01) without
significant differences in patient outcome including new-onset organ failure
(19% versus 15%; p = 0.45), death (7% versus 9%; p = 0.57) or other
components of the primary end point. In the conservative group with
on-demand ERC, the total number of ERCs decreased with 66% (128 versus 44
ERCs) without negatively impacting overall outcome. In the subgroup of
patients with cholestasis at randomization, no statistically significant
difference in the primary end point was found (32% versus 43%; risk ratio
0.79; 95% confidence interval 0.57-1.10; p = 0.18).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In patients with predicted severe acute biliary
pancreatitis without cholangitis, early ERC with endoscopic biliary
sphincteromy within 24 hours after presentation at the emergency department
did not reduce the primary end point of death or major complications.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> There is an important heterogeneity among Crohn's
disease patients including clinical presentation and severity, disease
location, disease behavior, presence of extra-intestinal manifestations or
not, disease course or individual response to therapies. There is also a
huge number of genetic combinations and exposition to environmental factors.
At the molecular level, transcriptome performed on mucosal samples exhibit a
striking heterogeneity. A molecular classification could prove more relevant
to predict disease course, response to treatment and to identify new drug
targets.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Our aims are to identify shared and unique
molecular features, clinically significant subtypes, and potential
therapeutic targets. We conducted an integrated analysis of several cohorts
from the IBD Over Time (IBDOT) consortium, including surgical samples of
ileal disease and endoscopic samples of both ileal and colonic disease. We
also searched for data available in the public domain. We performed
molecular clustering (ConsensusClusteringPlus) using mRNA from microarray
and RNA-seq, after correcting for batch effect. Cibersort was used to impute
immune cells fractions from bulk transcriptome. Finally, KEGG pathway
analysis was performed to characterize identified clusters.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> We included in the analysis 580 samples of the IBDOT
consortium (all by microarray) and 971 samples available in the public
domain (508 by RNA-Seq and 736 by microarray). We saw a clear batch effect
between the different platforms and cohorts. Colonic and ileal samples were
well clustered together in each cohort. After correction for batch effect
using biopsy location as a covariate, we identified 4 robust clusters of
Crohn's disease samples. Colonic samples clustered together (C3). Ileal
samples clustered mainly in 2 groups, 1 APOA1-low highly inflammatory (C1),
the other APOA1-high less inflammatory (C2). The fourth group (C4) was
smaller and contained ileal samples only. Immune cells fractions showed a
neutrophilic infiltration in C1, and a higher proportion of CD8 T cells and
Gamma-Delta T cells in C2. Pathway analysis confirmed a typical IBD-like
inflammation in C1, and a more subdued inflammation in C2.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We performed the first molecular classification of
Crohn's disease using more than 1500 gut samples from 6 different cohorts. 4
robust disease groups were identified, representing both disease location
and levels of inflammation. Some limitations were the high heterogeneity of
disease stage and limited data on disease characteristics for the data
collected in the public domain. Future work could look at the disease course
of these 4 clusters and determine their persistence over time.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> NOD-like family pyrin domain containing 6 (NLRP6)
protects from DSS colitis, and NLRP6-deficient animals have a dysbiotic
microbiota (1,2). In other animal facilities variants in the composition of
the microbiota between wt and NLRP6-deficient animals are explained by cage
effects and mother variates but not by the genotype (3,4). Although
intestinal epithelial cells highly express NLRP6, the reconstitution of wt
animals with Nlrp6-deficient bone marrow leads to similar colitis-associated
tumor formation as in Nlrp6-deficient animals (5).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> NLRP6 is highly expressed by epithelial and
goblet cells, but its function in hematopoietic cells is rather unknown.
Here, we determined the expression of NLPR6 in <italic>in vitro</italic>
differentiated T cells, and in T cells after co-transfer of wt and
NLPR6-deficient T cells in RAG hosts to minimize the influence of different
microbiotas on NLPR6 expression by T cells.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> NLPR6 is not expressed by naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells, B
cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages in contrast to epithelial cells.
When naïve T cells are differentiated to Th1 cells, Th1 cells express NLPR6,
whereas only a minority of differentiated Th2 cells and Th17 have NLPR6.
Promoter analysis of the human and mouse NLPR6 starting site revealed
binding regions for STAT1, STAT5a and Tbx21 (T-bet). T-bet induced NLPR6
expression in differentiated Th1 cells because NLPR6 was not detected in
Tbx21-deficient T cells. The production of IFNg by NLPR6-deficient Th1 cells
is reduced compared to wt T cells, which is independent of inflammasome
assembly, because in ASC-deficient T cells differences in IFNg production
was not observed. Moreover, differences in IL-13 and IL-17 production by
in vitro differentiated Th2 and Th17 cells and differences in Foxp3 Treg
cells between wt and NLPR6-deficient T cells was not observed. Similar
frequencies of wt and NLPR6-deficient T cells entered the active phase of
the cell cycle as indicated by Ki67 staining and had similar proliferative
capacities as determined by CFSE washout. T cell developmental defects were
not observed in wt and NLPR6-deficient littermates in thymus, spleen lymph
nodes and colonic lamina propria. However, reduced numbers of
NLPR6-deficient T cells with reduced IFNg production were noted after
co-transfer of wt and NLPR6-deficient T cells in RAG hosts. Principle
component analysis of RNA-seq from wt and NLPR6-deficient T cells obtained
from reconstituted RAG hosts revealed a two-cluster structure, which was
confirmed by hierarchical clustering of all differentiated genes with no
influence of the host on T cells. The 628 down- and the 923 up-regulated
genes were compared to hallmark signatures, which revealed enrichment of
apoptosis, interferon gamma response, inflammatory response, IL-6 JAK STAT3
signaling and TNFα signaling signatures in NLPR6-deficient T cells. Annexin
V/viability staining confirmed increased apoptosis of NLPR6-deficient T
cells compared to wt T cells after co-transfer in RAG hosts. Transfer of wt
CD45RBhigh T cells into RAG hosts resulted in somewhat increased body weight
loss and increased disease scores compared to RAG hosts receiving
NLPR6-deficient T cells two weeks after transfer.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The expression of NLPR6 by differentiated Th1 cells is
rather intrinsic induced and independent of different microbiotas because
NLPR6 expression was observed by <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiated T
cells. As consequence increased apoptosis was observed after transfer of
NLPR6-deficient T cells in RAG hosts. NLRP6 facilitates the survival of CD4
T cells.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Surgery for chronic pancreatitis is currently used
as last resort treatment when the first steps of the step-up approach,
medical and endoscopic treatment, have failed. It has been suggested that
early surgery may lead to better pain relief and preservation of pancreatic
function, as compared to the current step-up approach of medical and
endoscopic treatment, and surgical therapy if all else fails. We conducted a
multicenter randomized controlled trial to compare early surgery with the
current step-up approach.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We included patients with chronic pancreatitis
according to the MANNHEIM criteria with a dilated pancreatic duct (≥ 5 mm)
and severe continuous or intermittent pain attacks, who had only recently
started treatment with opioids. Patients who used strong opioids for more
than 2 months or weak opioids for more than 6 months in the last 2 years
were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to early surgery (6 weeks
after randomization; if pancreatic head &lt; 4cm: lateral
pancreatojejunostomy, if ≥4cm: Frey procedure) or to the step-up approach
(step 1: pain medication, step 2: endoscopic intervention, if step 1 failed,
step 3: surgical intervention, if step 2 failed). Failure criteria were
strictly defined. The primary endpoint was the mean Izbicki pain score
during 18 months of follow-up. Secondary endpoints included pain relief,
complications, mortality, number of interventions, pancreatic function, and
quality of life.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 88 patients were randomized according to calculated
sample size; 44 to early surgery (41 indeed underwent surgery) and 44 to the
step-up approach (44 underwent medical treatment, 39 endoscopic
intervention, and 13 surgical intervention thereafter). During 18 months'
follow-up patients in the early surgery group had a lower mean Izbicki pain
score as compared to patients in the step-up approach (35 vs. 48,
p = 0.018). Taken into account the baseline pain score, early surgery showed
a larger decrease in Izbicki pain score during follow-up (-26 vs. -16,
p = 0.04). Complete or partial pain relief during follow-up was achieved in
54% of patients in early surgery and in 33% of patients in the step-up
approach (RR: 1.52 [1.40-1.66], p &lt; 0.001). Fewer interventions were
performed in the early surgery group compared to the step-up group (median 1
vs. 3, P &lt; 0.001). Complications, mortality (0%), hospital readmission,
pancreatic function and quality of life were comparable between groups.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Early surgery, within the first months of need for
opioid use, for patients with chronic pancreatitis and a dilated pancreatic
duct provides better pain relief with less interventions than the current
step-up approach including endoscopy first, but quality of life is
comparable.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Screening colonoscopy can reduce the incidence and
mortality of colorectal cancer through detection of polyps. However, a miss
rate of up to 27% has been reported for adenomas.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to investigate whether
an automatic polyp detection system during colonoscopy increased the polyp
and adenoma detection rate. Consecutive patients were prospectively
randomized to undergo routine colonoscopy with or without assistance of
real-time automatic polyp detection system providing a simultaneous visual
notice and sound alarm when a polyp was detected. The automatic polyp
detection system used in this study was a previously validated deep-learning
polyp detection software<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 1,058 patients, 536 were randomized to a
colonoscopy (control group), and 522 to a colonoscopy with computer-aided
diagnosis (CAD group). There is no statistical difference between 2 groups
in demographics and adenoma risk factors, including age (p = 0.16), gender
(p = 0.19), BMI (p = 0.99), family/personal adenoma history (p = 0.34/0.8),
and family colon cancer history (p = 0.78) etc. A total of 767 polyps, 422
adenomas and 31 serrated adenomas were detected. The polyp detection rate
(PDR) of the control and CAD groups were 29.10% and 45.02% respectively
(OR = 1.995, 95% CI 1.532-2.544, p &lt; 0.001). The adenoma detection rates
(ADR) were 20.34% and 29.12% respectively (OR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.213-2.135,
p &lt; 0.001). The average number of polyps detected were 0.50 and 0.95
respectively (Change Folds = 1.89, 95% CI 1.63-2.192, p &lt; 0.001). The
average number of adenomas detected were 0.31 and 0.53 respectively (Change
Folds = 1.72, 95% CI 1.419-2.084, p &lt; 0.001). There was a total of 39
false alarms and no missed polyp by the automatic polyp detection.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Automatic polyp detection during colonoscopy resulted
in an increase in the number of polyps and adenomas found per colonoscopy
and improved the overall ADR and PDR. <table-wrap id="table1-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table1-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table1"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Control Group (N = 269)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">CAD Group (N = 498)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">P value</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Pathology.

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Removal of all colorectal adenomas during
colonoscopy (CS) is recommended; however, the increasingly frequent
detection of diminutive adenomas raises the question as to whether the
removal of all is mandatory, balancing benefit and harms.<sup>1</sup> The
increasing use of antithrombotic drugs and possibility of missed diminutive
adenomas may also require discussion regarding the acceptability of a
watch-and-wait approach for diminutive adenomas. Although the watch-and-wait
approach is allowed in Japan,<sup>2</sup> evidence is lacking for it.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This study aimed to evaluate the cumulative
incidence of advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACN) in individuals with
untreated diminutive adenomas, and to compare this with the incidence in
those without adenomas. The incidence was also evaluated after identifying
and adjusting for risk factors for the incidence of ACN. Data from 1,378
consecutive asymptomatic individuals who underwent first screening CS and at
least one follow-up CS without polypectomy at the Cancer Screening Center,
National Cancer Center, Tokyo, between February 2004 and March 2013 were
analyzed. Those with no adenomas or only nonadvanced diminutive adenomas
(&lt;5 mm) confirmed by image-enhanced magnifying endoscopy were scheduled
to undergo follow-up CS within 5 years after the initial CS without
treatment. Thus, participants were classified into two groups; those with
untreated diminutive adenomas (group A) and those without any adenomas
(group B). The cumulative incidence of ACN in both groups was assessed in
March 2018, using Gray’s test with consideration of competing risk
situations. Multivariate analysis using the Fine and Gray model was
performed to identify independent risk factors for the incidence of ACN
among the following factors: age, sex, family history of colorectal cancer,
smoking, drinking, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, body mass index,
diabetes mellitus, and the presence and number of untreated diminutive
adenomas.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 361 and 1,017 participants in groups A and B,
respectively. There were 1-6 untreated diminutive adenomas in each group A
participant, and 335 participants (92.8%) had less than 3. During a median
follow-up of 60.9 months (interquartile range 40.8-64.2), 21 ACNs, including
one T1 colon cancer, were detected in 18 individuals. The number of
colonoscopies performed per individual was two in both groups (p = 0.93),
and the 5-year cumulative incidences of ACN in group A and B were 1.4% (95%
CI 0.5-3.4) and 0.8% (95% CI 0.3-1.7), respectively, with no significant
difference between the groups (p = 0.23). Endoscopic findings showed that no
ACN grew from an untreated adenoma. The only independent risk factor for the
incidence of ACN was current smoking (hazard ratio 5.7; p &lt; 0.01);
presence and number of untreated diminutive adenomas did not affect the
incidence of ACN. After adjustment for smoking status, the 5-year cumulative
incidences of ACN in groups A and B were 1.0% (95% CI 0.0-2.2) and 0.7% (95%
CI 0.1-1.2), respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The 5-year cumulative incidence of ACN in those with
untreated diminutive adenomas was sufficiently low, and was similar to that
in those with no adenomas, indicating the potential acceptability of a
watch-and-wait approach for diminutive adenomas. The present findings may be
useful for consideration of more practical screening and surveillance
programs, although further assessment is required particularly for cases
with many diminutive adenomas. The potential necessity for consideration of
smoking status in surveillance is also worth further investigation.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is
strongly related with lifestyle. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs),
derived also from diet, have been positively related with NAFLD, while its
soluble receptor (sRAGE) acts as a decoy. The association of sRAGE with
NAFLD has been scarcely studied. Moreover, little is known about
lifestyle-related determinants of sRAGE levels.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to test the
association of sRAGE with lifestyle and NAFLD. A cross-sectional study among
subjects 40-70 years old, participating in a screening study, undergoing
abdominal ultrasonography to diagnose NAFLD and fasting blood tests.
Nutritional index consumption was measured by food frequency questionnaire
(FFQ) and life-style habits were measured by a structured questionnaire. Low
sRAGE levels were defined as a level below the population lower tertile
(&lt;1013 pg/ml).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 789 subjects had valid FFQ. High processed
and/or red meat consumption (above the third tertile) was associated with
higher odds of low sRAGE, respectively (OR = 1.49, 1.00-2.21, p = 0.048),
adjusting for gender, age, abdominal obesity and caloric intake. Conversely,
greater exercise time (above the median) was associated with reduced odds
for low sRAGE (OR = 0.68, 0.49-0.94, p = 0.020). Subjects with low sRAGE had
higher odds for NAFLD (OR = 1.51, 1.01-2.27, p = 0.045) and elevated ALT
among NAFLD subjects (OR = 1.72, 1.12-2.64, p = 0.014) and among the entire
sample (OR = 2.27 95%CI 1.28-4.04, p = 0.005).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Diet and exercise are associated with serum sRAGE
levels and, in turn, low levels of sRAGE are associated with NAFLD and
elevated ALT levels.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Hypoxia and hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are
believed to significantly affect the progression of chronic liver diseases
(CLD). Recently, we showed that hepatocyte HIF-2alpha activation is a key
feature in both human and experimental NAFLD and significantly contributes
to disease progression.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> In the present study we investigated the
contribution of hepatocyte HIF-2alpha in promoting the development of
NAFLD/NASH-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The role of HIF-2alpha
was investigated in human HCC liver specimens from NAFLD/NASH patients and
in mice carrying hepatocyte-specific deletion of HIF-2alpha (HIF-2alpha
fl/fl/Alb-Cre mice) receiving diethyl-nitrosamine (DEN) administration plus
choline-deficient L-amino acid refined (CDAA) diet (DEN/CDAA protocol).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> HIF-2 alpha, as detected by mRNA transcript and
immunostaining, was expressed in HCC specimens from NAFLD/NASH patients,
with higher expression in patients experiencing early tumour recurrence.
Following the treatment with the DEN/CDAA protocol, mice carrying hepatocyte
specific deletion of HIF-2 alpha showed a significant decrease in either the
volume and/or the number of neoplastic liver tumour masses in transgenic
mice as compared to control littermates. Liver tumours in HIF-2 alpha
transgenic mice were also characterized by: i) a decrease of tumour
associated macrophages and fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, as evaluated by F4/80
and alpha-smooth muscle actin immunohistochemistry, respectively; ii) a
significant decrease in transcript levels for critical and HIF2alpha-related
target genes, including c-Myc and CXCR4.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These results indicate that the activation of
HIF-2alpha in hepatocytes has a critical role in the development of
experimental liver carcinogenesis in a dietary NAFLD/NASH-related
environment.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The introduction of biological therapy has
influenced healthcare expenditures in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
significantly. However, no prospective long-term analysis of healthcare
costs in patients with IBD in the era of biologic treatments exists in
Europe.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to perform a cost
analysis of a pan-European inception cohort with five years of follow-up.
The Epi-IBD cohort is a population-based inception cohort of IBD patients
diagnosed from 31 centers in 20 countries in Western and Eastern Europe in
2010. Clinical and direct cost data (investigations, treatments,
hospitalization and surgery) were collected prospectively. Patient
management was left to the discretion of the treating gastroenterologists.
Data are expressed as mean costs (€/patient-year). PY0 represents the
inception year, and PY1, PY2, PY3 and PY4 are the four follow-up years.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The cohort included 1,362 IBD patients (Western Europe:
1,104; Eastern Europe: 258), of which 52% had ulcerative colitis (UC), 37%
Crohn's disease (CD) and 11% IBD unclassified. The age structure was: ≤40 y
45%, 41-60 y 31%, and ≥ 61 y 24%.</p>
<p>The total expenditures per year in CD and UC patients as well as the proportion
of expenditure spent on different categories of direct costs is shown in
Table 1. Total expenditure was higher in CD than UC, as was the annual
percentage outlay on biological therapy. In Western Europe, total annual
costs were highest in PY0 at €4,964, and then decreased as follows: PY1
€1,687, PY2 €1,585, PY3 €1,492, and PY4 €1,113. Expenditure on biologic
therapy increased in this time period (PY0 €338, PY1 €410, PY2 €440, PY3
€504, and PY4 €516). In Eastern Europe, while overall healthcare costs were
lower, similar observations were made. Total annual costs were highest in
PY0 at €2,227, and then decreased: PY1 €934, PY2 €758, PY3 €643, and PY4
€734. Cost of biologic therapy was the following: PY0 €31, PY1 €233, PY2
€355, PY3 €308, and PY4 €292. In both regions this was paralleled by a
steady decrease of costs of non-biologic treatment, hospitalization and
surgery.</p>
<p>In all centers the expenditure on investigations was highest in the year PY0.
No gender differences in costs were observed, however, patients aged ≤ 40
years engendered higher costs than older individuals. The overall outlay on
biological therapy, expressed as a percentage of total expenditure, varied
by age group: ≤ 40 yrs. 29%, 41-60 yrs. 21%, and ≥ 61 yrs. 11%. <table-wrap id="table2-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table2-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table2"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">PY0</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">PY1</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">PY2</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">PY3</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">PY4</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Crohn's disease – total expenditure</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5,579€</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1,820€</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1,714€</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1,907€</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1,669€</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">CD – Biological therapy</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">11%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">46%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">51%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">48%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">56%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">CD – Other IBD-related medication</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">13%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">11%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">11%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">CD – Hospitalization</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">14%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">11%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">11%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">6%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">CD – Diagnostic procedures</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">34%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">17%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">11%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">CD – Surgery</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">9%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">16%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">18%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">17%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ulcerative colitis – total expenditure</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3,612€</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1,421€</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">810€</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">983€</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">674€</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">UC – Biological therapy</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">7%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">19%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">25%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">UC – Other IBD-related medication</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">15%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">23%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">29%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">21%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">26%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">UC – Hospitalization</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">35%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">29%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">21%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">33%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">17%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">UC – Diagnostic procedures</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">38%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">19%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">19%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">UC – Surgery</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">21%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">8%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">13%</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></p>

</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this large population-based inception cohort of
unselected IBD patients, the overall direct expenditure on healthcare
decreased over a 5-year follow-up period. This period was characterized by
remarkably increasing expenditure on biologics, particularly in CD patients,
and decreasing expenditure on standard medical treatments, surgery and
hospitalization. Despite their known high acquisition charges, these data
indicate a cost-saving effect of biologic medications.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> One-third of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
patients, both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), treated
with anti-TNF agents do not respond to the drug (primary failure), and a
relevant proportion from those who respond experiences loss of response
(secondary failure) or intolerance over time. Although the switch to a
second or a third anti-TNF drug is not exceptional in clinical practice,
data are scarce.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim was to investigate the efficacy and
safety of the sequential use of a second and a third anti-TNF agent after
failing or developing intolerance to an anti-TNF drug. Patients diagnosed
with IBD from ENEIDA registry (a prospectively maintained registry from
GETECCU) who switched to a second or a third anti-TNF after failure or
intolerance to a previous anti-TNF drug, were included. Efficacy, loss of
response, and safety of the second and third anti-TNF were evaluated by
logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 1,022 patients that switched to a second anti-TNF were
included (50% men, mean age at diagnosis 31 years, 73% CD). The reasons for
withdrawal the first anti-TNF were: primary failure (21%), secondary failure
(51%), and intolerance (28%). A second attempt with an anti-TNF agent
induced remission in 45% of patients in the short-term. 33% received
concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. In the multivariate analysis, factors
associated with a lower probability of achieving remission after a second
anti-TNF were: combo therapy (OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.5-2.5, p &lt; 0.0001), to
withdraw the first anti-TNF due to a primary failure (vs. intolerance)
(OR = 1.6; 1.1-2.3%, p = 0.007) and to withdraw the first anti-TNF due to
secondary failure (vs. intolerance) (OR 1.5; 1.2-2%, p = 0.003). The
cumulative incidence of loss of response after achieving remission with the
second anti-TNF (median follow-up of 19 months) was 45% (41-49%): 23% at 1
year, 38% at 2, 66% at 3, and 62% at 5 years. The incidence of loss of
response to the second anti-TNF was 19% per patient-year of follow-up. The
dose of the second anti-TNF was increased in 22% of patients during
follow-up (median follow-up of 13 months); of these, 56% regained remission.
At 1 year, 91% of these patients were in remission. The factors associated
with a higher risk of loss of response were: UC vs. CD (HR = 1.6; 1.1-2.1,
p = 0.005) and combo therapy (HR = 2.4; 1.8-3, p &lt; 0.0001). The rate of
adverse events after a second anti-TNF was 15%, and led to drug
discontinuation in 66%. 71 patients switched to a third anti-TNF (55%men,
mean age at diagnosis 32 years, 63% CD). The reasons for withdrawal the
second anti-TNF were: primary failure (45%), secondary failure (39%), and
intolerance (16%). Remission was achieved with the third anti-TNF in 55% of
patients in the short-term. The incidence of loss of response was 22% per
patient-year of follow-up (median follow-up of 9 months). The cumulative
incidence of loss of response was 38%: 18% at 1 year and 37% at 2 years. 7
patients (11%) had adverse events, but only one discontinued the
therapy.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The efficacy of a second anti-TNF in IBD patients was
associated with the reason for switching. Almost half of the patients who
achieved remission with a second anti-TNF subsequently lost response.
Factors associated with loss of response of a second anti-TNF were type of
IBD and combo therapy. Almost two-thirds of patients who received a third
anti-TNF achieved remission; however, one-third of them lost response
subsequently. The sequential use of a second and third anti-TNF is
apparently safe.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Studies comparing the characteristics of
childhood-onset and adulthood-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the
biologic era are scarce.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To compare the disease characteristics, the use
of immunomodulators and biologic agents, and the need for surgery between
childhood and adulthood-onset IBD.</p>
<p>IBD patients diagnosed from 2007 from the ENEIDA registry – prospectively
maintained database promoted by GETECCU were included. Patients diagnosed at
≤16 years comprised the childhood-onset cohort (CC), and those diagnosed
&gt;16 years were the adult cohort (AC). Cox-regression analysis was
performed to identify potential predictive factors to receive
immunosuppresants, biological agents or surgery.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> From 21,200 patients, 96% comprised the AC and 4% the CC.
Median follow-up was 54 months in the CC and 38 months in the AC
(p &lt; 0.01). The proportion of male gender, CD and family history of IBD
was higher in the CC. CD patients in the CC had more extensive involvement
while the proportion of patients with stricturing or fistulizing phenotype
was higher in the AC. UC patients in the CC had more extensive involvement.
Cumulative incidence of exposure to immunomodulators was higher in the CC:
54% at one year, 63% at 2 years, 70% at 3 years, 73% at 4 years and 87% at 5
years in the CC; and 34% at 1 year, 43% at 2 years, 48% at 3 years, 52% at 4
years and 55% at 5 years in the AC (p &lt; 0.01). The cumulative incidence
of exposure to biologic agents was higher in the CC: 25% at 1 year, 39% at 2
years, 45% at 3 years, 50% at 4 years and 65% at 5 years in the CC; and 16%
at 1 year, 24% at 2 years, 29% at 3 years, 33% at 4 years and 37% at 5 years
in the AC (p &lt; 0.01). The proportions of patients and the cumulative
incidence of surgery were similar in the CC and AC (17% vs. 15%,
p &gt; 0.05). Childhood-onset IBD was associated with higher risk of
immunomodulator and biologic agents exposure. Childhood-onset IBD was not
associated with higher risk of surgery (table 1).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> IBD patients diagnosed during childhood have
differential characteristics (higher prevalence of CD, more extensive
disease and more frequent family history). In addition, the use of
immunomodulators and biologic agents is higher in childhood-onset patients.
Despite of the higher burden of the disease in children, the rate of surgery
is similar to that in the adulthood-onset IBD population. <table-wrap id="table3-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table3-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table3"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing
Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) are chronic disabling
diseases diagnosed often in young adulthood. Little is known about the
direct and indirect costs of IBD, especially in the era of biologic therapy.
To date, no study has assessed indirect cost of CD and UC patients in a
population-based setting.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Our aim was to assess the indirect cost of CD
and UC patients in a population-based inception cohort with 10 years of
follow-up. All incident patients, diagnosed with CD (213) or UC (300) year
2003-2004 in a well-defined Copenhagen area, were followed prospectively
until 2014. Employment status, sick-leave and social benefits are
automatically registered in national registries through the unique 10 digit
personal identification number given at birth or immigration. With use of
these national registries, indirect cost of unemployment, sickness- and/or
social benefits were assessed. The loss of tax income for the Danish
government during unemployment was calculated using the mean income for the
Danish population of 41,970 EUR (value of 2017). Data were compared with a
population of healthy controls matched by age, sex and municipality at
diagnosis with a ratio of 1:20 (n = 10,259). Using multiple linear
regression models, associations between indirect cost and multiple variables
(gender, age, smoking status at diagnosis, disease behaviour, -location,
-extension and diagnostic delay) were assessed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> During follow-up, 139 [65%] CD and 181 [60%] UC patients
had at least one paid sick-leave with a median (IQR) length of 8.4
(2.6-19.8) months for CD and 5.1 (1.6-15.9; p=0.2) for UC. The median cost
of sickness benefits during follow-up for CD was 10,2300 (3,900, 32,100) and
8,800 (2,400, 28,500) EUR for UC. No significant difference was found
between healthy controls and IBD patients regarding length of paid
sick-leaves (5.7 months [1.2, 16.4], p=0.08) or sickness benefits (9,700
[2,100, 30,200], p=0.2). Regarding unemployment, a total of 279193 (5439%)
(CD: 12377 [5836%], UC: 156116 [5239%]) patients were unemployed at least
once during follow-up. In CD, the median length of unemployment was 5.3
(2.3-12) and 6.6 months (2-14.8) in UC (p=0.55). The median cost for
unemployment benefits was 13,30017,900 (4,7003,100, 55,8003,600) EUR for CD,
and 12,50014,600 (3,1002,400, 47,1003,500) EUR for UC patients (p=0.5).
These numbers did not differ significantly from the healthy controls (5.9
[1.87, 14.4] p=0.6 and 13,4000,700 [2,400000, 48,60037,300] p=0.23,
respectively). The median loss of tax income for the Danish government
because of unemployment was 6,90052,300 (2,20018,500, 17,000121,800) EUR,
which did not differ from healthy controls (7,00051,300 [2,50016,400,
16,400126,300], p=0.6). The total indirect cost accounted for 19.714.4
million EUR (CD: 9.16.9 million, UC: 10.67.5 million). No factors were
associated with the indirect cost in CD. In UC, age 17-40 years (OR: 1.53
[1.01, 2.11.6]), being male (OR: 0.9 [0.8, 1.0]) and current smoker (OR:
1.31 [1.10, 1.62]) at diagnosis were significantly associated with the
indirect cost of 100,000 EUR.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this population-based inception cohort with ten
years of follow-up, indirect cost of IBD patients did not differ from the
general population. Furthermore, no significant increased expenses were
found between CD and UC patients. These data indicate that in a country with
universal and free access to healthcare current treatment strategies keep
patients with IBD on the job market. Except for higher direct costs due to
health care utilization, IBD patients did not carry higher indirect costs
compared to healthy controls.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Nucleotide Oligomerisation Domain 2
(<italic>NOD2</italic>) is a key gene of innate immunity which
participates to the host defence toward pathogens. Several
<italic>NOD2</italic>variations associated with Crohn Disease (CD).
Unexpectedly, these loss-of-function mutations are frequent in populations
of European ancestry suggesting a model of balancing selection and thus a
benefit to mutation carriers. Because NOD2 deficiency has been associated
with a resistance to <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> we
hypothesized that <italic>NOD2</italic> mutations have been selected during
past plague outbreaks due to <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We performed a Pubmed search looking for the
frequencies of CD associated mutations (R702W, G908R and 1007fs) in healthy
controls in European and Mediterranean countries. Using historical data on
plague outbreaks, we evaluated the rate of exposure to plague of the
ancestors of the corresponding populations. Demography of cities and
migration rates from the 14th century to the 19th century were also taken
into account to evaluate the impact of putative confounding factors.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The rates of the CD-associated <italic>NOD2</italic>
mutations in the general population were correlated with the intensities of
plague outbreaks in Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. Statistical
significance was obtained with the most frequent mutation (R702W, p = 0.03)
and with the pooled three mutations (p = 0.023). The association remained
significant when putative demographic biases were considered suggesting a
robust finding.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This result argues for a selection of CD-associated
<italic>NOD2</italic> mutations by the various plague episodes which
have occurred in Europe and the Mediterranean Basin since the Middle
ages.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic and progressive
disease that changes its behavior over time. Transmural inflammation in CD
leads to stricturing and/or penetrating complications.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aim to evaluate the frequency of the
long-term progression of CD phenotypes, and need for surgery, and to
determine the main factors associated with this evolution.</p>
<p>A retrospective study was conducted with a prospective follow-up. Patients
included had a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Montreal classification was
assessed at the moment of the diagnosis and at the end of the follow-up
period.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Included 290 patients, 53.8% female. The behavior at
presentation was inflammatory (B1) in 64.5%, structuring (B2) in 23.4%,
penetrating (B3) 12.1% and perianal disease was present in 18.6%. Behavior
at the end of the follow-up was: B1 in 51.4%, B2 in 30.3% and B3 in 18.3%,
perianal disease was identified in 20%.</p>
<p>Globally we observed a change in behavior in 46 patients (15.9%); from B1 to B2
in 30 patients, B2 to B3 in 7 patients and B1 to B3 in 9 patients.</p>
<p>Ileocolic location (60.9% vs 45.1%; p = 0.049), age at diagnosis &lt; 16 (8.7%
vs 2%; p = 0.017), the use of steroids at diagnosis (43.2% vs 27%;
p = 0.031) and less time exposure to biological therapy (15.9 months vs
41.32 months; p &lt; 0.001) were the risk factors associated with changing
phenotype.</p>
<p>Regarding surgery, 70 patients (24.1%) were submitted to intestinal resection.
Smoking status (42.9% vs 24.8%; p = 0.004), B2 (47.1% vs 15.9%;
p &lt; 0.001), B3 (42.9% vs 2.3%; p &lt; 0.001), hospitalizations in the
first year of diagnosis (52.3% vs 12.4%; p &lt; 0.001), use of steroids at
diagnosis (61.4% vs 23.6%; p &lt; 0.001) were more frequently observed in
patients submitted to surgery. Patients submitted to surgery were less
frequently treated with biological therapy (8.7% vs 23.4%;
p &lt; 0.025).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In our cohort we observed a behavior progression in
about one-sixth of patients. The most frequent change in behavior was to
stricturing pattern. Stricturing and penetrating behavior, higher number of
hospitalizations in the first year of diagnosis, use of steroids at
diagnosis, smoking status, age at diagnosis &lt; 16 and Ileocolic
localization were factors associated with an unfavorable clinical evolution.
Patients that were submitted to surgery were less treated with biological
therapy.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Surveillance programs on high-risk individuals (HRI)
can detect premalignant lesions or early pancreatic cancers (PDAC). We
report the results of the first-round of screening of the Italian
multicenter program supported by the Italian Association for the study of
the Pancreas (AISP).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The multicenter surveillance program includes:
a) individuals with familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) defined as those with ≥
3 first- (FDR), second- (SDR) or third-degree relatives with PDAC or
individuals with 2 relatives with PDAC with at least 1 FDR; b) BRCA 1/2 or
p16 mutation carriers with at least 1 FDR or SDR diagnosed with PDAC;
subjects suffering from hereditary pancreatitis (HP) or Peutz-Jegher (PJ)
syndrome. The surveillance program consists of at least an annual magnetic
resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). An endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is
proposed to patients who refuse or cannot be submitted to an MRCP.
Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed using chi-squared test
and a binary logistic regression model to identify risk factors the
detection of pre-malignant (any IPMN) or malignant lesion.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The study population is represented by 189 HRI who
underwent a first-round screening examination with MRCP (174, 92.1%) or EUS
(15, 7.9%) from September 2015 to March 2018. Nine (5.1%) received EUS as
supplementary investigation due to suspicious findings at MRCP. The mean age
was 52 years (range 21-80). 123 (65.1%) FPC, 61 syndromic (32.3%) and 5
(2.6%) HP were included. An overall number of 55 screening abnormalities
were found. MRCP detected pancreatic abnormalities in 44 HRI (25.3%), mostly
cystic lesions (n = 42, 24.1%); 27 cysts (61.3%) were BD-IPMNs. The mean
diameter of BD-IPMNs was 9 mm (range 3-25). EUS detected 6 PDAC (3.1%, 1
BRCA, 1 FPC, 3 PJS, 1 HP). Two patients received resective surgery (pT3N1R0
and pT1N0R0, 1 HP and 1 PJ HRI), 2 were locally advanced (BRCA1 and PJ HRI)
and 2 metastatic (1 FPC and 1 PJ HRI). EUS identified 4 further
abnormalities (2 undefined cystic lesions and 2 EUS features of chronic
pancreatitis) and it was normal in 5 out of 15 cases (33.3%). 2 further
patients (PJ-HRI), received surgery due to IPMN with high-risk stigmata with
pathology findings of 1 IPMN/invasive carcinoma and 1 low-grade dysplasia
mixed-type IPMN (both found at MRCP and confirmed by EUS). An additional
solid pseudopapillary tumor was identified and resected. The rate of
malignancies detected was higher in the non-FPC cohort than in the FPC one
(Fisher's exact test p &lt; 0.05). At the multivariate analysis smoking
habit (OR 3.9, 95%CI 1.2–11.8, p &lt; 0.05), &gt;2 relatives affected by PC
(OR 2.7, 95%CI 1-7.2) and age &gt; 50 years (OR 2.5, 95%CI 1-6.2) were found
to be independent predictors of detection of pre-malignant and malignant
lesions.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The first-round screening results in Italy report a
high rate of pancreatic malignancies (3.7%), mostly being advanced at
baseline. We confirm that the cohort of HRI suffering from PJ syndrome is
the one at highest risk of having pancreatic malignancies (10%). The rate of
malignant (invasive carcinoma/IPMN) or pre-malignant lesions (BD-IPMNs and
mixed type-IPMN) in the FPC-HRI cohorts was lower (0.5% and 14.8%,
respectively, p &lt; 0.05), despite non-negligible. At the multivariate
analysis smoking habit, &gt;2 relatives affected by PC and age &gt;50 years
were independent risk factors for the identification of pre-malignant or
malignant lesions. 6 HRI (3.1%) were submitted to surgery after the baseline
screening method with nil mortality.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the 4th
leading cause of cancer-associated death in the Western World. PDAC bears a
high accumulation of oncogenic mutations. Recent sequencing studies found
Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) frequently mutated in PDAC. Our lab
previously showed that the loss of ATM accelerates EMT and promotes genomic
instability (1,2). In line with the altered genomic integrity of ATM-mutated
PDAC established genotype specific strategies like PARP- and ATR-
inhibition. However, these treatment strategies tended to show early
resistance and particularly ATR inhibition renders toxicity at least in
humans (1).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Here, we unravel novel synergistic routes based
on actionable perturbations in the DNA damage response (i) to overcome
chemoresistance and (ii) to present a genotype tailored cocktail of targeted
therapies for <italic>ATM</italic>-mutated PDAC. Based on the Atmfl/fl;
Kras+/G12D; Ptf1a+/Cre (AKC) and Kras+/G12D; Ptf1a+/Cre (KC) mouse model
primary AKC and KC PDAC cell lines were established.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> First, we screened a set of inhibitors and
chemotherapeutics for single agent efficiency using conventional MTT assyas.
Second, the PreCISE (predictor of chemical inhibitor synergistic effects)
software tool was applied to unravel synergy in actionable perturbations of
the DNA damage response. Thereby, systematic combinational screening efforts
found synergy between inhibition of the DNA-PKC, ATR and PARP signaling
leading to synthetic lethality in AKC cell lines. Triple pathway inhibition
was then combined with conventional topoisomerase inhibitors, the latter
having shown substantially higher activity in AKC lines in our single agent
screen. Systematic characterization of the DDR in such treated cell lines
provided a coherent understanding of the molecular mechanism behind and key
observations were validated in orthotopic and subcutaneous transplantation
studies.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Summarized, based on a novel genomic unstable,
ATM-depleted PDAC model, we could identify new targeted and synergistic
routes to reach highest efficiency with lowest toxicity to pave the way to
clinical trials in this subgroup of genomic unstable PDAC patients.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The recent development of oral direct-acting
antivirals (DAAs) has dramatically improved the efficacy of anti-hepatitis C
virus (HCV) treatment, however, resistance-associated variants (RAVs) are
associated with treatment failure in HCV-infected patients receiving DAA
therapy. Although low-abundant RAVs at baseline could expand and contribute
to treatment failure, it has been difficult to determine the clonal origin
of RAVs using conventional short-read sequencing methods. Thus, in the
current study, we investigated the viral dynamics in patients undergoing DAA
therapy and explored the clonal origin of multi-drug resistant viral clones
using single molecular real-time (SMRT) sequencing, so called third
generation sequencing, which can generate extremely long contiguous sequence
reads.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Among 283 patients with genotype 1b HCV
receiving DAAs therapy in our study group, 32 who failed to achieve a
sustained virological response (SVR) were included in this study. First,
conventional ultra-deep sequencing of NS3 and NS5A regions of HCV genome was
performed in all patients using IonProton (ThermoFisher Scientific). Then,
using paired sera samples before and after DAA treatment from the
representative 6 non-SVR patients, we applied SMRT sequencing using PacBio
RSII (Pacific Biosciences) to determine the long contiguous sequences
spanning &gt;3000 bp of the NS3 to NS5A regions of each viral clone.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Ultra-deep sequencing detected representative RAVs in all
non-SVR patients at baseline, including NS5A-Y93H or L31M and NS3-D168V.
Importantly, at treatment failure, multi-drug resistant HCV clones were
detected in all cases as the major population. Then, long contiguous
sequences of each viral clone in 12 sera from 6 non-SVR patients (a total of
3601 clones) were determined by PacBio RSII. We found the substantial
sequence diversity of viral isolates present at baseline in all cases,
showing the high degree of genetic heterogeneity in HCV clones. All the
nucleotide substitutions analyzed in each clone before and after treatment
were compared, and we found significant linkage between some synonymous
substitutions and major resistance-associated substitutions. For example,
several synonymous mutations linked to NS5A-Y93H in a subpopulation of
pre-existing viral clones at baseline were shared by multi-drug resistant
viral clones at treatment failure. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a close
genetic distance between pre-existing drug-resistant clones and multi-drug
resistant viral clones at treatment failure. In addition, linkage analysis
demonstrated that multiple drug-resistant mutations newly developed based on
pre-existing RAVs after DAA treatment in all non-SVR cases.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Comprehensive analysis of SMRT sequencing and
conventional ultra-deep sequencing revealed that multi-drug resistant viral
clones at treatment failure originated from a subpopulation of pre-existing
RAVs in HCV-infected patients. Those RAVs were selected for and became
dominant with the acquisition of multiple resistance-associated
substitutions under DAA treatment pressure. These findings give us a clue to
a better understanding of treatment failure with anti-HCV therapy.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Since pancreatic cancer poorly responds to
chemoradiotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been considered as a
promising treatment strategy for minimal invasiveness and selective tumor
necrosis. However, the short penetration depth and prolonged
photosensitivity of the therapy hindered it from popular usage. Recent
progress of a novel photosensitizer with shorter acting time and improved
penetration and advancement of the endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may help
overcome such obstacles.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and
safety of EUS-guided photodynamic therapy (EUS-guided PDT) with a
second-generation photosensitizer for unresectable pancreatic cancer.
Patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer were prospectively enrolled in
a single tertiary center between December 2015 and January 2018. Patients
were photosensitized with chlorin e6 derivatives (Photolon®,
Belmedpreparaty, Belarus) 3.0mg/kg, 3 hours before the procedure. Light at a
660-nm wavelength was delivered through a dedicated flexible laser-light
catheter after puncturing the target directly by 19-gauge fine aspiration
needle. Light dose escalating (initially 120 J/cm, 150 J/cm, and 200
J/cm)was achieved. Primary outcomes including tumor necrosis volume and
fraction on CT or MRI were assessed 2 days after the treatment of EUS-guided
PDT, by using an in-house histogram analysis plug-in tool for ImageJ.
Criteria for secondary outcomes were technical success, adverse events, time
to progression periods, and overall survival.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 29 patients fulfilled the entry criteria and were
treated, and a total of 47 EUS-guided PDTs were performed. 20 were male, and
median age was 59 (range 36-75), and pre-PDT tumor diameter was median 35 mm
(range 18-64). Technical success rate of EUS-guided PDT was 100%. 10 cases
with substantial necrotic portion in tumors were excluded because it was not
feasible to assess the volume of necrosis by EUS-guided PDT. However, these
patients were included for the safety consideration. Among 37 EUS-guided
PDTs after exclusion, 120 J/cm was delivered to 9 patients, 150 J/cm to 21,
200 J/cm to 7. Median PDT per session was 5 (range 3-15) with median 3
needle pass (range 1-8). Total necrosis volume was median
4666 mm<sup>3</sup> (range 928-13411), and necrotic fraction was
median 35.5% (range 5-100). There was statistical difference of necrotic
volume between 120J/cm group and 150J/cm group (613.5 ± 624.5 mm<sup>3</sup>
and 1088.8 ± 505.3 mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively, p = 0.007), but not with
the 200 J/cm group (739.1 ± 422.5 mm<sup>3</sup>). Three cases of fever
occurred, which was spontaneously recovered. Otherwise, there was no
procedure related adverse events including pancreatitis nor
photosensitivity. No adverse interactions were seen in patients given
chemotherapy or radiotherapy before and after EUS-guided PDT. Progression
free survival was median 176 days (95% CI: 141-259), and overall survival
was median 304 days (95% CI: 260-NA).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> EUS-guided PDT with a second-generation
photosensitizer is technically feasible, well-tolerated, and relatively safe
for unresectable pancreatic cancer. Especially 150 J/cm may be optimal
delivery energy compared to 120 J/cm. EUS-guided PDT could be performed
before or after chemotherapy or radiotherapy for unresectable pancreatic
cancer. Further randomized trial of comparing EUS-guided PDT with standard
care (chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy) and standard care alone for
unresectable pancreatic cancer may be warranted. (Clinical trial: CRIS
registration number KCT0001763)</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold>
<underline>E</underline>valuation of
<underline>d</underline>rug-<underline>i</underline>nduced
<underline>s</underline>erious <underline>h</underline>epatotoxicity
(eDISH) is a tool used to assess and identify potential cases of
drug-induced liver injury<sup>1</sup>. eDISH was used to evaluate
obeticholic acid (OCA) and placebo profiles in 2 double-blind,
placebo-controlled studies in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH). FLINT was a 72-week study, which demonstrated statistically
significant improvements in hepatocellular ballooning, steatosis, lobular
inflammation, and fibrosis in patients treated with OCA compared to placebo.
CONTROL was a 16-week study, which showed that the addition of low-dose
atorvastatin reversed OCA-associated changes in LDL-C.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The objective of this analysis was to use eDISH
to determine if patients with NASH treated with OCA show increased markers
of liver injury or whole liver dysfunction. eDISH methodology was applied to
278 patients treated with placebo (n = 140) or 25mg OCA (n = 138) from FLINT
and 84 patients treated with placebo (n = 21), 5mg OCA (n = 20), 10mg OCA
(n = 21), or 25mg OCA (n = 22) from CONTROL. Individual subject peak values
of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin throughout the
double-blind treatment phase were plotted on an x-y chart as
logarithm<sub>10</sub> values of multiples of elevations above the
upper limit of the normal reference ranges (x ULN).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, no OCA-treated patients were in the Hy's law
quadrant (&gt;3x ULN for ALT and &gt;2x ULN for total bilirubin) compared
with 1 placebo-treated patient in FLINT. The proportion of patients with
peak ALT and total bilirubin values in the lower left quadrant (representing
normal or near normal range) was higher in OCA-treated patients compared
with placebo (FLINT: 91% OCA vs 84% placebo; CONTROL: 91% OCA vs 86%
placebo). 8% of OCA-treated patients from both FLINT and CONTROL presented
in the Temple's corollary quadrant (&gt;3x ULN for ALT and &lt; 2x ULN for
total bilirubin) vs 14% (in both studies) for the placebo-treated patients.
Across both studies (N = 362), 4 patients were in the cholestasis quadrant
(&gt;2X ULN total bilirubin and &lt; 3X ULN for ALT); 1 placebo-treated
patient and 3 OCA-treated patients, including 1 patient with Gilbert's
syndrome.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In these 2 placebo-controlled, double-blind NASH
studies, the eDISH analysis showed no trend for liver injury with OCA at
doses up to and including 25 mg.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Genetic susceptibility plays an important role in
the development of chronic pancreatitis. Recently, it has been demonstrated,
that loss-of-function mutations in <italic>CPA1</italic>, which encodes the
digestive enzyme carboxypeptidase A1, are associated with early-onset
chronic pancreatitis<sup>1–3</sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic> functional
studies indicate that pathogenic <italic>CPA1</italic> variants exert their
effect via the so-called misfolding-dependent pathological pathway
characterized by endoplasmic reticulum stress due to mutation-induced
misfolding of digestive enzymes. However, <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence
has been lacking. The objective of the present study was to generate a
murine model that recapitulates features of <italic>CPA1</italic>-associated
chronic pancreatitis.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To study the mechanism of action of
<italic>CPA1</italic> variants <italic>in vivo</italic>, a novel
<italic>Cpa1 N256K</italic> knock-in mouse strain was created carrying
the most frequently reported human <italic>CPA1</italic> p.N256K mutation in
the mouse <italic>Cpa1</italic> gene. Pathological changes in the pancreata
and ER stress were assessed in the mutant strain and compared to C57BL/6N
and <italic>Cpa1 null</italic> control mice.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In the <italic>Cpa1 N256K</italic> mutant mice we
observed characteristic features of chronic pancreatitis that included
progressive acinar cell atrophy, inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis
and pseudo-tubular complex formation. Contrary to the mutant mice both
control strains showed no signs of pancreatic damage. Mutation p.N256K
induced misfolding of mouse Cpa1 and resulted in elevated expression of ER
stress markers <italic>Hspa5</italic> (BiP) and <italic>Ddit3</italic>
(CHOP) in the <italic>Cpa1 N256K</italic> strain. Our data clearly
demonstrate that <italic>CPA1</italic> mutations lead to enzyme misfolding
and cause chronic pancreatitis via an ER-stress related mechanism.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We present the first mouse model of spontaneous
chronic pancreatitis associated with digestive enzyme misfolding and
endoplasmic reticulum stress. This model may be beneficial in testing the
effects of various environmental factors or pharmaceutical drugs on the
course of the disease.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is almost resistant
to chemotherapy. We performed next-generation sequencing on PDAC tumor
tissue and evidence-based, AI-supported evaluation to identify second-line
palliative therapies based on biomarker profiles.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> After first-line therapy, tissue samples were
sequenced using a 620-gene panel. Data were analyzed with the MH Guide™
software, a CE-marked medical device. Primary outcome was presence of
actionable mutations (drugable targets, effective or ineffective treatments,
toxicity markers) and treatment recommendations by the software. Secondary
outcomes were implementation of recommendations in patients´ treatment and
overall survival, stratified for those receiving versus not receiving
personalized treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 40 patients were enrolled, 35 tumor samples were analyzed
and interpretable results were obtained from 31 patients. At least 1
relevant biomarker was found in all cases. We found mutations in KRAS
(n = 24), TP53 (n = 17), SMAD4 (n = 2), BRCA1/2 (n = 4; 3 germline), CDKN2A
(n = 9), ATM (n = 6; 3 LOF), APC (n = 4), and MSH3 (n = 15, 1 germline). MH
Guide made treatment recommendations in 30/31 cases: PARP-inhibitors
(n = 26), MEK/RAF inhibitors (n = 20), CDK inhibitors (n = 9), other kinase
inhibitors (n = 3), mTOR inhibitors (n = 2). The molecular tumor board (MTB)
agreed in 26 cases, 2 patients received other second-line line therapy and 2
BSC. 3 patients died before and 2 during analysis, 1 prior to the MTB, 2
before start of therapy and 3 shortly after. Toxicity markers were found in
27/31 patients: Platinum (XRCC1 n = 16; 5 homozygous, TPMT n = 1; MUTYH
n = 3), paclitaxel (CYP2C8 n = 2), gemcitabine (CDA n = 4; 1 homozygous) and
5-FU (DPYD n = 1), doxorubicin (G6PD n = 1), docetaxel (GSTP1 n = 2),
sunitinib (ABCG2 n = 2), irinotecan (ERCC2, n = 6; 5 homozygous, UGT1A1
n = 1). Roughly half of all patients had adverse event CTCAE grade ≥3 during
previous treatment. Chemotherapy for which they had a toxicity marker was
given to 13/27 patients and 7 had toxicity of any grade associable with the
marker.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Evidence-based personalized treatment recommendation
in PDAC is feasible in a clinical setting and molecular stratification of
PDAC patients routinely leads to recommendation of off-label use of
registered drugs. Toxicity markers for agents commonly used in PDAC
treatment are present in a majority of patients and frequently correlate
with observed adverse events. The clinical significance of toxicity markers
needs further investigation.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Statins have pleiotropic effects including
pro-apoptic, anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory effects, which may exert
chemoprevention. Several observational studies have suggested that statins
may prevent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but have not yet been fully
studied.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This study aimed to investigate the association
between the use of statins and the risk of HCC in chronic hepatitis B virus
infected patients. A hospital-based retrospective study was conducted from
7,714 chronic hepatitis B infected patients enrolled between January 2008
and December 2012. Primary outcome was development of HCC. Statin use was
defined when patients had taken statin at least 30 days during follow-up.
The association between statin use and the risk of HCC were analyzed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> During a median follow-up of 7.2 years (min-max: 0.5–9.7
years), HCC was newly developed in 702 patients (9.1%). Patients who used
statin showed lower cumulative incidence of HCC development compared to
patients who did not use statin (8.0% vs 2.2% at 5-years, p &lt; 0.001).
When stratified according to cirrhosis status, 5-years cumulative incidence
rate of HCC was higher for those who did not use statin compared to those
who used statin among patients with cirrhosis (20.2% vs. 5.4%, p = 0.038,
n = 1,771), patients without cirrhosis (3.8% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.003, n = 5,578)
and patients with missing information on cirrhosis status (7.6% vs. 0%,
p = 0.048, n = 365), respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Statin use was associated with reduce risk for HCC
development in chronic hepatitis B patients, regardless of cirrhosis status.
Statin treatment may decrease HCC risk, which warrants prospective
validation.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Hepatitis C is associated with increased mortality
caused by end-stage liver disease and development of hepatocellular cancer.
The estimated number of persons dying from end-stage HCV infection in 2015
was 399,000 globally (1). In addition, HCV-infection is associated with
extrahepatic manifestations such as chronic kidney disease and increased
risk of for type II diabetes and coronary heart disease (2). In Finland,
annually some 1100 new cases of HCV are diagnosed (3) and the number persons
with HCV in Finland is some 22,000 with prevalence of 0.3% in the population
(4). Some 80% are persons using intravenous drugs who are HCV-positive
(4).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To assess the mortality, causes of death and
associated malignancies with hepatitis C based on nationwide data.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In total 10,058 individuals were included into the
analysis, comprising 42,027 person years. Of all the cases 63% were males,
53% were 0-29 years old, 44% 30-59 years and 3.6% older than 60 years.
During the study period 800 persons died (8%). For the whole study period
HCV-infected persons had markedly increased risk for death: for the whole
cohort SMR was 9.43 (95% CI 8.79–10.0), for those 0-29 years, 19.16 (95% CI
16.72–21.76), for 30-59 years 10.56 (95% CI 9.60–11.57), and for those over
60 years 4.37 (95% CI 3.67–5.13), respectively. Main causes of death are
summarized in Table 1. During the first year after diagnosis the SMR for men
under 30 years for accidental poisonings was 72.17 (95% CI 47.95–104).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Persons with hepatitis C infection have significantly
increased mortality, mostly due to accidents and violence (45.6%),
intoxications (22%), suicides (13%), infections, cerebrovascular disease and
alcohol-related disease (17%), usually associated with iv drug and alcohol
use. The results suggest that scaling up treatment of hepatitis C in PIWD is
unlikely to have any impact on their mortality. <table-wrap id="table4-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table4-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table4"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">ICD-10</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Diagnosis</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age, years</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">SMR (95%CI) Whole follow up</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">SMR (95%CI) &lt;1 year after dg</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">A00-B99</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Infections</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0-29</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">49.7 6.01–179</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">65.0 1.64–362</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30-59</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">41.1 20.5–73</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">71.8 19.6–183</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">60+</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10.6 1.28–38.3</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">23.9 0.60–132</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">C22</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Hepatocellular cancer</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30-59</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">8.03 0.97–29.0</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">19.5 0.49–108</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">60+</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">13.3 4.33–31.12</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">38.8 7.99–113</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">E10-E14</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Diabetes</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30-59</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">7.14 2.32–16.7</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">14.8 1.79–53.6</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">60+</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">9.46 1.95–27.6</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">15.4 0.39–86.0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">X40-X44,  X46-X49</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Accidental poisonings</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0-29</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">47.3 37.4–59</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">71.1 48.7–100</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30-59</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">39.1 31.5–47.9</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">39.0 23.1–61.6</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">60+</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">57.3 18.6–133</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">57.0 1.44–317</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Alcohol-related diseases</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0-29</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">28.0 14.0–50.1</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">61.8 24.9–127</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30-59</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">15.0 12.3–18.0</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">18.4 12.1–26.7</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">60+</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10.11 5.7–16.7</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">16.3 5.30–38.1</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Benefits of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in
preventing ischaemic vascular events need balancing against gastrointestinal
(GI) bleeding risks. Estimates of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) effects in
reducing ASA-associated upper but not lower GI bleeds (UGIB/LGIB) from the
same study population are scarce.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We used a population-based primary care database
of electronic medical records from the United Kingdom to quantify low-dose
ASA-associated UGIB and LGIB risks with/without PPIs. Among persons aged
40-84 years from 2000-2012, 199,049 new users of low-dose ASA (75-300
mg/day) were each matched to a non-user by age, sex, time since study entry,
and general practitioner visits in the previous year (proxy for general
health). Individuals (mean age at entry, 64 years) were followed (max. 14
years, median 5.4 years) to identify incident UGIB/LGIB cases, with
validation by manual review of patient records and linked hospital data.
Nested case-control analyses were conducted using cases and controls from
both cohorts; controls were frequency-matched to cases by age, sex and
calendar year. Current low-dose ASA or PPI use was defined as use 0-30 days
before the index date (UGIB/LGIB date for cases, random date for controls).
Adjusted relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
calculated.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 1843 UGIB and 2763 LGIB cases; RRs for current
use of low-dose ASA and/or PPIs are shown in the Table. Increased risks were
seen for UGIB (RR = 1.55) and LGIB (R = 2.06) with current low-dose ASA.
Compared with PPI use discontinued &gt;1 year before the index date
(suitable reference group to minimize indication bias), current PPI use of
&gt;3 months duration reduced UGIB risk by 21% (RR = 0.79) but had no effect
on LGIB risk (RR = 1.07) irrespective of low-dose ASA use. Compared with
current low-dose ASA plus past PPI use (&gt;30 days), concomitant PPI and
low-dose ASA therapy reduced UGIB risk by 34% when used for &gt;1 month
(RR = 0.66); UGIB risk increased with shorter-term use (RR = 2.82). However,
this increased risk with short-term (≤1 month) PPI use was lower when PPIs
were initiated on/before the start of ASA therapy (RR = 1.70) than
afterwards (RR = 3.35). Neither short-term nor longer-term PPI use
appreciably changed on LGIB risk among current low-dose ASA users.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results suggest that maintaining PPI use (&gt;1
month) reduces UGIB risk. Prescribing PPIs before starting low-dose ASA and
efforts to improve adherence with PPIs may help reduce UGIB risk. The
increased UGIB risk seen after start of PPI therapy among low-dose ASA users
is due to protopathic bias from first bleeding symptoms prompting PPI use.

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The most common causes of acute nonvariceal upper
gastrointestinal bleeding (AUGIB) are peptic ulcer bleeding and haemorrhagic
gastritis. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (LDA) are known risk factors for both. COX-2
selective NSAIDs are considered safer in terms of bleeding.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To identify patients with AUGIB who use LDA and
NSAIDs, determine the severity of bleeding, outcomes and potential risk
factors for adverse outcomes. Retrospective, prospective analysis of all
patients over 18 years of age consecutively admitted for AUGIB in a tertiary
centre in Latvia – Riga East Clinical University Hospital from November 2013
to December 2014. Data was collected regarding history of drug use,
bleeding-related interventions, length of hospital stay and outcomes.
Forrest classification was used to evaluate the severity of bleeding, data
was entered into the database with consecutive statistical analysis using
SPSS 20.0.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 236 patients with UGIB were enrolled (138 (58%) men, 98
(42%) women, mean age 62 ± 17.36 years). Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) was the
most common diagnosis (n = 180, 73%). Out of all patients, 90 (38.1%) were
NSAIDs users (more often women (46/44)), 27 (11.4%) used oral anticoagulants
(mean age 73 ± 11.3 years) and 52 (22%) used alcohol (mean age 47 ± 11.61
years). NSAIDs use was associated with more frequent PUD bleeding
(r = 0.347, p &lt; 0.001). Out of 26 patients with Forrest I type (IA and
IB) peptic ulcer bleeding, 12 (46%) used NSAIDs, 9 (34.6%) were on LDA
therapy, 3 (11.5%) were alcohol users. The most commonly used NSAIDs were
diclofenac (n = 24, 26%) and ibuprofen (n = 8, 9%). There was only 1 patient
on COX-2 selective NSAID therapy, who was admitted with Forrest II B
bleeding. 108 patients (45.7%) were hospitalised in intensive care unit,
most often with Forrest IIB PUD bleeding – 36 (33.3%). Transfusion of red
blood cells was required in 133 (56.3%) cases, fresh frozen plasma in 106
(44%) cases and cryoprecipitate in 39 (16.5%) cases. Surgery was performed
in 37 (15.6%) patients. Most of the patients requiring surgical intervention
were on NSAID therapy (22/37, p = 0.004, <italic>Pearson
Chi-Square).</italic> Bleeding-related in-hospital death occurred in
24 (10%) cases, mostly in patients with recurrent PUD bleeding. There was a
statistically significant age difference between patients who recovered and
those who died (n = 212, 61 ( ± 17.14) vs. n = 24, 78 ( ± 10. 04),
p &lt; 0.001). The difference in length of hospital stay between NSAIDs
users and non-users was marginally significant (p = 0,058,
<italic>Mann-Whitney Test</italic>).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> 1. LDA and NSAIDs remain the most common risk factors
for AUGIB and are associated with the need for surgical intervention. 2.
Bleeding-related mortality and need for surgery during hospitalization
remain high. 3. Important prophylactic measures should include patient
education about risks, adequate gastroprotection and minimisation of alcohol
use.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) decreases major
adverse cardiovascular events after a percutaneous coronary intervention
(PCI). New and potentially more effective antiplatelet agents such as
ticagrelor or prasugrel combined with aspirin (ASA) are being prescribed
preferentially to younger and healthier patients based on the potential
higher risk of GI bleeding. However, very few data are available concerning
the risk and type of GI bleeding associated with these new compounds when
compared to classical DAPT with clopidogrel in common clinical practice.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods</bold>: We aimed to determine the risk and type of major
and minor GI events in patients with DAPT and type of DAPT, and to analyze
PPI therapy regimens during and after DAPT withdrawal. This was a
retrospective observational cohort study of patients who started DAPT after
a PCI from January 2015 to December 2016. The follow-up period was censored
either after 15 months of initiation of DAPT, when a major (hospitalization)
GI event occurred or when DAPT was discontinued. Development of anemia
during the follow-up was considered as a minor GI event. Statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS software version 22.0.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 710 patients were included (mean age 66.9 ± 12.6 years;
79% males); 53% (376/710), 36.6% (260/710), and 10.4% (74/710) of patients
were on DAPT with either clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel, respectively.
There were statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics
between the groups, indicating that younger and healthier people received
therapy with the new antiplatelet agents (table 1). Most patients (661/710;
93.1%) received PPI therapy while DAPT was active and after withdrawal
(582/661); 88%. 32 patients (4.5% (32/710)) developed a major GI bleeding
and 18.9% (134/710) developed anemia. Lower GI bleeding was more frequent
than upper GI bleeding (78.1% (25/32) vs 18.8% (6/32)) and 3.1% (1/32) had
obscure GI bleeding. There were no differences in the occurrence of major GI
bleeding (5.1% vs 3.9%, p = 0.475), non-gastrointestinal bleeding (10.4% vs
10.5%, p = 1.000), ischemic vascular events (13.6% vs 9.6%, p = 0.103) or
death (4.8 vs 2.1%, p = 0.066) between patients on DAPT with clopidogrel or
new antiplatelets; however, anemia was most common in the group of DAPT with
clopidogrel (21.8% vs 15.6%, p = 0.035). After adjusting for main
confounding factors, including age, comorbilities, anticoagulant therapy and
GI risk, there was no differences in the risk of GI events between groups
(clopidogrel vs new agents (overall GI events HR: 0.839 (0.579–1.215), major
GI events HR: 1.050 (0.448–2.461), minor GI events HR: 0.801
(0.531–1.207)).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> DAPT is more frequently associated with lower than
upper GI bleeding. Prasugrel- or ticagrelor-based DAPT was not associated
with increased risk of either GI (upper or lower) bleeding when compared to
clopidogrel-based therapy. The potential benefits of the new antiplatelets
could be extended to all patients undergoing PCI based on GI risk factors.

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is one of the
main causes of hospital admission and urgent endoscopy in Gastroenterology
departments and represents a true emergency, associated with significant
morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Compared with prior decades,
patients with UGIB are older. Current epidemiological data show that elderly
patients tend to have comorbidities, and they experience worse outcomes than
non-elderly UGIB patients (1).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of our study is to compare elderly
patients (age 65 and older) (EPs) presenting with UGIB with non-elderly
patients (NEPs) as well as to identify predictors of outcomes: in-hospital
and delayed 6-months mortality.</p>
<p>Ours was a prospective cohort study on consecutive patients with UGIB (variceal
and non variceal) treated in “Virgen de las Nieves” University Hospital from
January 2013 to December 2017. All patients underwent upper endoscopy, and
information regarding clinical and biochemical data, procedures, and
outcomes for 6 months after admission were collected. Clinical outcomes
documented were in-hospital and delayed 6-months mortality, rebleeding and
delayed 6-months hemorrhagic and cardiovascular events. Descriptive
inferential and multivariate logistic regression models were carried
out.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 519 patients with a diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal
bleeding were included, 279 EPs and 240 NEPs. EPs differed from NEPs in
comorbidities (82.1% vs. 37.1%, p &lt; 0.001) and in antiplatelets (31.2%
vs. 5.4%, p &lt; 0.001), anticoagulants (26.9% vs.5%, p &lt; 0.001) and
NSAIDs (16.1% vs. 30.8%, p &lt; 0.001) use. No differences were found in the
need for endoscopic, interventional radiology and surgery procedures; blood
units transfusions, days of hospital stay, in-hospital rebleeding and
in-hospital mortality.</p>
<p>Independent predictors for in-hospital mortality in EPs were onset as
hematemesis (HR 2.750; 95% CI 1.105–6.846; p = 0.030), rebleeding (HR 6.551;
95% CI 2.731–15.719; p &lt; 0.001) and antiplatelets use (HR 0.297; 95% CI
0.084–0.990; p = 0.046). However, elderly patients presented a higher rate
of delayed 6-months mortality (15% vs. 7.7%, p = 0.016), 16.7% were related
with GI bleeding. Independent predictors for this event in EPs were albumin
(HR 0.426; 95% CI 0.426; p = 0.026) and creatinine levels (HR 1.927; 95% CI
1.178–3.150; p = 0.009).</p>
<p>Moreover, the group of elderly patients had a higher rate of delayed
hemorrhagic (14.8% vs. 2.9%, p &lt; 0.001) and cardiovascular events (24.5%
vs .12.6%).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this study we demostrate that EPs are more complex
regarding to comorbidities and antiplatelets use; however, they don’t have
worse in-hospital outcomes (need of blood transfusions, days of
hospitalizarion, rebleeding and mortality). In fact, antiplatelets use was a
independent protective factor for in-hospital mortality. This is in
accordance with recent reports showing significantly lower all-cause and
cardiovascular mortality rates in patients with UGIB who do not discontinue
antiplatelet agents. Practicing clinicians should consider risk and benefits
of discontinuing aspirin (2).</p>
<p>On the contrary, EPs group had poor delayed oucomes. This finding is in
concordance with ours previous reports stating that the misbalance caused by
UGIB on frail patients can entail a delayed mortality even months after the
acute episode (3). Serum creatinine and albumin level were independent risk
factors of delayed mortality and can be useful prognostic indicators.
Further validation in prospective studies is needed.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Upper GI bleeding (UGIB) is a common cause of
hospitalisation. The admission Rockall (ARS), Glasgow-Blatchford (GBS) and
AIMS65 scores are validated pre-endoscopy risk assessment tools. The UK
NCEPOD report into UGIB used Shock Index (SI = pulse/systolic blood
pressure) to assess risk of poor outcome. However existing data on SI are
mostly from trauma settings. The limited data in UGIB suggest SI &gt; 0.7,
or SI &gt; 1 may predict need for endoscopic therapy or mortality. Our aim
was to assess the accuracy of SI to predict clinical outcomes after
UGIB.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We collected demographic, clinical and
laboratory data on consecutive patients admitted to 6 large hospitals across
the UK, USA, Denmark, Singapore, and New Zealand over 12 months. We compared
the SI, ARS, GBS, AIMS65 and the new international bleeding risk score
(IBRS) in their ability to predict need for endoscopic therapy, need for
major transfusion (≥4 units PRBCs) and death. We also assessed score
thresholds for identifying patients at low or high risk of death, and
whether adding the SI as a parameter to the IBRS improved its predictive
accuracy.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 3012 patients (mean age 65yrs; 58% men) were studied. 574
(19%) required endoscopic therapy and 396 (13.3%) needed major transfusion.
30-day mortality was 7%. This table compares AUROCs of the scoring systems

<p>For predicting need for endoscopic therapy or major transfusion, SI had lower
accuracy than GBS and IBRS, but similar to AIMS65 and ARS. In contrast to
SI≥1, GBS≥7 correctly identified the majority of patients needing endoscopic
therapy (80% vs 21%; p &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p>For predicting 30-day mortality, SI had lower AUROC than all other scores.
GBS≤1 was superior to SI &lt; 0.7 at predicting low-risk of death (mortality
rate 0.35% vs 5.2%; p &lt; 0.001). Patients with S≥I1 had lower mortality
than those with IBRS≥8 (15.3% vs 34.1%; p &lt; 0.001) and IBRS correctly
identified a greater proportion of those who died as being high risk (49% vs
28%; p &lt; 0.001). Adding SI to the IBRS did not improve its predictive
accuracy (AUROC 0.864 vs 0.863).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Existing pre-endoscopy risk scores are superior to the
SI in predicting need for endoscopic therapy, major transfusion or mortality
after UGIB. Most patients who reach these important clinical endpoints are
classified as low risk by SI.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Acute Lower Intestinal Bleeding (ALIB) has variable
presentation ranging from minor haemorrhoidal bleeding to life threatening
diverticular haemorrhage. Risk stratification and identification of
high-risk patients requiring early intervention is difficult but important
for good clinical outcome. Similarly, low-risk patients could potentially be
discharged early for out-patient management. There is paucity of evidence to
support a single clinical tool to identify these patients. The STRATE score
was developed for this purpose and using the Blatchford Score (GBS) has also
recently been proposed.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of our study was to compare the STRATE
and GBS scores in risk stratification in patients with ALIB and the
identification of high-risk patients requiring urgent intervention. A
retrospective cohort study was conducted in a single tertiary hospital with
adult patients with ALIB who presented between January 2015 and September
2017. Admission data was analysed to calculate STRATE and GBS scores and
divide them into low, moderate and high-risk groups. For the STRATE score
low risk was defined as a score of 0 and high-risk as a score &gt;3. For the
GBS, a score &gt; 6 was considered high risk and a score of 0-1 as low risk.
Need for intervention, details of intervention performed and any
complications were also collated.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 198 patients were identified in the study period with a
diagnosis of ALIB. 55 were excluded due to insufficient data to complete the
analysis. 143 patients were divided into low, moderate and high-risk groups
using the 2 scores. There were 62 females and 81 males in our cohort with a
mean age of 73 years. The STRATE score identified 27 patients (18%) as
high-risk. 11 patients had therapeutic intervention in this group (37%) with
10 patients undergoing angiography and embolisation. In comparison, the
low-risk group (n = 5) did not require any urgent treatment. GBS identified
61 patients as high-risk with 19% requiring urgent intervention. Only 1
patient in the low-risk group for GBS (n = 31) required early treatment.
Only 20% of our cohort underwent in patient colonoscopy and no significant
endoscopic therapy was required. 2 patients required surgery for ischaemia
complicating embolisation.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The STRATE and GBS scores are similar and useful in
identifying a low-risk cohort of patients who may only require out-patient
management. Similarly, they compare well in identifying a high-risk cohort
who require early, aggressive intervention. An approach similar to upper
gastro-intestinal bleed could be considered for risk stratification with
GBS. This would separate patients with ALIB into high and low-risk groups
with high-risk defined as a score greater than 1. This may further improve
the assessment.</p>
<p>The management of patients in the moderate-risk group is less well defined with
either score. Both scoring systems rely on assessment of clinical parameters
within the first 4 hours. Serial monitoring and assessment of scores in the
first 24 hours may be beneficial in this cohort. The study is limited by its
retrospective design and limited numbers in our cohorts. Further prospective
studies are required to determine the ideal risk predictor tools and
management pathways in ALIB.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Achalasia cardia (AC) is a primary motor disorder of
the esophagus characterized by insufficient lower esophageal sphincter (LES)
relaxation and absence of esophageal peristalsis. Its treatment may be
endoscopic, pharmacological or surgical. Currently, the laparoscopic Heller
myotomy (LHM) is the gold standard treatment but the peroral endoscopic
myotomy (POEM) has gained popularity because of its safety and efficacy
profile. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed POEM to be as
effective and safe as LHM for achalasia. However, to date, few randomized
clinical trials (RCTs) prospectively compared endoscopic and surgical
approach.</p>
<p>We conducted a RCT to assess the efficacy and safety of POEM versus LHM in
patients with achalasia.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Patients with manometric findings consistent
with AC and no obstructive cause without prior therapy were randomly
assigned to either LHM or POEM from a single tertiary center. Demographic
data, procedure info, Eckardt score, LES pressure, follow-up reflux
esophagitis, adverse events and length of stay were collected. Student T's
test, Chi square and Logistic regression analyses were conducted.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 40 patients were enrolled (26 M, mean age 48.5) from Mar
16 to Jan 2017. We performed POEM in 20 patients and LHM in other 20. Both
groups presented significant reduction in Eckardt scores compared to
baseline (1.07 vs 7.87 POEM, p &lt; 0.0001 ; 0.44 vs 8.12 LHM,
p &lt; 0.00001) and in LES pressure (12.89 vs 27.03 in POEM, p &lt; 0.00001;
10.03 vs 24.01 in HM, p &lt; 0.00001) at 1 year follow-up. Adverse events
were similar in both group (POEM vs LHM) and consisted of empyema (n = 0 vs
1). Mucosal defects requiring clipping were needed in 3 POEM patients. There
were no statistical difference between groups regarding Eckardt score and
LES pressure reduction, and AEs rate. Patients undergoing POEM were more
likely to develop erosive esophagitis (60% vs. 10%, p &lt; 0.001). Operative
time was significantly lower for POEM (p &lt; 0.001). There were no
differences between POEM and LHM in length of hospital stay (p = 0.173).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> POEM as effective and safe as LHM for the treatment
achalasia but carries shorter duration of procedure. POEM patients present
higher esophagitis rate.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Bleeding from gastric varices (GV) is associated
with high mortality. Injection of cyanoacrylate (CYA) using standard
gastroscopes (SG) presents higher hemostasis and lower re-bleeding rates
compared to band ligation or sclerotherapy. Nevertheless, CYA-SG is
associated with some adverse events. EUS-guided coils alone technique
presents less adverse events, but it shows lower obliteration rate compared
with EUS-guided CYA alone, with a significantly higher health care cost. To
date, there is no data regarding comparison between EUS-guided coils+CYA vs.
EUS-guided coils alone.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aim to compare efficacy and safety of
coils+CYA vs. coils alone in the EUS-guided management of GOV II and IGV
I.</p>
<p>Single-center, randomized, controlled trial (March 2016 – June 2017). Study
protocol was approved by Institutional Review Board. Written informed
consent was obtained. Selection criteria: 18-80 yo, hepatic cirrhosis with
endoscopic evidence of GOV II or IGV I (Sarin classification), &gt;50000
platelets/mL, INR≤2, not into Hepatorenal Syndrome. After randomization, two
groups were formed. EUS procedure was performed by a 1° endoscopist, blind
to patients' history. EUS follow-up was performed 3 months later by a 2°
endoscopist, blind to 1° EUS. Efficacy definition: EUS-Doppler evidenced GV
obliteration, immediate GV disappearance, and later reappearance. Safety
definition: complications and re-bleeding rate in a 30 days-follow up.
Sample size considered 5% α-error, β-error 20%, and success rate for
complete obliteration after 1° EUS-guided coils vs. EUS-CYA procedure (82%
&amp; 53%) described by Romero-Castro et al. Differences between groups were
established through respective hypothesis testing; p &lt; 0.01 was
considered to be statistically significant. Endpoints were estimated through
relative risk (RR). Analyses were performed using R v3.4.2.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 59 patients were successfully included: 30 to EUS-guided
coils+CYA, 29 to EUS-guided coils alone group. There were no statistical
differences in baseline characteristics between groups, although a higher
number of coils were necessary to manage bleeding in coils alone group
(p &lt; 0.01) (table 1A). Compared to coils alone, coils+CYA technique
exposes &gt;6 times immediate GV disappearance (RR 6.3, 95% CI 2.5–15.8;
p &lt; 0.01), with 10% more cases of complete obliteration, 10% less
re-bleeding, preventing 14% GV reappearance and saving 14% re-interventions.
There were no difference regarding adverse events in both groups (table 1B).

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Abdominal pain in association with altered bowel
habits, without any obvious organic changes, are called functional bowel
disorders, with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) being the most common entity.
The etiology is unknown, but an altered gut microbiota has been observed in
some studies, with incongruent results.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Our aim was to examine the gut microbiota
composition in a large population-based cohort, the Malmö Offspring Study
(N = 1988, mean age 40y, 53% women), with respect to presence or absence and
severity of bowel symptoms and self-perceived stress. The participants
completed questionnaires about socioeconomic factors, lifestyle and medical
history, and were asked if they have (yes/no) 1) IBS; 2) experienced any
bowel symptoms during the last 2 weeks (BS-2w) and; 3) been constantly
stressed during the last 12 months. Participants with BS-2w completed a
Visual Analog Scale for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (VAS-IBS) including
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, bloating and flatulence, vomiting
and nausea and psychological well-being. The 16S rRNA gene was sequenced
(2*300bp, V1-V3) from fecal samples. To identify OTUs at genus level the
sequences were binned together by FLASH and QIIME and matched to the
GreenGenes (13.8) reference database. The OUT data was normalized using
cumulative sum scaling, and rare- and low abundancy OTUs were filtered out,
resulting in 67 identified genus. Associations between the gut microbiota
and IBS and BS-2w were analyzed by logistic regression, and items in VAS-IBS
by general linear model, adjusting for age, sex, physical activity and
smoking. We further studied if the associations were modified by
self-perceived stress.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of all study participants 15% reported having IBS, 19%
having BS-2w, and 47% being stressed. IBS and BS-2w were strongly correlated
(r = 0.6), and these subjects were more often females, were younger, had
lower physical activity level, were more often smokers and users of
probiotics, were more likely to be stressed and suffered from worse
psychological well-being, compared to the healthy subjects. The fecal
samples of IBS were significantly enriched with <italic>Collinsella</italic>
(p = 0.030),<italic> Dorea</italic> (p = 0.019),
<italic>Fusobacterium</italic> (p = 0.027),
<italic>Streptococcus</italic> (p = 0.008) and
<italic>Streptophyta</italic> (p = 0.015), and had significantly less
<italic>Barnesinellaceae</italic> (p = 0.018),
<italic>Butyricimonas</italic> (p = 0.022),
<italic>Christensenellaceae</italic> (p = 0.010),
<italic>Facealibacterium</italic> (p = 0.040),<italic>
Lahchnobacterium</italic> (p = 0.043), <italic>Rikenellaceae
(</italic>p = 0.009), and <italic>SHA98</italic> (p = 0.001).
Individuals who reported having bowel symptoms last 2 weeks were
significantly enriched with <italic>Blautia</italic> (p &lt; 0.001),
<italic>Dorea</italic> (p = 0.013),<italic> Ruminococcus</italic>
(p = 0.008), and <italic>Streptophyta</italic> (p = 0.004), and had
significantly less <italic>Christensenellaceae</italic> (p = 0.003) and
<italic>SHA98</italic> (p = 0.003). Diarrhea was the bowel symptom
with most differences compared to health, with the strongest association
with higher abundancy of <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> (beta = 3.25, p
for trend = 0.005). Additionally, we observed significant interactions
between gut bacteria and stress, the most significant being for<italic>
Lachnospiraceae</italic> on diarrea (p for interaction = 0.002), where
the association only occurred in stressed individuals.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This is to the best of our knowledge the first study
to investigate relationship between gut microbiota and IBS in a general
population. We observed that specific bacteria significantly differed
between individuals with and without IBS and bowel symptoms. Diarrhea was
the bowel symptom with most and strongest associations of different
microbiota. Self-perceived stress was found to modify the composition of gut
microbiota in relation to bowel symptoms.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The intestinal microbiota has been implicated as an
important factor in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
however the mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota affects the
presence and/or severity of IBS symptoms are unclear. Recent advances
suggest a role for bile acids in causing alterations in bowel functions
including stimulating bowel secretion and increase in peristalsis and
symptoms of diarrhea and watery stools that are commonly reported in
patients with IBS. It is well known that the conversion of primary bile
acids into (highly colonic irritant) secondary bile acids is entirely
dependent on intestinal bacterial enzymes. However, the relation between the
intestinal microbiota, bile salts and IBS has not been adequately
investigated.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to investigate the relationship between
the intestinal microbiota, bile salts composition and metabolism and IBS
clinical symptoms.</p>
<p>Fresh fecal samples were collected from subjects who met the Rome III criteria
for IBS, and non-IBS controls. IBS principal symptoms (abdominal pain,
change in bowel movements and bloating) were assessed using validated
measures on a daily diary. Overall IBS symptoms were assessed using the IBS
symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS) and intestinal sensation by Visceral
Sensitivity Index (VSI). The intestinal microbiota was investigated by
Illumina Miseq sequencing and analyzed using: an in-house validated,
published pipeline(1), predicted metagenomics with PICRUSt(2) and
concentrations of fecal bile acids by UPLC-MS system(3). Mann-Whitney test
was used for univariate analysis, and PerMANOVA was used for between group
comparisons. Pearson correlations were performed with log transformed bile
acid concentration and clinical data.</p>
<p><bold>Results: :</bold> Fecal samples from 25 IBS and 27 non-IBS subjects were
analyzed. We identified 9 major phyla of which Firmicutes (58.22 ± 2.56%,
mean ± sem), Bacteroidetes (36.32 ± 2.84), Actinobacteria (2.89 ± 0.66%) and
Proteobacteria (1.37 ± 0.24%) were the most abundant in all subjects. There
were no between-groups composition difference at the phylum and community
levels. We identified 21 bile acids in stool, with no significant difference
in concentration of individual bile acids between IBS and non-IBS samples.
In patients with IBS, fecal conjugated primary bile acids (r = 0.62,
p = 0.014), conjugated secondary bile acids (r = 0.49, p = 0.074) and
conjugated tertiary bile acids (r = 0.74, p = 0.022) showed a positive
relationship with IBS-SSS. The 3<sup>rd</sup> conjugated bile acid also
correlated with pain severity in IBS (positive correlation, r = 0.6809,
p = 0.0435) and VSI score (negative correlation, r = −0.7905, p = 0.0195).
No association was found between unconjugated bile acids and any of the
clinical variables. Predictive metagenomic analysis of bile salt hydrolase
(BSH) bacterial enzymatic activity showed negative correlation with
glycine-conjugated primary bile acids (r = −0.473, p = 0.0305). More
interestingly, an inverse trend was found between fecal BSH activity and
IBS-SSS (r = −0.416, p = 0.097).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We discovered novel relationships among fecal
microbial derived BSH, the concentration of conjugated bile acids and
severity of IBS symptoms. Our findings suggest the involvement of intestinal
microbiota in bile acid metabolism contribute to IBS severity in human
patients.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Intestinal epithelial barrier alterations play a key
role in the pathogenesis of several gastrointestinal diseases, such as
inflammatory bowel diseases and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Among
possible pharmacological interventions to restore epithelial barrier, an
interesting perspective is represented by probiotics, which are live
microorganisms commonly used in clinical practice. <italic>Escherichia
coli</italic> Nissle 1917 (EcN) is a probiotic effective in the
maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, although the underlying
molecular mechanisms remain unclear.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to characterize the
potential effect of EcN in reversing the increase of intestinal permeability
caused by the mediators spontaneously released by IBS biopsies, by known
inflammatory stimuli and to evaluate the molecular mechanisms involved.
CaCo-2 cells were used as an in vitro model of intestinal epithelial
barrier. Two concentrations of EcN (10<sup>8</sup> and 10<sup>6</sup>) were
applied to CaCo-2 with or without SLIGRL (a protease-activated receptor-2
activating peptide), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interferon (IFN)-g and
inflammatory mediators spontaneously released (SUP) by mucosal biopsies of
patients with IBS and healthy controls (HC). Paracellular permeability was
evaluated using sulfonic-acid-conjugated to fluorescein (FITC). qPCR was
used to assess mRNA expression of tight junction proteins, zonula
occludens-1 (ZO-1), claudin- 1 and occludin.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> EcN induced a dose-dependent reinforcement of CaCo-2
monolayer of 52% (10<sup>8</sup>, p &lt; 0.05) and 32% (10<sup>6</sup>)
compared to untreated CaCo-2 (CTR). SLIGRL 50uM and 200uM induced a
significant increase in CaCo-2 permeability compared to CTR (p &lt; 0.05);
the co-incubation of SLIGRL and EcN induced a recovery of epithelial
integrity compared to SLIGRL alone. TNF-a and IFN-g induced an increase in
CaCo-2 permeability compared to CTR reverted by EcN. SUP of patients with
IBS induced a significant increase of paracellular permeability compared to
HC SUP (p &lt; 0.05). The co-incubation of EcN with IBS-D or -C SUP induced
a recovery of permeability rate compared to SUP alone (p &lt; 0.05). No
effect of EcN was observed with IBS-M SUP. qPCR analysis showed EcN induced
a significant increase in ZO-1 and occludin expression compared to CTR.
Permeability rate significantly correlated with severity and frequency of
abdominal pain and distension.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> EcN reinforces intestinal epithelial barrier enhancing
the expression of tight junction proteins. EcN reverts the increase of
epithelial monolayer permeability induced by inflammatory stimuli and IBS
SUP. These results pave the way to future studies to understand the
potential application of EcN in IBS.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Increased colorectal perception, so-called visceral
hypersensitivity, is one of the hallmarks of patients suffering from
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A possible role of the gut microbiota in
visceral hypersensitivity was suggested by a study that showed that after
colonisation with gut microbiota of IBS patients, rats had increased rectal
sensitivity compared the control group [1].</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to assess the effect
of modulating the gut microbiota by faecal microbiota transfer (FMT) on
visceral hypersensitivity in IBS patients.</p>
<p>As part of a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial
(registered at clinicalTrials.gov under NCT02092402), 16 IBS patients were
randomised to receive FMT either from a healthy donor (treatment group), or
from their own faecal material (placebo group). The faecal material was
administered into the caecum by whole colonoscopy after a bowel cleansing.
In addition to completing questionnaires for assessing IBS symptoms
(IBS-SSS, GSRS-IBS), the patients underwent a barostat procedure at baseline
and 8 weeks after FMT. Before assessment, patients fasted overnight and were
placed in a left lateral position. The barostat catheter (600 mL, Mui
Scientific, Ontario, Canada) was placed 15 cm into the rectum. Rectal
distensions were performed according to previous studies using an electronic
distension barostat device (Distender series II, G&amp;J Electronic Inc.,
Toronto, Canada) [2, 3]. In short, intermittent semi-random staircase
distensions of 60 seconds duration were separated by intervals of 30 seconds
of baseline pressure. During each distension, subjects reported their
perception of pain, discomfort, and urge, respectively, using 100 mm visual
analogue scales (VAS). VAS scores were fit to a logistic function model and
evaluated at fixed pressures of 20, 30, 40, 50 mmHg. The fitted
baseline-corrected VAS values were then compared before and after FMT using
Wilcoxon signed rank test, and between treatment and placebo using
Mann-Whitney U-test.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Evaluable barostat data was available from n = 14
participants. No statistically significant differences in the patients'
perception of pain and discomfort were found before and after FMT, neither
in the treatment (n = 8) nor the placebo group (n = 6). The perception of
urge was significantly lower in the placebo group compared the treatment
group at 20, 40, and 50 mmHg 8 weeks after FMT. Even though a relief in
symptoms after FMT was found in the treatment group compared to baseline,
this was not associated with decreased visceral hypersensitivity.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The beneficial effect of FMT from healthy donors on
the symptom scores in IBS patients does not seem to be mediated by reduced
hypersensitivity. The reduced perception of urge in the placebo group could
be a result of the bowel cleansing prior to the colonoscopy. The absence of
this effect on urge in the treatment group might be due to a reaction of the
host mucosa to the introduction of a new, foreign microbiota. Further
analyses need to be performed to study what contributes to the positive
effect of FMT in IBS patients.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Faecal microbiota transfer (FMT) consists of the
introduction of a new microbiota into the intestine of a patient with the
aim to restore a disturbed gut microbiota. Studies have shown that FMT
reduces inflammation in ulcerative colitis, and improves insulin sensitivity
in metabolomic syndrome (1). However, the colonic mucosal host response to
FMT by gene expression has, to the best of our knowledge, not yet been
studied.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of the study was to investigate the IBS
patients' colonic mucosal response to the administration of allogenic (from
a donor) or autologous (own) faecal material into the colon. In a recently
conducted randomised, double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial, 16
IBS patients were treated with FMT by colonoscopy after bowel cleansing. RNA
was isolated from colonic biopsies, collected by sigmoidoscopy, at baseline,
2 weeks and 8 weeks after FMT in the group that received allogenic faecal
material as well as in the group that received autologous faecal material.
Whole genome microarray (Genechip Human Gene 2.1 ST, Affymetrix) was used to
analyse gene expression. Pathway analysis was performed by Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Pathway analysis of the gene expression data showed that
in patients treated with allogenic faecal material, significantly
upregulated pathways consisted mainly of immune response-related pathways
such as “Allograft rejection” and “Intestinal immune network for IgA
production”. On the contrary, in the patients receiving autologous faecal
material, pathways involving immune response-related processes, such as
“Primary immunodeficiency” were significantly downregulated.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study shows that the host mucosa responds to FMT
by up- and downregulating gene expression pathways involved in immunological
processes. The upregulated immune-related pathways in the allogenic FMT and
downregulated immune-related pathways in the autologous FMT group indicate
that the host reacts to the newly introduced, foreign microbiota in a
different way than to the bowel cleansing and re-introduction of the own
microbiota. Further analysis need to be performed in order to identify which
molecular interaction networks are involved, and if these gene expression
results are transferable to protein level.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is associated with an
intestinal dysbiosis, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been
hypothesized to have a positive effect in patients with IBS. We performed a
randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial to investigate if FMT
resulted in an altered gut microbiota and improvement in clinical outcome in
IBS patients.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We performed this study in 52 adult patients
with IBS (based on Rome III criteria) with moderate to severe disease
activity based on a symptom score of at least 175 in the IBS-severity
scoring system (IBS-SSS). Our primary endpoint was the difference in
improvement in IBS-SSS after 3 months. At the screening visit, clinical
history and symptoms were assessed and fecal samples were collected.
Patients were then randomized to FMT or placebo capsules for 12 days and
followed for 6 months. Study visits were performed at baseline, 1 month, 3
months and 6 months, where patients were asked to register their symptoms
using the IBS-SSS and IBS specific quality of life (IBS-QoL). Prior to each
visit fecal samples were collected, inclusive of a sample 3 days after
treatment was completed (day 15).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A significant difference in improvement in IBS-SSS score
was observed 3 months after treatment (p = 0.012) favoring placebo. This was
similar for IBS-QoL data after 3 months (p = 0.003) favoring placebo.
Patients receiving FMT capsules had an increase in biodiversity to the
extent that this group wasn't statistically distinguishable from the donors,
and the placebo patients remained statistically indistinguishable from their
pre-treatment state (Mann-Whitney U-test, p &lt;0.05). All participants
completed the treatment and no serious adverse events were registered
throughout the study period.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In a randomized double-blinded placebo controlled
study, we found that FMT changed gut microbiota in IBS patients. But
patients in the placebo-group experienced greater symptom relief compared to
the FMT-group. Altering the gut microbiota is not enough to obtain clinical
improvement in IBS. However, different study designs and larger studies are
required to examine the role of FMT in IBS.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Complete transection of the common bile duct is a
dramatic complication after biliary surgery especially after laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. Since 1995 we have proposed an endoscopic – radiologic
rendez-vous that successfully obtains the reconstruction of the biliary tree
in a minimal invasive way. After treatment with 4 or 5 biliary plastic
stents left in place for at least one year<sup>1</sup> patients were
followed up for at least five years.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Since 1995, 91 patients were treated for
complete transection of the common bile duct: 3 patients had traumatic
biliary section, 88 iatrogenic, (73 after lap.chole. 15 after open
surgery).</p>
<p>All patients were successfully treated with endoscopic-radiologic rendez-vous
and after right and left transhepatic approach 4 or 5 plastic 10 F stents
were radiologically put in place. After 12 months, the stents were
endoscopically removed and a control cholangiography with an ERCP was
performed. If stones and sludge were found they were removed. In case of
duct stenosis a new transhepatic approach was made and several plastic
stents put in place again for 12 months. The patients were followed up for 5
years with blood analysis, ultrasounds and MR cholangiography.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 60 patients were evaluated as 21 were lost at follow-up
and 10 are under treatment, 44 patients (73%) are well after 5 years without
any symptoms of cholestasis and biliary dilatation at MR cholangiography. 2
patients died for sepsis after 6 and 12 months of treatment. 4 patients had
cholangitis after 6 and 8 months: the stents were removed and replaced after
recovery, 16 patients had stenosis of the main bile duct after stent
removal: they were treated again with 4 plastic stents for 1 year, 8
patients had stenosis recurrence during follow up after 2 or 3 years: they
were treated endoscopically and a fully covered self-expanding metallic
stent left in place for one year. All patients, also those retreated, are
well after 5 years of follow up.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The radiologic-endoscopic rendez-vous is a safe and
efficient technic for minimal invasive treatment of the common bile duct
complete section. It is challenging for the radiologist as the intrahepatic
biliary ducts are thin and for the endoscopist that has to puncture the duct
often clipped. It requires many sessions for complete treatment and in a few
cases treatment for stenosis recurrence but in this way we can avoid
surgical treatment on the biliary tree that requires difficult intervention
which has a high morbidity and mortality.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Postoperative pancreatic fistulas (POPF) are one of
the most prevalent clinically relevant complications after partial
pancreatic resections. Endoscopic approaches have been proven successful,
but literature is scarce on the best route of drainage.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Our study aimed at comparing efficacy and safety
of transpapillary (ERCP based) and transmural (EUS guided) endoscopic
treatment of POPS occurring after distal pancreatectomies. We designed an
observational and analytical retrospective cohort study on all patients
(178) with a distal pancreatectomy since 2000. The primary end point was
clinical success of endoscopic treatment defined as a complete resolution of
POPF discharge or fluid collection (PFC) or size &lt; 2cm, with association
of symptoms resolution, without the need for percutaneous drainage or
surgery. Secondary endpoints were technical success (feasibility and
efficacy of stent placement), complication rate of endoscopic procedures,
and reintervention rate. Categorical variables were compared using
χ<sup>2</sup> test. Normally distributed continuous variables were
analyzed by Student <italic>t</italic>-test and non-normally distributed
variables by the Mann-Whitney U-test. Patients were divided in 3 groups
(ERCP only, EUS drainage only, both EUS and ERCP).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 173 surgical patients, 58 POPF grade B and C were
treated by endoscopy. Rate of fistula was not correlated to surgery type
(+-splenectomy, body and tail resection or solely tail, enucleation,
isthmectomy, combined with other organ resections), neither to indication
for surgery (malignancy, trauma, pancreatitis). Fistulas were more severe in
older patients (p = 0.043). Patients were treated by ERCP alone (n = 31,
53.4%), EUS alone (n = 13, 22.4%) or both procedures (n = 14, 24.1%). There
was a significant shift from ERCP alone (100% of cases between 2000-2005) to
EUS alone and combined with ERCP (23% 2006-2010, and 48% 2011-2016).
Technical success rates were similar in all groups (87-100-100%). Clinical
success in patients treated by ERCP only was 64.5% (20/31) and as high as
96.3% (26/27) in patients in whom EUS was performed at any points during
endoscopic treatment (p = 0.003). The overall re-intervention rate was
44.8%, significantly lower when EUS was part of the treatments (20 and 23%
vs. 55%, p &lt; 0.05). The complication rates in the ERCP, EUS and ERCP+EUS
groups were respectively 20% (n = 8/40), 30.8% (n = 4/13) and 0%
(p = 0.346), with a decrease to only 2 AE in the last 5 years.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Endoscopic treatment was highly successful in treating
POPF after distal pancreatectomy, with a significantly better clinical
success rate of EUS compared with ERCP, resulting in less reinterventions
needed. We therefore suggest considering EUS as a primary approach,
reserving ERCP for cases with pancreatic ductal strictures or inaccessible
post-operative collections or fistulas.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Transmural Drainage
(EUS-TD) is a minimally invasive first-line modality for the management of 2
types of pancreatic fluid collection (PFC): pancreatic pseudocyst (PP) and
walled-off necrosis (WON). EUS-TD has demonstrated a shorter hospital stay
and less morbidity compared to surgical cystogastrostomy. Stents delivery
systems are available in different materials and trademarks. Their specific
outcomes on PFC types have not been described, particularly in a Hispanic
population.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to evaluate the outcomes and seek for
differences in the management of EUS-TD of PP and WON, between different
stents materials and trademarks.</p>
<p>This was an observational, descriptive, longitudinal, retrospective cohort
study. Data from EUS-guided drainages of PFC cases were obtained from
medical records, as corresponding: PFC characteristics, type of stent
(metal: Hot-AXIOS™, NAGI™, SPAXUS™; plastic: double pigtail), technical
success (including time of procedure), clinical success (follow-up: adverse
events, further EUS, imaging, possible re-interventions and PFC resolution).
Variables were described in mean or median values, according to statistical
distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test), and contrasted through follow-up with
corresponding hypothesis testing. Analyses were performed using R v3.4.2 (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> From May-2014 to Oct-2017, 42 consecutive cases were
collected: 29/42 PP and 13/42 WON. Median age 48 (10–76) yo, 19/42 (45%)
female. PFC etiology were biliary in 31/42 (74%) cases, and alcoholic in
11/42 (26%). Median size of PFC was 7 (1–14) cm. PFC were more frequently on
body-tail (62%). Pain and infection were indication of drainage in 30/42
(71%) and 12/42 (29%) cases, respectively. Clinicopathological
chraracteristics are summarized in table 1. <table-wrap id="table9-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table9-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table9"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">(n = 42)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">PFC in remission during diagnosis, n (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">7 (16.7)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Patients not attempted &amp; lost follow-up, n

</p>
<p>In 7/29 PP cases, spontaneous remission was observed; 3/29 PP and 3/13 WON were
lost on follow-up. 19/19 PP and 10/10 WON underwent on EUS-guided stent
placement, with 100% technical success. Time of procedure per stents was as
following: Hot-AXIOS™ 5 (4-6) min, NAGI™ 19 (18-22) min, SPAXUS™ 20 (18-22)
min, double pigtail 20 (18-22) min (p &lt; 0.01). In PP cases, a bleeding
episode occurred 48 hours after a Hot-AXIOS™ placement (p = 0.58). In WON
cases, an obstruction was reported with a Hot-AXIOS™, and a bleeding episode
occurred 48 hours after a NAGI™ placement (p = 0.69). Both bleeding events
required surgical management. Overall adverse events rate was 10% (3/29)
with no reports from plastic stent cases. Overall 30-day mortality was 0%.
All stents were finally removed. On this series, none of the cases needed
percutaneous drainage. Overall median time from stent placement to complete
drainage &amp; removal was 8 (1-20) weeks; overall median longest follow-up
time was 41 (8-120) weeks. 3 cases (2 SPAXUS™, 1 NAGI™) cannot be released
due to device failure, and no cases of Hot-AXIOS™ or plastic stent.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Neither stent material nor trademark present a
significant impact on PFC outcomes, even in the presence of adverse events.
Compared to other stents, Hot-AXIOS™ seems to be more practical and faster
for placement.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Lumen Apposing Metal Stents (LAMS) have been
recently introduced into clinical practice. A variety of Technical Issues
(TIs) can appear during LAMS placement but we lack a common terminology to
address them and their consequences on clinical outcomes are unknown.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We define TI as any alteration in the normal
sequence of LAMS placement (TI is not synonymous with adverse event).
Consecutive patients undergoing an endoscopic procedure which included the
placement of a transmural LAMS between May 2011 and June 2017 in a single
tertiary center were included (table 1). Data were prospectively databased
and retrospectively analyzed. We propose a novel classification of TIs,
categorized in access failure, liberation failures, misplacements and
dislodgment. We analyzed their rates, risk factors, endoscopic management
and it effect on clinical outcomes.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 289 procedures (47.4% pancreatic fluid
collections, 33.7% pancreato-biliary drainages including gallbladder
drainages, 13.8% enteric anastomoses, 5.1% others) were analyzed. TI
occurred in 27% of them, founding a significant higher rate in technical
(99.5% vs 52.6%, p &lt; 0.001), procedural (100% vs 82.1%, p &lt; 0.001) and
clinical success (88% vs 77.9%, p = 0.03) when compared with procedures
without TIs. Distal (25.6%) and proximal flange misplacements (17.9%) and
complete liberation failures (17.9%) were the most frequently encountered
TIs. Forceps repositioning, placement of a new LAMS or another
through-the-LAMS stent were the most frequent rescued techniques. 13 (16.7%)
TIs could not be saved. Entero-anastomoses (OR 3.42 (1.22–9.62)) and
malignant disease (OR: 3.32 (1.05–10.56)) were risk factors associated to
the development of TIs on multivariable analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Even in experts’ hands, TIs are frequent in transmural
EUS-guided LAMS placement, typically in distal flange misplacement. The
knowledge of salvage techniques using other stents makes rescue possible in
more than 80% of cases. <table-wrap id="table10-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table10-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table10"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Basal Features</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">N (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age, median (IQR)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">71.6 (58.3–83.5)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Male sex, n (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">184 (63.7%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Malignant disease, n (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">75 (26%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">LAMS type, n (%) Hot Cold Missing</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">170 (58.8%) 116 (40.1%) 3 (1%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">“Free-Hands” Technique</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">42 (14.5%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Access, n (%) Stomach Duodenum  Jejunum

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Endoscopic management of combined malignant gastric
outlet obstruction (GOO) and biliary obstruction remains a challenge. The
development of EUS-guided biliary transmural drainage (EUS-D) and EUS-guided
gastrojejunal anastomoses (EUS-GJ) has increased the available palliative
options. The number of studies comparing intraluminal and transmural
approaches regarding follow-up procedures or readmissions is scarce.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective analysis including
all patients presenting malignant GOO and biliary obstruction between 2011
and 2017 at a single tertiary care center. Patients were classified
according to the biliary and duodenal drainage method, transmural (EUS-D and
EUS-GJ) vs transpapillary/intraluminal. Follow-up was started at the time of
the first endoscopic procedure. Biliary stent dysfunction was defined as
cholangitis and/or obstructive jaundice after endoscopic double stenting.
Duodenal dysfunction was accepted if GOO reappeared after successful initial
management.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 103 patients with a median age of 76.1 years
(IQR: 61.3–84.3), 58 males, were included. Most frequent diagnoses were
pancreatic adenocarcinoma (53.4%), cholangiocarcinoma (10.7%) and ampuloma
(8.7%). GOO and biliary obstruction were treated within the same week in
39/103 patients.</p>
<p>Most biliary obstructions were distal (93/103). Initial management was
performed with transpapillary stenting in 69/103 patients and EUS-D in
34/103 (20 choledocoduodenostomies, 13 hepaticogastrostomies, 1 gallbladder
drainage). Technical success was achieved in all patients undergoing EUS-D
and in 67/69 of the transpapillary drainage group; clinical success was
reached in 88.5% EUS-Ds and in 95.6% transpapillary drainages. Duodenal
strictures were mostly Mutignani types I (48.5%) and II (49.5%). GOO score
at the time of treatment was ≤1 in 87.9% of cases. Initial management was
performed with intraluminal SEMS in100/103 cases and with EUS-GJ in 3
patients. Technical success was achieved in 100% and clinical success in
97.5%. Thus, initial management included intraluminal duodenal and biliary
stents in 67/103 (65.1%) and EUS-D with intraluminal duodenal stents in
33/103 (32%).</p>
<p>Follow-up was available in 89 patients, with a median time of 247 days
(91-547), 68% died during follow-up, 4.4% completed the study period and
27.5% were lost after a median follow-up of 147 days (55-248). We observed a
total of 79 biliary events (median 0 events/patients, IQR 0-1). Obstructive
jaundice without cholangitis was the most common event (34/79) followed by
cholangitis with biliary obstruction (19/79) and cholangitis without
obstruction (15/79). EUS-D patients presented a total of 9 events in 6/30
patients while there were 70 events in 36/59 transpapillary drainages. 17/59
patients with transpapillary drainage underwent EUS-D. Transpapillary
stenting associated a significantly higher risk of new biliary events, with
an incidence-rate ratio of 2.5 (95% CI: 1.14–5.61).</p>
<p>We observed 40 episodes of duodenal disfunction in 31/89 patients during
follow-up, with the first episode appearing after a median of 95 days (IQR:
37-266); 30/40 (75%) were due to tumor ingrowth. Most episodes (26/40) 65%
were salvaged deploying a transluminal stent, although 7 EUS-GJs was
performed.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The role of EUS-guided transmural approaches in
malignant biliary obstruction and GOO is expanding, but further data are
needed before proposing management bundles. Our data suggest EUS-D reduces
the need of further endoscopic procedures during follow-up, while EUS-GJ is
been increasingly employed.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Endoscopic ultrasound guided gastroenterostomy
(EUS-GE) is a minimally invasive option for patients with gastric outlet
obstruction. It involves creating a gastroenterostomy fistula via EUS and
deploying a lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) across the fistulous tract. It
is a technically challenging procedure, requiring skills in EUS,
fluoroscopy, and LAMS deployment. The aim of this study was to determine the
learning curve for EUS-GE.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Consecutive patients undergoing EUS-GE by a
single operator were included from a prospective registry from Aug 2014 to
Oct 2017. Demographics, procedure info, post-procedure follow-up data, and
adverse events were collected. Non-linear regression and CUSUM analyses was
conducted for the learning curve. Clinical success was defined as tolerating
a diet post-procedure</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 23 patients were included (39%M, mean age 65.8 years). 11
(48%) had malignant GOO indication, 9 (39%) had benign GOO, 3 (13%) had
other indications. All had a 15mm LAMS placed, 7 (30%) had cautery enhanced
LAMS. Clinical success was achieved in 22/23 patients. Average follow-up
time 10.8 months (9.1STD). 7 patients had misdeployed LAMS during the
procedure, requiring placement of a bridging stent; 2 required NOTES
technique for bridging. 5 patients had minor post-procedure complications; 1
patient had a peri-procedural esophageal tear treated with clips. 4 patients
required repeat intervention for stent revision or removal if no longer
needed. Median procedure time was 88 mins (range: 45-140). CUSUM chart shows
88 minute procedure time was achieved at the 7th procedure indicating
efficiency. The spikes indicate procedures that required extra time due to
bridging of a misdeployed LAMS. Even with these outliers, the procedure
duration further reduced with consequent procedures (non-bridging LAMS stent
procedures) indicating continued improvement with experience (nonlinear
regression p &lt; 0.0001).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Endoscopists experienced in EUS-GE are expected to
achieve a reduction in procedure time over successive cases, with efficiency
reached at 88 minutes and a learning rate of 7 cases. Misdeployed stents
that require bridging add to the procedure time even after competency is
achieved but do not affect the overall learning curve trend.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> In recent years, Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) projects
analyzed over 200 colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor-normal pair exome and
obtained extremely big data which is available<sup>1</sup>. This TCGA study
also revealed dozens of Significantly Mutated Gene (SMG) which are key
drivers of CRC development. These results, however, are mostly obtained from
advanced CRC. In contrast, we have easy access to early CRC in our daily
clinical practice. Thus, we analyzed tissue samples which are mostly early
CRC obtained by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and endoscopic
mucosal resection (EMR), and compared to TCGA data on advanced CRC.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> TCGA data contained data on 149 advanced CRCs
which were studied <italic>in silico</italic>, whereas by next generation
sequencer we analyzed nucleotides sequences of our 18 endoscopically
obtained CRC samples (4 EMR and 14 ESD) by “Colorectal Cancer Panel” which
we created in-house. This in-house panel covers 202,842 nucleotides or
67,614 deduced amino acids of 60 SMGs<sup>1,2</sup>. Non-neoplastic portion
of the tumor was also analyzed. In addition to the gene sequencing, we
undertook immunohistochemical staining of (IHC) of mismatch repair genes
(MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, PMS6).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> We obtained significant mutations (Total 56, 10 nonsense,
7 frameshift, 39 missense) of 60 SMGs in 18 tumor samples (Cut-off level of
Allelic Fraction, AF above 20 %). We also analyzed TCGA data base on 149
advanced CRCs. We then categorized characteristics of those somatic mutation
into 4 groups according to presence or absence of 2 major signaling pathways
of Wnt signaling (APC, RNF43, CTNNB1) and of MAPK signaling (KRAS, NRAS,
BRAF).</p>
<p>Mutations for both Wnt &amp; MAPK; our Early 6/18 (33%) vs 59/149 (40%).</p>
<p>Mutations only for Wnt; our Early 12/18 (67%) vs 49/149 (33%).</p>
<p>Mutation only for MAPK; our Early 0/18 (0%) vs 24/149 (16%).</p>
<p>Mutation negative for both; our Early 0/18 (%) vs 17/149 (11%).</p>
<p>In our study, early CRCs had more Wnt pathway abnormality alone than advanced
cases of TCGA data base (67% vs. 33% p &lt; 0.05, Chi-square test). Of
interest was that among the molecules involved in Wnt signaling pathway
(APC, RNF43 and CTNNB1), the presence of somatic mutations in those
molecules were mutually exclusive. This applies for MAPK signaling pathway
(KRAS, NRAS and BRAF) as well. All mutation of APC and RNF43 identified in
our study were truncating, indicating these mutations were “drivers”.
Whereas mutation of MAPK genes were all transacting. Among molecule of Wnt
pathway, somatic mutation of RNF43 was identified in 2 (11%) early CRC
cases. IHC showed that expression of MLH1 and PMS2 were deficient in these 2
cases. In TCGA, only one of 149 (0.7%) advanced CRC had somatic mutation of
RNF43. This case was advanced CRC cancer with microsatellites instability
high.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Very early stage of CRC now easily available by EMR
and ESD tended to have somatic mutation only for genes of Wnt signaling
pathway (not both for Wnt and MAPK). In some cases, even in very early stage
of CRC, driver mutation of RNF43 with MSI could occur, which might
contribute to the initiation of neoplastic changes and transformation to
advance stages. However, the rarity of RNF43 mutations in advanced CRC in
TCGA data base yet to be confirmed.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and aspirin both have proof-of-concept for
colorectal cancer (CRC) chemoprevention, aligned with an excellent safety
profile.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We performed a randomised, blinded,
placebo-controlled, 2×2 factorial trial to determine the effects of EPA and
aspirin on preventing colorectal adenomas. We also assessed the safety and
tolerability of EPA, in free fatty acid (FFA) or triglyceride (TG) form, and
aspirin.</p>
<p>NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP) patients (aged 55-73) identified as
‘high risk' (≥5 small [ &lt; 10mm] colorectal adenomas; or ≥3 colorectal
adenomas, if one ≥10mm) at screening colonoscopy were randomly allocated
99%EPA-FFA 2g or 90%EPA-TG 2780mg (equivalent to 2g FFA) daily, or identical
placebo capsules; AND aspirin 300 mg daily, or an identical placebo
enteric-coated tablet. All participants and research staff were unaware of
the treatment allocation.</p>
<p>The primary outcome was the number of participants with ≥1 colorectal adenoma
(adenoma detection rate [ADR]) at one year surveillance colonoscopy.
Outcomes were analysed ‘at the margins' on an intention-to-treat basis,
adjusted for BCSP site and need for repeat endoscopy at baseline. Secondary
outcomes included the total number of colorectal adenomas per patient (mean
adenomas per patient [MAP]), ‘advanced' ADR, as well as colorectal adenoma
location (right/left) and type (conventional/serrated).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 709 participants (80% male, mean [SD] 65 [5] years, 82%
BMI &gt; 25kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were randomised. The four treatment arms
(EPA + aspirin, n = 177; EPA, n = 178; aspirin, n = 176; placebo, n = 176)
were well-matched for baseline characteristics. There were no differences
between FFA and TG users regarding rectal mucosal/red blood cell PUFA levels
or tolerability profile. There was no evidence of any difference in ADR
between EPA users (62%) and non-users (61%) (risk difference [RD] -0.9% [95%
CI -8.8,6.9]) or for aspirin users (61%) <italic>versus</italic> non-users
(62%) (RD -0.6% [-8.5,7.2]). There was no evidence of an interaction between
EPA and aspirin for ADR. There was no evidence of any effect on advanced ADR
of either EPA (RD -0.6% [-4.4,3.1]) or aspirin (RD -0.3% [-4.1,3.5]).
Aspirin use was associated with a reduction in MAP (incidence rate ratio
[IRR] 0.78 [0.68,0.90] with preventive efficacy against conventional (IRR
0.82 [0.71,0.94), serrated (IRR 0.46 [0.25,0.87]) and right-sided (IRR 0.73
[0.61,0.88]) lesions, but not left-sided (IRR 0.85 [0.69,1.06]) adenomas.
There was evidence of chemopreventive efficacy of EPA on conventional (IRR
0.86 [0.74,0.99]) and left-sided (0.75 [0.60,0.94]) adenomas, but not on
total MAP (IRR 0.91 [0.79,1.05]), serrated (IRR 1.44 [0.79,2.60]) or
right-sided (IRR 1.02 [0.85,1.22]) adenomas. Overall adenoma number was
reduced in the EPA + aspirin arm (166) compared with the other groups (238
[EPA], 209 [aspirin] and 231 [placebo]). EPA and aspirin treatment were well
tolerated with an excess of mild-moderate GI adverse events (AEs), prominent
in the EPA alone arm. There were 6 GI bleeding AEs.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Neither EPA nor aspirin treatment was associated with
a reduction in ADR at 1 year in ‘high-risk' individuals after clearance
colonoscopy. However, both agents displayed evidence of chemopreventive
efficacy, based on adenoma number reduction, which was adenoma type- and
location-specific, and is compatible with the known anti-(right-sided) CRC
activity of aspirin. Best use of EPA and aspirin may need a precision
medicine approach to adenoma recurrence based on colorectal adenoma
sub-types. ISRCTN05926847</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> In Japan, endoscopic submucosal resection (ESD) has
become standardized for early colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) as histological
complete en bloc resection. According to the Japanese Society for Cancer of
the Colon and Rectum (JSCCR) guidelines 2016, pT1 CRC resected
endoscopically is treated as follows. CRCs with positive vertical tumor
margins, unfavorable histology, submucosal invasion depth ≥1000 µm, positive
vessel invasion, or/and budding grade 2/3 should be considered for
additional surgery with lymph node (LN) dissection. Only a few studies have
demonstrated that preceding endoscopic resection including ESD did not
worsen clinical outcomes in cases after additional surgical resection,
however, malignant oncologic behavior of preceding endoscopic resection
prior to additional surgery has been controversial. In this study, we
analyzed the influence of preceding ESD on the prognosis of patients with
pT1 CRCs after additional surgery using propensity score-matching.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We retrospectively assessed 1,444 consecutive
patients with 1,444 pT1 CRCs who underwent ESD prior to additional surgery
or surgery alone between June 1992 and June 2016 at the Hiroshima GI
Endoscopy Research Group (Hiroshima University Hospital and 10 affiliated
hospitals). A total of 900 patients were excluded due to the following
reasons: resected by endoscopic mucosal resection or polypectomy (n = 575);
treated by ESD alone (n = 74); no follow-up for more than 12 months
(n = 35); previous or synchronous CRCs and other cancers (n = 92); or
resected by piecemeal resection (n = 24). Finally, 544 patients with T1 CRCs
who underwent ESD prior to additional surgery (group A: n = 163) or surgical
resection alone (group B: n = 381) were included in this study. The enrolled
patients were treated according to the JSCCR guidelines 2016, and patients
who did not meet curative condition of the guidelines were defined as
non-endoscopically curable (non-e-curable) patients. After matching the
propensity scores, we analyzed pathological characteristics stated in the
JSCCR guidelines 2016 and the prognoses of non-e-curable patients between
the 2 groups.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The numbers of non-e-curable patients were 157 in group A
(including 27 patients with positive vertical tumor margins) and 323 in
group B. The rate of LN metastasis was 9.4% (51 patients) and all of them
were non-e-curable patients. Recurrence did not occur in e-curable patients
(average observation period: 86.1 months); however, 14 recurrences (2.6%)
occurred in non-e-curable patients (average observation period: 70.3
months). Five of these were in group A, while the others were in group B.
One and three patients died of primary carcinoma in groups A and B,
respectively. Propensity scores were calculated using a logistic regression
model, and the variables included in the model were age, sex, location,
tumor size, and growth type in non-e-curable patients. After propensity
score-matching, 134 non-e-curable patients in group A and 134 non-e-curable
patients in group B were picked up. The 5-year overall survival rate in
group A was significantly higher than that in Group B (97.6% vs. 88.1%).
However, there were no significant differences in 5-year disease-free
survival rates (95.6% vs. 96.7%) and 5-year disease-specific survival rates
(100% vs. 99.1%) after treatment of pT1 CRCs between 2 groups in
non-e-curable patients.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The prognoses of e-curable patients with pT1 CRC
supported the JSCCR criteria. Preceding ESD with histological en bloc
resection for patients with T1 pCRC did not affect their clinical outcomes
adversely after additional surgery.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> PCCRC is a key quality indicator for the detection
and prevention of colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC). It is not known whether
rates of PCCRC are changing over time. There is limited evidence of factors
associated with PCCRC that might be amenable to quality improvement
interventions.</p>
<p>This study investigated trends in rates of PCCRC in the NHS in England; the
extent of variation between NHS trusts; and potential causal associations
with PCCRC.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Using linked national Hospital Episode
Statistics and National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service data all
individuals who had undergone a colonoscopy procedure between 1/1/2006 and
31/12/2012 and who developed a CRC to 31/12/2015 were identified. NHS trust
provider status and potential associations with PCCRC were included in the
analysis. International consensus methodology was used to calculate the
PCCRC – 3 year rate (PCCRC-3yr).<sup>1,2</sup> Colonoscopies were labelled
as true positive (CRC within 0 to 6 months of the procedure), false negative
(CRC within 6 to 36 months) and true negative (CRC beyond 36 months). The
PCCRC-3yr rate was calculated as: false negatives / (true positive + false
negative) x 100%. The PCCRC-3yr rate was calculated for each year from 2006
to 2012. In addition, the rate in each colonoscopy provider was calculated,
and organisations grouped using quintiles. PCCRC rates were calculated in
relation to patient and tumour characteristics.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Between 2006 and 2012 108,908 colonoscopies followed by a
diagnosis of CRC were identified. Of these, 93,240 (86%) were labelled true
positive, 7,781 (7%) were false negatives, and 7,887 (7%) were true negative
tests. There was a significant reduction in PCCRC-3yr rates, from 8.6% in
2006 to 7.5% in 2012 (Chi<sup>2</sup> for trend p &lt; 0.01). There was
variation in unadjusted, mean PCCRC-3yr rate between NHS Trusts from 5% (SD
+/-2%) in the highest performing quintile to 11% (SD +/-2%) in the lowest.
PCCRCs were significantly associated with female sex, right-sided colonic
lesions, inflammatory bowel disease and diverticular disease diagnosis,
mucinous CRC and in individuals with metachronous CRC.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> There has been a significant reduction in PCCRC-3yr
rates from 2006 to 2012, likely to be related to improvements in
colonoscopic quality: particularly improved caecal intubation and bowel
preparation resulting in improved lesion recognition and removal. There
appears to be unwarranted variation of PCCRC-3yr rates across NHS trusts.
Reasons for this variation need to be explored and subject to quality
improvement projects. Evidence from this study can be used to help target
those at highest risk of PCCRC.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Knowledge of the natural history of colorectal
adenomas is limited because these lesions are removed upon detection. The
few studies in which small adenomas have been left <italic>in situ</italic>
for a limited period of time have shown that most lesions remain stable or
even completely vanish. Lesions that have grown in size more often turn out
to be advanced adenomas when resected. Specific DNA copy number changes
(‘cancer-associated events' or CAEs) are associated with progression of
adenomas to cancer.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To evaluate whether growth of small colorectal
polyps left <italic>in situ</italic> is associated with specific molecular
features.</p>
<p>In the CT-colonography (CTC) arm of the COCOS-trial<sup>1</sup>, 95 small
(6-9mm) colorectal polyps detected on CT-colonography were left <italic>in
situ</italic> and re-measured after a surveillance interval of 3
years. Based on volumetric change, polyps were classified as either grown
(&gt;30% growth), stable (&lt;30% growth and &lt; 30% regression) or
regressed (&gt;30% regression). The surveillance CT-colonography was
followed by colonoscopy, during which all lesions were resected and
histologically classified. Using DNA isolated from FFPE material,
low-coverage whole genome sequencing was performed to determine DNA copy
number profiles, as well as target enrichment mutation analysis and CpG
island methylation (CIMP) analysis. In addition, expression of DNA mismatch
repair (MMR) genes was determined by immunohistochemistry.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> FFPE material could be retrieved from 65 lesions,
including 47 (72%) tubular adenomas with low grade dysplasia (LGD), 9 (14%)
tubulovillous adenomas with LGD, 1 (2%) sessile serrated lesion without
dysplasia and 8 (12%) hyperplastic polyps without dysplasia. Of the lesions
31 (48%) grew, 27 (41%) remained stable and 7 (11%) regressed. Growth rates
were higher in lesions having ≥1 CAEs compared to lesions without CAEs (143%
(s.e. 56%) vs 52% (s.e. 14%), respectively, p = 0.02). CAEs were absent in
lesions that regressed. Mutations occurred in 94% of the lesions, with
higher growth rates being associated with lesions having ≥2 mutations
compared to lesions with only 0-1 mutations (127% (s.e. 34%) versus 27%
(s.e. 13%), respectively, p = 0.03). Mutations in <italic>APC</italic> were
most frequently observed, occurring in 56% of the small polyps and only in
adenomas and not in serrated lesions. Additional alterations in key genes
involved in other pathways of colorectal carcinogenesis were observed,
including <italic>KRAS</italic>, and <italic>TP53</italic> mutations. The 2
serrated lesions analysed showed a <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation only. All
samples were MMR proficient. No relation between growth and CIMP was
observed. Based on the molecular definition of having ≥2 CAEs, 9% of all
lesions were classified as being at high risk of progression. These lesions
included both grown and stable lesions.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Molecular alterations associated with adenoma to
carcinoma progression are more frequent in growing polyps. The observation
that high-risk lesions were amongst polyps that remained stable and grew,
but not amongst regressing polyps, is relevant for screening and
surveillance strategies.</p>

cancer (CRC) screening program has led to an increase in diagnosis of early
(T1) CRC. However, endoscopic diagnosis of T1 CRC is challenging. In this
study we examined how well T1 CRC is recognised in the Dutch CRC screening
program and the outcomes for therapy.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> All participants to the FIT based (faecal
immunochemical test) national CRC screening program from February 2014 to
August 2015 in the South Limburg region with 1 university hospital
(Maastricht University Medical Center) and 3 regional hospitals (Zuyderland
Medical Center, location Sittard-Geleen and location Heerlen, and Diagnostic
Centre Maastricht) were included. We collected clinical, endoscopic and
histopathology data at index colonoscopy and 3-year follow-up data. T1 CRCs
were treated by endoscopic resection or surgery (direct surgery or surgery
after an initial attempt at endoscopic resection). Pedunculated neoplasms
were resected by hot snaring, while sessile and flat neoplasms were resected
by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 2473 patients with 7657 colorectal neoplasms
were included. Ninety-seven T1 CRCs, 48 T2 CRCs, 62 T3 CRCs and 3 T4 CRCs
were found. At colonoscopy, 19 (19.6%) of the T1 CRCs were endoscopically
diagnosed as carcinoma, while 78 (80.4%) were initially diagnosed as adenoma
(n = 77) or hyperplastic polyp (n = 1).</p>
<p>Of the 19 endoscopically correctly diagnosed T1 CRCs, 17 (89.5%) were directly
surgically resected and 2 (10.5%) underwent surgery after an initial attempt
at endoscopic resection. There were no correctly diagnosed T1 CRCs that were
solely treated by endoscopic resection.</p>
<p>Of the 78 endoscopically not as such recognised T1 CRCs, 36 T1 CRCs (46.2%)
were resected endoscopically and had been followed up according to
post-resection surveillance guidelines. 2 lesions showed recurrence within 3
years. (Table 1).</p>
<p>34 endoscopically not as such recognised T1 CRCs (43.6%) underwent surgery
after an initial attempt at endoscopic resection. Histopathology of the
resection specimen showed no residual submucosal invasion in 16 cases
(47.1%).</p>
<p>The remaining 8 endoscopically not as such recognised T1 CRCs (10.3%) were
directly referred for surgery, because these lesions were too difficult to
resect endoscopically due to their size and location.</p>
<p>Logistic regression analysis showed that distal location (OR 3.83, 95% CI:
2.03–7.25), non-pedunculated shape (OR 2.03, 95% CI: 1.26–3.27) and
estimated CRC based on macroscopic appearance (OR 4.90, 95% CI: 2.11–11.35)
were independent risk factors for submucosal invasion.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Approximately 80% of the T1 CRCs in our national CRC
screening program are not recognised as early CRCs. Uncertainty about
diagnosis may lead to additional colonoscopies, delay in surgery and
surgical over-treatment. Improvement in the recognition and treatment of
early CRC is needed to further optimize the outcomes of our national CRC
screening program. <table-wrap id="table11-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table11-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table11"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Endoscopically not recognised T1 CRCs

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Rectal cancer patients with a clinical complete
response to neoadjuvant treatment can be treated with a watch-and-wait
approach. However, one of the concerns in a watch-and-wait approach is
pelvic failure in patients with local regrowth.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to evaluate the
management and oncological outcomes of patients with local regrowth in a
watch-and-wait programme. All patients with a local regrowth after an
initial watch-and-wait approach between January 2005 -March 2018 were
identified from 2 pooled prospectively collected cohorts of rectal cancer
patients with a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant treatment
treated with a watch-and-wait approach. Type and outcome of salvage
treatment were assessed. Long-term oncological outcome was assessed using
Kaplan-Meier estimates, calculated from the end of neoadjuvant
treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 81 out of 379 (21.3%) watch-and-wait patients developed a
local regrowth. Median overall follow-up time was 22 months (range 3-89).
Median time to local regrowth was 9 months (range 3-24). Salvage surgery was
performed in 78/81 (96%) patients. Reasons for not performing salvage
surgery were: refusing salvage treatment (n = 1), presence of distant
metastasis (n = 1) and death after diagnosis of regrowth (n = 1). Local
excision was performed in 26 (33%) patients with regrowth, of which 5 (6%)
patients had a completion TME. Low anterior resection was performed in 26
(33%) patients, an abdominoperineal resection in 24 (31%) patients, and type
of resection was unknown in 2 (3%) patients. The R0 rate after TME was
94.5%. 1 patient had a pelvic recurrence after salvage treatment, and
received palliative systemic treatment in the setting of widespread
metastatic disease. 3-year distant metastasis free survival was 88.7% and
3-year overall survival was 96.7%.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In patients with a regrowth after wait-and-wait
salvage surgery was performed in 96%. Pelvic failure was very rare.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Cholestasis is a common feature of different
cholangiopathies such as PSC and PBC. Cholestasis causes liver inflammation
and injury in epithelial cells, thereby inducing ductular reaction and
activation of non-parenchymal liver cells [i.e. kupffer cells (KC) and
hepatic stellate cells (HSC)] that ultimately results in biliary fibrosis.
Liver injury leads to alterations in the intestine epithelial barrier,
enabling the translocation of bacterial components to the liver via the
portal vein. In the liver, these bacterial components bind to toll-like
receptors (TLRs) expressed in KC and HSC promoting inflammation and
progression of the wound-healing response. The triggering receptor expressed
on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an anti-inflammatory receptor that inhibits
TLR-mediated signaling.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This study aims to evaluate the role of TREM2 in
cholestasis. With this purpose,<italic> TREM2</italic> expression was
analyzed in the liver of PBC and PSC patients and normal controls. Wild type
(WT) and <italic>Trem-2</italic> knock out (<italic>Trem2-/-)</italic> mice
were subjected to bile duct ligation (BDL), or sham, for 7 days. Thereafter,
sera were collected for the analysis of biochemical markers and livers were
obtained for further histological and gene expression analysis.
<italic>In vitro</italic>, KCs were isolated from WT and
<italic>Trem2-/-</italic> mice, treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
and cytokine and chemokine expression was assessed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold>
<italic>TREM2</italic> expression is upregulated in the liver of PBC and PSC
patients as compared to healthy controls; this receptor was also upregulated
in a BDL based model of murine cholestasis. After BDL,
<italic>Trem2-/-</italic> mice showed exacerbated liver injury with
increased hepatocyte necrosis and immune-cell infiltration compared to WT,
as assessed by H&amp;Estaining. This was accompanied by augmented expression
levels of cholangiocyte (<italic>Ck-7</italic> and <italic>Ck- 19</italic>)
and proliferation markers (<italic>Ki67</italic> and <italic>PCNA</italic>),
indicating that <italic>Trem-2-/-</italic> animals suffered exacerbated
ductular reaction. Likewise, <italic>Col1a1</italic> and
<italic>α-Sma</italic> mRNA levels revealed enhanced fibrogenesis in
<italic>Trem2-/-</italic> livers compared to WT after
BDL<italic>.</italic> In addition, the expression of proinflammatory
cytokines (<italic>Il-6</italic> and <italic>Tnf-α</italic>) and chemokines
(<italic>Mcp-1</italic> and <italic>Cxcl1</italic>) were upregulated
in these mice. The number of neutrophils infiltrating the liver was also
increased in <italic>Trem2-/-</italic> mice. LPS-treated
<italic>Trem2-/-</italic> KC displayed increased expression of
pro-inflammatory (<italic>Il-6, Il-1β</italic> and <italic>Tnf-α)</italic>
and chemokine (<italic>Cxcl1</italic>) markers, both at mRNA and protein
level, as compared to WT-derived KC.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold>
<italic>TREM2</italic> is overexpressed in the livers of PBC and PSC
patients and during experimental cholestasis in mice. This receptor
negatively regulates TLR4-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in
KC, thereby protecting the liver from cholestatic injury in mice.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Inflammatory macrophages play a critical role in
liver inflammation. Hepatocellular damage, instigated by viral infections,
alcohol abuse or metabolic syndrome, results in the recruitment and
activation of inflammatory cells mainly macrophages in the liver. The
inflammatory macrophages initiates the process of liver injury progressing
from liver fibrosis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore,
selective targeted inhibition of the inflammatory macrophages would be a
promising approach to attenuate liver inflammation or inflammatory liver
diseases. We identified CD64 receptor as a prospective target for
pro-inflammatory macrophages.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> In this study, we developed a novel delivery
system i.e. CD64-targeted lipid nanoparticles to achieve M1-specific uptake
and to selectively deliver anti-inflammatory drugs to inhibit M1
inflammatory macrophages thereby ameliorating liver inflammation.
Specificity of CD64 receptor was evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic> in
murine and human macrophages and <italic>in vivo</italic> in
CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced acute liver inflammation mouse model. Novel CD64
targeting peptide was designed and CD64 targeting peptide coated lipid
nanoparticles were synthesized, characterized and evaluated for M1-specific
uptake in murine and primary human macrophages using FACS.
Prednisolone-encapsulated CD64-targeted lipid nanoparticles were
synthesized, characterized and investigated for efficacy
<italic>in vitro</italic> in RAW macrophages, human THP1 monocytes,
primary bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs), primary human monocytes,
primary human Kupffer cells, and <italic>in vivo</italic> in acute
CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver injury mouse model.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Significant up-regulation of CD64 receptor was observed
in murine and human LPS- and IFNγ-differentiated M1 macrophages
<italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>in vivo</italic> in liver fibrosis
mouse models and in human fibrotic liver tissues. CD64-targeted lipid
nanoparticles showed favorable size, stability and drug entrapment
efficiency. Significantly, CD64-targeted nanoparticles showed M1-specific
uptake, while nanoparticles without targeting moiety/scrambled peptide
showed comparatively reduced internalization at different time points.
Furthermore, targeted nanoparticles demonstrated significantly reduced
uptake in M2 restorative macrophages. No significant uptake in other liver
cells was observed. Antibody blocking of CD64 receptor significantly
inhibited uptake in M1 macrophages strongly suggesting CD64-mediated uptake.
Prednisolone-encapsulated CD64-targeted nanoparticles showed significant
reduction in M1-specific inflammatory markers (i.e. CCL2, iNOS, IL-6, IL-1β
and TNFα) <italic>in vitro</italic> in RAW cells, human THP1 monocytes,
primary murine BMDMs, primary human monocytes and primary human kupffer
cells. <italic>In vivo</italic>, prednisolone-encapsulated targeted
nanoparticles demonstrated specific liver uptake, highly significant
attenuation in intra-hepatic inflammation and fibrotic parameters as
compared to free prednisolone and non-targeted liposomes.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study presents a novel strategy to selectively
target M1 Macrophage therefore holds great promise for diagnosis and
therapeutic treatment of liver fibrosis and inflammatory liver diseases.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Endoscopic papillectomy (EP) is increasingly being
used for ampullary adenoma removal. Treatment advances including pancreatic
stent placement and clipping for distal-side mucosal defects have increased
EP safety; however, it remains dangerous and challenging. The ideal power
output and mode of electrosurgical current used for EP have not yet been
established. Selection of the mode of current generally depends on the
endoscopist's preference. To perform the treatment more safely and reliably,
we performed this randomized, controlled trial to examine the mode of
electrosurgical current at the time of resection during EP.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> In this randomized, single-blind, prospective,
multicenter trial, patients with an ampullary adenoma who were undergoing EP
were recruited. EP was performed using a standardized algorithm<sup>1</sup>
and patients were randomized to undergo either EP with “Endocut” (EP-E)
using a combination of pure cut and soft coagulation, or EP with “Autocut”
(EP-A) using pure cut only. The primary outcomes were the incidence of
procedure-related bleeding and pancreatitis. Overall successful complete
resection, pathological findings, and another adverse event were secondary
endpoints.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 60 patients were enrolled during 2 years. Delayed
bleeding developed in 9 (15%) patients: 4 (13.3%) in the Ep-E group and 5
(16.7%) in the EP-A group (p = 1.00). Immediate bleeding occurred in 43% (13
of 30) of patients in the Ep-E group and 60.0% (18 of 30) in the EP-A group
(p = 0.20). Bleeding severity was mild in all cases. 8 patients (26.7%; 7
mild, 1 moderate) in the EP-E group had pancreatitis versus 9 (30.0%; 8
mild, 1 moderate) in the EP-A group. The primary outcome did not differ
between groups (p = 0.77). The rate of crush artifacts due to cauterizing
was higher in the EP-E than EP-A group (27% vs 3.3%, p = 0.03). There were
no procedure-related deaths.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Autocut mode has similar efficacy and safety to
Endocut mode for EP. Crush artifacts of resected specimens may occur
frequently in mucosal resection with Endocut mode (Clinical trial
registration number: UMIN000021382.)</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Endoscopic transmural drainage (TMD) with dedicated
lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) is routinely performed for the management
of symptomatic pancreatic fluid collections (PFCs) (pancreatic pseudocyst
[PP] or walled-off necrosis [WON]). There has been an increasing concern
regarding the timing of LAMS removal given recent reports on higher than
expected delayed adverse events at the time of clinical follow-up.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Evaluate clinical outcomes at the time of
follow-up imaging and endoscopy after LAMS insertion for symptomatic PFCs.
Multicenter retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with EUS-guided
LAMS placement for symptomatic PFC from January 2010 to May 2017. Main
outcomes included resolution of the PFC on follow-up imaging, and findings
on follow-up endoscopy after initial LAMS placement, including the rate of
adverse events (e.g. delayed bleeding, stent occlusion/migration, buried
stent syndrome).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 122 patients (mean age 51 years; 68% male)
underwent successful LAMSs insertion for 56 WONs (88%) and 55 PPs (95%). The
mean size of the PFC was 10.6 cm. Resolution of PFC on cross-sectional
imaging was significantly higher for PP (96%) vs. WON (62%) at a median of 4
weeks after LAMS insertion (p &lt; 0.001). More patients with PP (47; 82.5%)
than WON (40; 62.5%) underwent LAMS removal at the time of follow-up
endoscopy (p = 0.028). Stent occlusion was the most common adverse event
noted on follow-up endoscopy (29.5% in WON vs. 17.5% in PP; p = 0.2),
followed by stent migration (4.9% in WON vs. 8.6% PP; p = 0.5) and buried
stent syndrome (1.6% WON vs. 1.8% PP; p = 1.0). There were no cases of
delayed bleeding. There were no patients lost to follow-up. Size of PFC,
diameter of LAMS (10 mm vs 15 mm), additional stents through LAMS (yes vs.
no), debridement (yes vs. no) were not associated with the likelihood of
stent occlusion seen on follow-up endoscopy on multivariate analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> EUS-guided LAMS placement for PFC is safe; with
serious adverse events rarely encountered at the time of clinical follow-up
and stent removal. The rate of PFC resolution on imaging at a median of 4
weeks after LAMS insertion was significantly lower for WON vs. PP. Future
large prospective studies are needed to better define the course of PFCs and
optimize management protocol for patients with PFC treated with LAMS.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Although considered the most reliable and sensitive
method for tissue acquisition in patients with indeterminate bile duct
strictures (IBDS), there are scant data on methods to optimize the sampling
and specimen processing techniques at single operator cholangioscopy
(SOC).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim was to determine the optimal method of
specimen processing and to identify the number of biopsies required to
establish a definitive diagnosis in patients undergoing SOC-guided biopsies
of IBDS.</p>
<p>Patients with IBDS were randomized at ERCP to undergo specimen processing using
the onsite (touch imprint cytology [TIC]) or offsite (cell block) method. A
maximum of seven biopsies were performed in each cohort. In onsite cohort,
biopsies were performed until the diagnosis was established at TIC. In
offsite cohort, to determine the optimum number of biopsies required for
establishing diagnosis, three biopsies were placed in the first container
and four in the second. Main outcome measure was to compare the operating
characteristics of onsite versus offsite specimen processing techniques.
Secondary outcome measure was to determine the number of biopsies needed to
establish definitive diagnosis. Final diagnosis was established at surgery
or a minimum clinical follow-up of 12 months.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 62 patients were randomized: onsite = 32, offsite = 30.
Location of stricture was common bile duct (n = 19), common hepatic duct
(n = 16), hilum (n = 18) and intrahepatic ducts (n = 9). Final diagnosis was
benign disease in 35 and malignancy in 27. There was no significant
difference in diagnostic accuracy (93.8 vs. 90.0%, p = 0.67), sensitivity
(85.7 vs. 76.9%, p = 0.65), specificity (100 vs. 100%, p = 0.99), positive
predictive value (100 vs. 100%, p = 0.99) or negative predictive value (90.0
vs. 85.0%, p = 0.99) between the onsite versus offsite cohorts,
respectively. A diagnosis was established with a median of 1 biopsy (IQR
1-1.5) in the onsite cohort; false positives were encountered in 1 patient
and false negatives in 2. The diagnostic accuracy was identical (90.0%)
whether patients underwent 3 or 4 biopsies in the offsite cohort; false
negatives were encountered in 3 patients.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> For centers without onsite cytopathology support,
performing three SOC-guided biopsies of the biliary stricture and processing
the specimen offsite yields a diagnostic accuracy of 90%.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Intraoperative pancreatoscopy is a promising tool
that might guide surgical resection for suspect main duct involving IPMNs.
Data about its diagnostic yield and its clinical impact are lacking.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To assess the diagnostic yield and clinical
impact of intraoperative pancreatoscopy in patients operated for suspect
main pancreatic duct involving IPMNs in a retrospective, single center,
cohort study. Patients undergoing surgery for suspect main duct or mixed
type IPMNs (MPD ≥ 5 mm) underwent intraoperative pancreatoscopy and frozen
section analysis. In all patients undergone extended resection due to
suspect pathological pancreatoscopic findings, the final histological
specimen was compared with the intraoperative frozen section analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> From 2015 to 2017, 46 patients, 52.1% males, median age
67.3 years (45-82 years) underwent intraoperative pancreatoscopy. No
procedure related complications were observed. Intraoperative pancreatoscopy
changed the operating course in 30 patients (65.2%), leading to extended
resections in 20 (43.4%) and to parenchyma sparing procedures in 10 (21.7%).
Among patients who underwent extended resections due to pancreatoscopic
findings, 6 (30%) have shown skip lesions at final histology, that had not
been detected at intraoperative frozen section analysis. The application of
both intraoperative pancreatoscopy and frozen section analysis lead to 85.7%
sensitivity and 92.3% specificity for the detection of pathological tissue
in the remnant pancreas.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Intraoperative pancreatoscopy is a safe and feasible
procedure and might allow the detection of skip lesions during surgery for
suspect main duct involving IPMN. It has changed the operative management
strategy in 65.2% of patients, and in 30% of patients, it significantly
impacted the oncological radicality, allowing the detection of early lesions
suitable for radical curative surgery.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) is
associated with significant morbidity and prolonged hospital stays. [1,2]
Endosonography-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) is an alternative to PTBD
when endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) biliary
decompression has failed. EUS-BD transmurally, or facilitated transpapillary
drainage is possible via the intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts.</p>
<p>The aims of this study were to review the technical success and adverse events
with EUS-BD procedures performed at a tertiary care referral centre.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Data were prospectively recorded on EUS-BD
procedures performed at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust from 1st January
2016 to 26th April 2018. Procedures were performed by 2 experienced
endoscopists trained in interventional EUS and ERCP. Recorded variables were
technical success, adverse events, length of stay, 30-day re-admission rate
and all-cause mortality.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 30 patients (12 male) were included. Indications for
drainage were choledocholithiasis (n = 8) and malignant obstruction
(n = 22). Reasons for failed ERCP were obscured intradiverticular ampulla
(n = 8), Malignant biliary obstruction prohibiting wire guided access
(n = 11); duodenal stenosis with inaccessible papilla (n = 8; malignant,
n = 6; Crohn's, n = 1), and failed cannulation (tumour infiltration of
ampulla, n = 3). The route of attempted biliary drainage was
choledochoduodenostomy with lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) in 17,
EUS-guided rendezvous in 9, and hepaticogastrostomy in 4. Overall technical
success was achieved in 29 (97%), with 1 patient requiring PTBD. 29 cases
(97%) were achieved under conscious sedation with midazolam and fentanyl.
There were 2 significant bleeds; one from the sphincterotomy after a
rendezvous procedure and one from a hepaticogastrostomy. Both bleeds were
treated with a further endoscopic procedure. There was one instance of LAMS
maldeployment, salvaged with fully covered metal stent placement over
preserved wire access, and one TIA related to discontinuation of
anticoagulation. 8 cases were performed as elective, out-patient procedures.
Median length of stay post procedure was 6 days (range 2–80 days) for
inpatient cases. There were no re-admissions within 30 days. Of the 14
patients who have died, median survival post procedure was 78 days (range
18–275 days).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study adds to the existing literature supporting
EUS-BD as an effective and safe alternative to PTBD after failed ERCP, which
can be performed under conscious sedation, often in the outpatient setting.
Our technical success rate is comparable to published series. [3] Adverse
event rates compared favourably with accepted rates from PTBD. [1]
Experience and improved instruments should lead to further improved results.
Definitive prospective, randomised studies are needed to compare outcomes
for percutaneous versus EUS-guided drainage.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided ductal access
&amp; drainage (EUS-D) of biliary or pancreatic ducts offer an alternative
to percutaneous drainage after failed ERCP. The actual utility of EUS-D in
tertiary care centers is unknown. A complete assessment of EUS-D role
requires considering the full spectrum ERCP failure beyond failed
cannulation, all populations and indications.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Prospective cohort study including procedures
aiming at duct drainage performed June 2013-Nov 2015 in a tertiary care
center. Referral centers were stratified as primary (no ERCP), secondary
(&lt;200 ERCPs/year) or tertiary (&gt;200 ERCPs/year &amp; IR). EUS-D was
performed after failed ERCP, except in selected patients with altered
anatomy or submitted from tertiary centers, where it was performed directly.
Procedures were classified as follow-up or index if patients had prior
endoscopic duct access or not. Follow-up procedures included ERCP, EUS-D,
endoscopic transluminal cholangio-pancreatography (ETCP) through mature
transmural duct fistulas, and combined (ERCP with any antegrade approach).
Main outcomes: Rates of procedural ERCP failure, EUS-D and PTBD during the
study period.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 1625 patients underwent 2205 procedures (median 1
procedure/patient IQR: 1-2), 1274 index and 931 follow-up procedures. Index
procedures are summarized in table 1. Overall, EUS-D played a role in
116/1274 (9.1%) index procedures, including 39/67 (58.2%) patients with
surgically altered anatomy (SAA) and 77/1207 (6.4%) patients with native
anatomy. Most EUS-Ds performed were transmural drainages (88/116; 75.9%),
while EUS-guided rendez-vous was performed in 12/116 (10.3%), antegrade
EUS-D and combined procedures were performed each in 8/116 (6.9%). Direct
EUS-D was performed in 30/67 (44.8%) patients with SAA and 15/1207 (1.2%)
patients with native anatomy (including 9/25 gastric outlet obstructions and
5 patients from tertiary centers). EUS-guided drainage was performed after
failed cannulation in 53 cases, 45/1192 (3.8%) subjects with native anatomy
and 8/37 (21.6%) subjects with SAA. Finally, 7 (1.5%) patients with native
anatomy and one case of SAA (5%) underwent EUS-D despite successful
cannulation. Only 3/1274 index procedures (0.2%) required PTBD. EUS-D was
performed more frequently in subjects from tertiary referral centers, 25/69
(36.2%), compared to secondary, 36/228 (15.8%) or primary referral centers
55/977 (5.6%), p &lt; 0.001. EUS-D was performed in 17/87 (19.5%) benign and
67/317 (21.1%) malignant strictures. In the remaining indications, EUS-D was
performed in 32/870 (3.7%) procedures, p &lt; 0.001. 931 follow-up
procedures were performed in 352 patients. Overall, the proportion of ERCPs
among follow-up procedures was 85.7%, while ETCPs accounted for 7.4%, EUS-Ds
for 4% and combined procedures for 2.9%.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> EUS-D was performed overall in 6.9% of 2205 biliary
and pancreatic duct drainage procedures (7.6% referred from high ERCP volume
centers), whereas PTBD was required in 0.1%. The EUS-guided approach
integrated with ERCP could be an optimal option of drainage at index and
follow-up procedures. <table-wrap id="table12-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table12-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table12"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Overall (n = 1274)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Primary referral centers (n = 977)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Secondary referral centers (n = 228)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Tertiary referral centers (n = 69)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Male sex, n (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">641 (50.3%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">481 (49.2%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">122 (53.5%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">38 (55.1%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age, median (IQR)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">76.5 (64.5–83.5)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">76.5 (64.5–83.5)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">76.5 (64.5–84.5)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">70.5 (64.5–80.5)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Surgically altered anatomy, n (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">67 (5.3%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">35 (3.6%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">18 (7.9%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">14 (20.3%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Stones, n (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">476 (37.4%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">380 (38.9%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">74 (32.5%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">22 (31.9%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Malignant strictures, n (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">317 (24.9%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">194 (19.9%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">100 (43.9%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">23 (33.3%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Papillary stenosis, n (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">276 (21.7%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">243 (24.9%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">25 (11%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">8 (11.6%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Benign strictures, n (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">87 (6.8%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">66 (6.7%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12 (5.3%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">9 (13%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Other findings, n (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">117 (9.2%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">93 (9.5%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">17 (7.5%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">7 (10.1%)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> As one of the largest and most functionally complex
organs of the human body, the intestine is vulnerable to many disorders,
which are burdened by high social costs. Options to investigate these
functions with direct relevance to the human condition remain severely
limited when using conventional two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures and
animal models. The field of tissue engineering has extensively explored the
development of <italic>de novo</italic> tissue in order to restore diseased
phenotype. A major opportunity exists to exploit these natural scaffolds as
3-dimensional (3D) models for the <italic>in vitro</italic> study of
gastrointestinal diseases.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We here designed 2 decellularization protocols
to develop acellular 3D scaffolds from both tubular and small scale cube
human gut.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The resultant scaffolds showed preservation of
extracellular matrix (ECM) protein composition and 3D architecture.
Decellularized human gut scaffolds were reseeded with human epithelial
colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2) and primary human intestinal
myofibroblasts for up to 14 days. Engrafted cells showed excellent
viability, motility, proliferation and remodelling of ECM. In addition, mRNA
expression changed when comparing primary human intestinal myofibroblasts
cultured in 2D versus 3D scaffolds. Compared to fibroblasts cultured in 2D,
ACTA2 and COL1A1 mRNA expression were significantly downregulated whereas
TGF-β1 and MMP-3 expression were increased in 3D cultured myofibroblasts.
Moreover, a long-term treatment with TGFβ1 and PDGF-BB, to mimic a diseased
model, induced further gene expression in 3D whereas desensitization towards
the stimuli was observed in 2D cell cultures.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results present 2 innovative and effective
protocols for the decellularization of human gut. These human-derived
intestinal scaffolds may represent an innovative platform for disease
modelling, biomarker discovery and drug testing in gastrointestinal
fibro-carcinogenic disorders.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Cell bioengineering approaches not only hold great
promise to replace and regenerate dysfunctional tissue for improved life
quality of the diseased patient but may also provide more sophisticated
disease models. Engineering approaches to build human pancreatic tissue
resembling acinar, ductal and endocrine tissue have been hampered by the
complexity of the pancreas. Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) may provide
the appropriate bioengineering platform for developmental and biomedical
studies due to their capability to differentiate into every cell type in the
human body.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> PSCs typically yield heterogeneous population,
while certain disease models require homogenous populations. We previously
succeeded in generating virtually pure cultures of human pancreatic
progenitor cells followed by spontaneous differentiation in a 3D-culture
environment to allow acinar ductal commitment (Hohwieler, GUT, 2017). These
cultures are the basis of the current approach.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> We have implemented signals controlling embryonic lineage
fate bifurcations to efficiently yield the desired cell types through
exclusion of alternate fates. Specifically, we applied signaling molecules
and growth factors inducing either acinar or ductal cells, while inhibiting
the respective counter lineage with inhibitors. This approach yields
virtually pure pancreatic acinar or duct-like cells generated from human
PSCs resembling key features of adult human pancreatic counterparts as shown
in an established test battery. Thereby, we provide a coherent roadmap to
generate the 2 mature exocrine pancreatic cell types, acinar and ductal
cells. Finally, we have applied this novel tool box to dissect the cell type
of origin of pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The innovative model presented gives novel
opportunities to study developmental processes in the pancreas and bears the
unique chance to dissect the cell type of origin of pancreatic cancer</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Western
countries. The pathogensesis of CRC is a multi-step and multi-factorial
process. Disruption of the gut microbiota has been associated with
gastrointestinal diseases such as colorectal cancer [1]. The genus
<italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> is considered an important component
of the gastrointestinal microbiota. It has an important role in several
aspects of gastrointestinal homeostasis: immunologic, neuro-hormonal, and
metabolic. <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis subsp</italic>.
<italic>lactis</italic> is a well documented probiotic form of
<italic>Bifidobacterium.</italic> Mycosporin-like Amino Acids (MAAs)
are low molecular weight amino acids. MAAs are unique components of red
seaweeds and seaweed products are known as nutrional supplements in bowel
diseases. <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> does not produce MAAs.
If one could create a <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> producing
MAAs via genetic engineering, it should exert more potent immuno-stimulatory
properties and might become a more potent therapeutic agent in colorectal
cancer</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Abiosynthetic gene cluster for MAAs has been
demonstarted in Gram-positive bacteria [2]. Anabaena variabilis PCC 7937
(Cyanobacterium) is able to synthesize MAAs [3]. Genome studies identified a
combination of genes, YP_324358 (predicted DHQ synthase) and YP_324357
(O-methyl transferase), which were present only in <italic>A.
variabilis</italic> PCC 7937 and missing in other
<italic>Cyanobacteria</italic>.<italic> Anabaenasp</italic>. PCC 7120
has been induced to produce MAAs after genomic transfer (YP_324358 and
YP_324357 genes) from <italic>Anabaena variabilis</italic> PCC 7937 [3]. The
comparative genome analysis revealed that the <italic>Bifidobacterium
animalis subsp. Lactis.</italic> KLDS 2.0603 strain has most similar
whole genome sequence to the BB-12 strain [4]. It seems that
<italic>Cyanobacterium</italic> is the source of MAAs and we
hypothesize that the genes of <italic>Cyanobacterium</italic> involved in
MAAs biosynthesis could be transferred to the strain <italic>Bifidobacterium
animalis subsp. lactis</italic> BB-12 [5].</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Genetically modulated <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> can
modulate the immune system to further reduce chronic inflammation and
increase colonic mucosal stability. More decreased chronic inflammation and
increased mucosal stability might have the promoting role in colorectal
tumorigenesis at different stages including tumor initiation, promotion,
progression and metastasis [6]. Also experimental data reveal the important
role of NF-κB in colon tumor cells as well as in the surrounding “cancerous”
and reactive microenvironment [7]. It can be predicted that this combination
may be more effective in preventing colorectal cancer through NF-κB pathway.
Elevated TBARS levels are associated with colon cancer initiation and
progression and this combination can prevent cancer formation by lowering
TBARS levels [8].</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Significant progress has been made in recent years in
recognizing the importance of gut microbiota to colorectal cancer. Key
findings include the discovery of oncogenetic mechanisms that link the gut
microbiome to colorectal cancer, including reduced SCFA production, chronic
inflammation, alterated transcription factors and the immune response.
Creating <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> species producing MAAs viagenetic
engineering could result in a bacterium that is more potent in its effect on
human health. MAAs produced via genetic engineering can be used not only as
a probiotic, also as a pharmacological agent in CRC.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Perianal fistulas are regularly observed in patients
with Crohn's disease. Very few effective treatment options to accomplish
closure of the fistula track have been reported. The results from our
dose-finding study (allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell
(MSC) therapy for perianal fistulas in Crohn's disease<sup>1</sup>) showed
that local administration of MSCs in perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease is
safe and local injection of 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> MSCs and 3 × 10<sup>7</sup>
MSCs promoted fistula healing. In the current study we present the 4-year
efficacy and safety data of 2 of the 3 dose cohorts.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> All patients from cohort 1 (2 patients placebo;
5 patients 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> MSCs) and cohort 2 (2 patients placebo; 5
patients 3 × 10<sup>7</sup> MSCs) were invited for evaluation. The patients
treated in cohort 3 (2 patients placebo; 5 patients 9 × 10<sup>7</sup> MSCs)
will be seen in the next few months. Adverse events were registered and
fistula healing (e.g. no fistula discharge) was evaluated. All MSC-treated
patients were asked to undergo a pelvic MRI scan.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> From both groups of patients treated with MSCs, 4 out of
5 patients were available for long-term follow-up after 4 years. 1 of the
patients in cohort 1 died because of an adenocarcinoma of the
cecum<sup>1</sup> and one patient in cohort 2 was lost to follow-up.
With regards to therapy efficacy, fistula closure 4 years after MSC-therapy
was observed in 3 out of 4 patients treated with 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> MSCs and
in 4 out of 4 patients treated with 3 × 10<sup>7</sup> MSCs. The single
patient with an active fistula never experienced a closed fistula after
treatment with MSCs. All 4 placebo-treated patients in cohort 1 and 2, still
had draining fistulas at deblinding of the study and were offered post study
treatment with MSCs. 2 of these 4 patients were indeed treated, now 2 years
ago (both are not included in the current 4-year follow-up study). The 2
placebo-treated patients that denied the post study treatment still have
fistula drainage after 4 years follow-up. A total of 6 out of 8 evaluated
MSC treated patients were willing to undergo a pelvic MRI in the 4 year
follow-up visit. In all 6 patients, the original perianal fistula tract(s)
were still seen on MRI.</p>
<p>Several adverse events were reported both in placebo and in MSC-treated
patients. Most of the reported adverse events however are in line with the
nature of the underlying disease and immunosuppressive medication (e.g.,
exacerbation of Crohn's disease, pneumonia, uveitis). However, in the
long-term follow-up in 1 patient treated with 3 × 10<sup>7</sup> MSCs, a
superficial lesion in the distal rectum showed the presence of Epstein-Barr
virus-associated B-cell proliferative disease. This patient is currently
being treated with chemotherapy. Molecular and cellular analysis indicated
no relation with MSC-therapy.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> After 4 years, 8 of 10 patients treated with
1 × 10<sup>7</sup> or 3 × 10<sup>7</sup> MSCs could be evaluated and
88% of these patients reported the absence of draining fistulas, compared to
0% of the patients treated with placebo after 3 years of follow-up. 2
serious adverse events have been reported in the long-term follow-up, but
found not to be directly related to MSC therapy. The results of cohort 3
will become available in the summer of 2018. Our preliminary data show that
long-term fistula closure can be achieved with a single MSC treatment. More
long-term data are needed to further complete the safety profile of MSC
therapy for Crohn's fistulas.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Severe gastrointestinal symptoms are often
associated with markedly perturbed enteric motility, is a sign of underlying
enteric neuropathies. Current methods used to demonstrate enteric
neuropathies are mainly based on classic qualitative histopathological /
immunohistochemical evaluation. This standard approach, however, is hampered
by data interpretation, inter-observer variation and often insufficient
expertise of pathologists.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> In this study, the quantitative analysis of
enteric neurons in patients with severe dysmotility (SD) was performed by 3
independent and skilled pathologists and correlated with clinical
features.</p>
<p>Jejunal full-thickness biopsies were collected from 32 well characterized SD
patients (16-77 years; 22 F); and from n = 8 controls (47-73 years 4F). A
symptom questionnaire was fulfilled prior to surgery. Patients were
subdivided according to a previous qualitative histopathological evaluation:
n = 10 with an apparently normal (AN) neuro-muscular layer; n = 14 with
inflammatory (INF) changes throughout the neuromuscular layer; and n = 8
with degenerative neuro-muscular alterations (DEG). Myenteric (MP) and
submucosal (SP) neurons were stained using neuron specific enolase antibody
and neuronal cell bodies/ganglion were counted in at least 3 sections
independently by 3 pathologists. The mean numbers of neuronal cell
bodies/ganglion were analyzed by student's t-test and the correlation with
symptoms/signs via Spearman correlation test.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The final discordance among the 3 operators was only 20%.
MP and SP neuronal cell bodies were decreased in SD vs. controls
(p &lt; 0.001). MP and SP neurons also were decreased in AN, INF and DEG vs.
controls (p &lt; 0.0001 in MP and p &lt; 0.05 in SP). Furthermore specimens
with INF and DEG showed less MP (but not SP) neuronal cell bodies compared
to AN (p = 0.0224 and p = 0.0044). The reduction in MP and SP neuronal cell
bodies correlated with abdominal distension/pain, early satiety,
constipation and gastroparesis (p &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This methodological approach with high concordance
rate (80%), identified an overall 50% decreased of MP and SP neuronal cell
bodies implying a critical loss of the neuronal mass. The 50% neuronal
reduction correlated with a variety of symptoms / signs of SD patients. This
study indicates that quantitative neuronal abnormalities can be demonstrated
in patients with AN histopathology.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Dental pulp-derived mesenchymal stem cells (DP-MSCs)
as a source for regenerative medicine are now the subject of much clinical
attention. There are high expectations due to their safety, low tumorigenic
risk, and low ethical concerns. Tooth-derived MSCs are known to have a great
potential in their proliferation and differentiation capacities, even when
compared with bone-marrow-derived MSCs.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to examine the hepatic properties and
gene expression patterns of DP-MSC-induced hepatocytes and to investigate
the affinity of these cells to liver by using a nude rat model. Dental pulp
cells obtained from extracted teeth were cultured under the presence of
Activin A, FGF, and then insulin and HGF. Production of liver specific
proteins including albumin were investigated. 3 dimentional cultures were
perfused with medium containg 5mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and urea concentration in
the eluate was assayed. RT-PCR analysis for the genes that are responsible
for the experiments was performed. <sup>51</sup>Cr labelled cells (1.51x
10<sup>6</sup>) were infused via hepatic artery of nude rats and
autoradioluminographic images were taken (Dr. Shirai N, Nemoto Science, Co.,
Ltd, Tsukuba Institute).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Cells differentiated into polygonal hepatocyte-like
cells. Production of human albumin fibrinogen, alanine aminotransferase, and
hepaplastin in the culture medium were confirmed.</p>
<p>The result of conversion of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl to urea (Table 1). Mean and SD
values from the 5 hepatocyte cell lines that were independently established
were shown. <table-wrap id="table13-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table13-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table13"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="6" rowspan="1">Urea (mM)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">min</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">15</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Mean</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">

</p>
<p>The result of RT-PCR showed the expression of HNF4α (transcription factor
specific to liver) as well as genes including arginase 1, glutamine
synthetase and carbamoyl phosphate synthase that involved in urea
production.</p>
<p>Autoradioluminogram of the nude rat that were infused with
<sup>51</sup>Cr-labelled hepatocytes via hepatic artery showed positive cell
spots predominantly located in the liver at both 2 and 168 hrs after the
infusion.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Dental pulp MSC-induced hepatocytes had characteric
functions of mature hepatocytes including the production of liver specific
proteins and the presence of urea cycle. Because the cells repopulated in
livers of nude rat even 168 hrs after infusion, they are expected to be a
promising cellular resources of regenerative medicine for refractory liver
diseases.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is a
rare syndrome characterized by severe gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility,
causing a clinical picture mimicking mechanical obstruction in the absence
of any detectable organic abnormality. CIPO is often associated with
defective intestinal absorption / secretion resulting in body weight loss
and malnutrition. The microvasculature supplying the gut, may contribute to
the severe GI impairment in CIPO, but it has never been formally
investigated.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This study explored the enteric microvasculature
at tissue level in CIPO vs. mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal
encefalomyopathy (MNGIE), a genetic condition characterized by the absence
of thymidine phosphorylase (TP) expression that is a key regulator of
angiogenesis. MNGIE patients show a clinical picture dominated by
neurological and GI manifestations, the latter mimicking CIPO features in
most cases.</p>
<p>21 clinically and histopathologically characterized CIPO patients (9M; age
range: 16-75 yrs); 5 MNGIE patients (4M, 24-32 yrs) and 5 control patients
undergoing elective surgery for uncomplicated neoplastic diseases (CTR; 3M,
48-73 yrs) entered the study. In each enrolled patient 2 full thickness
biopsies were obtained and processed. The first biopsy was formalin fixed
and paraffin embedded. Sections were stained with orcein in order to
identify the elastic component associated to blood vessels supplying the
jejunal submucosa. The size and number of vessels/mm<sup>2</sup> were
quantified in each biopsy using Ima-J software. Submucosal vessels were
subdivided in 5 dimensional classes: &gt;500 mm and 499-301 mm (large);
300-101 mm (medium); 100-51 mm and &lt; 50 mm (small). The second biopsy was
processed to assess TP protein expression by western blot.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> CIPO and MNGIE patients show a trend to have more
vessels/mm<sup>2</sup> of submucosa (19.6 ± 4.0 and 27.5 ± 4.0
respectively), compared to CTR (11.3 ± 8.7; p = ns). The percentage of the
small vessels (&lt;50 mm) in CTR was very low ∼15.7%, whereas this
drastically increased in CIPO (41.7%; p = 0.014) and MNGIE (53.8%;
p = 0.0070). Conversely, the percentage of higher diameter vessels
(&gt;500 mm) in CTR is ∼9.0% and in CIPO and MNGIE patients decreased to
2.4% and 2.2% (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.0429), respectively. Medium vessels
(300-101 mm) represented the most common group (45%) of total CTR GI
vessels, whereas the subgroup vessel percentage decreased to 26.1% and 16.7%
in CIPO and MNGIE patients (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.0006), respectively.
Finally, the biochemical quantification of the angiogenic factor TP showed a
significant decrease in the jejunum of CIPO patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results indicate that, compared to CTR, MNGIE and
CIPO vasculature shows quantitative abnormalities, large and medium vessel
formation vs. small vessels. To the best of our knowledge this is the first
attempt to address abnormal vascularization in the small intestine of
genetic (MNGIE) and sporadic CIPO as a possible mechanism underlying gut
dysfunction.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Diabetes represents one of the major burdens in the
21st century with approx. 350 million people affected worldwide. Monogenic
diabetes such as juvenile onset insulin-dependent diabetes (JOD) or maturity
onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for approximately 1-2% of
diabetes cases and results from mutations that primarily reduce β-cell
function. The identification of the genetic basis of these diabetes forms
has translated into novel avenues of personalized medicine in the diabetes
field, but only few of these genes have been identified to date.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Based on published data, we hypothesize that a
proportion of the genetic contribution to common diabetes (T1D and T2D) may
be caused by rare monogenic variants/mutations missed by the current GWAS
strategies targeting common variant. The current project reports on such a
novel gene relevant as regulator of human pancreatic islet formation but
also as a novel juvenile onset diabetes (JOD) gene. For this purpose a
stage-specific genome wide profiling complemented with Chip-seq data in
differentiating human embryonic stem cells was used.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In our approach we could show that our gene binds and
activates Nkx2.2, Nkx6.1 and Pdx1, all belonging to the core suite of
isletogenesis transcription factors. Interestingly, this gene co-occupies
the enhancer and promoter regions of the latter genes together with Foxa2,
Pdx1 and Gata6. Finally, we engineered human embryonic stem cells with
previously identified mutations in JOD patients. Directed differentiation
studies of these cells shows an altered binding pattern of Nkx2.2, Nkx6.1
and Pdx1 finally leading to reduced amounts of monohormonal b-cells. This
reduced target gene binding results from a limited zinc affinity due to the
mutation that would be necessary as co-factor for gene binding.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The platform provided allows personalised drug-testing
and further sheds light on the mechanism how our JOD gene regulates
pancreatic development and leads to diabetes in case of certain mutations in
humans.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> While most intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are
rapidly renewed, small intestinal IECs residing at the +4 position remain
quiescent and thereby reside as long-lived IECs. Those long-lived small
intestinal IECs are committed to the secretory lineage, and function as
reserve stem cells upon massive loss of the genuine intestinal stem cell
(ISC) pool. However, the existence of a long-lived IEC counterpart in the
colon remains uncertain.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We recently reported a newly developed lineage
tracing system for secretory IECs by using the Atoh1-CrePGR;
ROSA26-LSL-tdTomato (Atoh1<sup>tdTomato</sup>) mice (Stem Cell Rep, 2018).
Using these mice, a pulse-chase experiment combining tdTomato-basedlineage
tracing of Atoh1<sup>+</sup>IECs and BrdU-based nuclear labeling of IECs was
conducted to elucidate the lifetime of those Atoh1<sup>+</sup>IECs in each
region of the colon. Also, region-specific gene expression was examined by
subjecting tdTomato<sup>+</sup>cells collected from the proximal or distal
colon. To investigate the IEC-intrinsic mechanism required for the
maintenance of long-lived Atoh1<sup>+</sup>IECs, we employed the organoid
3D-culture system. Cell cycle status of organoid IECs derived from different
parts of the colon was analyzed by flow cytometry or immunoblotting.
<italic>In vitro</italic> tolerance against 5-FU-induced DNA damage
was examined by real-time cell viability assay and immunohistochemistry.
Finally, we established an IEC-specific 5-FU-induced mucosal injury model to
investigate the reserve stem cell capacity of long-lived secretory IECs
<italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A distinct population of Atoh1<sup>+</sup>IECs in the
proximal colon exclusively retained their tdTomato labeling for over 20
days. These label-retaining Atoh1<sup>+</sup>IECs were generally
post-mitotic, as shown by the BrdU labeling experiment consisting of a
1-month labeling period and a subsequent 3-month chasing period. Microarray
analysis of Atoh1<sup>+</sup>IECs in the proximal colon revealed that they
exhibited enhanced expression of genes required to maintain cell quiescence.
Consistently, organoids established from the proximal colon showed increased
induction of cell cycle arrest and subsequent reduction of proliferation
activity, compared to their distal colon counterpart, by promoting
Atoh1<sup>+</sup>IEC differentiation through Notch inhibition. In
addition, secretory-lineage committed organoids derived from the proximal
colon showed enhanced resistance against 5-FU-induced DNA damage.
Atoh1<sup>+</sup>IECs of the proximal colon <italic>in vivo</italic>
were also highly resistant to 5-FU induced DNA damage, as confirmed by the
reducedexpression of cleaved caspase 3. By using
Atoh1<sup>tdTomato</sup>mice, we also conducted lineage tracing of
Atoh1<sup>+</sup>IECs in our 5-FU-induced mucosal injury model, and
found that Atoh1<sup>+</sup>IECs in the proximal colon did not only survive
but also re-acquired ISC properties to completely repair the damaged colonic
crypts.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A subpopulation of Atoh1<sup>+</sup>IECs in the
proximal colon reside as long-lived IECs that can serve as reserve ISCs in
response to DNA damage-induced mucosal injury.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The interferon-free antiviral therapies (Direct
Antiviral Agent, DAA) for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have allowed
treatment of a larger number of patients, including those with cirrhosis,
advanced age and comorbidity. It is known that the annual incidence of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in HCV infected patients increases with the
degree of fibrosis and is between 2 and 8%. Meta-analysis on interferon
antiviral therapy showed a risk reduction of HCC incidence of more than 70%,
irrespective of fibrosis stage, in patients who achieved an SVR. Data on DAA
therapy are more controversial. Despite previous studies reported a high
incidence of recurrent HCC in patients treated with DAA and in whom HCC was
previously treated, this data was not confirmed by subsequent large
multicentric studies. Some concerns on higher incidence of de-novo HCC after
DAA treatment have also been reported.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to evaluate which
variable are eventually associated to HCC occurrence or recurrence in
patients with HCV infection and advanced fibrosis. The study included 297
consecutive HCV patients (M 192/F 105; mean age 60.9 ± 12.1; 54.3% with
genotype 1 and 23.8 with genotype 3) with high fibrosis stage detected by
transient elastography (81 F3 and 216 F4 sec. Metavir); 16 of whom had a
past history of HCC. The following variables were assessed at baseline:
liver stiffness, platelets count, Baveno VI criteria for screening varices
(stiffness &gt; 20 Kpa and platelet counts &lt; 150,000 mm<sup>3</sup>),
alphafetoprotein, Child Pugh score, MELD score, presence or absence of
esophageal varices, presence or absence of diabetes. All patients received
an optimal DAA treatment from April 2015 to May 2017. All treated patients
were regularly followed up with a median of 20 months (7-33 months). Chi
square analysis for categorical variables was used.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> SVR-12 was achieved in 290 patients (97.6%). 23/297 (7.7
%) patients develop HCC de novo or recurrence during the period of
follow-up. Among the variable assessed at univariate analysis, liver
stiffness &gt; 20 Kpa and platelet counts &lt; 150,000 mm<sup>3</sup> and
the presence of diabetes were significantly associated with the
occurrence/recurrence of HCC after treatment (82.6% vs 17.4%, p = 0.023 and
15% vs 5.4%, p = 0.021, respectively).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Liver stiffness &gt; 20 Kpa and platelet
counts &lt; 150,000 mm<sup>3</sup> known as Baveno VI criteria for
screening varices, may be a useful tool to differentiate patients at greater
risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma after DAA treatment. This risk
seems to be further increased by the presence of diabetes. Further studies
with a larger population of patients will be needed to confirm this
observation.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may be
associated with sarcopenia, which share risk factors including chronic
inflammation, insulin resistance, vitamin D deficiency.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This study aimed to determine whether sarcopenia
is independently associated with NAFLD and advanced fibrosis in a nationally
representative sample of US adults. Cross-sectional data from 11,325
participants in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
were analyzed. NAFLD was diagnosed by ultrasonographic hepatic steatosis
without evidence of other liver diseases. The presence of advanced fibrosis
was determined by the NAFLD fibrosis score. Sarcopenia was defined as
skeletal muscle index that was measured by bioelectrical impedance
analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> NAFLD was more common in subjects with sarcopenia than in
those without (46.7% vs. 27.5%), which was consistent in analyses stratified
by gender, obesity status, and ethnicity. A univariate analysis showed that
sarcopenia was associated with NAFLD (odds ratio [OR], 2.31; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 2.01–2.64), which remained significant after adjustment for
age, gender, ethnicity, metabolic risk factors, and vitamin D deficiency (OR
1.24; 95% CI 1.03–1.48). This finding persisted even after adjustment for
c-reactive protein as a marker of chronic inflammation. Furthermore,
NAFLD-associated advanced fibrosis was more common in subjects with
sarcopenia than in those without (7.8% vs. 1.6%), which was also consistent
in analyses stratified by gender, obesity status, and ethnicity. Sarcopenia
was associated with NAFLD-associated advanced fibrosis independent of
metabolic risk factors, vitamin D deficiency, and chronic inflammation (OR,
1.79; 95% CI, 1.18–2.72). An additional sensitivity analysis was conducted
including insulin resistance in the model with similar results.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this nationally representative sample of American
adults, sarcopenia was independently associated with increased risk of NAFLD
and NAFLD-associated advanced fibrosis independent of well-defined risk
factors. Interventions to strengthen muscle mass may present an opportunity
to reduce the burden of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Increased intestinal permeability (IP) has now been
considered as a key factor in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Given the pivotal role
of Gut-Liver Axis in NAFLD pathogenesis, genes involved in the modulation of
IP are perfect candidates in exploring SNPs that might significantly impact
on fatty liver disease severity.</p>
<p>The aim of our study was to assess whether a single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNP) (rs2542151 G→T) of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Non-Receptor Type 2
(PTPN2), known to be involved in regulation of IP, is associated with
severity of NAFLD (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis -NASH- and/or liver
fibrosis) and type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We recruited a prospective consecutive cohort of
NAFLD cases and healthy controls among Caucasian patients from 2 Italian
tertiary care centers. PTPN2 genotype was assessed both in patients and
controls. Anthropometrics, clinical data and laboratory data were collected
for each patient. In the entire cohort the presence of fibrosis was
non-invasively assessed by FIB-4 score. A subgroup of patients underwent
liver biopsy. Unconditional multiple logistic regression models were used to
investigate the association between selected SNP (PTPN2 rs2542151 G→T),
comorbidities and histological severity of liver disease. Genotype
frequencies were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium both in control
and in patient cohort.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> We enrolled 566 cases (males 64.6%, mean age 45.3 ± 13.8
ys) and 377 controls (males 67.1%, mean age 41.3 ± 3.1 ys). PTPN2 genotype
distribution was not significantly different between NAFLD patients and
controls. Liver biopsy was available for 345 patients; 198/345 (57.4%) had
NASH. In the whole study population, considering a genetic dominant model,
the analysis showed that PTPN2 rs2542151 G→T is associated with an higher
FIB-4 score (OR 1.19 95% CI 1.01-1.41 p &lt; 0.05) and the presence of T2DM
(OR 1.82 95% CI 1.14-2.89 p &lt; 0.05) independently from age and sex. At a
subgroup analysis of patients who underwent liver biopsy, rs2542151 G→T of
PTPN2 was associated with the presence of severe steatosis (OR 2.19 95% CI
1.35-3.55 p &lt; 0.01), NASH (OR 1.81 95% CI 1.13-2.90 p &lt; 0.05) and
severe fibrosis (OR 2.55 95% CI 1.50-4.33 p &lt; 0.01) independently from
age and sex.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our study shows that rs2542151 G→T of PTPN2 is
associated with the severity of steatosis, fibrosis and NASH histologically
assessed. Furthermore, rs2542151 G→T of PTPN2 is associated with the
presence of T2DM in patients affected by NAFLD. These results still suggest
that in NAFLD patients an individual genetic susceptibility could play a key
pathogenetic role on IP impairment and consequently lead to an higher
histological severity of fatty liver disease and the presence T2DM.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun is a major
regulator of hepatocyte function in acute and chronic liver diseases.
However, its role during non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remains poorly
defined.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To address this issue in more detail, we
examined c-Jun expression in liver biopsies of patients diagnosed with
steatosis and NASH. The contribution of c-Jun to the pathogenesis of NASH
and subsequent fibrosis was further analyzed in hepatocyte-specific
(<italic>c-Jun</italic><sup>Δli</sup>) as well as inducible knock-out
mice lacking <italic>c-Jun</italic> in both, hepatocytes and non-parenchymal
liver cells (NPLCs; <italic>c-Jun</italic><sup>Δli*</sup>) fed a methionine-
and choline-deficient diet (MCDD).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Disease progression from steatosis to NASH and
NASH-related fibrosis strongly correlated with increased hepatocellular
c-Jun expression in patients, while c-Jun expression in NPLCs strongly
correlated with fibrosis stage. Analysis of MCDD-treated
<italic>c-Jun</italic><sup>Δli</sup> and control mice further revealed
that c-Jun expression in hepatocytes promotes hepatocyte survival and
protects against an exacerbated compensatory response called ductular
reaction (DR), expression of pro-fibrogenic genes and subsequent fibrosis.
The DR correlated with increased numbers of non-parenchymal Sox9 and
Osteopontin (Opn) co-expressing cells as well as expression of the Opn
receptor CD44, which have all been implicated in fibrogenesis.
Interestingly, c-Jun and Opn expression co-localized in both, human and
murine hepatocytes as well as NPLCs and we therefore wondered whether the
increased fibrosis observed in <italic>c-Jun</italic><sup>Δli</sup> mice
could be rescued by additional deletion of <italic>c-Jun</italic> in NPLCs
(<italic>Jun</italic><sup>Δli*</sup>). Indeed, NASH in
<italic>c-Jun</italic><sup>Δli*</sup> mice was characterized by
reduced liver damage, impaired Opn expression, impaired ductular reaction
and subsequently less fibrosis. A comparable phenotype was observed in
<italic>Opn<sup>−</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>−</sup></italic> mice,
indicating that the phenotype observed in
<italic>Jun</italic><sup>Δli*</sup> mice was indeed very likely
Opn-dependent.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These results suggest that c-Jun exerts cell-type
specific functions during NASH pathogenesis: c-Jun expression in hepatocytes
promotes hepatocyte survival and protects against the NASH-related DR and
fibrosis. In contrast, c-Jun expression in NPLCs rather promotes the DR and
subsequent fibrosis by regulating Opn expression.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Large scale, real-life data on the long-term course
of liver disease after HCV clearance obtained with DAAs are still scanty,
and the separate effects on hepatic and non-hepatic causes of death still
unclear.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Between March 2015 and December 2016, 5,166
patients (mean age 65.7 ± 11.5 years, 57.6% males) were included in the
prospective RESIST-HCV cohort (22 centres in Sicily) and started DAAs
treatment. 199 with previous HCC and 299 with previous OLT were excluded.
All patients were followed after antiviral therapy to register liver-related
and unrelated outcomes. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of survival
since starting DAAs. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the
predictors of liver-related and unrelated death.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In 200 patients viral outcome was not assessable (14
patients stopped therapy for adverse events, 27 died and 159 dropped out
during or after therapy). 4,468 patients were observed for a mean of 72 ± 32
weeks, 990 (22.1%) had diagnosis of chronic hepatitis (F3 in &gt;90%), 3095
(69.3%) had Child A cirrhosis and 383 (8.6%) had Child B cirrhosis. Overall,
4,234 patients (94.8%) achieved SVR while 234 patients (5.2%) were HCV-RNA
positive at the last control. 62 patients (1.4%) died during the
observation: 31 of them died for liver-related causes, 19 for cardiovascular
disease, 4 for cancer (not liver), 6 for other causes. No liver death
occurred among patients with chronic hepatitis. By multivariate Cox
regression analysis, the lack of SVR (hazard ratio [HR] 18.5; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 6.8–50.8; p &lt; 0.001) and albumin &lt; 3.5 g/dl (HR: 6.0;
95% CI, 2.3–15.7; p &lt; 0.001) were independently associated with an
increased incidence of liver related mortality in Child A patients. Lack of
SVR was the unique predictor of liver deaths also in Child B patients (HR
3.49, 95% CI: 1.09–11.22. p = 0.036). Independent predictors of
cardiovascular mortality were no SVR (HR: 10.6, 95% CI: 3.4–32.5;
p &lt; 0.001) and diabetes (HR: 4.1, 95% CI:1.3–13.00, p = 0.011).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this real-world setting using a variety of DAA
regimens SVR reduced overall mortality and risk of liver-related and
unrelated deaths at all stages of disease, but mostly in Child A cirrhosis.
Deaths linked to cardiovascular diseases are reduced after viral eradication
regardless of the stage of fibrosis. The biological basis and ultimate
lifetime impact should be assessed.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has become a
relevant topic with increasing attention and is a major threat for
immunosuppressed patients. Routine HEV testing of blood products has
recently been implemented in Great Britain and the Netherlands. The
relevance of blood-borne hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections for these
patients has been discussed controversially within the last months and still
requires further investigations.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We report (A) our experience of routine HEV
testing of blood products at a tertiary centre and (B) cases of
immunosuppressed patients developing transfusion associated chronic HEV
infection.</p>
<p>From 10/2016 onwards all blood donors at the University Hospital
Hamburg-Eppendorf were routinely screened for HEV RNA (pools of 24
donations) by PCR using the Roche cobas 6800® (LLOD single: 19 IU/ml, 24
pool: 456 IU/ml). HEV RNA positive blood products were not transfused. All
immunosuppressed patients with HEV infection (2011-2017) were
retrospectively studied. All blood products given to chronically
HEV-infected patients were retrospectively analyzed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> (A) 30/28981 donors (0.1%) were HEV-RNA-positive (median
viral load 960 IU/ml), whereas only 3 of them (10%) presented with elevated
serum transaminases at time of donation (ALT: 83 U/l, 192 U/l and 101 U/l).
Retrospective analysis of all HEV-positive donors revealed that 4 donors
with asymptomatic infection had been HEV-viraemic for up to 3 months.</p>
<p>(B) 37 immunosuppressed patients with HEV infection were identified whereas 11
of these (30%) developed chronic HEV infection. In 4/11 (36%) we were able
to identify an HEV positive blood donation as source of HEV transmission. 2
of these (50%) acquired chronic HEV infection by plasmapheresis/rituximab as
treatment for heart transplant rejection.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Overall incidence of HEV RNA in asymptomatic blood
donors in our cohort is higher than previously reported although most donors
had low viral load. However, blood products are a relevant source of
HEV-infection in particular for immunosuppressed individuals as 36% of
chronic HEV infections were transfusion associated. Therefore routine
screening of blood products should be implemented in standard of care.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold>
<italic>Helicobacter Pylori</italic> (HP) is one of the most successful
pathogens in the world, infecting nearly half of the world's population.
Importantly, HP is the biggest risk factor in the development of gastric
pathology including gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia (IM) and
dysplasia, all of which are considered precursor lesions to gastric cancer.
Autophagy is a cellular degradation mechanism, the physiological role of
which is to recycle cytoplasmic components. A specialized form of autophagy,
xenophagy, contributes to clearance of intracellular pathogens. Recently it
has been shown that HP may modulate autophagy through activation of the
endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) pathway. Our previous studies have
shown that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the autophagy gene
ATG16L1 (rs2241880) modulates intestinal ER stress. The aim of this study
was to investigate the role of this SNP in HP-mediated autophagy, ER stress
and intestinal metaplasia.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> DNA (n = 262) was isolated from EDTA blood of a
cohort of IM patients (PROREGAL Cohort), and the ATG16L1 SNP (rs2241880)
status was determined by PCR-RFLP. ER stress and autophagy experiments were
performed with gastric cancer cell line SK-GT-2 and immortalized gastric
cell line GES-1. ER stress was induced by tunicamycin. ER stress (GRP78) and
autophagy (LC3B) were detected by western blot analysis. HP (ATCC 43504) was
cultured on Columbia sheep blood agar and heat-killed before cell
stimulation. Antral biopsies were taken from 47 patients with IM of which 23
were actively infected with HP (determined by histology), these same
patients were biopsied 1 year after eradication. The other 24 biopsies were
from patients with IM who have never been infected with HP (determined by
serology). Immunohistochemistry was performed on these biopsies using GRP78
as a marker for ER stress. Positivity was scored using the Allredscore
taking the average of 4 high powered fields. Statistical significance was
determined by Students T-test.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The minor allele frequency (MAF) of rs2241880 (i.e. the A
allele, associated with lower intestinal ER stress levels) was calculated as
0.53 in the IM cohort, which was significantly higher than the reference
population (Rotterdam study, MAF 0.45, p = 0.0003). After stimulation with
HP, ER stress levels in gastric cell lines were reduced, whereas autophagy
was induced, as determined by LC3BI to LC3BII conversion. These differences
were not observed when cells were stimulated with non-pathogenic <italic>E.
coli</italic> bacteria. Biopsies from patients actively infected with
HP showed a reduced amount of GRP78 positivity as compared to uninfected
patients (p = 0.0171) and the same patients one year after eradication
(p = 0.0006).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These results show that HP upregulates the autophagy
pathway and thereby reduces ER-stress <italic>in vitro</italic> and
<italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore we show that a genetic variant
of the ATG16L1 gene which causes reduced levels of ER stress is more
prevalent in patients who have developed precancerous gastric lesions,
suggesting that promotion of autophagy and thereby reduction of ER stress
contributes to HP-induced changes of the gastric epithelium.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The discovery of <italic>H. pylori</italic>
superseded the long-held conception of the stomach being a sterile organ
that does not contain specific microbiota. Further research has shown that
<italic>H. pylori</italic> is not the only inhabitant of the stomach,
and other microorganisms can also colonize it. However, the influence of
<italic>H. pylori</italic> on other members of the gastric microbiota
remains poorly understood. Research on the bacterial biodiversity within the
stomach in <italic>H. pylori-</italic>positive versus <italic>H.
pylori-</italic>negative gastric mucosa is still controversial.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of the study was to characterize the
microbial composition of the gastric mucosa in <italic>H.
pylori</italic>-positive and <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative subjectsby
high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing. Ten gastric mucosal biopsy samples were
obtained for metagenomic analysis. According to the rapid urease test
combined with cytology results, 6 <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive and 4
<italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative samples were detected. Total RNA
from each sample was extracted, which then was used to synthesize cDNA. This
step was needed to detect only the living microorganisms of the stomach. DNA
libraries of V3-V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced on
the Illumina MiSeq platform. Trimmed reads were analyzed by the QIIME
software to characterize the composition of the microbiota.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There is a significant difference in bacterial
composition between <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive and <italic>H.
pylori</italic>-negative samples. In case of <italic>H.
pylori</italic>-positive patients, a significant dominance of the
<italic>Helicobacter</italic> genus was found, which in 2 out of 6
samples represented up to 99% of the total microbiota. In the absence of
<italic>H. pylori</italic> infection the predominance of the
<italic>Streptococcus</italic> genus was shown as well as the presence
of the <italic>Rothia, Prevotella, Gemellaceae, Fusobacterium</italic> and
<italic>Neisseria</italic> genera, which are usually recognized as the
normal gastric microbiota. It is interesting to note that <italic>H.
pylori</italic> occurs in small quantities even in cases when no
evidence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection is detected according to
the rapid urease test and cytology. It is worth noticing that in 4 samples
quite a large number of the <italic>Nesterenkonia</italic> and
<italic>Halomonas</italic> bacterial genera was found, which are
usually isolated from the environment, e.g. soil or marine samples, and have
not previously been detected in the human digestive tract. Thereby, their
role among the other gastric microbiota representatives needs further
study.</p>
<p>Shannon diversity index was calculated to analyze the biodiversity in all
studied samples. The biodiversity decreased in all <italic>H.
pylori</italic>-positive samples and was in average three times lower
than in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative patients.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Microbial composition differs significantly in
<italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive and <italic>H.
pylori</italic>-negative samples; <italic>H. pylori</italic> tends to
prevail in the stomach of <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients.
Bacterial biodiversity is shown to be decreasing in the presence of
<italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. This allows assuming that
<italic>H. pylori</italic> has some sort of inhibitory effect on other
inhabitants of the gastric microbiota.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The frequencies of lymph node metastasis (LNM) in
pT1a and T1b gastric cancer (GC) are 3% and 20%, respectively, namely the
majority of them has no LNM. The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network
proposed the concept of molecular phenotype classifying GC into 4 phenotypes
including Epstein-Barr virus-CIMP (EBV). The EBV group accounts for 8.8% and
is considered to have low prevalence of LNM. This study aimed to evaluate
clinicopathological features of submucosal invasive (pT1b) EBV GC without
lymphovascular invasion to choose lower risk group for LNM from pT1b GC, for
expanding indications of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> 411 pT1b GCs without lymphovascular invasion
that underwent surgical resection between 2005 and 2014 at the Cancer
Institute Hospital, were enrolled and retrospectively analyzed. Tissue
microarray was made and EBV-encoded RNA in situ hybridization was performed
for evaluation of EBV status. Patients' age, sex, tumor location,
macroscopic type, predominant histologic type, tumor diameter, depth of
submucosal invasion, the presence of ulceration and the presence of LNM were
compared between EBV group and non-EBV group.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The EBV group accounted for 11.4% (47/411). Compared to
the non-EBV group, the EBV group was more frequent in men (80.8% vs. 64.8%,
p = 0.032), located more frequent in upper third region (44.6% vs 18.1%,
p &lt; 0.0001), showed deeper submucosal invasion depth (mean 1200 µm vs 600
µm, p = 0.0001) and lower frequency of having ulceration (21.2% vs 42.8%,
p = 0.004). The predominant histologic type of “carcinoma with lymphoid
stroma” was more frequent in EBV group than in non-EBV group (44.6% vs 2.2%,
p &lt; 0.0001). No LNM was found in EBV group (0% vs 7.7%, p = 0.059).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> pT1b EBV GC without lymph vascular invasion showed low
prevalence of regional LNM regardless of tumor diameter and the extent of
submucosal invasion. This group will be a good candidate to be included
curative resection criteria of ESD.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> FGFR2 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 2) has been
reported to be associated with cellular growth and carcinogenesis. However,
the mechanism underlying its functional role in gastric cancer (GC) remains
elusive.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We seek to elucidate the function of FGFR2 and
comprehensively reveal its regulatory mechanisms during gastric
carcinogenesis. Firstly, we performed expression profiling based on 9 GC
cell lines to identify FGF18 and FGFR2 as the predominant members in the
FGF-FGFR cascade. The mRNA and protein expression of FGFR2 were examined by
qRT-PCR and Western blot. The correlation of FGFR2 expression with other
clinical parameters was investigated by immunohistochemistry on tissue
microarray. The biological role of FGFR2 was determined by MTT
proliferation, monolayer colony formation, cell invasion assays through
siRNA-mediated knockdown. Expression microarray was employed for the
downstream signalling analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Among the ligands and receptors of FGF family, FGF18 and
FGFR2 possessed the highest expression levels. Given that our previous work
has demonstrated the oncogenic role of FGF18 in GC, we continued to
delineate the expression and function of FGFR2 in gastric carcinogenesis.
According to TCGA dataset, FGFR2 owns the highest gene amplification rate
among the family, and copy number gain and amplification are associated with
mRNA upregulation (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). FGFR2 upregulation also
indicated poor survival among GC patients (overall survival, HR = 1.69,
<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, n = 641; first progression survival,
HR = 1.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, n = 641, multiple GEO cohorts).
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggested that FGFR2 abundance was
correlated with downregulation of PTEN (ES = 0.391, NES = 1.614,
<italic>p</italic> = 0.031, n = 300, NCBI/GEO/GSE62254). Multivariate
cox regression analysis revealed that FGFR2 upregulation predicted poor
prognosis independently. In vitro experiments demonstrated that siFGF18 led
to inhibition of cell growth (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), colony
formation (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and invasion
(<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), suggesting its oncogenic role during
gastric carcinogenesis. Moreover, MAPK signalling pathway was confirmed to
be the main downstream of FGFR2 in GC, which showed good concordant with the
driver oncogenic role of YAP1. Finally, we confirmed that FGFR2 exhibits
oncogenic role through activating YAP1, thus to stimulate MAPK
signalling.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> FGFR2 is abundantly expressed in GC tissues with gene
amplification and its overexpression indicates poor outcomes. FGFR2
overexpression in GC exhibited oncogenic property through YAP1 activation.
Our findings not only identified novel prognostic marker but also provided a
translational potential for clinical intervention.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Gastric carcinogenesis is a multistep <italic>H.
pylori</italic>-related process. Deregulation of microRNA (miRNA)
expression is one of the crucial contributing events in the progression from
chronic inflammation to preneoplastic conditions and gastric cancer. Several
miRNAs have been suggested as potential biomarkers for preneoplastic
conditions. However, nothing is known regarding the modulating effects of
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or proton pump inhibitors
(PPI) on the miRNA expression.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to investigate the
effect of aspirin, NSAIDs and PPI on the expression of mucosal inflammatory
miRNAs (miR-155 and miR-223) in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-infected and
non-infected subjects. The study was performed in 2 cohorts: 1)
interventional study in 20 healthy subjects with and without <italic>H.
pylori</italic> infection (each n = 10), and 2) in prospective
case-control observational study (n = 188). In interventional study,
low-dose aspirin (100mg) was given for 7 days and upper GI-endoscopy
including histological sample collection was accessed on the days 0, 1, 3,
7. 9 <italic>H. pylori</italic>-eradicated subjects repeated the protocol
following eradication treatment. Patients from the second cohort underwent
upper GI endoscopy including histological evaluation, <italic>H.
pylori</italic> testing (incl. cultivation), biopsy collection and
were systematically questioned about NSAIDs and PPI use. MiR-155 and miR-223
levels were assessed in total RNA extracted from the biopsies using TaqMan
Assay and subsequently correlated with COX-2 expression level.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> miR-155 and miR-223 expression is strongly dependent on
<italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in gastric mucosa and in
short-term view shows a trend for reversal following eradication treatment.
Daily low-dose aspirin as well as NSAIDs intake did not influence the
expression both in healthy subjects and in patients. However, regular PPI
intake was associated with a substantial reduction of miR-155 expression
predominantly in antral mucosa of patients with chronic gastritis
independently of the density of neutrophils and mononuclear cell
infiltrates. Furthermore, miR-155 expression was inversely associated with
COX-2 levels in subjects without<italic> H. pylori</italic> infection.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PPI but not NSAIDs or low-dose aspirin are associated
with changes in expression of mucosal inflammatory miRNAs in <italic>H.
pylori</italic>-dependent manner. Further studies are needed to
elucidate the potential clinical and prognostic benefit of PPI-related
miR-155 modification.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> In addition to <italic>H. pylori</italic> virulence,
host genetic backgrounds and other environmental factors also exhibit
complex interactions in gastric cancer development. <italic>Prostate stem
cell antigen</italic> (<italic>PSCA</italic>) single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) and its decreased expression are associated with gastric
cancer<sup>1</sup>. Gastric cancer develops through a multiple step
process known as the gastritis-gastric cancer sequence that is triggered by
<italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. Severe gastritis has been proven
to be a precursor condition<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Here, we investigated <italic>PSCA</italic> SNP
rs2294008 and <italic>PSCA</italic> expression of background gastric mucosa
in the gastritis-gastric cancer sequence and revealed host-bacterial
interactions in the disease pathogenesis.</p>
<p>A total of 280 subjects with <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and 28
<italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative controls who underwent EGD in
Toyoshima Endoscopy Clinic were enrolled in this study<sup>3</sup>.
Genotyping results of 509 <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative controls and
2,329 gastric cancer patients analyzed in our previous study<sup>4</sup>
were used in this study. DNA was purified from peripheral blood leukocytes.
mRNA was purified from remaining biopsy tissues from the gastric mucosa of
the incisura angularis. Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted. The
expression of the <italic>actin, beta</italic> gene was used for
normalization. To grade the neutrophil activity according to the updated
Sydney system, we used 2 biopsy specimens from the greater curvature of the
corpus and the antrum. We topographically classified the gastritis into 4
categories and defined no gastritis and antrum-predominant gastritis as mild
gastritis, and pangastritis and corpus-predominant gastritis as severe
gastritis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> As previously reported<sup>1</sup>, the T allele of
<italic>PSCA</italic> rs2294008 was significantly associated with
gastric cancer risk when we used<italic> H. pylori</italic>-negative
individuals as a control (p = 4.5 × 10<sup>−6</sup>; odds ratio (OR) = 1.37;
T vs C). SNP rs2294008 is associated with the progression of gastritis
(p = 9.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup>; OR = 3.88; TT+ TC vs CC,
p = 1.0 × 10<sup>−3</sup>; OR = 1.93; T vs C), but not with <italic>H.
pylori</italic> infection <italic>per se</italic> (p = 0.15;
OR = 1.14; T vs C) nor with the progression from active gastritis to gastric
cancer (p = 0.37; OR = 0.90; T vs C). The <italic>PSCA</italic> polymorphism
was significantly associated with the expression of <italic>PSCA</italic>
mRNA in the gastric mucosa of both <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative
controls and <italic>H. pylori</italic>-infected patients
(p = 1.8 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, 1.3 × 10<sup>−12</sup>, respectively).
<italic>H. pylori</italic> infection reduced <italic>PSCA</italic>
expression (p = 5.1 × 10<sup>−8</sup>) while eradication therapy increased
<italic>PSCA</italic> expression (p &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−11</sup>). In
addition, <italic>PSCA</italic> expression was decreased in the gastric
mucosa in severe gastritis compared with mild gastritis only among T allele
carriers (CC: p = 0.36, CT: 0.048, TT: 0.032).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our findings revealed the interaction between host
genetic variations (<italic>PSCA</italic> SNP) and bacterial infection that
contributes to gastritis progression after <italic>H. pylori</italic>
infection in the gastritis-gastric cancer sequence and its possible
implications for risk prediction and personalized disease prevention.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> PSC is a chronic inflammatory liver disease leading
to strictures intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts and finally to cholestasis
and secondary biliary cirrhosis. The etiopathogenesis of the PSC is unknown
[1]. PSC is a premalignant condition associated with high risk for
cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) [2,3]. Currently there are no sensitive surrogate
markers to predict the risk. High-throughput metabolomics analysis could
offer as a potential source to identify reliable markers.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to discover metabolomics profiles of
serum and biliary samples in 1) controls and PSC patients to find new
noninvasive markers for screening and diagnosing PSC, 2) PSC patients with
non-advanced disease compared to those with advanced disease to assess the
disease progression, 3) PSC patients with and without biliary dysplasia or
CCA to find more sensitive and specific markers to detect biliary dysplasia
and CCA.</p>
<p>The patients (N = 184) were recruited from the PSC registry of Clinic of
Gastroenterology; serum and bile samples are collected and stored at -80C.
Samples are extracted using acentonitrile, and analysed using WATERS Acquity
UPLC coupled to XEVO-TQ-S QQQ MS for targeted and quantitative metabolomics
analysis [4].</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Model-based analyses (Generalized Estimating Equations)
pinpointed 60 metabolites with significant p-values in bile and/or serum
after correction for type-I error. In both bile and serum samples,
2-Aminoisobutyric acid, Acetoacetic acid, Asymmetric dimethylarginine,
Citrulline, Dodecanoylcarnitine, Guanosine, Homocysteine, Inosinic acid,
L-Glutamic acid, L-Glutamine, L-Palmitoylcarnitine, L-Tyrosine, Sorbitol,
Stearoylcarnitine, Symmetric dimethylarginine, and Tetradecanoylcarnitine
showed consistent differences between healthy controls and PSC patients. All
of the above except Citrulline, Inosinic acid, L-Glutamine, and
Stearoylcarnitine also allowed differentiating between healthy controls and
all affected patients (non-advanced PSC, advanced PSC and dysplasia).</p>
<p>In bile samples alone, Adenine, Chenodeoxycholic acid, Creatine, Creatinine,
Cyclic GMP, Glycocholic acid, Hippuric acid, Hydroxykynurenine,
O-Phosphoethanolamine, S-Adenosyl-L-Homocysteine, and Taurocholic acid
Tetradecanoylcarnitine showed consistent differences between healthy
controls and PSC patients. With the exception of Chenodeoxycholic acid, and
Hippuric acid, all the above also allowed differentiating between healthy
controls and all affected persons. Importantly, Cytidine, L-Kynurenine,
L-Tyrosine, and Propionylcarnitine, also differentiated between PSC and
dysplasia patients.</p>
<p>In serum samples alone, 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid, Adenosine monophosphate,
Carnosine, D-Ribose-5-phosphate, Decanoylcarnitine, Dimethylglycine, Folic
acid, Gamma-Glutamylcysteine, L-Asparagine, L-Kynurenine, L-Tryptophan, NAD,
Neopterin, Niacinamide, Nicotinic acid, Normetanephrine, Spermidine, and
Xanthosine showed consistent differences between healthy controls and PSC
patients. With the exception of L-Tryptophan, and Spermidine, all the above
also allowed differentiating between healthy controls and all affected
persons.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study detected a consistent group of metabolites
characterizing PSC and dysplasia patients in both serum and bile samples. In
addition, fluid-specific candidate biomarkers were pinpointed. Of these,
alterations in bile L-Tyrosine, Cytidine, L-Kynurenine and
Propionylcarnitine characterized dysplasia in particular.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Several animal models are available to study the
cystic fibrosis (CF) related pancreatic damage although they have clear
limitations. Recently cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR)
knockout ferret and pig models have been generated.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to characterize the fluid and
bicarbonate secretion of CF and wild type (WT) ferret and pig pancreatic
ducts. Pancreatic ducts were isolated from newborn CF and WT ferret and pig
pancreas. In the ferret model the expression of CFTR was detected by
immunohistochemistry and resting pH, buffer capacity and
Cl<sup>−</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub> exchange activity were evaluated by
microfluorometry. Fluid secretion of ducts from CF and WT ferrets and pigs
were examined by videomicroscopy.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Our results indicate that the bicarbonate secretion is
significantly decreased in CF ferret ducts compared to WT. Videomicroscopy
revealed a significant increase in fluid secretion to
HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> and to 5µM forskolin and 100 µM IBMX
stimulation in both WT pig and WT ferret ducts. In CF ferret and pig ducts
increase of the fluid secretion were not detected during the stimulation
period.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Concerning our data, absence of the CFTR can lead to
decreased or completely abolished pancreatic ductal fluid secretion. Our
interesting results revealed the importance of studying pancreatic ductal
secretion of these new CF animal models more closely.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Intramyocellular lipid deposition associates with
mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance (IR), constituting a key
pathophysiological event in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Our
group has previously shown that human muscle IR correlates with NAFLD
severity, while microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs), including pro-apoptotic miR-34a,
are progressively regulated during disease progression, in both liver tissue
and plasma.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Now, we aimed to investigate the functional role
of miRNAs in the skeletal muscle of NAFLD patients modulating local
mitochondrial dysfunction and IR and, hence, contributing for development of
metabolic syndrome and NAFLD.</p>
<p>Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from morbid obese NAFLD patients
undergoing bariatric surgery. Muscle RNA was run in TaqMan™ array microRNA
cards. qPCR array data was analyzed using the HTqPCR package in
Bioconductor. C57BL6 mice were fed with different NAFLD-inducing diets,
including a fast food diet for 25 weeks; a choline-deficient, high-fat diet
for 14 weeks; and a choline-deficient amino acid-defined diet for 32 weeks.
C2C12 muscle cells were incubated with palmitic acid (PA) in the presence or
absence of A-769662, a AMPK specific activator, or upon miR-34a functional
modulation.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 47 muscle miRNAs were found to increase from simple
steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), including miR-34a
(p &lt; 0.05). Concomitantly, expression of SIRT1, a direct target of
miR-34a, and activation of AMPK, a metabolic SIRT1-mediator, were decreased
(p &lt; 0.05). Mitochondrial dynamics dysfunction was evidenced by decreased
Mfn2, a mitochondrial fusion protein and increased Drp1, a mitochondrial
fission protein (at least p &lt; 0.05). Activation of the miR-34a/SIRT1/AMPK
pathway, IR and mitochondrial dysfunction were also evident in the skeletal
muscle of all three NAFLD animal models, as well as in C2C12 cells incubated
with PA (at least p &lt; 0.05). Of note, <italic>in vitro</italic>, miR-34a
inhibition alleviated PA-repressed SIRT1/AMPK and mitochondrial deregulation
(at least p &lt; 0.05). Inversely, miR-34a overexpression mimicked
PA-induced dysfunction, an effect that was abolished when downstream AMPK
was activated (p &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Altogether, these results indicate that activation of
the miR-34a/SIRT1/AMPK pathway leads to impairments in IR and mitochondrial
dynamics in skeletal muscle of NAFLD patients. As the role of miR-34a in
global NAFLD pathogenesis keeps expanding, its further exploitation as a
putative therapeutic target is warranted.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> In recent years, the prevalence of nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing, and accordingly, the
proportion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with a background of
NAFLD has also been on the rise. Although it is important to identify
patients with HCC among NAFLD patients, a useful biomarker has not yet been
established, so its discovery is an urgent matter in the medical treatment
of NAFLD.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We previously reported that a high-fat diet
aggravated the pathophysiological findings in the liver in nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH) mouse models, and the hepatic expression of serine
palmitoyltransferase long-chain subunit 3 (SPTLC3) mRNA was suggested to be
potentially associated with NASH progression and carcinogenesis of the
liver. However, the role of SPTLC3 in NAFLD patients has not been fully
elucidated. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of SPTLC3 in
patients with NAFLD. We analyzed 61 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD,
including 19 with hepatocellular carcinoma, and 6 healthy volunteers (HVs)
and investigated the association between the serum SPTLC3 levels and the
clinical features. In addition, we compared the serum SPTLC3 levels before
and after the HCC treatment of 18 NAFLD patients with HCC. The serum SPTLC3
levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 38 of the NAFLD patients were female, and the median age
was 58 years. The median platelet count was 2.06×10<sup>5</sup>/µL, serum
ALT was 68.0 U/L, hyaluronic acid was 55.8 ng/dL, and SPTLC3 was
1.089 ng/mL. In the NAFLD patients with HCC (19 patients), the age, HbA1c,
hyaluronic acid, AFP, and DCP were higher than in those without HCC (42
patients). The serum SPTLC3 levels were significantly higher in the HCC
group than in the non-HCC group (6 HVs and 42 NAFLD patients) (HV vs. NAFLD
group vs. HCC group = 0.6 vs. 1.0 vs. 1.6 ng/mL, respectively; p &lt; 0.01).
In multivariate analysis, SPTLC3 was an independent factor related to
NAFLD-related hepatocarcinogesis. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
analysis revealed that the SPTLC3 cut-off value of 1.42 ng/mL discriminated
between HCC and non-HCC (area under the curve-ROC, 0.745) better than AFP
(0.665). SPTLC3 and DCP (0.777) had equivalent diagnostic capabilities. The
diagnostic rate of HCC using SPTLC3 (cut-off value: 1.42 ng/mL) was 63.2%.
The rate using the 3 parameters of AFP, DCP, and SPTLC3 (if one or more
exceeded the cut-off value, it was regarded as ‘positive’) was 84.2%. The
serum levels of SPTLC3 of patients who received HCC treatments were lower
than the levels before treatments (before: 1.412, after: 1.094,
p &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The overexpression of SPTLC3 in the liver was
associated with NASH-related hepatocarcinogenesis, and the levels of serum
SPTLC3 were high in the NAFLD patients with HCC. SPTLC3 might be a novel
biomarker for identifying patients with HCC among NAFLD patients in
conjunction with existing biomarkers.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition that
occurs in the pancreatic parenchyma and systemically affect other organs.
The first phase of the disease, usually during the first week, is caused
from the patient's systemic inflammatory response elicited by acinar cell
injury. During this phase, the severity of acute pancreatitis is directly
related to extrapancreatic organ failure, and several intercellular
signaling proteins such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) are involved.
Although there is currently no specific treatment for such condition, there
is evidence in animals model showing that the administration of
pentoxifylline, a competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is
able to reduces inflammation through TNF-a inhibition. However, its benefit
in acute pancreatitis in human remains unclear.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to study clinical outcomes of
pentoxifylline in APACHE II score in acute pancreatitis patients at 72 hours
after treatment and to study effects of pentoxifylline on inflammatory
markers level (i.e., CRP, ESR, procalcitonin, and Interleukin-6).</p>
<p>54 acute pancreatitis patients with associated risk factors of severe
pancreatitis development were evaluated for the severity of disease and
inflammatory markers prior to treatment. Participant were allocated within
48 hours of diagnosis into pentoxifylline or control arm. Severity of
disease as well as inflammatory markers were re-evaluated 72 h after
treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Pentoxifylline did not decrease severity of disease
determined by a reduction in APACHE II score and a percent reduction of
APACHE II compared with control group (0 vs. 2; p = 0.267 and 0% reduction
vs. 3% reduction; p = 0, respectively). Interestingly, the incidence of the
systemic inflammatory responds syndrome (SIRS) after 72 hours of treatment
was significantly lower than those without pentoxifylline. (7.7% vs. 29.2%;
p = 0.048). Noticeably in subgroup analysis, patients with acute alcoholic
pancreatitis who received pentoxifylline tended to have lower C-reactive
protein (CRP) levels than those who did not (-14.53 ± 61.40 vs
-3.72 ± 153.27; p = 0.82).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Pentoxifylline is an anti-TNF-a drug that seems to
reduce the inflammatory process of early phase of acute pancreatitis,
particularly in patients presented within 24 hours of onset. However, the
overall severity of the disease and clinical benefit was similar to control
group. A future study of pentoxifylline is needed to confirm its
efficacy.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Liver fibrosis is known to be a progressive
pathological process that results in the accumulation of excess
extracellular matrix proteins, ultimately leading to the development of
cirrhosis and, at times, hepatocellular carcinoma. Brg1, a core subunit of
the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, is known to modulate proliferation
in the liver and genes regulating extracellular matrix. Up to now, the role
of Brg1 in liver fibrosis remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the
effect of Brg1 on the progression of liver fibrosis.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> A hepatocyte-specific Brg1 knockout mice model
was being used by intercross of Brg1<sup>fl/fl</sup>and AlbCre single mutant
mice on a mixed genetic background. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>)
was injected in order to induce liver fibrosis for 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks.
Brg1 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. Liver fibrosis was
assessed by analysis of liver to body weight ratio, Sirius red staining,
alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) staining, and serum ALT ELISA.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Brg1 expression was significantly increased in fibrotic
liver tissue of wildtype mice compared to non-treated wildtype mice. Brg1
knockout mice showed reduced liver fibrosis after chronic liver injury
caused by CCl<sub>4</sub>injection. After 6 weeks of CCl4 treatment, the
liver to body weight ratio of Brg1 liver-specific knockout mice was
decreased compared to wildtype mice. In addition, less fibrosis was seen in
Brg1 knockout mice as shown by Sirius red staining and α-SMA staining.
Moreover, serum ALT levelswere lower in Brg1 liver-specific knockout mice
compared to wildtype mice.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We were able to show that hepatocyte-specific Brg1
deletion prevents liver fibrosis after CCl<sub>4</sub> injection in mice. We
conclude that Brg1 promotesprogression of hepatic fibrosis and may, thus, be
used as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with
liver fibrosis due to chronic injury.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Scissor-type knife was invented as a device for
endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for gastrointestinal neoplasms, which
enabled to perform ESD-like biopsy procedure. Therefore, ESD with
scissor-type knife (ESD-S) is considered as a technically easier procedure
than ESD with non-scissor-type knife (ESD-N). However, there are few reports
suggesting efficacy of ESD-S by comparing with ESD-N.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This study aimed to compare the technical
outcomes of ESD-S with those of ESD-N by propensity score matching analysis.
Superficial esophageal cancer treated by ESD between October 2015 and March
2018 at 3 hospitals were retrospectively reviewed. Lesions treated by ESD-S
(n = 48) and lesions treated by ESD-N (n = 114) were compared. Multivariate
analyses and propensity score matching were used to compensate for the
differences in age, gender, tumor size, tumor location, tumor depth, degree
of tumor circumference, operator level and traction method use, including
factors which were previously reported to affect the outcomes of ESD.
Primary outcome was the procedure time during ESD. Secondary outcomes were
the rate of en-block/complete resection and the rates of complication
(perforation/delayed bleeding) among 2 groups.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Before matching, non-experts had a higher rate of
selecting scissor-type knife than experts. Propensity score matching
analysis created 34 matched pairs. Adjusted comparisons between 2 groups
showed a significant difference in procedure time (median; 42.5min in ESD-C
vs 68.5min in ESD-O, p = 0.014). In addition, they also showed similar
treatment outcomes (en-block resection rate: 100% vs 97.1%, p = 1; complete
resection rate: 88.2% vs 82.4%, p = 0.734; perforation during ESD: 0% vs
5.9%, p = 0.493, delayed bleeding: 0% in both groups).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> ESD using scissor-type knife achieved shorter
procedure time than ESD using non-scissor-type knife without increase of
complication. Therefore, scissor-type knife may become one option as an
endo-knife of ESD for superficial esophageal cancer, especially for
non-experts.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Patients with a history of esophagectomy of
gastrectomy may have a higher risk of suffering from esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma (ESCC) due to tumor recurrence or reflux of alimentary juice.
Early ESCC can be found by endoscopy examination during the follow up in
part of patients. Esophagectomy has been viewed as the gold standard for
ESCC, however, a second alimentary tract reconstruction is extremely
difficult, which remains esophageal replacement with the colon the only
method. What makes matter worse is that this method is companied by high
risks of adverse events and leads to bad quality of life and survival rate.
ESD has been proved to be useful for early ESCC within indications, but
without analysis of this special group of people.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This is a single-center retrospective study.
Early ESCC patients receiving ESD between 01/01/2012 and 12/31/2016 in our
institution were analyzed. Patient and cancer characteristics, adverse
events were compared between the groups.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 49 patients (53 lesions) with early ESCC are included in
the study (Table 1). Most of the cases are male (93.9%) and 44 cases had a
history of gastrectomy, while 5 cases had a history of esophagectomy. Among
the 53 lesions, 32 (60.4%) lesions invaded epithelium or lamina propria
mucosa, and 9 (17.0%) lesions invaded muscularis mucosa, both of which are
viewed as indications of ESD for early ESCC. 12 (22.6%) lesions invaded
submucosa. En bloc resection and R0 resection were achieved in 50 (94.3%)
and 42 (79.2%) cases respectively. 4 (7.5%) cases had the lymphovascular
invasion. All patients who didn't get an R0 resection or had submucosal or
lymphovascular invasion didn't receive a second surgery, and some of them
accepted radiotherapy. No fatal perioperative adverse events were found. 1
patient had bilateral pleural effusion and treated by improvement of
respiratory function and antibiotics, without surgery or drainage. 3
patients suffered from stricture and were treated by endoscopic dilation to
relieve stenosis.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> ESD is found to be safe and technically feasible in
treating early ESCC in patients with a history of esophagectomy and
gastrectomy. More follow-up data are needed to be analyzed by further
studies to prove its efficacy in these groups of patients in a long run.

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Recurrence of achalasia symptoms after laparoscopic
Heller's myotomy (LHM) occurs in about 10% of patients due to inadequate
myotomy or fibrosis at the site of myotomy. Re-operation can be technically
challenging with increased perioperative complications and decreased
response. POEM is emerging as a less invasive treatment modality for
redo-myotomy in such patients. In this study, we compared the outcomes of
POEM in patients with and without prior LHM.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Achalasia patients who underwent POEM between
April 2014 and June 2017 with at least 2-month post-treatment follow-up were
included in the study. Patients were categorized as those with prior LHM and
those without prior LHM. Patient demographics, pre-treatment and 2 month
post-treatment timed barium oesophagram (TBE), high resolution oesophageal
manometry (HREM) and pH study parameters were compared between the 2 groups.
All POEM procedures were performed under general anesthesia and with
standard steps. Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test was used to
assess the significance of differences for categorical and continuous
variables respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 138 patients (No LHM = 109; prior LHM = 29)
were included and 53.8% were females. There was no significant difference in
the age, gender, prior treatments for achalasia (apart from LHM),
pre-treatment Eckardt's score, length of stay and complication rates in both
groups. The length of POEM procedure (110 [91-130] vs. 97.5 [79.5–110.5
minutes]; p = 0.023) and duration of symptomatic achalasia (5 [4-8] vs. 2
[1-6] years; p = 0.002) were significantly longer in the prior LHM group.
2-month post treatment Eckhardt's scores and HREM parameters improved
significantly in both groups. Post-treatment, patients with prior LHM showed
improvement in all the TBE parameters except for height of barium column at
1 minute, which did not change significantly. On comparing pre-treatment TBE
and HREM parameters, patients in the no LHM group had smaller width of
barium column at 5 minutes and significantly higher mean basal LES pressure
and lower LES integrated relaxation pressure (LES-IRP) as compared to the
prior LHM group. All TBE parameters (except, height at 1 cm) improved more
significantly in the no LHM group as compared to prior LHM group. Abnormal
pH study with increased DeMeester scores (&gt;14.72) was not significantly
different in the 2 groups.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> POEM takes longer procedure time but is safe and
effective for palliation of symptoms in patients with recurrent symptoms
after prior LHM. Clinical improvement reflected by a decrease in Eckhardt's
scores is similar in both groups, although objective improvement in TBE
parameters is more impressive in patients without prior LHM. <table-wrap id="table15-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table15-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table15"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Factors</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">No prior LHM group (n = 109)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Prior LHM group (n = 29)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">p-value</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Pre-POEM findings</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Eckardt's score</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">7 (5-9)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">7 (5-8.5)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.618</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Basal mean pressure on HREM (mmHg)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">45 (29.6–58.7)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">28.7 (14.1–46.5)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.004</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Lower esophageal sphincter Integrated

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Gastrointestinal submucosal tumors (SMTs) are most
commonly found in the stomach, as often as 1 in every 300 endoscopies. Small
tumors may be asymptomatic or only present with nonspecific gastrointestinal
symptoms, and are usually detected incidentally during upper
gastrointestinal endoscopy. Recently, as the widespread use of digestive
endoscopy and advances in endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), the diagnostic
rate of small SMTs, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) with
malignant potential, have been increasing. According to guidelines set by
the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), surgical referral should
be considered for non-metastatic GISTs &gt; 2 cm, whereas GISTs &lt; 2 cm
lacking high-risk features upon EUS can be followed up at 6-month to
12-month. However, distinguishing GISTs from other SMTs with similar
features by EUS is difficult. Furthermore, when the tumor grows, patients
may lose the opportunity to receive minimally invasive treatment. Therefore,
the minimally invasive resection approach for these small SMTs is
crucial.</p>
<p>Endoscopic resection (ER) including endoscopic submucosal excavation (ESE) and
endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR) which are derived from endoscopic
submucosal dissection (ESD) have been used to curatively resect gastric SMTs
in an en bloc fashion. When the tumor is in the fundus, the dissection is
more challenging and more time is comsumed for the resection because of the
retroflexion of the endoscope and specific anatomical features. Formerly,
large consecutive studies analyzing of small SMTs treated by ER technique,
particularly in gastric fundus, have not been reported. The aim of this
study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and feasibility of resection for
small gastric SMTs using the ESE and EFTR technique in a large series of
patients with long-term outcomes.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> In this study, we investigated the efficacy,
safety, and long-term outcomes of ER for small SMTs of the gastric fundus in
a large series of patients which were lacked before. 537 consecutive
patients with SMTs no more than 20mm of the gastric fundus originating from
the muscularis propria (MP) layer and treated with endoscopic submucosal
excavation (ESE) or endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR) were included
in this retrospective study at Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University from
January 2013 to September 2016. Clinicopathological, endoscopic and
follow-up data were collected and analyzed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The en bloc resection was achieved in 100% of patients
and complete resection was achieved for 530 (98.7%) lesions. Although total
rate of complications was 9.3%, serious adverse events only occurred in 3
(0.6%) patients including major pneumoperitoneum, major hydrothorax and
bleeding. Unlike lager tumor size and longer procedure time, endoscopist
experience had positive impact on decreasing complications. Based on
statistical analysis, tumors with greater size, near cardia and treated by
EFTR were the significant contributors to longer operative times. A median
follow-up of 32 months was available and all patients were free from local
recurrence or distant metastasis during the study period.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although technical difficulties present in gastric
fundus, ER is quite effective and safe for resection of small gastric SMTs
with high complete resection rate and rare serious adverse events.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Generally, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of
the duodenal tumor remains less prevalent due to anatomical characteristics
of the duodenum, technical difficulties of the procedure, and a high risk of
complications including delayed bleeding and perforations which may require
invasive surgical intervention [1]-[3].</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Herein, we describe a novel endoscopic
technique, endoscopic resection via antral submucosal tunneling (ERAST), for
the en bloc removal of tumors in the duodenal bulb. The specific steps of
the ERAST are as following. First, a mucosal incision is made using a Hybrid
knife (I-type, ERBE, Germany) approximately 5 cm proximal to the pylorus. A
submucosal tunnel extending to the duodenal tumor via the pylorus is then
created. To completely expose the tumor, submucosal tunneling following
entry into the duodenal bulb is continued until approximately 10 mm distal
to the tumor. Soft coagulation (80 W on effect 4, ERBE, Germany) is
recommended for hemostasis in the bulb to prevent potential perforation of
the thin duodenal muscularis propria. Next, a mucosal incision is made from
the inner side of the submucosal tunnel towards the duodenal lumen. The
circumferential mucosa of the tumor is then incised in a step-by-step manner
to remove the tumor en bloc. An endoclip tied with floss is used to extract
the tumor out from the duodenum. Finally, the mucosal defect in the bulb and
the mucosal incision in the antrum are closed using endoclips (Micro-Tech,
Nanjing, China) combined with endoloop (MAJ-254; Olympus). ERAST takes
advantage of submucosal tunneling to facilitate tumor resection and has the
potential to increase the safety of ESD and overcome difficulties in
resecting tumors that are anatomically challenging to access.</p>
<p>In this preliminary study, we evaluated the feasibility and safety of ERAST for
the treatment of lesions in the duodenal bulb.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> As shown in Table 1, 4 tumors, independent of their
location in the duodenal bulb, were successfully resected by ERAST and 100%
en bloc resection was achieved. No major bleeding or perforation occurred
during ERAST and no postoperative complications such as delayed bleeding,
perforation or hyperpyrexia was observed. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy carried
out 2 months after the ERAST revealed that the indicated wound had healed
completely without recurrence or biliary reflux and no patients reported any
discomfort. Leveraging the use of submucosal tunneling to facilitate
endoscopic resection, the endoscopic view enabled by ERAST facilitates
recognition of anatomic layers of the thin duodenal wall and hence,
demarcation of a clear and safe dissection line above the muscularis
propria. In addition, ERAST facilitates the dissection of tumors in
anatomically difficult locations, such as locations close to the pyloric
ring or superior angle; exploiting the submucosal tunnel, ERAST enables the
endoscope to approach the tumor easily with an adequate visual and operating
field.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In conclusion, our findings suggest that ERAST is
feasible and safe for the removal of lesions in the duodenal bulb,
particularly for those in challenging anatomical locations. However, further
prospective studies with a larger number of cases are warranted to
investigate the long-term recurrence rates and potential adverse effects.

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Large sessile and subpedunculated tumors are
frequently associated with severe submucosal fibrosis and retraction of the
muscularis (1,2). Therefore, endoscopic en bloc resection by endoscopic
submucosal dissection (ESD) is challenging. Despite the non-lifting sign,
endoscopic resection may be curative since the fibrosis is often benign
without tumor invasion and many of these tumors are limited to the mucosa.
The pocket-creation method (PCM) provides adequate submucosal traction
enabling ESD, even with submucosal fibrosis (3). We previously reported that
the PCM facilitates ESD of laterally spreading colorectal tumors,
non-granular type, frequently complicated by submucosal fibrosis (4).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study is to assess the utility
of PCM to overcome the difficulties caused by even severe fibrosis
associated with large sessile and subpedunculated tumors by comparing ESD
using the PCM with conventional methods (CM).</p>
<p>A total of 887 colorectal lesions were resected by ESD between April 2010 and
January 2017 at Jichi Medical University Hospital. Of 887 lesions, 109 were
sessile or subpedunculated tumors. Of the 109 lesions, 18 were smaller than
20mm in diameter and one non-neoplastic lesion was excluded. This is a
retrospective review of the remaining 90 colorectal large sessile and
subpedunculated tumors in 89 patients. The lesions are divided into PCM
(n = 40) and CM groups (n = 50). The primary outcome measure was en bloc
resection rate. Secondary outcome measures included (1) R0 resection (en
bloc resection with histologically negative resection margins); (2)
complications; (3) dissection time (min); (4) dissection speed
(mm<sup>2</sup>/min).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> PCM and CM achieved high en bloc resection rates. (PCM,
100% [40/ 40] vs. CM 94% [47/49] p=0.55). ESD of 2 lesions in the CM group
were stopped during the procedure, 1 after immediate perforation was
recognized, and 1 with a deeply invasive tumor converted to Endoscopic
Mucosal Resection. 1 lesion in the CM group was resected in a piecemeal
fashion. Tumor diameters (mm) were similar (median (range), PCM: 30.5
(20-57) vs. CM: 30.5 (20-90), p=0.77) There were no differences in R0
resection rates (88 %, 35/40 vs. 78%, 38/49, p = 1.0) or incidence of
adverse events (perforation and late delayed bleeding, 5%, 2/40 vs. 8%,
4/50, p = 0.69). When the PCM was used, the rate of pathologically negative
vertical margins (p = 0.04) was significantly greater, dissection time
(p = 0.04) shorter and dissection speed (p = 0.02) faster than when CM was
used.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> ESD using PCM increases the rate of negative vertical
margins with rapid dissection for the treatment of large colorectal sessile
and subpedunculated tumors.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) is an
immune-mediated condition that shares some immunological pathways with
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Few case reports have suggested an
overlap between EoE and IBD, although the epidemiology and implications of
this relationship are unknown.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The primary objectives of this study were to
estimate the prevalence of EoE in IBD and to identify potential adverse
outcomes of co-diagnosis. Given the rarity of EoE in IBD, we relied on a
very large population-based cohort to maximize the sensitivity and precision
of our analyses. All enrollees in the Truven Health MarketScan® Research
Database (2007–2016), the largest health claims database in the United
States, were included in this study. Patients with EoE, Crohn's disease
(CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) were identified based on recurrent
diagnoses using the International Classification of Diseases 9 and 10 codes.
Descriptive analyses were used to estimate the prevalence and characterize
the demographics of IBD patients with or without EoE. Cox proportional
hazards models were used to compare the longitudinal risk of major adverse
outcomes (corticosteroid use, initiation or change in biologic therapy,
hospitalization, and abdominal surgery) between IBD patients with and
without EoE. Regression models controlled for age, sex, and geographic
region.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 153,232,283 individuals with a median
follow-up time of 1.8 years (interquartile range 0.8 to 3.8). The overall
prevalence of EoE was 68.5 per 100,000 individuals. The prevalence rates of
EoE were significantly higher in patients with CD (508.0 per 100,000;
p &lt; 0.01) and UC (325.0 per 100,000; p &lt; 0.01) than in the general
population. CD and UC patients with EoE were predominantly male (CD: 61.8%
vs. 38.2%, p &lt; 0.01; UC: 56.6% vs. 43.4%, p &lt; 0.01) and younger (CD:
33.9 vs. 46.1 years, p &lt; 0.01; UC: 41.4 vs. 49.8 years, p &lt; 0.01) than
IBD patients without EoE. For CD patients, EoE was associated with an
increased risk of corticosteroid use (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.16; 95%
CI 1.07 to 1.25; p &lt; 0.01) and the initiation or change in biologic
therapy (aHR 1.21; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.39; p &lt; 0.01), but not
hospitalization or surgery. For UC patients, EoE was similarly associated
with an increased risk of corticosteroid use (aHR 1.26; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.40;
p &lt; 0.01) and the initiation or change in biologic therapy (aHR 1.50; 95%
CI 1.03 to 2.20; p = 0.04), but not hospitalization or abdominal
surgery.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this first population-based study of EoE in IBD,
EoE was found to be 5- to 8-fold more prevalent in IBD than the general
population. For IBD patients, EoE was significantly more common in younger
and male patients. EoE was associated with an increased need for
corticosteroids and biologic therapy, but not hospitalization or abdominal
surgery. Given the observed relationship between EoE and IBD, further
investigation into the epidemiology and pathophysiology of both diseases may
provide insight into shared mechanisms of pathogenesis.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The most frequent location of inflammatory lesions
in Crohn's disease (CD) are the terminal ileum and the colon. Disease
activity can lead to the developpement of stenosis and their management is
well known. Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) locations of CD are less frequent
thus the risk of stenosis is high. Few studies are avalaible to evaluate the
efficacy of medical, endoscopic and surgical treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of the present study was to evaluate
outcomes and treatments efficacy in Crohn's disease patients with severe
strictures of the upper gastrointestinal tract. We performed a retrospective
study in 18 centers from the GETAID, including all CD patients with an
nonpassable UGI stricture on upper endoscopy. The primary outcome was the
surgery-free survival from diagnosis of stricture. Short and long-term
clinical efficacy (defined as a relief of obstructive symptoms) and
endoscopic efficacy (defined as ability to pass the scope beyond the
stricture) of medical, endoscopic and surgical treatments and identification
of predictors of surgery were also evaluated.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> From 1988 to August 2017, 43 CD patients with a
non-passable stricture on upper endoscopy were included: 40% were female and
9% were active smokers. Median age at CD diagnosis was 22 (IQR: 17-30,5)
years with a median disease duration from CD to stricture diagnosis of 7
(IQR: 0-13,5) years. Location of stenosis was : 4 (9%) esophagus, 6 (14%)
stomach, 28 (65%) duodenum, 3 (7%) proximal jejunum, and 2 (5%) evolving
both pylorus and duodenum. 40 (93%) patients had primary stricture and 3
(7%) anastomotic stricture. The median follow-up from stricture diagnosis to
last news was 5 (IQR: 2-10.5) years. Surgical-free survival was 80%, 75%,
61% and 49% at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years respectively. Medical treatment of the
stricture consisted in: immunosupressant in 27 cases with as short-term
clinical efficacy in 13 (48%) cases and endoscopic efficacy in 3 (11%)
cases; anti-TNF therapy in 28 cases with a short-term clinical efficacy in
17 (60%) cases and endoscopic efficacy in 7 (25%). 39 endoscopic procedures
(30 dilations, 7 stents, 2 gastroenteroanastomosis) were realized with a
short-term clinical efficacy in 31 (79%) cases and endoscopic efficacy in 23
(59%) cases; a complication occurred in 4 (10%) cases (3 perforations and 1
hemorrhage). At the end of follow-up 21 (49%) patients were not operated. 25
surgeries were performed with a short-term clinical efficacy in 21 cases
(84%) for a median time of 61 (12-127) months. A complication occurred in 8
(32%) cases (2 perforations, 1 death, 1 pulmonary embolism, 1 anastomotic
stricture, 1 hematoma, 1 hemorrhage, 1 gastroenteroanastomosis dysfunction).
In multivariate analysis, the risk of surgery was greater for active smokers
(p = 0.04), and was lower for patients receiving anti-TNF treatment at
stricture diagnosis (p = 0.02).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Surgery is often necessary in CD patients with severe
stricture of the UGI, especially in active smokers. Medical and endoscopic
treatments are efficient in the majority of the patients at short term and
allow avoiding surgery in almost half the patients at long term.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Mesenchymal cell therapy is promising for the
treatment of perianal Crohn's fistulas refractory to conventional therapy.
Autologous adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (ADSVF) is recognized
as an easily accessible source of cells with angiogenic, anti-inflammatory,
immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. ADICROHN pilot study is based
on the innovative hypothesis that combined action of ADSVF associated with
trophic charasteristics of microfat graft could be beneficial to Crohn's
patients with refractory perianal fistulas</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This is a prospective, open, non-comparative,
single center, phase I-II clinical trial. Eligible patients were aged &gt;18
years and diagnosed with complex perianal ﬁstula associated with Crohn's
disease at least for 6 months with controlled luminal disease
(CDAI &lt; 220). Fistula(s) had to be refractory to conventional treatment.
10 patients were enrolled. Patients were first subjected to an exam under
anaesthesia with drainage by seton placement if indicated, followed at least
1 week later on the same day by adipose tissue extraction, ADSVF and
microfat preparation then injected into the fistula. Patients were monitored
at baseline and at 1, 2, 6, 12, 16 and 48 weeks after injection for safety
and efficacy analysis. Safety analysis included at every visits clinical
assessment of adverse events. Efﬁcacy analysis included at every visit
clinical evaluation of fistula closure, evaluation of disease activity by
PDAI/CDAI scores, and assesment of quality of life by SIBDQ. Fistula closure
was also evaluated via radiological assessment with MRI (confirmation of
absence of collections &gt;2 cm of the treated perianal fistula) at week 12
and 48. Complete response was defined as a complete cessation of suppuration
on week 12, despite not achieving a complete re-epithelization. Partial
response was defined as an evident decrease in suppuration. Remission was
defined as complete closure of all the external openings that were draining
at baseline despite gentle pressure, also confirmed via radiological
assessment with MRI (absence of collections &gt;2 cm of the treated perianal
fistula).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Since October 2015 and March 2017, 10 patients were
treated by this innovative local treatment (among 10 cc of microfat and
about 30 millions of ADSVF viable cells subsequently injected into the soft
tissue around the fistulas). No serious adverse events have been described.
The most frequent side effect (40% of patients) was moderate pain on
lipoaspiration site. No case of incontinence post treatment was described.
About efficacy, 70% of response was found at week 12 (50 % of partial
response and 20% of remission) and 80% of response at week 48 (40% of
remission, 20% of complete response, 20% of partial response). These results
were associated to significant reduction of severity of perianal disease
with a PDAI score that passed from 7.3 at baseline at 3.8 at week 12 and 3.4
at week 48 (p = 0.002) and significant improvement of quality of life score
(p = 0.038).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This first study evaluating co-local administration of
ADSVF in association with fat graft appears to be a simple, safe and
efficient surgical regenerative therapy for perianal Crohn's fistula
refractory to conventional therapy.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> In the absence of head-to-head trials, there is an
unmet need to better understand the effectiveness of different biologics in
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The Sicilian Network for Inflammatory
Bowel Disease (SN-IBD) is a group composed by 16 Sicilian centres which
continuously enter in a web based software all clinical data of IBD patients
treated with biologics.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Data of all incident Crohn's disease (CD)
patients treated with infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA) from January
2013 to April 2017 were extracted from the cohort of SN-IBD. Patients were
divided in biologic-naïve and non-naïve, and the 2 groups were analyzed
singularly. We used a 1-to-2 propensity score matching (2 ADA: 1 IFX)
accounting for the main baseline characteristics in naïve patients, and a
1-to-1 propensity score matching (1 ADA: 1 IFX) in non-naïve. Clinical
outcomes were evaluated at 12 weeks and 1 year.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 632 patients (735 total treatments) were included. After
propensity score matching, 321 naïve (ADA: 214; IFX: 107) and 81 non-naïve
patients (total treatments: 94; ADA: 47; IFX: 47) were analyzed. Among naïve
patients, a clinical benefit was achieved in 175/214 (81.8%) patients
treated with ADA and in 84/107 (77.6%) patients treated with IFX (adjusted
OR: 1.23, 95% CI 0.63–2-44, p = 0.547) at 12 weeks; after 1 year, a clinical
benefit was achieved in 148/214 (69.2%) patients treated with ADA and in
69/107 (64.5%) patients treated with IFX (adjusted OR: 1.10, 95% CI
0.61–1.96, p = 0.766). The rate of adverse events was significantly higher
in patient treated with IFX (incidence rate ratio = 1.71, p-value = 0.020).
Conditional logistic regression model showed that previous surgery (adjusted
OR: 0.19, 95% CI 0.04–0.78, p = 0.021), upper GI localization (adjusted OR:
0.20, 95% CI 0.05–0.84, p = 0.028), and fistulizing behavior (adjusted OR:
0.29, 95% CI 0.10–0.87, p = 0.027) were independent risk factors for a
reduced rate of clinical benefit at 1 year. Among non-naïve patients, a
clinical benefit was achieved in 29/47 (61.7%) patients treated with ADA and
in 32/47 (68.1%) patients treated with IFX (adjusted OR: 0.72, 95% CI
0.21–2.44, p = 0.600) at 12 weeks; after 1 year, a clinical benefit was
achieved in 23/47 (48.9%) patients treated with ADA and in 19/47 (40.4%)
patients treated with IFX (adjusted OR: 1.23, 95% CI 0.54–2.86, p = 0.620).
The rate of adverse events was significantly higher in patient treated with
IFX (incidence rate ratio = 2.57, p = 0.009). No prognostic factor of
clinical benefit was found among non-naïve patients.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In the first study comparing the clinical
effectiveness of ADA and IFX in moderate to severe CD patients via
propensity score, there was no significant difference between the 2 drugs,
neither in naïve nor in non-naïve patients.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The goal of treatment in ulcerative colitis (UC) is
to induce clinical response and maintain steroid-free disease remission in
the long term. The aim of the present study is to examine how
moderate-to-severe UC is currently managed in real-world clinical practice
across select Western European countries.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Data from the 2017 Adelphi Inflammatory Bowel
Disease Specific Programmes (IBD-DSP) were used. The IBD-DSP is a database
of patient chart information abstracted by selected gastroenterologists
across the European Union Five ([EU5]; i.e., France, Germany, Italy, Spain,
and the United Kingdom [UK]). Eligible gastroenterologists who agreed to
participate were asked to complete patient record forms for the next 7
consecutive eligible adult patients with UC. Only charts from patients with
moderate-to-severe UC were included in the analysis (defined as those with
documented administration of either an immunomodulator [IM] or a biologic).
Treatment usage by line of therapy (defined as the sequential order of
treatments after diagnosis) and the prevalence of dose escalation was
reported using descriptive statistics (mainly percentages).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of N = 1191 patient charts were included (France:
N = 331, Germany: N = 271, Italy: N = 207, Spain: N = 250, UK: N = 132;
56.5% male; mean age = 39.6 [SD = 13.7]). Patients had been diagnosed for a
mean of 4.9 years (SD = 5.9). For those with complete treatment history
(N = 1060), 47.1% used 5-ASAs and/or steroids as their first-line therapy.
The remaining 52.9% used either an IM or biologic as first-line therapy (IM
without biologic = 27.4%; infliximab [IFX] = 13.3%; adalimumab [ADA] = 9.8%,
golimumab [GOL] = 1.3%, vedolizumab [VDZ] = 0.8%). Use of IM therapy
(without a biologic) was higher in subsequent lines: second-line = 41.5%,
third-line = 38.3%. Similarly, the use of a biologic also increased in
second-line (IFX = 19.0%, ADA = 10.4%, GOL = 3.6%, VDZ = 2.4%) and then
again in third-line (IFX = 19.9%, ADA = 14.4%, GOL = 4.0%, VDZ = 6.6%). The
percentage of patients treated with biologic therapy who were also using a
concomitant IM increased over time from first-line to third-line:
IFX = 19.9% to 32.0%, ADA = 12.5% to 25.9%, GOL = 7.1% to 20.0%, VDZ = 11.1%
to 20.0%. Among patients currently using a biologic therapy, dose escalation
during maintenance therapy (i.e., a higher than indicated dose or greater
than indicated dosing frequency) was observed as follows: IFX = 39.1%,
ADA = 36.1%, VDZ = 30.9%, GOL = 20.8%.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Among patients with UC in the EU5 who go on to use an
IM or biologic treatment, many patients use these treatments as their first
therapy after diagnosis. Combination therapy with both IM and biologic
therapy is also common and increases over the course of the disease. For
patients who use biologic therapy, between 20-40% of patients use a higher
than indicated dose and/or frequency. These findings suggest a number of
patients experience suboptimal levels of disease control.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Ustekinumab is a fully human IgG1k monoclonal
antibody targeting the p40 subunit of interleukins-12 and 23 thus inhibiting
their receptors on T cells and natural killer cells. Ustekinumab is
effective to induce clinical response and remission in patients with
moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) that is refractory to
either TNF antagonists or conventional therapy in phase III trials. The aim
of the study was to describe the real-life experience with Ustekinumab
intravenous induction in anti-TNF and/or vedolizumab resistant or intolerant
CD patients.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We perfomed a retrospective observational
open-label study on CD patients receiving ustekinumab intravenous induction
between August 2014 and November 2017 in 2 gastroenterology departments at
University Hospital Nord (Marseille) and University Hospital Saint-Eloi
(Montpellier). The primary outcome was clinical response at 8 weeks, defined
by reduction in Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) of ≥3 points.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 100 patients was included. 99 patients (99%)
were resistant or intolerant to ≥1 anti-TNF and 54 (54%) to Vedolizumab.</p>
<p>Ustekinumab was given to 84 (84%) patients for luminal disease activity, to 8
(8%) for intolerance to a previous treatment, to 7 (7%) for absence of
endoscopic or imaging remission and to 1 patient (1%) for reduce the risk of
post operative recidive.</p>
<p>Clinical response at week 8 was achieved in 74 patients (74%) and clinical
remission in 50 patients (50%). 79 patients were still under treatment at 6
month. No factors predicted the initial clinical response with ustekinumab
at week 8.</p>
<p>An adverse event developed in 11 patients (11%) during the induction phase and
1 severe adverse event resulting in death was reported 5 months after
treatment initiation.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Ustekinumab intravenous induction is effective in
almost three-quarters of patients with CD refractory to at least 1 anti-TNF
agent and/or vedolizumab therapy. Moreover, it seems to be sustainable over
time and safe.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Barrett's Endoscopic Therapy (BET) for the
management of patients with BE neoplasia has significantly developed in the
past decade. Despite recent national and international guidelines, UK and
European registries and national audits demonstrate variation in the
management of these patients resulting in variable outcomes. Healthcare
systems and processes need to be aligned to ensure a streamlined, efficient
and high quality service provision to all patients. Quality Indicators (QI)
for BET in the UK are lacking.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The <bold>aim</bold> of this project was to
develop expert physician-led QBET to define best practice in patients with
BE neoplasia.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> The RAND UCLA Appropriateness Method (RAM) was utilised to
combine the best available scientific evidence with the collective judgment
of experts to develop QBET in 4 sub-groups: Pre-endoscopy, intra-procedural
(resection), intra-procedural (ablation) and post endoscopy. National and
International experts including gastroenterologist (n = 20), surgeons
(n = 2), BE pathologist (n = 1), clinical nurse specialist (n = 1) and
patient representative (n = 1) participated in a 3-round process (Round 0, 1
and 2) to develop 18 QIs in BET that fulfilled the definition of
appropriateness using 4 statistical methods: 1) mean absolute deviation from
median MAD-M, 2) BIOMED Concerted Action on Appropriateness definition, 3)
p-value and 4) inter-percentile range adjusted for symmetry (IPRAS).
Performance threshold was also set for each of the QIs, indicating the
target to be achieved by each service provider.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 17 experts participated in Round 1 and 20 in
Round 2. Of the 24 proposed QIs in round 1, 20 were ranked as appropriate
(put through to round 2) and 4 as uncertain (were discarded). At the end of
round 2, a final list of 18 QIs were scored appropriate and are listed in

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Barrett's oesophagus (BO) is a known precursor
lesion to oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). All clinical guidelines
recommend surveillance and/or treatment of BO patients depending on the
severity of the precursor lesion. However, the optimal management strategy
for non-dysplastic BO (NDBO) and low-grade dysplasia (LGD) patients remains
controversial. Prior modeling studies have reported conflicting results on
the management of these patients.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to identify the optimal management
strategy for BO patients through a comparative modeling analysis. We used 3
independently developed population-based models from the NIH Cancer
Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET). A cohort of
60-year-old US men with BO was simulated and followed until death without
surveillance or treatment (natural history). Then, we implemented 78 unique
BO management strategies. The strategies varied in (a) LGD management: with
or without confirmation of LGD by a repeat endoscopy at 2 months, and
surveillance with different intervals or endoscopic treatment; and (b) NDBO
management: no surveillance or surveillance with different intervals. In all
strategies, patients with high-grade dysplasia received endoscopic
treatment. An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, assuming a
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year
(QALY), determined the optimal strategy using the average results of the 3
models. To assess the robustness of our findings, we also analysed the
separate results of each model and simulated a cohort of US women with
BO.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The models' average OAC incidence in the natural history
was 110 (93-120) and the average cost was $5.7 million ($4.5–6.7 million)
per 1000 BO patients. Surveillance and/or endoscopic treatment of BO
patients prevented 23-77% of OAC cases, but they increased costs to
$6.3–17.0 million. Considering cost-effectiveness, all strategies with only
surveillance for LGD patients were dominated by those with LGD treatment.
Repeated endoscopy to confirm LGD was more cost-effective than strategies
without confirmatory endoscopy. The optimal strategy was treatment after
confirmation by repeat endoscopy for LGD patients and surveillance every 3
years for NDBO patients (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: $64,322/
QALY). The separate results of each model and the female cohort were
consistent with the average results of the male cohort on management of LGD,
but suggested intervals for surveillance of NDBO patients varied (2-5 years)
(Table 1).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our analyses show that endoscopic treatment of
patients with LGD is cost-effective, but only if these patients undergo
repeat endoscopy to confirm LGD before treatment. The optimal strategy for
NDBO patients is surveillance using 3-year intervals in men and 5-year in
women.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Barrett's surveillance traditionally requires
mapping biopsies to identify neoplasia. Acetic acid (AA) allows only
targeted biopsies, potentially reducing the number of biopsies required.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To compare neoplasia detection with AA targeted
biopsies and protocol guided non-targeted biopsies during Barrett's
surveillance. This was a multicentre randomized crossover feasibility study
in UK secondary care. Patients under surveillance for Barrett's metaplasia
(&gt;2cm) with no history of dysplasia or cancer were recruited.
Endoscopists were trained in the acetic acid technique through a structured
training programme developed for the study. All patients underwent 1
gastroscopies 8 weeks apart, 1 with AA guided biopsy of abnormal areas only
(Portsmouth Protocol) and 1 with non-targeted mapping biopsies (Seattle
Protocol). Neoplasia yield (low grade dysplasia LGD, high grade dysplasia
(HGD) and cancer) from each strategy was evaluated and the number of
biopsies recorded.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 200 patients recruited from 6 centres. Mean age 66 yrs.
145 were male. Mean length C4M6. 174 patients completing both procedures.
The prevalence of LGD, HGD and cancer was 9/192 (4.7%). All HGD and cancer
was found with both protocols and confirmed with definitive treatment. 1 LGD
was found with both Portsmouth and Seattle protocol. 1 LGD was found with
Portsmouth protocol not found with Seattle. 3 LGD were found with Seattle
protocol not found with Portsmouth. This difference was not significant, and
on follow-up gastroscopy no neoplastic changes were found in any of the LGD
cases. 2139 biopsies were taken using Seattle protocol at a cost of £125,987
(357 biopsies per neoplasia, £18,023). 226 biopsies with Portsmouth Protocol
at a cost of £13,311 (57 biopsies per neoplasia, £3,357) a 6-fold
difference. In terms of HGD / cancer, 1070 biopsies / neoplasia found using
Seattle protocol and 113 biopsies / neoplasia using Portsmouth Protocol, a
9.5-fold difference.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This is the first RCT comparing these techniques. No
HGD or cancer was missed with either technique. There was a 4-fold reduction
in biopsies per neoplasia detected with Portsmouth compared to Seattle
protocol and a 9.5-fold difference when restricted to high-risk neoplasia.
If implemented nationally then this could lead to a massive reduction in
histopathology work load and costs. LGD remains controversial and we believe
inflammation could have resulted in false positive LGD as subsequent OGD and
biopsies did not reveal any LGD. This feasibility data would support a
definitive trial of AA targeted biopsies in a surveillance population.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Radio-frequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of
Barrett's oesophagus (BE) related neoplasia is the preferred ablative
intervention after endoscopic resection (ER). For circumferential BE, the
3cm HALO 360 balloon is used to treat large areas. A new device, the HALO
360 Express self-sizing catheter was recently launched and can potentially
allow quicker ablation times and better coverage of the mucosa due to the
improved tissue/ catheter contact and 4cm balloon length. We have previously
presented initial data of 3 month follow up in these patients but now
present more extensive data including end of treatment biopsies.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Specialist centres in the UK and Ireland
submitted cases where Halo 360 express had been used. Patients returned for
follow-up at 3 months after index RFA express treatment. The primary outcome
was surface area regression of BE at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were
stricture formation and regression of intestinal metaplasia (EoT (End of
Treatment) CR-IM) and dysplasia (EoT CR-D) were analysed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 11 centres submitted 123 patients treated with the HALO
360 Express catheter. 112 of these cases had 3 month follow-up. The mean age
was 67 years +/-10. 83% were male. 43 patients (35%) had low-grade dysplasia
(LGD) as initial histology; 62 had high-grade dysplasia (HGD) 50%, 19 had
intramucosal carcinoma (15%), 1 had invasive adenocarcinoma as baseline
histology. 54 (44%) had had previous endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). The
mean pre-treatment circumferential Barrett's segment length (C) was 5.5cm
+/- 4.3cm and the mean mucosal length (M) was 7.8cm +/- 3.6cm. The mean %
reduction in C of 78% +/-36% and mean reduction in M of 55% +/-36% at this
first 3 month follow-up. 17 patients (15%) developed strictures which
required dilation at this 3 month follow-up. The median number of dilations
was 2 (IQR2-4). 4/17 (24%) were treated with 12J/no clean, 10/17 were
treated with 10J/no clean (59%), 3/17 (17%) had been treated with 10J/clean
protocol. 8/17 (47%) had had previous EMR. 47 patients had 12 month EoT
biopsies, 40 (85%) had CR-D and 34 (76%) had CR-IM. 4/112patients (&lt;4%)
had progressed to invasive cancer at the time of writing. The median number
of treatments (focal RFA, EMR, APC (argon plasma coagulation)) to EoT was
2(IQR1-4).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The HALO 360 Express catheter shows good reduction in
C and M length at 3 months, and effective eradication of IM and Dysplasia in
those at 12 months. However, as previously reported by us the stricture rate
is higher than previous series with the HALO 360 catheter which showed a
stricture rate of 6-10% compared to 15% in this study.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Neoplastic Barrett esophagus (BE) is usually treated
by a combination of endoscopic resection for (visible) neoplasia followed by
ablation of the remaining BE mucosa with the aim to eradicate the entire BE.
For ablation, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) which has been used in most
studies, has recently been challenged by other methods such as but argon
plasma coagulation (APC) with prior submucosal injection (Hybrid-APC,
H-APC).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Multicenter study in 9 European centers on
patients with biopsy proven neoplastic BE. Following endoresection (EMR/ESD)
a maximum of 5 H-APC sessions was allowed; exclusive ablation for neoplastic
BE (LGIN/HGIN) could be performed at the discretion of the endoscopists for
neoplastic BE (LGIN or HGIN) without visible lesions. Primary therapeutic
success was defined as one follow-up endoscopy showing normal endoscopic
neo-Z-line with negative biopsies.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 130 of 164 included patients (112 male, 18 female, mean
age 63.8 years) have completed therapy with 3 month follow-up, 19 were
excluded from the therapeutic concept for a variety of reasons. Final
diagnoses were mucosal cancer (n = 79), high-grade (HGIN, n = 23), low-grade
dysplasia (LGIN n = 26) and normal BE (n = 2). Therapy: Combined resection
and ablation (n = 117), exclusive ablation (n = 13). Mean number of H-APC
sessions: 2.69 (range 1-5). Short-term treatment outcome: Endoscopic
treatment success (normal Z line) was seen in 99 cases, but in 6 cases
histopathology showed intestinal metaplasia (minor residual BE disease) or
(n = 1) residual cancer. 31 further cases each had either indeterminate
endoscopy (minor residual BE possible) but either negative biopsies (n = 27)
or minor residual normal BE on biopsies. Based on histopathologic proof,
short-term eradication rates were 89.2% (116/130). Treatment for minor
residual BE is currently ongoing in some patients. Immediate complications:
bleeding n = 5, post-procedure fever n = 9 and 1 perforation treated
conservatively by clipping. Later strictures requiring dilatation: n = 5
(5/130 = 3.8 %). In the 12 months follow-up (n = 101 at present), the
endpoint of a macroscopically normal Z-Line with negative biopsies was
maintained in 88/101 cases (87.1%), with 2 cases included who had
indeterminate endoscopy (suggesting minor residual BE) but negative
biopsies. Of the 13 cases with positive biopsies (macroscopically visible BE
in 2 of them), all had non-dysplastic BE.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> H-APC for BE ablation appears to be feasible and safe
with a short- and mid-term efficacy of close to 90% in this interim
analysis; final results of this large prospective study have to be awaited.
The comparative value of H-APC to RFA will be assessed in a prospective
randomized trial.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Cryotherapy has been used for years to eradicate
flat dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (BE), since it may be better tolerated
and result in lower stricture rates when compared to heat-based ablation
techniques. Cryoballoon ablation (CBA) is a new technique comprising a
through-the-scope catheter with a conformable balloon that is inflated and
cooled using nitrous oxide. Thus far, focal CBA has been promising, but only
suitable for treatment of limited BE. The novel 90°-swipe CBA (90°-SCBA)
covers 90° of the esophageal circumference over 3cm in a single step. The
controller software allows for adjustment of the dose (the rate at which the
diffuser traverses the 3cm long axis of the balloon catheter while emitting
cryogen). 90°-SCBA has been feasible and safe in animal and
pre-esophagectomy studies.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study is to assess feasibility,
safety and dose-related efficacy of 90°-SCBA in patients with dysplastic BE.
Patients with flat BE (circumferential extent ≤3cm) and low or high-grade
dysplasia (LGD/HGD) or residual BE after endoscopic resection(ER), were
enrolled in 5 Dutch BE expert centers. Half of the esophageal circumference
was treated, starting with 0.8mm/sec (dose 1). The dose was then escalated
with 0.1mm/sec (6 patients per dose) until the effective dose (ED) was
found. ED was defined as the lowest dose resulting in median BE regression
≥80% in the absence of dose-related serious adverse events (DR-SAE). ED was
subsequently confirmed in a confirmation cohort. DR-SAEs included severe
pain (VAS &gt; 6) for ≥7 days or stenosis requiring dilation. Pain (VAS
0-10), dysphagia (0-4) and other adverse events were evaluated at days 0, 1,
7 &amp; 30. Primary outcomes were technical success, DR-SAEs and efficacy
(BE regression at 8 weeks follow-up (FU) endoscopy assessed by 2 independent
endoscopists by systematic comparison of baseline and FU videos).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 25 patients were included (74% male, median BE
C0M3). Baseline pathology was LGD (76%), HGD (12%) and adenocarcinoma (12%).
Five patients were treated with ER before inclusion. The 90°-SCBA procedure
was technically successful in 23 patients (92%). Device malfunctions
occurred in 2 other patients (8%) and were resolved with device replacement.
No DR-SAEs occurred (Table). BE regression at FU was 78% (IQR 68-86) with
0.8mm/sec (dose 1, N = 6) and 85% (75-95) with 0.7mm/sec (dose 2, N = 7),
which was in turn defined as ED. ED was confirmed in 12 extra patients
resulting in a median BE regression of 85% (IQR 75-94). Median pain scores
after treatment with the ED (dose 2, N = 19) were 4 (IQR 2-5), 2 (0-4), 0
(0-0) and 0 (0-0) at days 0, 1, 7 &amp; 30 respectively. Median dysphagia
score was 0 at all FU timepoints.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our multicenter pilot study suggests that
semi-circumferential treatment with 90°-SCBA is feasible, safe and well
tolerated for eradication of flat dysplastic BE. It results in a median BE
regression of 85% in the 19 patients treated at a dose of 0.7mm/sec (ED) and
is a promising new modality for endoscopic eradication. <table-wrap id="table19-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table19-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table19"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1">Dose-finding phase<hr/></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Confirmation phase</th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The disease state of IBD patients have been
described by clinical, macro, and microscopic approaches. However, despite
extensive efforts for standardization, those measurements are still subject
to certain degree of subjectivity that limits their reliability. More
objectives and molecularly defined measures of gut inflammation are of
particular interest in IBD, as they allow to objectively subset patients
according to disease activity or use as part of the treat-to-target
strategy. Such molecular scores can also be used to regress the inflammation
component from transcriptome data, improving the ability to identify
non-inflammatory processes of IBD pathophysiology, such as tissue
homeostasis and epithelial barrier function, and to measure the mucosal
healing.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We present a more objective molecular
characterization of disease activity based on transcription profiles of 719
inflamed (I) and 1776 non-inflamed (NI) intestinal biopsies from 1160
patients in the MSCCR cohort (498 CD, 419 UC, 243 non-IBD control)
undergoing routine endoscopy at Mount Sinai Hospital. Genes differentially
expressed between I and NI biopsies (FDR &lt; 0.05, FCH &gt; 2) were used to
generate a biopsy-level molecular inflammation score (MIS-B) via
GSVA<sup>1</sup>. For each patient, multiples MIS-B scores from
different regions were combined to create a patient-level gut inflammation
score (MIS-G) using mixed-effect models.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> MIS-G strongly correlated with clinical disease severity
as measured by the disease activity scores (HBI for UC, SCCAI for UC), as
well as commonly used Inactive/Active disease categories. MIS-G also
correlated with endoscopic measures of IBD severity (SES-CD for CD, and Mayo
endo for UC), with higher MIS-G in more severe disease and significant
pairwise differences between each Inactive/Mild/Moderate/Severe category.
The observed associations were stronger for MIS-G than for CRP measured the
day of the endoscopy. Specifically, UC patients with Inactive and Mild
disease could be differentiated by MIS-G (p &lt; 10<sup>−10</sup>), but not
by CRP (p = 0.5). MIS-G was also associated with disease location in CD
according to Montreal classification, with higher scores in patients with
ileo-colonic disease (L3) than those with terminal ileum (L1) or colonic
(L2). Although no differences were found in clinical or endoscopic severity
between patients in early stage of disease (&lt;2 years since diagnosis) and
late disease (&gt;5 years), nor for CRP values (d = 0.07, p = 0.81),
patients with late disease had higher MIS-G than those recently diagnosed
(d = 3.2, p &lt; 0.02), highlighting the granularity of our molecular
scores. In UC patients, MIS-B was positively associated with SCCAI in
biopsies from distal colonic regions (Rectum, Sigmoid and Left colon), but
not with more proximal regions of colon or ileum.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We generated a measure of transcriptionally based
intestinal inflammation in IBD patients, MIS-B, that provides an objectively
defined measure of disease state in IBD relevant tissues. Patient-level
MIS-G represents a molecular measure of disease activity that differentiates
between IBD categories according to clinical and endoscopic evaluations,
potentially allowing for further subsetting of IBD patients. We identified
biopsies macroscopically defined as NI with high MIS-B, defining regions
with latent disease. Investigation of such regions may help determining
sub-clinical disease state, either to identify biological mechanisms
regulating clinical manifestations, or to predict risk of upcoming
flares.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Restorative proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal
anastomosis (IPAA) is the surgical therapy of choice for patients with
refractory or complicated ulcerative colitis (UC). Approximately 60% of
these patients develop pouch inflammation (pouchitis).</p>
<p>The hypothesis is that pouchitis may occur due to compromise of the epithelial
barrier function and exposure of the intestinal immune system to microbial
antigens. Increased luminal protease activity was associated with
exacerbation of colitis in animal models as well as in patients with
inflammatory bowel diseases.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to study whether luminal proteolytic
activity is increased in UC patients with pouchitis and what are the
functional implications on epithelial barrier function.</p>
<p>Fecal supernatants were extracted from patients with a normal pouch (NP),
active pouchitis (AP) and healthy controls (HC). Fecal protease activity was
determined using FITC-casein florescence assay. Caco-2 cell monolayers were
exposed to fecal supernatants. Epithelial integrity and permeability were
determined by measuring trans-electrical epithelial resistance (TEER) and
permeability of a 4 kDa FITC-dextran across the monolayers.
Immunofluorescence and Western blot were performed on Caco-2 cells to assess
for tight junction proteins integrity (ZO-1, occludin) after exposure to
fecal supernatants.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Fecal supernatants were obtained from 25 patients: 6 NP,
10 AP and 9 HC participants. Proteolytic activity was 4.3–fold increased in
patients with AP compared to NP and HC (p &lt; 0.05). Fecal supernatants
from patients with AP disrupted occludin and ZO-1 proteins, as assessed by
Western blot and immunofluorescence. TEER in patients with AP was reduced by
1.6 fold (p &lt; 0.05), and epithelial permeability to FITC-dextran
increased by 18.36 (p &lt; 0.05) and 73 fold (p &lt; 0.01), compared to the
effects of fecal supernatants from patients with NP and HC,
respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Pouch inflammation is associated with increased
luminal proteolytic activity. Fecal supernatants from patients with
pouchitis disrupt tight junction proteins of Caco-2 cell monolayers and
increase epithelial cells permeability suggesting that proteolytic activity
affects epithelial barrier function and may be a step in the mechanism of
pouchitis.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Th17 cells are crucially involved in the
immunopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases in humans. Nevertheless,
pharmacological blockade of IL17A, the Th17 signature cytokine, yielded
negative results in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), and attempts to
elucidate the determinants of Th17 cells pathogenicity in the gut have so
far proved unsuccessful.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Here, we aimed to identify and functionally
validate the pathogenic determinants of intestinal IL-17-producing T cells.
<italic>In-vivo</italic> generated murine intestinal IL-17-producing T
cells were adoptively transferred into immunodeficient
<italic>Rag1<sup>−</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>−</sup></italic>
recipients to test their pathogenicity. Human IL-17-, IFNγ/ IL-17 and IFNγ-
actively secreting T cell clones were generated from lamina propria
lymphocytes of CD patients. The pathogenic activity of intestinal
IL-17-producing T cells against the intestinal epithelium was evaluated.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> IL-17-producing cells with variable colitogenic activity
can be generated <italic>in vivo</italic> by different experimental colitis
models. Pathogenicity of IL-17-secreting cells was directly dependent on
their IFNγ secretion capacity, as demonstrated by the reduced colitogenic
activity of IL-17-secreting cells isolated from IFNγ<sup>−/−</sup> mice.
Moreover, IFNγ production is a distinguished attribute of CD-derived lamina
propria Th17 cells. IFNγ secretion by CD-derived IL-17-producting intestinal
clones is directly implicated in the epithelial barrier disruption through
the modulation of tight junction proteins.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Intestinal Th17 cell pathogenicity is associated to
IFNγ production, which directly affects intestinal permeability through the
disruption of epithelial tight junctions.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Locally injected mesenchymal stem cells (Alofisel®,
TiGenix and Takeda) are now an approved therapy in European Union for
treatment of perianal fistulising Crohn's disease (CD)<sup>1</sup>. However,
clinical studies have shown limited efficacy of systemic mesenchymal stem
cells (MSC) therapy for luminal CD<sup>2</sup>. The reasons for low efficacy
for luminal CD is inadequately investigated with majority of the studies
performed demonstrating the benefit of MSC therapy in murine models that
require manipulation (genetic, chemical) to develop inflammation and focus
on colonic inflammation. Thus, we studied the SAMP-1/YitFc (SAMP), a chronic
and spontaneous murine model of small intestine (SI) inflammation that
closely resembles human CD for treatment with human bone marrow derived MSC
(hMSC)<sup>3</sup>. We previously reported that hMSCs injected
intraperitoneally (i.p) into SAMP reduced the severity of SI inflammation
(Phosphate buffered saline[PBS] control: 17 ± 1.1 vs. hMSC: 9.4 ± 2.4;
p &lt; 0.01)<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to determine the
mechanism(s) by which hMSCs mediate immunosuppression in SAMP. hMSC mediated
immunosuppression was studied by enzyme immunoassay, flow cytometry,
differentiation assays, mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), macrophage
co-culture, RT-PCR, and nanostring immune profiling. hMSCs were transduced
with lentivirus vector containing shRNA for COX-2 (hMSCshCOX-2) to knockdown
secretion of Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) and lentivirus
with scrambled shRNA was used as control (hMSCshRNA control).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Using NanoString mouse immune cell profiling assay that
examined the gene expression of 561 inflammation related genes, SAMP mice
treated with hMSC i.p had increased abundance of macrophages and decreased
abundance of lymphocytes in the SI. In co-culture assay, hMSCs reprogrammed
SAMP macrophages to alternatively activated antiinflammatory phenotype with
higher gene expression of arginase I (3.9–fold increase, p = 0.01) and lower
gene expression of IL-6 (0.8–fold decrease, p = 0.03) and TNF-α (0.7–fold
decrease, p = 0.09) compared to SAMP mice treated with PBS and dead hMSCs.
In MLRs set up with irradiated allogeneic splenocytes to stimulate naïve T
lymphocytes from SAMP mice, hMSCs profoundly suppressed T cell proliferation
in a dose dependent manner as measured by [<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine
incorporation (95% CI of difference: 3,885–10,456 cpm; ANOVA p &lt; 0.001
for 5x10<sup>4</sup> hMSCs and 8,573–14,335 cpm; ANOVA p &lt; 0.0001 for
2x10<sup>5</sup> hMSCs). By enzyme immunoassay we determined that
hMSCs basally secrete PGE<sub>2</sub> at a concentration of 4850 ± 86 pg/mL
per 100,000 cells. The supernatants from suppressed T cells co-cultured with
hMSCs contained higher amounts of PGE<sub>2</sub> than proliferating T cells
not co-cultured with hMSCs (5609 ± 364 pg/mL vs.49.6 ± 57 pg/mL;
p &lt; 0.0001). Indomethacin, a COX-1/2 inhibitor (10 µM) decreased
PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion from hMSC (1219 ± 56 pg/mL vs. 7187 ± 42
pg/mL; p &lt; 0.0001) and abrogated the suppression of T cell proliferation
in MLR (95% CI of difference: -914–2442 cpm; p not significant). MLR
performed with PGE<sub>2</sub> inhibited hMSC (hMSCshCOX-2) in comparison to
hMSC shRNA control again demonstrated abrogation of suppression of T cell
proliferation (95% CI of difference: 3,885–10,456 cpm; ANOVA p &lt; 0.001
for hMSCshRNA control and 95% CI of difference: -1,859–7580 cpm; ANOVA p not
significant for hMSCshCOX-2) confirming the role of PGE<sub>2</sub> in
mediating immunosuppression by hMSC.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> hMSCs mediate immunosuppression by secreting
PGE<sub>2</sub> and reprogramming macrophages to immunosuppressive
phenotype in SAMP model of experimental CD.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Excessive production of interleukin-6 is associated
with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Blockade of the interleukin-6
receptor (IL6R) with a monoclonal antibody (tocilizumab) is licensed for
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical trials of IL6R inhibitors in IBD
have been small in numbers, with varying efficacy. The <italic>IL6R</italic>
SNP rs2228145 associates with a similar pattern of effects to tocilizumab
therapy (higher soluble IL6R, lower c-reactive protein and fibrinogen),
making it an attractive genetic instrument for drug target validation.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We performed a two sample Mendelian
randomization study using rs2228145 (a variant associated with impaired IL6R
signaling) to evaluate the role of IL6R inhibition for primary prevention of
IBD. Gene – soluble IL6R biomarker associations were estimated in 1650
individuals, as a proxy for defective IL6R signaling. Gene – IBD
associations were estimated in 49833 cases and 61630 ancestry matched
controls from publically available IBD genome-wide association study (GWAS)
summary statistics.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In a fixed-effects meta-analysis of 26788 cases with
Crohn's disease (CD), 23045 with ulcerative colitis (UC)) and 61630
controls, genetically elevated soluble IL6R was associated with decreased
odds of Crohn's disease (CD) (odds ratio (OR) 0.87, 95% CI 0.82–0.92,
p = 0.00001463) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.89–0.99,
p = 0.0378) per 2-fold increment.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> On the basis of genetic evidence in human beings,
defective IL6R signaling seems to protect against the development of both CD
and UC; its inhibition is an attractive drug target suitable for further
exploration. Genetic studies in populations could be used more widely to
help validate and prioritize novel drug targets or to repurpose existing
agents for new therapeutic and preventive uses.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's
disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic inflammation of the
human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Dendritic cells (DC), the most potent
antigen presenting cells, are essential to maintain the mechanisms of
GI-homeostasis towards nutrients and commensal in health, while initiating
immune responses towards pro-inflammatory invading pathogens. However,
despite the relevance of DC modulating GI-immune responses, there is not
much information about DC composition in the human GI-tract both in health
and IBD.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Our aim was to characterize human GI-DC subsets,
phenotype and function both in health and in IBD patients. To that end,
human intestinal biopsies were obtained from healthy controls and IBD
patients (including UC and CD; both active and quiescent). Tissue was
disaggregated and the lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) characterized
by flow cytometry.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Human intestinal DC were identified within singlet viable
leukocytes as
CD14<sup>−</sup>CD64<sup>−</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>.
Type 1 conventional DC were defined as CD103<sup>+</sup>SIRPα<sup>−</sup>
while type 2 conventional DC were identified as SIRPα<sup>+</sup> and
further divided into subsets based on the expression of CD103. Total DC
numbers changed throughout the healthy human gut as they were higher in the
colon (either distal or proximal) compared with the ileum. DC numbers were
indeed further decreased in the duodenum. Type 1 (minority) and type 2
(majority) conventional DC did not change their proportion throughout the
healthy gut. However, CD103<sup>+</sup>SIRPα<sup>+</sup> DC were the main
subset in the duodenum as opposed to CD103<sup>−</sup>SIRPα<sup>+</sup> DC
which were predominant in the colon and the ileum. Compared with their
CD103<sup>−</sup>SIRPα<sup>+</sup> type 2 counterparts,
CD103<sup>+</sup>SIRPα<sup>+</sup> had higher levels of HLA-DR, CD40,
CD86, CCR7, CD137L, ICOSL and PD-L1. CD103<sup>+</sup>SIRPα<sup>+</sup> were
also more phagocytic and had lower expression of blood-related markers like
CLA and CCR2 suggesting that they are derived from
CD103<sup>−</sup>SIRPα<sup>+</sup> DC following mucosal conditioning.
Indeed, CD103<sup>+</sup>SIRPα<sup>+</sup> numbers were increased following
LPMC culture, although this process was reverted in the presence of
pro-inflammatory LPS. CD103<sup>+</sup>SIRPα<sup>+</sup> DC displayed an
enhanced production of IL-10, both in resting conditions and in the presence
of LPS, confirming therefore their tolerogenic phenotype. Type 1
CD103<sup>+</sup>SIRPα<sup>−</sup> DC, on the contrary, displayed a
decreased production of IL-1β (both resting and with LPS) in agreement with
their different lineage. Referred to the colonic mucosa in IBD, type 2 DC
constitutively displayed lower expression of SIRPα both on the inflamed and
non-inflamed mucosa from IBD patients. Nevertheless, the inflamed colon from
UC patients, but not CD, specifically displayed lower numbers of tolerogenic
CD103<sup>+</sup>SIRPα<sup>+</sup> confirming therefore a differential
DC signature in both conditions.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Human GI-DC can be divided into 3 different subsets
with different phenotype and function based on the expression of CD103 and
SIRPα. CD103<sup>+</sup>SIRPα<sup>+</sup> DC display a tolerogenic phenotype
and function and are likely derived from their
CD103<sup>+</sup>SIRPα<sup>−</sup> counterparts following mucosal
conditioning. The specific reduction of CD103<sup>+</sup>SIRPα<sup>+</sup>
DC in the inflamed mucosa from UC patients, but not CD, suggests the
presence of different pathogenic mechanisms occurring in IBD.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a transcription
factor activated by a large variety of natural and synthetic ligands and
represents an important link between the environment and immune-mediated
pathologies. Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy driven by
gluten.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We characterized the expression and role of AhR
in CD-related inflammation. AhR expression was analysed in duodenal mucosal
samples, lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and intraepithelial
lymphocytes (IELs) of active CD patients, inactive CD patients and normal
controls (NC) by flow cytometry and real-time PCR. To evaluate the factors
that regulate AhR expression in CD mucosa, specific neutralizing antibodies
against IL-21, IL-15 or IFN-γ were added to <italic>ex vivo</italic> organ
cultures of active CD mucosal explants. Moreover, duodenal samples taken
from inactive CD patients were treated with peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin
(PT). After 24 hours, AhR and inflammatory cytokines expression were
evaluated by real-time PCR. Transcripts of inflammatory cytokines were also
analysed in CD mucosal explants either left untreated or treated with
6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (Ficz), a natural ligand of AhR. Finally, we
evaluated whether Ficz ameliorated poly I:C-driven small intestine atrophy
in mice.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> AhR expression was significantly reduced in duodenal
biopsy samples, LPMC and IELs taken from active CD patients compared to
inactive CD patients and NC. The addition of PT to <italic>ex vivo</italic>
organ cultures of duodenal biopsies taken from inactive CD patients reduced
AhR expression, while neutralizing IL-21 or IL-15 specific antibodies
increased AhR expression in <italic>ex vivo</italic> organ cultures of
duodenal samples of active CD patients. Treatment with Ficz of <italic>ex
vivo</italic> organ cultures of duodenal biopsies, IELs and LPMC taken
from active CD patients reduced the expression of IFN-α, IFN-γ and TNF-α.
Moreover, Ficz reduced the expression of perforin and granzyme B in IELs and
LPMC isolated from active CD patients. Mice given Ficz were protected from
poly I:C-driven intestinal atrophy and showed reduced levels of IFN-α,
IFN-γ, TNF-α, perforin and granzyme B in small intestinal mucosa.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These data indicate that AhR-driven signals inhibit
pathogenic responses in the gut of CD patients.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> In coeliac disease (CD), tolerance to gluten
(gliadin) proteins from cereals is lost. Tolerogenic immune modifying
nanoparticles (TIMP) are effective at restoration of antigen-specific immune
tolerance in various autoimmune conditions. The identification of gliadins
as dietary antigens and drivers of immune-mediated pathology in CD suggests
that TIMP containing gliadin (TIMP-GLIA) may serve as a cure.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Here, we tested immunomodulatory effects of
TIMP-GLIA vs. control TIMP in 3 different mouse models of CD, 1) a
delayed-type hypersensitivity, 2) a HLA-DQ8 transgenic, and 3) a gliadin
memory T cell enteropathy model. Nanoparticles were administered
intravenously.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Treatment with TIMP-GLIA reduced gliadin-specific T cell
proliferation, inflammatory cytokine secretion, circulating gliadin-specific
IgG/IgG2c, earswelling, gluten-dependent enteropathy, and body weight loss
in mouse models of CD. Therapeutic effects were antigen-specific, and
dose-dependent. RNA sequencing and Foxp3 RT-qPCR of gliadin-restimulated
splenocytes from HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice revealed a tolerogenic signature of
TIMP-GLIA in T cells and antigen-presenting cells.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The results demonstrate efficacy of TIMP-GLIA in
modulating the immune response to gliadin <italic>in vivo</italic>, by
inducing regulatory T cell tolerance and reversing T helper 1/T helper 17
cell skewing. Safety and efficacy testing of TIMP-GLIA in restoring gluten
tolerance in CD patients is warranted.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Refractory celiac disease type II (RCDII) is an
indolent intestinal tumor of aberrant intraepithelial T-lymphocytes (IEL).
The severe enteropathy found in RCDII is caused by aberrant IEL that exert
cytotoxicity against the enterocytes. In this study, we investigated the
cell death mechanisms that are responsible for villous atrophy in RCDII and
their potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> mRNA and protein expression were determined
using RT-MLPA analysis, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, respectively.
Enterocyte killing and degranulation by aberrant IEL were measured in the
presence of a transwell, specific inhibitors or therapeutic agents, using
flow cytometry. Secretion of granzyme B was detected by ELISA.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> mRNA and protein expression of granzyme B were
significantly upregulated in the cytoplasm of aberrant IEL of patients with
RCDII compared to levels of granzyme B expression in patients with celiac
disease on a gluten-free diet (GFD). The level of granzyme B expression in
RCDII patients correlated with the severity of villous atrophy and with
clinical response to therapy. RCDII cell lines also demonstrated increased
levels of granzyme B expression. Furthermore, in RCDII patients and RCDII
cell lines degranulation and secretion of granzyme B was observed in the
presence of epithelial cells. Incubation of RCDII cell lines with epithelial
cell line Caco2 showed that aberrant IEL induced apoptosis of Caco2.
Treatment with a granzyme B inhibitor demonstrated that killing of
enterocytes was granzyme B dependent and that degranulation by IEL was
imperative. In addition, we found that the aberrant IEL induced cell death
through triggering of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway via mitochondrial
membrane depolarization and caspase-3 and -9 activation. For degranulation
of granzyme B and killing of the enterocytes, binding of the aberrant IEL to
the epithelial cell was necessary. CD103(αE) expression was significantly
increased in RCDII patients compared to CD patients on GFD. Functional
studies revealed that CD103(αE)β7-E-cadherin interaction was essential for
release of granzyme B and loss of enterocytes. Treatment with therapeutic
agent etrolizumab, an anti-β7 mAb, inhibited degranulation of granzyme B and
killing of the epithelial cells by RCDII cell lines.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Killing of enterocytes in RCDII is dependent on
upregulated expression and degranulation of granzyme B and on interaction
with the aberrant IEL through CD103(αE)β7-E-cadherin binding. These data
contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of villous atrophy
in RCDII and therefore can be important for diagnostic purposes and during
follow-up of RCDII patients. Moreover, our preclinical findings support the
potential use of etrolizumab as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment
of RCDII patients.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Because of their increased risk for coeliac disease
(CD), ESPGHAN and other guidelines advise to screen children with affected
first-degree relatives. However, in the literature there is little
information about the benefit of early diagnosis and treatment in these
children.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Our aim was to prospectively assess whether
children from coeliac families benefit from screening, early diagnosis and
treatment.</p>
<p>We analyzed the data from the European, multicentre PreventCD cohort involving
944 newborns recruited from 2007-2010, who are being prospectively assessed
for CD development. All the children are positive for HLA-DQ2 and/or HLADQ8
and have at least 1 first-degree relative with CD. Health status using
(parental) questionnaires on CD-related symptoms and CD antibodies (IgA
against transglutaminase 2 (TGA)) were assessed at the age of 4, 6, 9, 12,
18, 24 and 36 months, and thereafter at least every 2 years (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.preventcd.com">www.preventcd.com</ext-link>). TGA was centrally measured using from
2007-2014 the Celikey Varelisa test and from 2015, the Celikey ELIA method,
with cut-off values of 5 U/ml and 7 U/ml respectively. If the children
presented symptoms and/or increased TGA level indicating CD, diagnostic
small bowel biopsies were offered. The biopsies were assessed centrally by
an independent pathologist blinded to the clinical and antibody results. All
CD diagnoses were discussed and agreed upon by the diagnostic committee of
PreventCD. Measured outcomes were improvement of the reported symptoms and
of TGA level on a gluten-free diet (GFD) at follow-up 1 and 2 years after
diagnosis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> As on 01 December 2017, 130 children (mean age: 9.1
years; range: 7.3–10.9; 59.8% female) had been diagnosed with CD at a mean
age of 3.8 years (range: 1.1– 9.2). Since 4 asymptomatic CD children did not
follow a GFD, 126 CD children were included in this analysis. 71 children
(56.3%) were symptomatic at diagnosis and reported 1 or more symptoms, as
shown in the table. In total 80.0% and 87.8% of the symptomatic children at
diagnosis were symptom-free after 1 and 2 year on a GFD, respectively. All
symptoms at diagnosis, except constipation and vomiting, significantly
improved after treatment. The mean TGA level in symptomatic children
decreased from 81.2 U/mL to 4.0 U/mL and 2.2 U/mL after 1 and 2 year of
treatment, respectively. <table-wrap id="table20-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table20-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table20"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">At diagnosis – no.

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Coeliac disease (CD) is a gluten-dependent
enteropathy that develops in genetically susceptible individuals. Current
treatment is a gluten-free diet (GFD), which leads to the recovery of the
normal morphology and function of the intestine, with the subsequent
disappearance of clinical symptoms and specific antibodies. Therefore, CD
diagnosis needs to be established under gluten containing diet, a problem
due to the increasing number of individuals following a GFD.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Based on the study of Han et al. (1), we studied
the utility of detecting activated γδ and CD8 T cells expressing gut-homing
receptors after a 3-day gluten challenge aimed to diagnose CD in individuals
on a GFD.</p>
<p>We studied 18 previously diagnosed seropositive CD patients: 14 with high HLA
genetic risk (all HLA-DQ2.5) and 4 with low or even non-HLA genetic risk
(two HLA-DQ2.2, one HLA-DQ7.5 and one non-HLA-DQ2/DQ8). All patients showed
clinical and serological response to GFD. A group of 35 non-CD controls was
also included, mainly composed by healthy volunteers that followed a GFD for
at least 1 month. All subjects were exposed to 12-15 g of gluten every day
for 3 consecutive days. Peripheral blood was collected before (day 0) and 6
days (day 6) after starting gluten consumption, and the expression of CD103,
β7 and CD38 in gd and CD8 T cells was assessed by flow cytometry.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The 3-day gluten challenge was completed by all
participants. In all of them, the studied T cell populations were
undetectable or barely present at day 0, but on day 6, gd and CD8 T cells
coexpressing CD103, β7<sup>hi</sup> and CD38 were observed in every CD
patient, but only in 1 control. No differences were observed between
patients with high and low/non-HLA risk genetics.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A short gluten challenge elicits the activation of
CD103<sup>+</sup> β7<sup>hi</sup> CD8/γδ<sup>+</sup> T cells in CD.
These cells can be detected by flow cytometry in peripheral blood, even in
those patients with a more difficult diagnosis, opening new possibilities
for CD diagnosis in individuals on a GFD.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Refractory celiac disease (RCD) is classically
categorized into two different entities: RCD type I is an autoimmune disease
that responds to immunosuppressants, while in RCD type II a monoclonal
transformation of IEL is found<sup>1</sup>. This is usually detected by
means of TCR clonality analysis. Patients with RCD type II have a poor
prognosis and a high risk of development of enteropathy-associated T-cell
lymphoma (EATL), so that it has been proposed to consider RCD type II as a
low-grade intraepithelial lymphoma (pre-EATL)<sup>2</sup>. Recently, flow
cytometric analysis of isolated intestinal lymphocytes has been introduced
as new diagnostic modality for the detection of so-called aberrant
intestinal lymphocytes (ILs)<sup>3,4</sup>.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aims of this study were (i) to detect
aberrant ILs in a cohort of non-celiac, celiac and RCD patients by means of
flow cytometry, (ii) to verify whether there is an association between
clinical characteristics of RCD patients and presence of aberrant ILs, (iii)
to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of aberrant ILs for RCD II/pre-EATL in
our cohort.</p>
<p>Immunostaining (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD7, CD103, TCRγδ, lineage markers) and flow
cytometric analysis of isolated ILs from duodenal biopsies of patients with
RCD, uncomplicated CD and controls were performed. Aberrant ILs were defined
by means of different gating strategies including cytCD3+surfCD3-CD7+ and
surfCD3-CD7+CD103+. Aberrant ILs and clinical characteristics in different
patient groups were compared.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 130 flow cytometry analyses were performed on
109 patients (42 controls, 21 active CD, 16 CD on gluten-free diet and 30
RCD). RCD patients were initially grouped according to TCR clonality
(TCRclon+, n = 17, TCRclon-, n = 13). The presence of aberrant ILs was
compared between the two subgroups, with increased aberrant IL numbers being
exclusively in the RCDclon+ (Table 1). Patients with evidence of aberrant
ILs also showed significantly more criteria for severe malabsorption (as
assessed by a cumulative malabsorption score). A cut-off of 11% ILs for the
most reliable strategy allowed to identify a subgroup of low risk RCD
patients ( = 21/30) and a small group of high-risk RCDs (n = 5) that were
classified as pre-EATL (2 of them with a later EATL diagnosis).
Nevertheless, sensitivity gaps were uncovered: 1 patient with ulcerative
jejunoileitis who later developed an EATL was not identified as pre-EATL.
Furthermore, 2 overt EATL cases were false negative (i.e., overall
sensitivity 67%, NPV 89%). Alternative, simpler gating strategies for
aberrant ILs showed similar accuracy to the main strategy.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In clinical practice, flow cytometry of aberrant ILs
may be a simple predictor of high-risk RCD. However, its use as the only
diagnostic strategy for classifying patients in RCD I (low risk) and RCD
II/pre-EATL may also lead to misdiagnosis. A multimodal diagnostic approach
for the diagnosis of RCD (including TCR clonality and malabsorptionscore)
maximizes diagnostic accuracy. <table-wrap id="table21-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table21-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table21"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Controls (n = 42)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Active CD (n = 21)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">CD on GFD (n = 16)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">RCD clon- (n = 13)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">RCD clon+ (n = 17)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">N of assays</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">42</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">22</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">16</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">18</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">31</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">%Lymphocytes</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">13 (6-21)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">24 (11-35)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">15 (7-28)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">16 (7-22)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20 (7-33)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">%CD4+</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">14 (4-38)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">9 (2-21)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">11 (5-30)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10 (2-27)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">8 (2-30)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">%CD8+</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">33 (4-75)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">44*(14-73)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">40 (8-76)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">37 (7-76)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">31*(5-61)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">%TCRγδ+</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3 (0-8)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">15 (2-29)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12 (3-35)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">11 (2-36)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">7 (1-47)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Cirrhosis has shown an increase of 45.6% in
mortality from 1990 to 2013. Medicare expenditures for potentially
preventable readmissions may be as high as $12 million per year and the cost
for an individual readmission is reported around $20, 000. Besides the
costs, the readmission is related with a significant negative effect on
quality of life for the patients. Early hospital re-admissions (during the
next 30 days after discharge) among patients with decompensated cirrhosis
predict a poor outcome and increase the 1-year follow-up mortality. We
believe that in some cases early re-hospitalization could be predictable and
therefore, potentially preventable. This study aimed to develop a score that
identifies patients at high risk for 30-day readmission.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This prospective study was conducted in 2
hospitals from Spain. We included 253 patients with diagnosis of cirrhosis,
and admitted due to a decompensation. Before discharge, we collected
demographic, socioeconomic, clinic and laboratory data. Readmissions were
categorized into 3 stages, within 30 days, from 1-6 month, and from 6-12
months after discharge.</p>
<p><bold>Statistical Analysis:</bold> We established significant risk factors for
early readmission identified by Cox proportional hazards model. We assigned
weighted-points that were proportional to their β regression coefficient
values. We calculated a prognostic score in patients with complete data for
multivariate model (N = 245). After internal validation (Bootstrap
validation), patients were categorized into 3 groups that were significantly
distinct in predictive risk for early readmission (low, medium, and high
risk).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The predictors for ER in the Cox-model (p &lt; 0.05)
included: SBP during hospitalization (HR: 4.34; 95% CI 1.43–13.17;
p = 0.01), ascites grade ≥2 (HR: 2.16; 95% CI 1.21–3.86; p = 0.01), number
of medications at discharge (HR: 1.16; 95% CI 1.03–1.32; p = 0.02), ECOG
performance status ≥1 (HR: 4.13; 95% CI 1.25–13.65; p = 0.02), Child-Pugh
≥10 (HR: 2.43; 95% CI 1.33–4.45; p = 0.004) and MELD-Na ≥15 (HR: 2.25; 95%
CI 1.19–4.26; p = 0.01). The use of beta-blockers was a protective factor
for readmission (HR: 0.46; 95% CI 0.26–0.82; p = 0.01).</p>
<p>After assigning weighted-points to the previous factors, the model (Table 1)
was able to predict 30-day readmissions with a good discrimination. The
c-statistic value was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.72–0.84). The total sum of the 7
values plus 4 (scaling factor) was the final risk score number. Patients
were divided into 3 groups according to the risk of ER:</p>
<p>• <italic>Low-risk group (&lt;17 points):</italic> 93/245 subjects; 30-day
readmission rate of 4.3%.</p>
<p>• <italic>Medium-risk group (17-24 points):</italic> 85/245 subjects; 30-day
readmission rate of 21.2%</p>
<p>• <italic>High-risk group (≥25 points):</italic> 67/245 subjects; 30-day
readmission rate of 49.3%</p>
<p>1-year follow up showed a survival rate of 47.8% in the high-risk group, 65.3%
in the medium-risk group, and 83.9% in the low-risk group.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The risk score is useful to identify patients at high
risk of early readmission. This group can be the target to implement
strategies to reduce the 30-day readmission. It is necessary external
validation of the score and future studies to establish appropriate
interventions. <table-wrap id="table22-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table22-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table22"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">SBP during hospitalization</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">YES =+10</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">NO =+0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ascites at discharge grade ≥2</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">YES =+5</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">NO =+0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">ECOG performance Status grade ≥1</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">YES =+9</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">NO =+0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Child-Pugh score ≥10</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">YES =+6</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">NO =+0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">MELD-Na ≥15</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">YES =+5</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">NO =+0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Beta blocker use</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">YES =−5</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">NO =+0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Number of medications at discharge (n)</td><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">+ n</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Infections in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) are
common and one of the major causes of hospitalization. Multidrug-resistant
organisms (MDROs) are a current reality that can alter the paradigm of
treatment and prevention of infection in these patients.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study is to identify the risk
factors for the occurrence of MDROs in patients with LC.</p>
<p>Prospective study from October 2017 to March 2018 in consecutively hospitalized
patients with uncompensated LC with infection. Blood, urine and ascitic
fluid cultures were analyzed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 52 episodes of infection (43 males, mean age 63 ± 14.6
years, 30 Child-Pugh C, 20 Child-Pugh B). In 15 episodes no microorganisms
were identified in cultural examinations. Of the remaining, MDROs were
isolated in 18 (15 males, mean age 63 ± 12.3 years; 7 Child-Pugh C, 10
Child-Pugh B). Klebsiella ESBL was the most frequently isolated MDRO
(44.4%). MDROs were associated with the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI)
(72.2% vs. 36.8%, p = 0.0312), antibiotic therapy in the last 90 days
(including norfloxacin prophylaxis) (94.4% versus 47.4%, p = 0.0033) and
hospitalization for more than 48 hours or discharge for less than 30 days
(100% versus 68.4%, p = 0.0082). The presence of Diabetes Mellitus (38.9%
versus 31.6%) and hepatocellular carcinoma (33.3% versus 31.6%) were not
relevant as factors predisposing to MDROs infection (p = 0.6526 and p = 0,
9124, respectively).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The indiscriminate use of antibiotics and PPIs
increases the risk of MDROs infections, suggesting that the prescription of
these drugs should be restricted to formal indication. Also hospitalization
for more than 48 hours or hospital discharge for less than 30 days have been
shown to influence the onset of MDROs. This suggests that hospitalizations
in LC patients should be limited to the minimum number of days required. The
authors consider relevant the investigation of other factors predisposing to
the emergence of these microorganisms.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Pleural effusions complicate end-stage liver disease
in 5% of patients. Early and careful identification of cause and related
complications is imperative for appropriate management and patient survival.
Unlike refractory ascites, data is limited on safety and efficacy of TIPS in
cirrhotic patients with refractory refilling pleural effusion.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We analyzed a consecutive cohort of hospitalized
cirrhotic patients having pleural effusion (PE) at admission. Baseline HVPG
and PE tap was done to determine etiology and presence of infection. We
determined the rate and predictors of PE resolution with standard medical
treatment (SMT), need for intercostal drainage (ICD) for repeated
pleurocentesis, and efficacy and safety of TIPS in hepatic hydrothorax.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 1149 admissions involving 762 cirrhotics (mean CTP-
10.6 ± 1.8) with PE, 967 (84.2%) had hepatic hydrothorax (HH), 181 (15.8%)
had tubercular PE (TBPE) and despite comparable HVPG, CTP and MELD scores at
baseline, patients with HH in comparison to TBPE developed more
complications (HE-41.6% vs 30.2%, AKI- 48.6% vs 37%, pneumonia- 16.1% vs
7.2%, bacteremia-11.7% vs 6.1% and septic shock-14.1% vs 8.3%; all
p &lt; 0.01) on follow-up. Of patients with HH, 475 (49.2%) were symptomatic
(mainly dyspnea-30.1%, cough-24% and chest pain-16.9%) at admission and PE
tap revealed SBE in 219 (22.9%) patients. Presence of co-existing SBP
(52.5%; Odd's ratio, OR: 5.2) and ICD placement (24.2%; OR: 3.1) were
independent predictors for SBE. Baseline HVPG (16.6 ± 4.4 vs. 16.4 ± 5.1;
p-0.6) and MELD scores (22.3 ± 6.9 vs. 21.9 ± 7.3; p-0.1) were comparable in
SBE and no SBE patients. 43% patients of HH responded to SMT alone and 133
(13.8%) required ICD placement for repeated pleurocentesis. 41 patients were
carefully selected for TIPS [based on lower CTP score (TIPS vs no TIPS-
9.9 ± 1.6 vs 10.7 ± 1.8; p-0.02), lower MELD (18.7 ± 5.5 vs. 21.5 ± 7.5;
p-0.03) and higher HVPG (19 ± 4.7 vs. 16.4 ± 4.8; p-0.08)]. Despite
reduction in pressure gradient (mean portal venous – mean right atrial
pressure) from 23.1 ± 3.8 mm Hg to 7.2 ± 2.5 mm Hg), only 20 (48.2%) had
complete resolution of HH, with no difference in mortality rates. Main
complications of TIPS in HH were post TIPS encephalopathy (8 patients, 6
resolved) and ischemic hepatitis (4 patients, 2 resolved). 321 (35.9%)
patients with HH had in-hospital mortality and independent predictors were
MELD &gt; 25, SBE non-response to SMT and septic shock requiring
vasopressors.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Only 1-half of hepatic hydrothorax resolves with
standard medical therapy and need for any intervention including TIPS
generally heralds poor outcomes. Role of hepatic hemodynamics in predicting
complications and response to HH is limited. Early referral for liver
transplantation is imperative.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Muscle cramps are common in patients with liver
cirrhosis and adversely influence quality of life with no available highly
effective treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy
and safety of orphenadrine in treatment of muscle cramps in cirrhotic
patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> 122 patients with liver cirrhosis were enrolled in this
study who suffering from frequent muscle cramps (≥3 per week), randomized to
receive either orphenadrine 100 mg twice daily or placebo for 1 month twice
daily as a control. 33 patients in the orphenadrine group and 36 patients in
the placebo group were on diuretic therapy. Muscle cramp questionnaire was
fulfilled. Severity, duration, and frequency of muscle cramps were assessed
before, after 1 month of treatment and 2 weeks after washout of treatment.
Side effects were recorded every visit to determine safety of the drug.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 1 month after treatment with orphenadrine; the frequency
of muscle cramps decreased significantly to 0.91 ± 1.07 compared to
11.08 ± 4.55 at baseline per week (p &lt; 0.001), the duration of muscle
cramps decreased from 4.36 ± 1.24 to 1.86 ± 2.25 minute after treatment
(p &lt; 0.001). The pain score improved significantly from a score of
7.27 ± 2.38 to 3.27 ± 3.46 (p &lt; 0.001). The side effects were few such as
dry mouth, drowsiness, and nausea, with no significant difference between
their occurrences in the 2 groups.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Orphenadrine is safe and effective in treatment of
muscle cramps in patients with liver cirrhosis.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the most prevalent
cause of advanced liver disease and liver-related mortality in Europe and
Russia. Abstinence is the first line and the basic therapeutic procedure for
any form and stage of ALD. Combined comprehensive supportive and behavioral
(repeated short brief intervention sessions) treatments provided by
clinicians may increase abstinence rate followed by liver function
stabilization and improves patient's outcome.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The main aim of this study was to estimate the
effectiveness of the active outpatient follow-up (AOF) program in achieving
and maintaining abstinence, liver function compensation and improving the
long-term outcome of patients with ALD.</p>
<p>In this historical control study 29 patients with ALD were enrolled in the
group of AOF that included active supervision by hepatologist: physical and
motivation assessment, motivational interviewing, liver panel lab tests with
the rate once at 3 months. The duration of the AOF was 12 months with 1
follow-up visit after 12 month. The historical control group included 36
patients with ALD and history of 2-year follow-up in the hepatology
department, who received comprehensive therapy and simple advice to avoid
alcohol.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There were significant differences in adherence to
abstinence between AOF and control groups at 6 (88% vs 43%, p &lt; 0.001), 9
(84% vs 44%, p = 0.002), 12 (84% vs 41%, p = 0.001) and 24 (80% vs 40%,
p = 0.017) months of follow-up, respectively. The 24-month alcohol relapse
occurred in 2 (8%) patients in the AOF group comparing with 13 (36%)
patients in the control group (p = 0.005). Univariable analysis showed that
only AOF was significantly associated with achieving and maintaining of
abstinence. Multivariable regression analysis of alcohol relapse during the
24 month showed that AOF is independent factor for being abstinent (OR: 0.80
[95% CI 0.14-0.479]; p = 0.006).</p>
<p>The proportion of patients with decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B+C) was
higher in the control group at 12 (14.2% vs 56%, p = 0.002) and 24 (19% vs
52%, p = 0.021) months after enrollment. Medians of MELD were 11 (10-12.5)
points in the AOF group vs 14 (11.75-17.25) points in the control group
(p = 0.01) after 12 months and 11 (10-12.5) points in the AOF group vs 13
(11-15) points in the control group (p = 0.009) after 24 months. The overall
mortality in AOF-patients vs those in control group was 14% vs. 28%
(p = 0.02), respectively. Multivariable regression analysis of mortality
showed that decompensated cirrhosis at baseline was an independent risk
factor for higher mortality (OR: 88.01 [95% CI 3.1-2498.51]; p = 0.009)
whereas in contrast AOF was an independent factor for being alive (OR: 0.026
[95% CI 0.001-0.618]; p = 0.024).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The program of active outpatient follow-up provided by
hepatologist can increase likelihood of achieving and maintaining
abstinence, prolonged compensation of liver function and improve the
long-term survival of patients with ALD.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is used for primary
(PP) and secondary prophylaxis (SP) of variceal bleeding. For SP, current
guidelines recommend combined use of non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs) and
EBL for SP, while either NSBB or EBL should be used in PP.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> (Re-) bleeding rates and mortality were
retrospectively assessed with and without concomitant NSBB therapy after
first EBL in PP and SP.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 766 patients with esophageal varices underwent EBL from
01/2005-06/2015. In PP, among 284 patients undergoing EBL, n = 101 (35.6%)
received EBL only, while n = 180 (63.4%) received EBL+NSBBs. In 482 patients
on SP, n = 163 (33.8%) received EBL only, while n = 299 (62%) received
EBL+NSBBs.</p>
<p>In PP, concomitant NSBB therapy neither had an impact on bleeding rates
(log-rank p = 0.353) nor on mortality (log-rank p = 0.497) as compared to
EBL alone.</p>
<p>Patients in SP with EBL+NSBB showed similar rebleeding rates as compared EBL
alone (log-rank p = 0.247). However, in SP, a concomitant NSBB therapy
resulted in a significantly lower mortality rate (log-rank p &lt; 0.001)
with fewer deaths related to liver failure, bleeding, and infections with
EBL+NSBB combination therapy. A decreased risk of death with EBL+NSBB in SP
(hazard ratio, HR:0.50; p &lt; 0.001) but not of rebleeding, transplantation
or further decompensation was confirmed by competing risk analysis.
Interestingly, in SP, NSBB intake reduced 6-months mortality (HR:0.53;
p = 0.008) in patients without severe/refractory ascites (HR:0.37;
p = 0.001) only but this effect was not seen in patients with
severe/refractory ascites (HR:0.80; p = 0.567).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> EBL alone seemed to be sufficient for PP of variceal
bleeding. In SP, concomitant NSBB to EBL improves survival within the first
6 months after EBL, as compared to EBL alone. In patients with
severe/refractory ascites these beneficial effects of NSBB therapy have to
be weighted against their potential side-effects.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Pancreatic cancer has a high mortality rate and is
the third leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States. Risk
factors for developing pancreatic cancer-include age &gt; 55, male sex,
obesity, tobacco, and diagnosis of diabetes. Additionally, acute and/or
chronic pancreatitis has been implicated as an important risk factor for
pancreatic cancer; however, the incidence and temporal relationship of
pancreatitis prior to the diagnosis of pancreas cancer is unclear.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aim to establish the role and incidence of
pancreatitis temporally with the development of pancreatic cancer. A
population-based study, with a web-based platform called Explorys was used
to collect de-identified patient data. Over 50 million patients, spanning
nationally in over 20 healthcare systems' electronic medical records is in
this cloud-based, HIPPA-enabled platform. Data was obtained using ICD-9 code
criteria with search terms “acute pancreatitis,” “chronic pancreatitis,” and
“malignant tumor of the pancreas.” A temporal relationship between
pancreatitis diagnoses, followed by pancreatic cancer diagnosis was
investigated. Intervals of 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months were observed.
Demographical data, including age, gender, and race was also recorded and
analyzed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total 50,080 patients were found to have a diagnosis of
pancreatic cancer. 7,420 (14.8%) of these patients were found to have
diagnoses of pancreatitis prior to their cancer diagnoses. Of those, 91.6%
were between the ages of 45-89. Interestingly, there was a higher incidence
of pancreatic cancer in the African-American population vs. the Caucasian
population (21.2% vs 14.8%, p &lt; 0.05) group with prior pancreatitis
diagnosis. Further analysis of pancreatic cancer diagnosis revealed that
6,030 of the 7,420 patients were diagnosed within 3 months of their acute
and/or chronic pancreatitis (81.3%) diagnosis. Finally, 7,340 (98.9%)
patients had established diagnoses of pancreatic cancer within 3 years of
the pancreatitis diagnosis.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Treatment of pancreas cancer is often challenging
because symptoms are not common or specific until advanced stage disease
occurs. Early detection of pancreatic cancer may lead to improved survival.
This study shows that almost 15% of patients with a diagnosis of pancreatic
cancer have prior diagnoses of pancreatitis, of which 90% of these cases
occur over age 45. Additionally, nearly 99% of pancreas cancer diagnoses
occur within 3 years of the pancreatitis diagnosis. Given our large sample
size, early detection and screening in patients with pancreatitis over the
age of 40 with unclear etiology of pancreatitis may be reasonable,
especially in the African American population. Limitations include inability
to track etiology of pancreatitis as well as unclear histologic types of
pancreas cancer in this database. <table-wrap id="table23-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table23-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table23"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Diagnosis</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Pancreatitis</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Pancreatic Cancer</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Pancreatitis Prior to Cancer (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">N</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">7,420</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">50,080</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">14.8</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Males</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">4,030</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">25,540</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">15.8</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age – yr</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20-29</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">150</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">6.7</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30-39</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">90</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">470</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">19.1</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">40-49</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">420</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1,790</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">23.5</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">50-59</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1,330</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">6,490</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20.5</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">60-69</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2,100</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12,830</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">16.4</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">70-79</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1,930</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">14,430</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">13.4</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">80-89</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1,140</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10,230</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">11.1</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">90+</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">340</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3,420</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">9.9</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ethnicity</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Caucasian</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5,470</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">37,030</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">14.8</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">African-American</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1,360</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">6,410</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">21.2</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The documented incidence of pediatric pancreatitis
(PP) is low, but it shows a rising pattern from Eastern to Western Europe
and the USA. The cause of this phenomenon is not clear, but based on a
single center study the amylase and lipase measurements correlate with the
incidence of the disease.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of the PINEAPPLE (Pain IN EArly phase of
Pediatric Pancreatitis) study is to investigate the current diagnostic
practice for PP and to estimate the occurrence of pancreatitis among
children suffering from abdominal pain worldwide. Furthermore we would like
to develop an EBM guideline to establish a scoring system in order to
evaluate the necessity of diagnostic steps for PP in children with abdominal
pain. PINEAPPLE is a registered (ISRCTN35618458), observational,
multinational clinical trial and the prestudy protocol is published
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26641250">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26641250</ext-link>). The
PINEAPPLE-R is a retrospective review of ER medical records of children and
adults. The PINEAPPLE-P is a prospective study in which serum pancreatic
enzyme measurement (sPEM) and abdominal imaging are performed in every
children with abdominal pain. Until now we have reviewed 35277 patient
records for the PINEAPPLE-R and involved 496 patients in the PINEAPPLE-P
from 13 centers from 3 countries.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> PINEAPPLE-R: 9.7% (2775/28707) of the children appeared
at ER unit had abdominal pain. In case of abdominal pain sPEM was performed
in 14% whereas 32% of the patients had transabdominal ultrasonography. In
our cohort the number of sPEM decreases from the USA (21.6%) to Eastern
Europe (13% in Hungary and 0.6% in Romania) and it correlates (r = 0.97)
with the incidence of PP (8/2775). PINEAPPLE-P: 8 pancreatitis from 496
patients with abdominal pain were diagnosed. Positive family history and
upper abdominal pain were characteristic for PP but fever and forced posture
were not typical.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The PINEAPPLE-R shows that the incidence of PP is 0.3%
among children with abdominal pain based on the current diagnostic practice.
Better awareness of PP results 1.6% incidence of PP as a reason of abdominal
pain. These data strongly suggest that acute pancreatitis is underdiagnosed
in children.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Many risk factors have been implicated in pancreatic
cancer, including age &gt; 55, male gender, obesity, tobacco use,
pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus (DM). It has been reported in literature
that as high as 80% of patients with pancreatic cancer have glucose
intolerance or frank diabetes.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aim to evaluate if physicians are diagnosing,
reporting, and managing diabetes in patients with pancreatic cancer. A
population-based study, using an IBM platform called Explorys, was used to
collect de-identified patient data. Over 50 million patients, spanning
nationally in over 40 healthcare systems' electronic medical records (EMR)
is in this cloud-based, HIPPA-enabled platform. Data was obtained using
ICD-9 code criteria with search terms “diabetes mellitus” and “malignant
tumor of the pancreas.” Further, patients were also included if they were on
anti-diabetic medications, including metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin.
These search terms were observed to ensure diagnosis of DM after pancreatic
cancer as a first occurrence. Subsequently, HbA1c levels were observed in
correlation to rates of mortality within this cohort.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 50,080 patients in the Explorys database with
diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Of those, 20,160 (40.3%) had concomitant
diagnosis of DM in their EMR. African-Americans had a higher rate of DM
development when compared to Caucasians (50.2% vs. 39.9%, p &lt; 0.001).
Majority of the diabetic patients were aged 60-89, with predominance between
70-79. As levels of HbA1c increased, rates of mortality did as well.
Patients with HbA1c levels between 4-6.4% were found to have a lower
mortality rate than those with HbA1c levels in the range between 6.5–8%
(44.8% vs. 46.6%, p = 0.0293) and 9–12% (44.8% vs. 47.6%, p = 0.00672).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> It has been reported in literature that as high as 80%
of patients with pancreatic cancer have concomitant diagnoses of DM. We
found drastically different percentages; these variations may be due to
several factors. Firstly, it is very possible clinicians are underdiagnosing
diabetes, especially in patients with pancreatic cancer. It is possible
because of the high mortality of these patients, their other diagnoses,
including DM, are being overlooked. Secondly, if DM is being diagnosed,
physicians are not adequately reporting it in a patients' EMR. Moreover,
patients with DM with HbA1c levels greater than 6.5% have a higher rate of
mortality as compared to patients with HbA1c levels below 6.5%. Clinicians
need to be aware of the high incidence of DM in patients with pancreatic
cancer, so proper diagnosis and management can be implemented to possibly
decrease mortality. Increased awareness should be also be in elderly
patients between 60-89, as well as the African-American population where
prevalence was highest. <table-wrap id="table24-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table24-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table24"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Factors</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Pancreatic Cancer</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Diabetes and Cancer</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Rate (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">N</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">50080</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20160</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">40.3</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Males</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">25540</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10660</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">41.7</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age 20-29</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">150</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">13.3</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age 30-39</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">470</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">110</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">23.4</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age 40-49</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1790</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">510</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">28.5</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age 50-59</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">6490</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2160</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">33.3</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age 60-69</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12830</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5260</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">41.0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age 70-79</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">14430</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">6600</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">45.8</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age 80-89</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10230</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">4210</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">41.1</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age 90+</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3420</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1290</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">37.7</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Caucasian</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">37030</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">14770</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">39.9</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">African-American</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">6410</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3220</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">50.2</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Tobacco users</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">22610</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12650</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">55.9</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Alcohol users</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">11700</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">7010</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">59.9</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">BMI &gt; = 30</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">19400</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12550</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">64.7</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) is
associated with a poor prognosis. Current standard treatment is limited to
chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy. Novel treatment approaches are crucial
in attempting to combat this unmet medical need. Phosphorus-32 (P-32)
Microparticles is a brachytherapy device that implants a predetermined dose
of the beta radiation emitting isotope (P-32) directly into pancreatic
tumours via endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guidance. The presented data are
early results from an ongoing international, multi-institutional, single-arm
pilot study. The study objective is to determine the safety and efficacy of
P-32 Microparticles in a patient population undergoing standard chemotherapy
for unresectable LAPC.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Eligible patients were allocated to receive
either gemcitabine+nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX by physician choice. P-32
implantation took place during the 4th or 5th week following the initiation
of chemotherapy. P-32 was implanted directly into the pancreatic tumour via
EUS guidance, using a fine needle aspiration (FNA) needle. Each patient's
dose was calculated from the tumour volume where the absorbed dose of P-32
to the tumour was calculated to equal 100 Gy. Diffusion pattern of the P-32
suspension following implantation was assessed by EUS and by Bremsstrahlung
SPECT/CT imaging. Chemotherapy was continued after the implantation. Safety
data was collected weekly and toxicity was graded using the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Centrally read CT scans
were conducted every 8 weeks to assess response defined as complete response
[CR], partial response [PR], and stable disease [SD]) rate, according to
RECIST 1.1 criteria. FDG-PET scans were performed at baseline and at week
12.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Data is reported on the first 20 implanted patients (12
males and 8 females, median age 65 years [range 54-84]) up to week 16 of
follow-up. At 16 weeks, the objective response rate was 20% – PR in 4/20
patients. The local disease control rate (CR, PR and SD) was 85% – either PR
or SD in 17/20 patients. Median change in tumour volume from baseline to
week 16 was -33% (range +36% to -80%). Total lesion glycolysis (TLG) as
measured via FDG-PET scan showed a median reduction of 54% (range +45% to
-100%) from baseline to week 12.</p>
<p>The EUS-guided implantation was carried out successfully in all patients and
without any complications. By week 16, 318 adverse events (AEs) were
reported. 33 Grade 3 AEs (10%) and 6 (2%) Grade 4 toxicities were reported.
The most common AEs of Grade 3 and 4 severity were neutropenia (7), anaemia
(2), constipation (2), vomiting (2) and fatigue (2). None of the G3 and G4
AEs were attributable to the device or the implantation procedure.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Early data indicates that the use of EUS-guided
implantation of P-32 is highly feasible, well tolerated and has an
acceptable safety profile in combination with standard first-line
chemotherapy for LAPC. Preliminary data shows evidence of tumour regression
and local disease control. These results, however, warrant further
evaluation. The clinical trial is ongoing and additional safety and efficacy
data will be presented.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> An antireflux metal stent (ARMS) for nonresectable
distal malignant biliary obstruction may prevent recurrent biliary
obstruction (RBO) caused by the duodenobiliary reflux and thereby provide
long time to RBO (TRBO). The superiority of the ARMS over conventional
covered self-expandable metal stents (SEMSs) has not fully examined.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We conducted a multicenter randomized controlled
trial to examine whether TRBO of an ARMS with a funnel-shaped valve was
longer than that of a covered SEMS in patients without a history of SEMS
placement. Secondary outcomes included causes of RBO, adverse events, and
patient survival.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> We enrolled 104 patients (52 patients per arm) from
September 2014 to June 2016 at 11 tertiary care centers in Japan. The median
TRBO did not differ significantly between the ARMS and covered SEMS groups
(251 and 351 days, respectively; p = 0.11). RBO due to biliary sludge or
food impaction was observed in 13% and 9.8% patients who received an ARMS
and covered SEMS, respectively (p = 0.083). The ARMS appeared to be
associated with a higher rate of stent migration compared with the covered
SEMS (31% vs. 12%, respectively; p = 0.038). No significant between-group
difference was observed for adverse events or patient survival.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The current ARMS was not associated with longer TRBO
compared with the covered SEMS. Further modifications including addition of
an anti-migration system are required to justify the use of the current ARMS
as a first-line palliative treatment modality for distal malignant biliary
obstruction.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Although ERCP for the palliation of malignant
biliary obstruction is the standard care, post-procedure pancreatitis and
stent dysfunctions are not uncommon. While endoscopic ultrasound
(EUS)-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) has garnered interest as a viable
alternative when ERCP is impossible, its role as a primary palliation of
malignant distal biliary obstruction is yet to be proven.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of the study was to determine whether
EUS-BD is comparable to conventional transpapillary stenting with ERCP in
the primary palliation of malignant distal biliary obstruction. We performed
random allocation to EUS-BD or ERCP in 125 patients with unresectable
malignant distal biliary obstruction at four tertiary academic referral
centers in South Korea.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Technical success rates were 93.8% (60/64) for EUS-BD and
90.2% (55/61) for ERCP (difference 3.6%, 95% 1-sided confidence interval
lower limit -4.4%, p = 0.003 for noninferiority margin of 10%). Clinical
success rates were 90.0% (54/60) in EUS-BD and 94.5% (52/55) in ERCP
(p = 0.49). Lower rates of overall adverse events (6.3% vs 19.7%, p = 0.03)
without post-procedure pancreatitis (0 vs 14.8%), reintervention (15.6% vs.
42.6%), and higher rate of stent patency (85.1% vs. 48.9%) were observed
with EUS-BD at the study end. EUS-BD was associated with more preserved QOL
than transpapillary stenting after 12 weeks of the procedure.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study demonstrated comparable technical and
clinical success rates between EUS-BD and ERCP in relief malignant distal
biliary obstruction. Coupled with longer duration of bile duct patency,
lower rates of adverse events and re-intervention, EUS-BD should be
considered as a viable primary treatment option in patients with distal
biliary obstruction from unresectable malignancy.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Excessive excitation of the esophageal smooth muscle
is thought to induce esophageal hypercontractility. Abnormal inhibition can
lead to premature esophageal contractions, with or without abnormal lower
esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation. Esophageal provocative testing
(multiple rapid swallows, MRS) during HRM evaluates esophageal excitation
and deglutitive inhibition, and could provide insights into the
pathophysiology of hypercontractile esophageal disorders.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to evaluate interrelationships between
excessive excitation and abnormal inhibition in esophageal hypercontractile
disorders, using MRS. Esophageal HRM fulfilling Chicago Classification 3.0
criteria for hypercontractile esophagus (HE) with and without
esophagogastric junction (EGJ) obstruction were reviewed from 5 centers (4
in Europe, 1 in US). Incomplete studies, and prior foregut surgery were
exclusions. Upper endoscopy and barium studies excluded structural processes
(rings, hiatus hernia, stricture). Single swallows (SS) and MRS were
analyzed using HRM software tools assessing integrated relaxation pressure
(IRP, &gt;15 mmHg = EGJ obstruction), distal latency (DL) and distal
contractile integral (DCI); MRS:SS DCI ratio &gt;1 defined contraction
reserve. Comparison groups were achalasia type 3 (positive control for EGJ
obstruction) and healthy volunteers (negative control). Symptoms, HRM
metrics, and MRS contraction reserve were analyzed within HE subgroups and
comparison groups.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Study groups consisted of 40 patients with HE
(62.6 ± 2.0, 63% F), 30 with HE and EGJ obstruction (65.6 ± 2.7, 55% F); 72
with achalasia type 3 (66.2 ± 2.0, 56% F) and 18 normal controls
(27.4 ± 0.7, 56% F). Higher mean DCI values were noted in HE and HE with EGJ
obstruction groups (p = ns between SS and MRS, and between groups), these
DCI values were significantly higher than comparison groups (p &lt; 0.0001
for each comparison). MRS/SS DCI ratio was lower in HE with obstruction
compared to achalasia type 3 (p = 0.03) and normal controls (p &lt; 0.001),
and trended toward significance in HE vs. achalasia type 3 (p = 0.16).
Proportions with contraction reserve were lower in HE subgroups (p = 0.03
across groups). Incomplete inhibition was similar between EGJ obstruction
categories (HE with obstruction, achalasia type 3, p = ns), and lower in HE
without obstruction (p = 0.04 vs. achalasia type 3, p = 0.06 vs all
obstructive categories). On symptom analysis, perceptive symptoms
(heartburn, chest pain) were common in HE subgroups (p = 0.009 across
groups), while transit symptoms (dysphagia) were more frequent in the
setting of EGJ obstruction (p = 0.03 across groups). <table-wrap id="table25-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table25-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table25"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">HE</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">HE with obstruction</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Achalasia type 3</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Normal controls</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">SS DCI mmHg.cm.s</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">8910 ± 515*†</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">8552 ± 1043*†</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3912 ± 398†</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1762 ± 335</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">MRS DCI mmHg.cm.s</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">9640 ± 1602*†</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">9088 ± 2357*†</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">4222 ± 479</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2699 ± 652</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">MRS:SS DCI ratio</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.08 ± 0.15†</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.88 ± 0.11*†</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.42 ± 0.16</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.78 ± 0.30</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">% with contraction reserve</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">38%†</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">40%†</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">49%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">78%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">% with abnormal inhibition</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">50%*</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">60%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">69%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">50%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Dysphagia</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">53%*</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">70%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">76%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Heartburn/chest pain</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">86%*</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">77%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">58%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></p>

</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The esophageal smooth muscle demonstrates excessive
excitation at baseline in HE subgroups, manifest as high DCI and diminished
contraction reserve on MRS. In contrast, abnormal inhibition is predominant
in achalasia type 3, and participates in the pathophysiology of HE with
obstruction. Our findings indicate that the balance of excitation and
inhibition defines the clinical and motor manifestations in HE, HE with
obstruction and achalasia type 3. Provocative testing, particularly MRS, has
diagnostic value in the evaluation of hypercontractile esophageal
disorders.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Esophageal pH-impedance monitoring (MII-pH) can
identify a type of belching disorder that seems to have a significant
behavioural component – supragastric belching (SGB). SGB involves an intake
of air from the mouth into the esophagus, followed immediately by expelling
the air via abdominal straining, without the air entering or originating
from the stomach. We have recently reported our experience on treatment of
SGB using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (Glasinovic et al., 2018). Our
10 weeks CBT protocol consisted of: explaining the possible mechanism of
SGB, raising awareness of the initial warning signals for the onset of the
belch, and teaching patients abdominal breathing manoeuvers and a
mouth/tongue position to prevent it. Out of the 39 patients who completed
treatment, 25 patients (64%) recorded at least 50% improvement in either
their subjective and/or objective outcomes at the end of the 5 CBT sessions
(10-week treatment)</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We <bold>aimed</bold> to assess predictors of
success and to audit subjective outcomes at 6-12 months after completion of
CBT.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> To identify determinants of treatment success, patients
who reported at least 50% symptom improvement (improved group, IG n = 25)
were compared with those who did not (including treatment drop-outs,
unimproved group, UG n = 14) on a range of baseline and in-treatment
variables. All treatment completers (N = 39) were contacted via phone
6-12-months post treatment and 31 (79%) responded. The outcome was measured
subjectively using the 4 item Visual Analogue scale (VAS) score adapted from
Hemmink et al (2010). Patients were asked to rate how bothered they are by
their belching, their ability to control belching, the impact of the
belching on daily activities, and the impact on social activities.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of baseline variables, IG and UG differed only in the
proportions of patients from ethnic minorities. Successful treatment outcome
was related to being able to identify signals for the onset of belching,
acceptance of the behavioural explanation of the condition and adherence to
treatment exercises. The differences between IG and UG groups in symptom
change were significant already after the first week of treatment (t = 2.6;
p &lt; 0.05). At baseline VAS score was: 6.53 ± 2.06; at the end of CBT
treatment 3.45 ± 2.11 and at the 6-12 month follow up it was: 3.82 ± 2.04.
The difference between the baseline VAS and 6-12-months VAS statistically
significant (p &lt; 0.001). At the TE interview patients were asked if they
still continued to use the abdominal breathing technique and mouth opening.
24/31 (77.4%) stated that they continue to follow the CBT treatment on a
regular basis.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Awareness of signals preceding belching and accepting
the behavioural explanation of the condition were factors that predicted
success. The follow up audit at 6-12 month after treatment support the
long-term efficacy of CBT in the treatment of SGB.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Cough reflex sensitivity to inhaled irritants is
influenced by the functional state of cough-triggering afferent nerve
terminals in the larynx and large airways. Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR)
causes irritation of the larynx and possibly large airways. However, the
relationship between the cough reflex sensitivity and LPR is incompletely
understood.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We hypothesized that cough reflex sensitivity in
patients with LPR is positively correlated with LPR. Our hypothesis predicts
that patients with more frequent LPR have lower cough reflex threshold.
Consecutive patients referred for LPR were evaluated and those with positive
reflux symptom index (RSI &gt; 13) and/or reflux finding score (RFS &gt; 7)
were evaluated. LPR was evaluated by 24 hour dual pharyngeal and distal
esophageal 24-hour pH/impedance monitoring. Appropriate distance between
pharyngeal and distal esophageal pH sensors was chosen based on
manometrically determined LES and UES. LPR event was inferred from the
pharyngeal reflux following reflux detection in the distal esophagus. For
each LPR event we determined the maximum drop of pH at the pH
levels &lt; 6, &lt; 5.5, &lt; 5.0, &lt; 4.5 and &lt; 4.0 to perform the
analysis independent of the assumption how acidic the pH of LPR is required
to affect the sensitivity of cough reflex. Cough reflex sensitivity was
determined by single breath capsaicin inhalation challenge of doubling
concentrations of capsaicin (0.49–1000µmol/l) using KoKo PFT system. Cough
threshold was defined as the lowest concentration of capsaicin that evoked
at least 2 coughs (C2) or 5 coughs (C5). For statistical analysis C2 and C5
values were -log transformed and Pearson coefficients were calculated for
correlation with reflux parameters.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 27 consecutive patients were evaluated. The number of LPR
events that reached pH 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 was 14[8-21], 4[2-7],
1[0-2], 1[0-1], 0[0-1]. Correlations between cough reflex sensitivity
expressed as C5 and the numbers of LPR episodes with pH drop to &lt; 6.0,
5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 expressed as the R value were 0.07, 0.04, 0.01, 0.02,
0.23, respectively (p &gt; 0.1 not significant in all cases). Correlations
between cough reflex sensitivity expressed as C2 and the numbers of LPR
episodes with pH drop to &lt; 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 expressed as the R
value were 0.18, 0.03, 0.11, 0.04, 0.14, respectively (p &gt; 0.1 not
significant in all cases). There was no correlation between the cough
sensitivity expressed as either C5 or C2 and the number of LPR episodes,
irrespective of the acidity of the LPR event.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The number of LPR episodes does not correlate with the
cough reflex sensitivity in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux,
irrespective of the acidity of LPR event. This suggests that a direct simple
relationship between the intensity of laryngeal irritation and cough is
improbable.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Anti-Reflux Endoscopic Surgery (ARES) is a new
efficacious treatment of option for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
We propose to define “esophageal remodeling” as the functional restoration
of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) that involves increased lower
esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure. ARES is a endoscopic fundoplication
technique using endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) to treat such refractory
GERD patients. This study investigated the clinical outcomes of ARES for
refractory GERD patients.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> ARES was performed in 106 patients with
drug-refractory GERD from December 2015 to July 2017. We analyzed data from
a prospectively collected database of ARES subjects, which included
preprocedure and 6-month postprocedure of GERD-Q symptom scores, and results
from esophageal high resolution manometry (HRM) and 24-hour pH monitoring.
Symptom control rates were compared according to clinical and surgical
factors to identify predictive factors of successful surgical outcomes.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> ARES was performed for 106 patients (55% male; mean age
46.8 years) with PPI-refractory GERD. Mean PPI medication periods were 5.7
(1-30) years and median ARES procedure time was 32.6 (15-83) minutes. The
GERD-Q score and 24hr pH monitoring were significantly improved after ARES.
Mean post-treatment GERD-Q score was 7.54 ± 2.6, compared to 10.87 ± 2.7
pre-treatment (p &lt; 0.001). In impedance planimetry, the mean
distensibility was 16.1 ± 8.3 prior to and 9.1 ± 5.7, respectively
(p &lt; 0.001). No serious complications after ARES were occurred. But 6
patients underwent post-treatment stricture, and were treated using balloon
dilation and steroid injection. 3 patients suffered from minor post-ARES
bleeding, successfully treated with argon plasma coagulation.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> ARES is a very effective and safe treatment option for
PPI-refractory GERD patients. ARES can be a good alternative treatment for
refractory GERD.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The HEROES study was a 16-week double-blind,
placebo-controlled phase 2 multicenter trial that evaluated the efficacy and
safety of RPC4046 in adult patients with active eosinophilic esophagitis
(EoE). The study included subjects who were considered steroid refractory
based on prior corticosteroid use and investigator judgment. Both
pre-specified and post-hoc analyses were undertaken to assess the effect of
RPC4046 treatment on this important subgroup.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> In this study, 99 adult patients with active EoE
were stratified by steroid-refractory status (yes/no) and randomized 1:1:1
to receive RPC4046 360 mg, 180 mg, or placebo weekly for 16 weeks. The
primary endpoint was change from baseline in mean esophageal eosinophil
count at week 16. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to
week 16 in EoE Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS), improvements in dysphagia
determined by the Daily Symptom Diary (DSD), Eosinophilic Esophagitis
Activity Index (EEsAI) score, and EoE histology scoring system (EoEHSS)
based on grade and stage.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the steroid-refractory patients, 17 were randomized to
RPC4046 360 mg, 14 to RPC4046 180 mg, and 16 to placebo. The differences in
change in mean esophageal eosinophil counts from baseline to week 16 between
RPC4046 360 mg and placebo as well as RPC4046 180 mg and placebo were
statistically significant. The difference in mean change in EREFS between
each RPC4046 group and the placebo group was statistically significant for
total score over all esophageal locations. The mean change in DSD composite
score in the RPC4046 360 mg group compared to the placebo group approached
statistical significance. Statistically significant improvements from
baseline to week 16 in the RPC4046 treatment groups also were observed on
histology as determined by EoEHSS and on symptom severity as determined by
EEsAI. The most frequently reported adverse events in the study were
headache, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, nasopharyngitis,
diarrhea, and nausea.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> RPC4046 treatment improved mean and peak eosinophil
count and histopathologic parameters, improved endoscopic features, and
improved symptoms in steroid-refractory EoE patients. Although this
pre-specified analysis was undertaken in a subgroup of patients in the
HEROES trial, these data provide support that treatment with RPC4046 results
in marked improvement in multiple EoE-related disease measures in
steroid-refractory EoE patients. In the overall study population, ozanimod
was generally safe and well-tolerated. <table-wrap id="table26-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table26-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table26"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Placebo (n = 16)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">RPC4046 180 mg (n = 14)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">RPC4046 360 mg (n = 17)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="4" rowspan="1">Esophageal Eosinophil Count

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic
immune-mediated inflammatory esophageal disorder characterized by symptoms
of esophageal dysfunction and dense eosinophil-predominant infiltration. EoE
constitutes a particular non-IgE-mediated food allergy; avoiding specific
food triggers is the only therapy that targets the cause of the disease.
Limitations from dietary therapy hampering its implementation in clinical
practice promoted the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, mainly swallowed topic
steroids and proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) as first-line therapies for EoE
patients. Comparative studies among available options are lacking. The
<italic>EoE CONNECT</italic> registry resulted from the UEG Link Award
program is a suitable way to document and understand how new patients
diagnosed from suffering EoE are being managed in Europe.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To describe the use and effectiveness of diets,
drugs, esophageal dilation and its combinations as first-line therapies for
children and adults with EoE and to identify potential variables that
influence the choice of therapy. Initial therapy in patients diagnosed with
EoE from <italic>EoE CONNECT</italic> registry (a prospectively maintained
registry of EoE patients from EUREOS) were analysed; effectiveness was
defined in terms of histologic response and symptomatic improvement.
Demographic and clinical variables were considered to identify on
decision-determining factors. Frequency tables were generated for each
treatment category while contingency tables were analysed by chi-square test
using GraphPad software.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 352 patients (186 male) were recruited at 8 centers in
Spain and 1 in Italy. PPIs were the preferred option for first-line therapy
(69.3%), followed by dietary interventions (16.5%) and topical steroids
(fluticasone propionate in all cases) (9.1%), whereas endoscopic dilation
(1.4%) and combination therapy (3.7%) were rarely prescribed. Within PPI
drugs, omeprazole and rabeprazole were the most (49%) and the least (2.7%)
frequently prescribed drugs, respectively. As for dietary options, empiric
elimination diets (EED) were the most commonly chosen alternative (78.3%),
with the six-food elimination diet representing 46.8% of them. A complete
symptomatic improvement was more frequently achieved after an EED (61.1%)
while PPI displayed the highest ratio of no response (28.4%). Topic steroids
were the most effective option to achieve histologic response (69.2%), but
they were assessed in only 13 patients. Overall, PPIs and EED achieved some
degree of histologic response in 54% and 51.2% of patients,
respectively.</p>
<p>Age was identified as an explicative factor for treatment choice: EED were the
most common option for children and teenagers (25.3%) while PPI use
increased with age, reaching a highest rate in patients over 50 years-old
(82.1%). Severity of symptoms revealed a significant explicative factor,
with PPIs constituting the preferred therapy in 88.6% of patients with any
degree of dysphagia, while EED was the first therapy prescribed in 29.8% of
non-dysphagic patients at the moment of treatment initiation (p &lt; 0.001).
Finally, Spanish patients received dietary therapy more frequently than
Italian ones (p &lt; 0.05), who doubled the use of topic steroid after
diagnosis. Differences were also observed among hospitals in Spain
(p &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PPI therapy is the preferred first-line option for EoE
patients in Europe, despite of a high rate of absence of clinical response.
Patients' age and severity of symptoms determined the choice of therapy.
Efforts are needed to harmonize the treatment of EoE patients to reduce
variability in clinical management.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Unnecessary blood cell transfusion (RBCT) increases
the risk of side effects and the cost of the treatment of gastrointestinal
bleeding, without providing benefits.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to assess the appropriateness of RBCTin
acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGB).</p>
<p>This was a retrospective study from January 2013 to June 2017 at a university
tertiary care hospital. Patients with acute LGB were identified using the
International Classification of Diseases (9th Revision) and Clinical
Modification codes for admission diagnosis. A <italic>transfusion
episode</italic> was defined as the interval between the prescription
of RCBT and completion of its administration.</p>
<p>The following variables were defined for each transfusion episode:</p>
<p>• <italic>Appropriateness of the RBCT prescription:</italic> the prescription
was evaluated with restrictive criteria, based on pre-transfusional
hemoglobin (Hb) and the clinical characteristics of each patient in
accordance with the recommendations of the AABB (American Association of
Blood Banks): a threshold of Hb ≥7 g/dL in stable patients, and one of Hb ≥8
g/dL in patients with stable coronary and cerebrovascular disease,
hemodynamic instability or cardiac failure.</p>
<p>• <italic>Appropriateness of the RBCT volume:</italic> over-transfusion was
defined when post-transfusion Hb levels were ≥2 g/dL above the relevant Hb
transfusion threshold for each particular RBCT indication. The number of red
blood cell (RBC) units over-transfused was estimated as the sum of the
differences between actual and target post-transfusion Hb for each
transfusion episode, assuming that one RBC unit increased theHb level by 1
g/dL. Finally the number of transfusion episodes with use of one unit of RBC
(“1-in-1 transfusion”) was considered.</p>
<p>Patients with massive hemorrhage, previous transfusion &lt; 90 days, acute
coronary syndrome, symptomatic peripheral vascular disease or stroke &lt; 90
days were excluded.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 407 consecutive patients with LGB were
identified 106 of whom (26%) were transfused. We included 115 transfusion
episodes in 74 patients (18.2%) with a total of 206 RBC units transfused.
Median age was 82.6 years; 59 (79.4%) of patients were over 70, and 54.1%
were men.</p>
<p>75 transfusion episodes (65.2%) were appropriate. Over-transfusion occurred in
34 episodes (29.6%). A “1-in-1 transfusion” was performed in only 25 (21.7%)
transfusion episodes. The number of over-transfused RBC units was 69
(33.5%). Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of patients and
transfusional episodes.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> RBCT in LGB is inadequate in a third of the cases due
to over-transfusion, caused by an inappropriate assessment of the relevant
Hb threshold of each patient. More measures should be implemented to
increase the appropriateness of RBCT. <table-wrap id="table27-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table27-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table27"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Patients</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">74</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Male</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">40 (54.1%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age (years Median/&gt;70 years</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">82.6/59 (79.7%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Shock (SBP &lt; 100 bpm + heart rate &gt;100

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Current guidelines recommend clopidogrel to be
interrupted for at least 5 to 7 days before polypectomy. We investigate
whether uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy will increase the risk of
post-polypectomy bleeding.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> In this double-blind randomized trial, we
screened for patients receiving clopidogrel due to cardiovascular disease
who required polypectomy. Patients were instructed to stop taking their
prescriptions of clopidogrel 7 days before colonoscopy and were randomized
to 7 days of clopidogrel (75mg daily) or its placebo daily until the morning
of colonoscopy. All patients resumed their usual prescriptions of
clopidogrel after colonoscopy. Primary endpoint was delayed post-polypectomy
bleeding defined as rectal bleeding starting after the colonoscope has been
retracted from the anus to 30 days after the procedure, with hypotension, a
decrease in hemoglobin of ≥2 g/dL from baseline, requirement of transfusion,
prolonged hospitalization, hospitalization, and or hemostatic intervention.
Secondary endpoints were immediate post-polypectomy bleeding and serious
cardiothrombotic events. Immediate post-polypectomy bleeding was defined as
bleeding at the time of polypectomy that persisted despite continuous
irrigation with diluted epinephrine solution for 5 minutes. Serious
cardiothrombotic events were defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction,
non-fatal stroke, or death from a vascular cause within 6 months of
colonoscopy.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 387 patients received colonoscopy of who 216
required polypectomy: 106 patients in uninterrupted clopidogrel group, 110
patients in interrupted clopidogrel group. The cumulative incidence of
delayed post-polypectomy bleeding was 3.8% (95% CI 1.4% – 9.7%) in the
uninterrupted clopidogrel group and 3.6% (95% CI 1.4% – 9.4%) in the
interrupted clopidogrel group (log-rank test p = 0.945). Immediate
post-polypectomy bleeding (8.5% versus 5.5%, p = 0.380) and cardiothrombotic
events (1.5% versus 2%, p = 0.713) were noted.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Contrary to current guidelines<bold>,</bold> our study
does not show any clinically meaningful increase of post-polypectomy

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Endoscopic post-papillectomy bleeding usually occurs
in 3 to 20% of cases or higher prevalence. Moreover, delayed
post-papillectomy bleeding within 1 week is also problematic. However, there
is no definite guideline or consensus for prevention or reduction of delayed
post-papillectomy bleeding. Additive role of prophylactic argon plasma
coagulation (APC) after papillectomy was not defined.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to evaluate the
efficacy of prophylactic APC to minimize delayed post-papillectomy bleeding
and reduce the recurrence or persistence of residual tumors.</p>
<p>A prospective randomized study was performed at 6 tertiary referral centers.
Patients with ampulla of Vater adenoma were enrolled and followed from
January 2016 to March 2018, and were randomized to either the prophylactic
APC or non-APC group. Endoscopic papillectomy was performed using a
conventional snaring papillectomy method without submucosal injection. Then,
the prophylactic APC group underwent APC on the resection margin. Immediate
post-papillectomy bleeding needing hemostasis was not included. On the next
day after papillectomy, all patients underwent follow-up duodenoscopy to
identify post-papillectomy bleeding and followed up with duodenoscopy at 1,
6, and 12 months. The main outcome measurements were delayed (&gt;24 h)
post-papillectomy bleeding rate and tumor persistent rate between 2
groups.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 48 patients underwent endoscopic papillectomy.
Delayed bleeding rates in the prophylactic APC and non-APC groups were 33.3%
(8/24) and 16.7% (4/24), respectively (p = 0.336). Tumor persistence at 1
month did not differ between the 2 groups (8.3% vs. 4.2%, p = 0.401).
However, both groups did not have tumor recurrence at 6 months (0/24 and
0/24). The mean tumor length and width were 11 and 12 mm in the prophylactic
APC group, and 13.6 and 12.7 mm in the non-APC group. En-bloc resection
rates in the prophylactic APC and non-APC groups were 83.3% (20/24) and
95.8% (23/24), respectively. Positive resection margin rates in the
prophylactic APC and non-APC groups were 66.7% (16/24) and 33.3% (8/24),
respectively (p = 0.076). Post-procedure pancreatitis rates were 20.7%
(5/24) in the prophylactic APC and 37.5% (9/24) in the non-APC groups,
respectively (p = 0.295). The severity of pancreatitis did not differ
between the 2 groups. There were no procedure-related mortalities or serious
complications.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The prophylactic APC may be not effective in reducing
delayed post-papillectomy bleeding or remnant tumor ablation. The
prophylactic APC seemed to have a higher tendency of delayed
post-papillectomy bleeding without statistical difference, and might be not
have additive role on tumor persistent or ablative effect during short-term
follow-up.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Pseudoaneurysms may occur in both acute and chronic
pancreatitis. Gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common presentation
after rupture. Pseudoaneurysm can be of different size and can have
different wall thickness. Managing peripancreatic pseudoaneurysms is complex
and challenging. Failure in radiological intervention is followed by
surgery. We present a series of Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided treatment
of 6 patients with pseudoaneurysms involving splenic artery (1 patient),
gastroduodenal artery (GDA) (3 patients) and hepatic artery (2 patient)</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> All 6 patients were male. 4 patients presented
with gastrointestinal bleeding. 3 patients had chronic pancreatitis while 2
were associated with acute pancreatitis. Initial selection of treatment by
EUS was made by size and wall of pseudoaneurysm which can be thin walled or
thick walled. As per inner diameter, they can be of 3 types: small
(&lt;2cm), large (2-4 cm) or giant (≥ 4cm). There were 3 giant, 1 large and
2 small pseudoaneurysms. 4 had thick wall while 2 had thin wall. Different
modalities of EUS guided treatment were used singly or in combination. These
modalities were coils, thrombin and glue. The sizes of coils were dependant
on the size of aneurysm. It was inserted with 19 Gauge needle. Thrombin was
injected in boluses of 500 IU per ml using 25 Gauge needle. Cyanoacrylate
glue was injected around 1 or 2ml using 22 Gauge needle. 2 thin walled
pseudoaneurysm were treated with thrombin injection. 1 giant splenic artery
pseudoaneurysm was treated with combination of coil, thrombin and glue. 1
large GDA pseudoaneurysm was treated with combination of coils and thrombin.
1 small thick wall GDA pseudoaneurysm was treated with 2 ml of glue
injection. 1 giant hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm was treated with 2 sessions
of coiling.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There were no major complications. All 6 patients had
complete or near complete occlusion of pseudoaneurysm which was evaluated by
abdominal ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound. Multiple sessions were
required in 4 patients while 2 were treated with single session.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> • EUS guided treatment of pseudoaneurysms appears as
effective, feasible and safe technique with many choices of obliteration
i.e. Coil, thrombin and glue at the disposal of endosonographer</p>
<p>• It can ensure complete obliteration of pseudoaneurysm with no major
complications</p>
<p>• It is evolving technique which requires further standardization, more studies
and comparative studies with interventional radiology</p>
<p>• The operator should be familiar with all three modalities of treatment i.e.
Coil, thrombin and glue</p>
<p>• Whether single or multimodality EUS guided treatment will be decided by
operator preference, type of aneurysm, local availability and further
studies</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Gastrointestinal haemorrhage by rupture of
gastroduodenal varices has an incidence of 3 to 30% and represents
approximately 10% of all upper gastrointestinal haemorrhages associated with
portal hypertension (PHT). The aim of this work is to evaluate the
therapeutic efficiency and complications of diluted chemical glue injection
in glucose serum as an endoscopic haemostasis technique.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective study of 24 patients
compiled between January 2012 and April 2018. All patients were admitted
with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. They all had benefited from a
gastroscopic fibroscopy that had objectified bleeding caused by rupture of
gastroduodenal varices. Methacryloxysulfolane-associated
n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Glubran 2) was prepared with glucose serum. The
endoscopic treatment performed under sedation, consists of the injection of
chemical glue at the level of gastroduodenal varices.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The average age of our patients was 51 years [23 years
-76 years]. A female predominance was noted, with a sex ratio F/M: 2.4.
Glucose injection into gastric varices was performed in 22 patients (91.7%)
of whom 12 had GOV2 (55%), 8 had IGV1 (36%), 2 had GOV1 (9%). Ectopic
duodenal varicose veins were found in 2 patients (8.3%). The injection was
performed at 1 or 2 sites of the ruptured varice. The initial haemostasis
was obtained in 100% of cases. Recurrence was noted in 2 patients. No
immediate or delayed complication was noted.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results confirm that endoscopic hemostatic
treatment of hemorrhages from ruptured gastroduodenal varices by chemical
glue diluted in glucose serum is effective and less expensive compared to
dilution in Lipiodol which is not always available in our context.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Portal venous system (PVS) is one of the most
inaccessible systems of the body. Acute thrombosis of portal venous system,
resulting in mesenteric ischemia has a high morbidity and mortality.
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided access to the PVS is possible. We report
EUS guided thrombolysis of acute portal venous system thrombosis in 6
cases.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Between December 2015 and march 2018, all
symptomatic patients presenting with acute thrombosis of portal venous
system with/ without mesenteric ischemia were included in the study.
Informed consent was taken. Diagnosis was achieved by clinical evaluation
(abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominal distension) and CT abdomen (thrombus in
PVS with/ without abnormal thickening of ischemic bowel wall). Only patients
without indication for surgery, i.e. bowel infarction, bowel perforation,
were included. All patients had variable extent of acute thrombus along with
dilated portal venous system and clinical features of impending mesenteric
ischemia. All patients received intravenous fluids, antibiotics and low
molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Patients without clinical improvement to
anticoagulation therapy at 48 hours were taken for EUS guided
thrombolysis.</p>
<p>Entry into the portal venous system was possible by EUS-guided puncture and
injection of streptokinase was given as continuous catheter thrombolysis
with 30000 unit/hour in three cases. Bolus injections of 50000 units were
given in portal vein, splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein in 3
cases<italic>.</italic> For bolus injection, the splenic vein was
punctured from body of stomach, the portal vein was punctured from duodenal
bulb and the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) was punctured from descending
duodenum. For continuous catheter thrombolysis SMV was punctured through the
pancreas with a 22 gauge EUS- FNA needle. A .018 inch guide wire was placed
into a tributary of SMV. A tapered tip cannula was advanced over the wire
and cannula was positioned in the tributary of SMV. The scope was removed
while leaving the cannula in place, the cannula was routed through the nose
and a syringe pump was fitted for infusion of thrombolytic agent. The
thrombolysis was continued for 72 hours to 10 days depending on symptom
improvement. Regular follow-up was done to monitor for GI bleed. The
thrombolysis catheter was removed in all cases under endoscopic guidance to
monitor for a possible bleed from catheter site.</p>
<p><bold>Results: <italic>Procedure related:</italic></bold>Technical success as defined by successful catheter placement in PVS
was achieved in all patients (100%). During hospital course, 1 patient had
catheter site bleed while catheter was <italic>in situ</italic>, for which
hemostasis was achieved by inflating an enteroscope assisting device of
balloon, fitted over the scope. 1 patient had mild ooze on catheter removal
which was controlled by inflating an enteroscope assisting device of balloon
fitted over the scope. 1 patient developed splenic infarct on day 7. Despite
infarction, thrombolysis could be continued till the resolution of ileus on
day 10.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Patient related:</italic></bold>All patients tolerated the procedure well. All patients had
resolution in pain and ileus. There was no mortality.</p>
<p>There was complete resolution of thrombus in 4 cases with partial resolution in
2 cases</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> EUS-guided thrombolysis should be considered in
life-threatening acute PVS thrombosis. Multicentre trials in larger number
of cases are required and comparison with interventional radiology methods
needs to be planned. We require dedicated accessories to ensure continuous
delivery.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The gastrointestinal mucosa represents the main
interface between dietary components and the organism. Lunasin is a 43-amino
acid peptide naturally present in soybean protein with a variety of
biological functions demonstrated by <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, cell
cultures and animal models. Nevertheless, its physiological relevance in
human primary intestinal cells has been scarcely investigated.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Our aim, therefore, was to evaluate the
<italic>ex vivo</italic> biological activity of peptide lunasin in the
healthy human intestinal mucosa. Peptide was obtained by chemical synthesis.
Colonic biopsies from healthy controls were conditioned with peptide lunasin
(5, 50, and 200 µM), both in the presence and absence of pro-inflammatory
lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The cytokine milieu (IL-1β, IFN-α2, IFN-γ, TNF-α,
MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-23, and IL-33) was
subsequently assessed on the culture supernatants following overnight
culture. The stability and/or modification of peptide during culture was
evaluated by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry
(HPLC-MS/MS).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Peptide lunasin exerted immunomodulatory effects on the
human intestinal mucosa determined by changes on the global cytokine milieu.
While lunasin 5 µM was not biologically active, it regulated the cytokine
profile at 50 µM expanding the production of IL-10 and IL-33 by intestinal
mucosa. Moreover, at higher doses (lunasin 200 µM), this peptide lowered the
production of IFN-γ, IL-6 and MCP-1, as well as enhanced an innate immune
response characterized by induction of intestinal IL-1β and TNF-α cytokines.
Nevertheless, this peptide did not modulate the global cytokine profile when
intestinal mucosa was exposed to LPS. The response of colonic biopsies
towards the conditioning with peptide lunasin was monitored by HPLC-MS/MS,
confirming its presence during cultures.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Bioactive food peptides may exert physiological
effects related to digestive health given their direct and continuous
contact with immune mucosa. Peptide lunasin modulated in resting conditions
the immune cytokine profile of the healthy intestinal mucosa. This peptide
might represent, therefore, a novel agent as functional compound for the
prevention of immune and inflammatory-mediated intestinal disorders.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory
characterized from an aberrant immune response favoring by gut microbiota in
genetically predisposed individuals and/or under the influence of
environmental factors like a high-fat diet. In this context, CD is
characterized by an abnormal ileal colonization by adherent-invasive
<italic>E. coli</italic> (AIEC) and an expansion of mesenteric adipose
tissue (AT). Currently, immunosuppressive or biological treatments used in
CD are not curative and have many side effects. In this context, physical
activity (AP) could be an attractive alternative therapy through its
anti-inflammatory properties, its ability to effectively decrease TA and
favorably modulate the gut microbiota composition.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study is to analyze the
preventive effect of spontaneous PA on gut-adipose tissue cross-talk in
CEABAC10 mice exposed by AIEC bacteria after training. 36 male CEABAC10 mice
were divided in spontaneous PA (WHEEL; n = 24) and the control group (CONT;
n = 12) during 12 weeks. The distance and the speed performed in WHEEL group
were weekly recorded. After this period, both groups were exposed to AIEC LF
82 for 6 days and were killed 4 days later. Animals were fed with high
fat/high sugar diet (HF/HS) over all study duration and a per feeding was
performed on CONT group. Body composition was analyzed by EchoMRI and the
weighing of tissue was realized post-mortem. Glycemic control was evaluated
through fasting glycaemia, insulinemia and an oral glucose tolerance test.
The level of AT cytokines secretion (IL-6 and KC) was measured by ELISA. The
expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin) was determined by
western-blot and used as a marker of intestinal permeability. Gut microbiota
was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq Platform.
Fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentrations were determined using
gas liquid chromatography.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Over the 12 weeks, WHEEL group ran an average of
3.6 ± 0.4 km per day at an average speed of 8.5 ± 0.7 m.min<sup>-1</sup>.
The mean total mass in WHEEL group was lower compared to CONT from week 7 to
the end of protocol (p&lt;0.05). Total fat mass at 12 weeks was inferior in
WHEEL group compared to CONT group (p&lt;0.05). Before bacterial exposition,
glycemic control (fasting glycaemia, insulinemia and plasma glucose OGTT
responses) were not affected by spontaneous PA, however, the distance run
and the speed were associated with lower fasting glucose and an increase of
glucose tolerance (p &lt; 0.05). Mesenteric AT was lower in WHEEL group, and
a negative correlation was found between mesenteric AT and distance ran
(r = −0.6, p&lt;0.05). Tight junction protein content increased with
spontaneous PA. Beneficial and anti-inflammatory genera (Bifidobacterium and
Lactobacillus) in CONT group decreased while the AP favors slimming-related
genera (Oscillospira) and SCFA producers (Ruminococcus). Concomitantly,
propionate and butyrate were higher in WHEEL group (p = 0.05).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Spontaneous PA favors a modification of the gut
microbiota composition of CEABAC10 mice in response to HF/HS diet and
bacterial exposition. This modification could be related to the decrease of
total fat mass and more likely to the mesenteric AT reduction. These effects
were greater when the average distance performed and the mean speed were
higher. These preliminary results obtained in a rodent model could be
expanded to patients with CD in therapeutic clinical protocols. Physical
activity could then be considered in patients with CD in order to
substantially improve their quality of life.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Genome-wide association studies identified many risk
genes for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).<sup>(</sup><italic><sup>1</sup></italic><sup>)</sup> Amongst these, many genes encode proteins that are
involved in proteostasis, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.
Understanding how such defects in proteostasis induce anti-inflammatory
protective responses could lead to novel therapy.<sup>(</sup><italic><sup>2</sup></italic><sup>)</sup> An important mechanism of protection in the intestine
is the production of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) by plasma cells.<sup>(</sup><italic><sup>3</sup></italic><sup>)</sup> Interestingly, plasma cell accumulation around the
intestinal crypts, so-called basal plasmacytosis, is a phenomenon often
observed in inflammatory bowel disease.</p>
<p>We set out to investigate whether ER stress induces protective IgA
responses.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To model the role of ER in the intestine, mice
were developed in which X-box binding protein-1 is deleted specifically in
the intestinal epithelium (<italic>Xbp1</italic><sup>ΔIEC</sup>). IgA
deficient (IgA<sup>−/−</sup>), B cell deficient µMT mice, and TCRβ deficient
(TCRβ<sup>−/−</sup>) mice were crossed to
<italic>Xbp1</italic><sup>ΔIEC</sup>mice to generate double KO
animals. PP-deficient animals were generated by injecting pregnant females
at gestational day 13.5 with anti-IL7Rα, which abrogates PP ontogeny. Germ
free (GF) <italic>Xbp1</italic><sup>ΔIEC</sup>mice were generated as
previously described.</p>
<p>Intestinal lamina propria (LP), Peyer's patch (PP) and peritoneal immune cell
populations were studied using flowcytometry and immunohistochemistry.
Inflammation was assessed on H&amp;E stained tissue sections from small
intestines, by an expert pathologist, as previously described.<sup>(</sup><italic><sup>4</sup></italic><sup>)</sup>
</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold>
<italic>Xbp1</italic><sup>ΔIEC</sup>mice exhibited inflammation particularly
in the terminal ileum, as previously described.<sup>(</sup><italic><sup>5</sup></italic><sup>)</sup> Interestingly,
<italic>Xbp1</italic><sup>ΔIEC</sup>mice had significantly increased levels
of LP IgA<sup>+</sup>plasma cells and increased luminal and serum IgA as
compared to littermate controls. IgA protected from inflammation as
IgA<sup>−/−</sup><italic>Xbp1</italic><sup>ΔIEC</sup>mice or B cell
deficient µMT<italic>-Xbp1</italic><sup>ΔIEC</sup>mice had increased small
intestinal inflammation.</p>
<p>IgA<sup>+</sup> plasma cells were not derived from Peyer's patches (PP), as no
increase in either Fas<sup>+</sup>GL7<sup>+</sup>germinal center B cells or
CXCR5<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>+</sup>T follicular helper cells was
observed. In addition, PP deficient <italic>Xbp1</italic><sup>ΔIEC</sup>
mice or TCRβ<sup>−/−</sup><italic>Xbp1</italic><sup>ΔIEC</sup> mice had a
similar increase in LP IgA+ plasma cells compared to PP deficient and
TCRβ<sup>+/+</sup>littermate controls. Instead, a significant increase
in peritoneal B1 cells was observed, an innate-like limb of the B cell
system. Interestingly, the IgA response occurred independent of the presence
of inflammation or microbiota as germ free (GF)
<italic>Xbp1</italic><sup>ΔIEC</sup>mice, that lack microbes and do
not develop inflammation, had increased levels of LP IgA<sup>+</sup>plasma
cells as well.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We here show that innate-like, peritoneal B1
cell-derived IgA responses are under the control of epithelial ER stress.
The IgA response is not induced in the Peyer's Patches and does not require
T-cell help. It occurs independently of either microbes or inflammation
making it a self-contained, host-derived response. We further show that such
a response serves a critical role in protecting the mucosa and requires
secretion of IgA into the lumen. We propose that this homeostatic function
of epithelial ER stress is conceptually a novel and beneficial “eustress”
response that is functionally opposed to its well-described involvement in
pro-inflammatory pathways.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by
aberrant regulation of tight junctions (TJ), which leads to intestinal
barrier defects. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
and interleukin (IL)-8/18 have a pivotal role in intestinal epithelial cells
(IEC) for restoration of gut mucosal barrier defect during colitis.
Previously, we showed that Catestatin (CST), a chromogranin-A (CHGA)-derived
peptide, regulates immune communication and STAT-3 in the gastrointestinal
tract.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of CST
on IEC functions during the development of colitis using human biopsies from
patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC), human colonic epithelial
cells, and an experimental model of UC (dextran sulfate sodium
[DSS]-colitis). The expression of CST and its correlation with mRNA levels
of TJ proteins (Claudin-1 [<italic>CLDN1</italic>], zonula occludens-1
[<italic>ZO1</italic>], occludin [<italic>OCLN</italic>]),
epithelial-associated cytokines (<italic>IL8, IL18</italic>), and
<italic>STAT3</italic> were quantified in patients with UC using ELISA
and RT-qPCR. Acute colitis (5% DSS, 5 days) was induced in C57BL/6 mice.
Preventive CST (1.5 mg/kg/day) treatment or vehicle started 1-day before
colitis induction and lasted for 5-days. Disease activity index (DAI), TJ
proteins (Cldn1, Zo1, Ocln), and IL-18 were determined. Caco-2 epithelial
cells were treated with CST (100 ng/ml) for 24 h in presence or absence of
STAT3-inhibitor (STATTIC) then exposed for LPS (1 mg/ml) or 5 % DSS for an
additional 24 h. Proliferation, viability, and migration of caco-2 cells
were quantified using proliferation, MTT and wound healing
assay<italic>.</italic> Levels of phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3), TJ proteins
(CLDN1, ZO1, OCLN), IL-8, and IL-18 in LPS- &amp; DSS-stimulated caco-2
cells were quantified.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In UC patients, level of CST, TJ proteins (CLDN1, ZO1,
OCLN), and STAT3 are significantly decreased and IL-8, IL-18 increased when
compared with healthy individuals. Colonic expression of CST showed a strong
positive linear relationship with TJ proteins (CLDN1, ZO1, OCLN) and STAT3,
and a strong negative correlation with IL8 and IL18. Experimentally, CST
reduced the onset and severity of colitis and the colonic levels of IL-18,
and maintained colonic expression of <italic>Cldn1, Zo1, Ocln,</italic> and
enhanced the level of phosphorylated (p)-STAT3. <italic>In vitro,</italic>
CST significantly increased proliferation, viability, and migration of
caco-2 cells in naïve conditions and in response to LPS- &amp; DSS-induced
epithelial injury. CST enhanced the p-STAT3 in both LPS- &amp;
DSS-stimulated epithelial cells. CST also reducedthe release of IL-8/IL-18
and maintained the expression of TJ proteins in response to LPS and DSS. In
parallel, the presence of STATTIC, the beneficial effect of CST on IL-8 and
IL-18 release and expression of <italic>CLDN1, ZO1, OCLN</italic> was
abolished.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Here, we extend our previous findings by showing that
CST is associated with epithelial functions in human patients suffering from
UC and we provide additional experimental insights into how CST regulates
intestinal homeostasis and mucosal wound healing via the STAT3-dependent
pathway. Targeting CST in IEC should be a promising therapeutic approach in
situations when the intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis is disturbed in
UC patients.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation is a
promising strategy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, low cell
retention and engraftment after transplantation diminish the clinical
application of MSCs in IBD. In our previous report, a synthesized bioactive
hydrogel by immobilizing the C domain peptide of insulin-like growth
factor-1(IGF-1C) on chitosan formed a hydrogel matrix which can refresh stem
cells by mimicking niche. Hence we aim to investigate whether
co-transplanting this hydrogel with human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem
cells (hP-MSCs) into the damaged colon could ameliorate trinitrobenzene
sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis and illustrate its mechanism.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Utilizing the lentivirus transfected into hP-MSC
which steadily express fireflyluciferase (Fluc) and green fluorescent
protein (GFP) thereby can be measured proliferation effect of CS-IGF-1C
hydrogel for hP-MSCs and tracked by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and
histology, respectively. Colitis was induced with TNBS via enema, mesenteric
injection of PBS, chitosan hydrogel, or chitosan-IGF-1C hydrogel with
hP-MSCs or PBS without hP-MSCs were performed. After living imaging by BLI
for measuring the survival of hP-MSCs and reactive oxygen species (ROS),
intestinal tissues were collected for histopathologic analyses.
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were tested by real time PCR.
Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses are conducted for detecting the
phenotype of macrophages after transplantation. Enzyme linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) was performed for testing PGE2 from the supernatant of
hP-MSCs.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Comparing with free hydrogel or chitosan hydrogel only,
the CS-IGF-1C hydrogel significantly increased stem cell proliferation
demonstrated by BLI. Moreover, in vivo studies indicated that CS-IGF-1C
hydrogel promoted hP-MSCs survival confirmed by BLI and co-transplantation
of CS-IGF-1C hydrogel with hP-MSCs ameliorated mice colitis dramatically:
increased body weight decreasing IL-1, IL-6 and ROS, alleviated intestinal
inflammation, achieved histological improvement compared with free hydrogel
or chitosan hydrogel only. Additionally, CS-IGF-1C hydrogel could promote
hP-MSC releasing PGE2, polarizing M2 macrophages accompanying expression of
Interleukin-10 (IL-10), furthermore reducing the level of M1 macrophages
<italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Topical application of CS-IGF-1C hydrogel implanted
hP-MSCs significantly ameliorates mouse colitis via promoting these donor
cells releasing PGE2, which polarizes M2 macrophages accompanying IL-10
expression. To our knowledge, this is the first report on co-transplantation
with CS-IGF-1C hydrogel and MSCs on IBD as well as the local-injection as
administration which improve the therapeutic effectiveness of MSCs on
TNBS-induced colitis significantly. These data could benefit the expansion
of application of MSCs transplantation on IBD treatment.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic remittent
inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract that arises from a
deranged interplay of the immune system, microbiota and unknown
environmental factors in genetically susceptible hosts. GWAS studies
recently revealed a genetic association of gluthatione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)
with the development of CD (1). Reduced GPX4 activity leads to a form of
iron-dependent regulated cell death that is termed ferroptosis. Recent
findings linked ferroptotic cell death with incorporation of polyunsaturated
fatty acids into biological membranes, including arachidonic acid (AA) (2).
AA is contained within a western style diet and especially animal products.
The consumption of these fatty acids paralleled the increased IBD incidence
in the last decades. However, the role played by AA in intestinal
inflammation is unknown.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> In this study we aimed to investigate the
influence of AA on intestinal epithelial cells, with reduced GPX4 expression
evoked by siRNA silencing. For <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis we crossed
<italic>Gpx4<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> (3) mice with
<italic>Villin-Cre<sup>+/</sup><sup>−</sup></italic> mice to
obtain
<italic>Gpx4<sup>flox/wt</sup>;Villin-Cre<sup>+/</sup><sup>−</sup></italic>
(<italic>Gpx4<sup>+/</sup><sup>−</sup><sup>IEC</sup></italic>)
mice. We investigated an inflammatory phenotype in
<italic>Gpx4</italic>-deficient murine MODE-K small intestinal epithelial
cells (IEC) and organoids from
<italic>Gpx4<sup>+/</sup><sup>−</sup><sup>IEC</sup></italic>mice upon AA treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> IECs that were <italic>Gpx4</italic> silenced, showed
increased lipid peroxidation and ferroptotic cell death which was aggravated
by AA. Ferroptosis was paralleled by production of IL-6 and the IL-8
homologue CXCL1. Cytokine production and death were governed by ferric iron.
Ferroptotic IECs also released damage associated molecular patterns that
induced neutrophil chemotaxis. Organoids from
<italic>Gpx4<sup>+/</sup><sup>−</sup><sup>IEC</sup></italic>mice showed diminished viability and a distorted morphology upon
treatment with AA and ferric iron. Moreover,
<italic>Gpx4<sup>+/</sup><sup>−</sup><sup>IEC</sup></italic>mice that were orally challenged with AA and ferric maltol showed
neutrophilic infiltration in the proximal small intestine as well as
increased CXCL-1 expression, while wildtype littermates were unaffected.
Treatment with a-tocopherol protected
<italic>Gpx4<sup>+/</sup><sup>−</sup><sup>IEC</sup></italic>mice from neutrophilic inflammation.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our data shows that AA and ferric iron promote lipid
peroxidation and cytokine release in GPX4-deficient IECs which trigger
neutrophilic inflammation in mice with reduced GPX4 levels in the intestinal
epithelium. As such, we identified an environmental trigger within a western
diet that instigates intestinal inflammation in susceptible hosts.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> It is now well-established that IL-33 and its
receptor, ST2, are important factors in the pathogenesis of IBD. However,
animal studies to uncover their mechanistic function(s) during gut mucosal
inflammation have yielded ambiguous results.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of our study was to characterize the
precise role of the IL-33/ST2 axis following acute epithelial injury and
mucosal repair in DSS-induced colitic mice. 3% DSS was administered for 5d
to C57/BL6 wild-type (WT), <italic>Il-33<sup>−</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>−</sup></italic>and <italic>St2<sup>−</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>−</sup></italic> mice.
DSS was then replaced with drinking water for 2 wks (recovery period).
Another group of WT mice received DSS for 5d and IL-33 (33ug/kg, i.p.) or
vehicle (VEH) every other day during the recovery period. Mice were
sacrificed either after DSS challenge or after 1 or 2 wks of recovery.
Control mice (CT) not exposed to DSS were sacrificed at similar time points.
Body weight, occult blood test, and stool consistency were measured daily to
calculate the Disease Activity Index (DAI), and endoscopic and histological
evaluation of colons were performed using established scoring systems. IHC,
qPCR and western blot were done on full-thickness colons for IL-33 and ST2
localization, mRNA expression and evaluation of protein isoforms,
respectively. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) were isolated from colitic
mice treated with IL-33 or VEH during recovery and processed for qPCR.
Caco-2 cells were grown to 80% confluency, cultured with or without rhIL-33,
collected after 6 and 24h, and evaluated for cell proliferation by XTT assay
and scratch assay. Another group of cells was collected after 6h, RNA was
extracted and submitted for microarray analysis. Results were tested at
qPCR. Based on these data, <italic>MIR320</italic> was selectively
knocked-down trough reverse transfection in Caco-2 cells. Control Caco-2
were processed with transfection reagents only (Control). Cells were then
cultured with rhIL-33 following the abovementioned protocol and evaluated at
XTT and scratch assay.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> IL-33, ST2L and sST2 mucosal levels were elevated after
DSS challenge and further increased after 1 week of recovery, before
returning to baseline by 2 weeks of recovery <italic>vs.</italic> CT. IHC
showed intense IL-33 and ST2 staining within the inflamed and ulcerated
mucosa of DSS-treated mice. ST2 staining was more evident during the
recovery phase following DSS, notably localized to IEC and SEMF in close
proximity to areas of re-epithelialization. Both <italic>Il33</italic> and
<italic>St2</italic> deficiency in mice reduced the severity of
colitis after acute DSS, but interestingly dampened epithelial repair
throughout the recovery period <italic>vs.</italic> WT. IL-33 treatment
during recovery decreased endoscopic and histologic score, promoting mucosal
healing, a faster body weight recuperation and disease activity amelioration
<italic>vs.</italic> VEH. At XTT and scratch assay, IL-33
significantly increased cell proliferation and wound healing
<italic>vs.</italic> untreated Caco-2 cells. Microarray analysis
showed IL-33-mediated activation of intracellular proliferative pathways. In
particular, IL-33 administration potently upregulated miR-320
<italic>vs.</italic> untreated cells. These results were confirmed at
qPCR in both Caco-2 <italic>vs.</italic> untreated cells and IECs isolated
from IL-33 treated mice <italic>vs.</italic> VEH. Specific knockdown of
<italic>MIR320</italic> significantly decreased both epithelial
proliferation and wound healing <italic>vs.</italic> Control at XTT and
scratch assay, respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Taken together, IL-33 can play a dichotomous role
during gut mucosal inflammation, stimulates epithelial restitution and
repair, and promotes overall recovery during colitis potentially through a
mechanism involving upregulation of miR-320.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Major advances in recent years have resulted in
improved survival for patients with chronic intestinal failure (CIF). There
is very little data on the future of children that became adult with
CIF.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of our work was to describe this
population since the creation of our center.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> In an approved HPN centre for adults with a dedicated
activity for CIF, we collected retrospectively all data related to patients
treated with home parenteral nutrition during infancy (at least 4 years
before transition to our centre) and transferred in our centre since 1984.
We evaluated demographic data, social evolution and main complications at
theadulthood. Results were expressed as median [ ± SD].</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Among a total of 870 HPN patients followed between 1984
and december 2017, 44 young adults (17F/27M) were transferred from 3
paediatric hospitals. Age of transition was 19 ± 2 years. The principal
etiologies of CIF were short bowel syndrome (n = 18), CIPO (n = 21), mucosal
disease (n = 5). At the end of follow up, defined as the last news or death,
7/44 patients had died (2 after intestinal transplantation, 3 after sepsis,
2 due to liver failure), 3/44 were weaned off PN (2 due to growth factors, 1
after intestinal transplantation), 33/44 were alive requiring HPN (6 ± 1.7
infusions/week; 2.2 ± 1.3l/day; 29 ± 13kcal/kg/day). Oral intake was
2000 ± 1085kcal/day but 9/44 presented remaining oral disorders.
Seventeen/44 had a regular work (35 ± 6.5hours/week). 23 lived with their
parents; 17 lived in partnership and 7 had at least one child.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Despite progress in survival and quality of life in
HPN, many children who become adults stay with their parents and do not
work. The transition requires probably a better social, educational and
psychological preparation if we want to improve the future of these
patients.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Short bowel syndrome with intestinal failure
(SBS-IF) is a rare condition that requires parenteral support (PS). Pivotal
trials with teduglutide (TED) in SBS-IF have demonstrated a PS volume
reduction ≥20% from baseline (BL) in 63% of treated patients at 6 months
(M6). In France, TED has been available since October 2015, and initial
results demonstrated an early response at M3 in 59% of treated patients. The
objectives of the current analysis are to evaluate in the “real-world”
setting the outcomes of treatment and to assess the predictive factors of
response and of PS wean-off at M6 in adults with SBS-IF.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This is a French, multicenter, observational
study looking at the characteristics and outcomes of all adult patients with
SBS-IF who have initiated TED (N = 74). All patients on treatment for ≥6
months between October 2015 and September 2017 are included in this analysis
(n = 54). Clinical response is defined as ≥20% of PS volume reduction from
BL at Week 24 of treatment. Descriptive summary statistics are presented as
mean (range) values, and univariate analysis adjusting for nutritional
variables (age, sex, body weight) have been conducted to identify predictors
of response and of PS wean-off.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 54 patients with SBS-IF were treated with TED (0.05
mg/kg/day) for ≥6 months. 22 (40.7%) were women, age was 52.3 years (range,
22−84) PS duration was 9.8 years (range, 0.5−31), PS days/week was 4.3
(range, 2−7), PS volume was 11,163 mL/week (range, 2000−38,500), and oral
energy intake was 6347 kcal/week (range, 0−16,800). 19 patients (35%) had a
jejunostomy, 27 (50%) a jejunocolic anastomosis, and 8 (15%) a jejunoileal
anastomosis with a remaining small bowel length of 61 cm (range, 0−200). At
M6, 46/54 (85%) were responders and were on 2.8 PS days/week (range, 0−7).
13 of 54 patients (25%) were weaned off PS. The predictive factors of
response at M6 were a high oral energy intake at BL (p = 0.024). The
predictive factors of wean-off at M6 were a jejunocolic anastomosis
(p = 0.007), a low PS volume at BL (p = 0.001), a high oral energy intake
(p = 0.018).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This is the largest real-world adult cohort with
SBS-IF treated with TED. The results of this analysis confirm the efficacy
at M6. Our study identified that net volume PS reduction is higher for
patients with high baseline PS while all types/causes of SBS may benefit
from TED with a similar relative reduction in PS needs. Furthemore, patients
with colon in continuity, low baseline PS volume requirements and high oral
intake are most likely to fully wean-off PS.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Data on the efficacy and safety of long-acting
somatostatin-analogues for postoperative dumping syndrome are scarce. We
previously reported the efficacy of monthly intramuscular long-acting (LAR)
compared to daily subcutaneous octreotide injections using the Arts dumping
score (DS) and its subscales for early and late dumping symptoms (1).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We performed a double-blind, randomized and
placebo controlled cross-over study of monthly subcutaneous lanreotide in
postoperative dumping syndrome. Adults with positive prolonged oral glucose
tolerance test or spontaneous hypoglycemia and global DS ≥10 despite dietary
advice were treated with lanreotide (Somatuline® Autogel 90 mg) and placebo
(each 3 monthly injections) in a randomized double-blind cross-over fashion
with 4-week wash-out period between treatments. Primary outcome was the
effect of lanreotide on DS and overall treatment assessment 3 weeks after
the last injection. Secondary outcomes were (serious) adverse events (AE)
and quality of life (QoL-SF36). Non-parametric analyses were performed on
pooled results (2 periods combined) comparing baseline, lanreotide and
placebo.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 24 patients (66.7% female, mean age 49.1 ± 2.1
yrs, BMI 23.7 ± 0.8 kg/m2) were included with 12 randomized to lanreotide
and 12 to placebo first. Pooled DS after 3 injections were significantly
decreased compared to baseline after lanreotide (median (IQR) 14 (11.5–23)
vs. 22 (16-27); p = 0.032) but not placebo (20 (15-27) vs. 23 (13-29);
p &gt; 0.05). A similar improvement was seen for early (7.5 (4.5–13) vs. 12
(9-16); p = 0.03) but not late (7 (6-10.3) vs. 9 (6-13); p &gt; 0.05) DS.
The overall treatment assessment correlated negatively with change in DS,
indicating lower scores with increase in DS (r = −0.703, p &lt; 0.002) and
validating the Arts DS. Of the 90 reported AE, 53 (59%) occurred on
lanreotide vs. 37 on placebo (p &gt; 0.05) with 20 events of diarrhoea (14
lanreotide vs. 6 placebo; p &gt; 0.05). All 7 serious AE occurred during
lanreotide treatment with (sub-) obstruction in 4 patients. Symptom
improvement was not associated with significant changes in the QoL-SF3 and
the vitality subdomain scored higher after placebo vs. baseline (40 (30-50)
vs. 25 (15-32.5); p &lt; 0.01) but not lanreotide.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Lanreotide is effective for treating postoperative
dumping symptoms, although side effects are common and quality of life is
not significantly affected. Future studies should focus on optimal dosing to
enhance tolerability while maintaining efficacy.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The Fontan procedure is used in patients with a
single functioning ventricle due to a complex congenital heart disease. This
results in sustained systemic venous hypertension that in the long term
cause liver damage and, in some patients, protein-losing enteropathy (PLE).
The association between liver disease and PLE is unknown. Addittionally, PLE
is thought to be associated with intestinal inflammation. However, data
supporting this hypothesis is scarce and fecal calprotectin (FC) has not
been assessed in this population.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aim to evaluate if PLE is associated with
liver damage through non-invasive methods and to assess if FC is increased
in PLE. This is a case-control study from an unicentric
prospective-database. Patients were evaluated by blood tests; Fibroscan®;
abdominal Doppler-US, MRI or CT (if pacemaker); and echocardiography and
other cardiological test. PLE was defined as Alpha-1-Antitrypsin clearance
&gt; 27 ml/day. Controls were matched by age and Fontan procedure
(atriopulmonary/extracardiac). IBD was an exclusion criteria.</p>
<p>Univariate analysis using non-parametric tests with adjustment for multiple
comparisons was performed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 14 cases and 15 controls were included. Baseline and
cardiological characteristics are detailed in Table 1. Patients with PLE
presented worse cardiological function. Non-invasive methods suggested more
advanced liver disease in PLE (median): platelets/mm<sup>3</sup> (117,000 vs
153,000, p = 0.01), hepatic Fibroscan® (25.4 vs 14.5 Kpa, p = 0.03), ascites
in US (43% vs 7%, p = 0.03), esophageal varices or intrabdominal collateral
circulation on CT/MRI (64.3% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.03), FIB-4 index (1.4 vs 0.9,
p = 0.016) and LSPS index (2.2 vs 0.38, p &lt; 0.001). No differences were
detected in bilirubin, transaminases or cholestasis parameters.</p>
<p>PLE patients had higher FC values (median) (80 vs 30 µg/g, p &lt; 0.001). No
differences were found in NSAID, anticoagulants or antiagregants
consumption. Calprotectin levels were directly correlated with alpha-1
antitrypsin clearance (rho = 0.6, p = 0.004) and inversely with the cardiac
index (rho = −0.65, p = 0.006), total proteins (rho = −0.68, p = 0.004) and
the body mass index (rho = −0.5, p = 0.01)</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> 1. PLE is associated with more advanced liver
disease.</p>
<p>2. Fecal calprotectin is increased in PLE and correlates with its severity. Our
study suggest that FC could be a useful biomarker in PLE after Fontan
surgery. <table-wrap id="table29-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table29-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table29"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Variable</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Patients with PLE (n = 14)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Patients without PLE (n = 15)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">P values</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age years</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">28.1 (13 -38)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">28.2 (13- 39)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Male Sex</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">71.4% (10/14)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">53.3% (8/15)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.31</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Antiagregant</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">57.1% (8/14)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">73.3% (11/15)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.45</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Fontan surgery: – Atriopulmonar  –

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The high mortality of acute mesenteric ischemia
(AMI) closely correlates with the occurrence of intestinal necrosis leading
to extensive intestinal resection. Recent studies showed that a multimodal
and multidisciplinary management of AMI, including a prompt
revascularization, decreased the overall mortality as well as the rate of
intestinal resection in this setting. These results demonstrated that AMI is
potentially reversible and that preventing its progression to irreversible
transmural intestinal necrosis (ITIN) should be a primary therapeutic goal.
Alongside prompt revascularization, other treatments may help avoid, limit
or delay ITIN and its complications. The aim of this study was to assess the
efficacy of these therapeutic measures in terms of their effect on the
occurrence of ITIN.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We conducted a prospective observational cohort
study in our intestinal stroke center including all consecutive patients
admitted for AMI between January 1st, 2009 and December 31st, 2014. The
primary outcome was the occurrence of pathologically proven ITIN in patients
who underwent surgery within 90 days from admission. Patients with
superficial and non-transmural ischemic necrosis upon pathological
assessment and those who recovered from AMI with no need for intestinal
resection at 90 days after admission were considered not to have ITIN.
Resected specimens were retrospectively reviewed in order to confirm ITIN by
a senior pathologist, expert in gastrointestinal diseases and blinded to the
treatments administered before surgery. The origin of AMI, epidemiological
and clinical data as well as treatment provided (oral and/or IV antibiotics,
antithrombotic drugs, revascularization and delays) were collected. A Cox
regression model with time-dependent variables was performed for statistical
analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 67 patients [(29 (43%) women; median age 54
(40-63) years)] were included. The origins of AMI were arterial, venous,
mixed and non-occlusive in 52%, 37%, 6% and 2% of cases, respectively.
Pharmacological treatment immediately provided upon admission included
intravenous antibiotics (n = 53; 79%), oral antibiotics (n = 37, 55%),
anticoagulant therapy (n = 63; 94%), antiplatelet (n = 29; 83% of arterial
AMI patients), and revascularization therapy (n = 18; 51% of arterial AMI
patients). Median follow-up was 12 months [95% confidence interval
(CI) = 9.6–21.7]. 28 (42%) patients underwent intestinal resection and ITIN
was noted in 23 (34%) of cases. In multivariate analysis, oral antibiotics
was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of ITIN [HR: 0.16
(95%CI = 0.03–0.62); p = 0.01] whereas organ failure was associated with an
increased risk [HR: 15.4 (95%CI = 3.2–73.7); p = 0.001]. Overall mortality
was 13% and ranged from 2% to 35% in patients without and with ITIN,
respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results suggest a protective effect of oral
administration of antibiotics against the occurrence of irreversible
transmural intestinal necrosis in the setting of AMI. A management strategy
including at least oral antibiotics in addition to early revascularization
might reduce or prevent progression of AMI to intestinal necrosis, avoid
surgery and improve survival. Such a strategy should be confirmed with
further prospective interventional studies.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> In small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE), the
presence of residue in the small bowel lumen limits the observation, hampers
the interpretation and may lead to diagnostic mistakes.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to assess differences in the diagnostic
yield of SBCE using 3 different preparation protocols, as well as the rate
of complete examinations and small bowel transit time (SBTT).</p>
<p>Prospective, randomized, blind study, including 101 patients that consecutively
preformed SBCE (PillCam® SB3, Given Imaging). Protocol A: Clear liquids diet
the day before the examination with fasting from 8p.m.; Protocol B: Protocol
A + 2 pouchs of Moviprep® (polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution) in 1
liter of water from 8p.m. of the day before the examination; Protocol C:
Protocol A + 2 pouchs of Moviprep® in 1 liter of water to be consumed after
real-time confirmation of SBCE arrival at small bowel.</p>
<p>Small bowel preparation was classified by an experienced physician, considering
the percentage of the examination in which mucosal observation was adequate:
Excelent (&gt;90%), Good (90-75%); Fair (75-50%); Poor (&lt;50%).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 101 patients were randomized to the 3 protocols (A 37, B
31 and C 33 patients). Protocol C had an excellent or good small bowel
preparation in a higher percentage of examinations (A:37.8% vs B:45.2% vs
C:78.8%, p = 0.002). No significant differences were found between the 3
protocols regarding diagnostic yield (A:59.5% vs B:48.4% vs C:63.6%,
p = 0.445), however protocol C had a higher detection of angiectasia (A:5.4%
vs B:9.7% vs C:27.3%, p = 0.022).</p>
<p>No differences were found between the 3 protocols regarding SBTT
(A:278 ± 123minutes vs B:275 ± 107minutes vs C:244 ± 148 minutes = 0.504) or
complete examinations rates (A:89.2% vs B:100.0% vs C:93.9%, p = 0.171).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In SBCE the administration of Moviprep® after the
confirmation of capsule arrival at the small bowel associated with a better
small bowel preparation and a higher detection of angiectasia. Therefore,
this innovative protocol should be systematically used to improve procedure
results.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Variants within the gene locus encoding protein
tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) are associated with the
development of inflammatory disorders, including IBD. The role of PTPN2 in T
cells and intestinal epithelial cells has been investigated in depth, but
its role in dendritic cells (DCs) remains unclear. Understanding the DC
specific role of PTPN2 is of particular interest, since DCs play a crucial
role in activation of T cells and orchestrating immune responses in general.
Here, we addressed whether loss of PTPN2 in DCs affects the expression of
co-stimulatory molecules and subsequently activation and differentiation of
T cells.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Mice with a LoxP flanked PTPN2 gene were crossed
with mice expressing Cre-recombinase under control of the CD11c promoter in
order to specifically delete PTPN2 in DCs (PTPN2-CD11cCre mice). Using
multicolour flow cytometry, we analysed immune cells in the spleen,
mesenteric lymph nodes, lung, liver, kidney, and skin in PTPN2-CD11cCre mice
and their wild-type littermate controls.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> PTPN2-CD11cCre mice show symptoms of splenomegaly and
skin inflammation, as well as inflammatory infiltrates in the liver and lung
in some mice. Severity of the inflammation varies between individuals,
resulting in spontaneous death in some mice. We found increased expression
of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on PTPN2-deficient DCs. Of note,
there was no difference regarding the expression of MHCII on CD11c+ cells
between PTPN2-CD11cCre and their littermate controls. Consistent with
increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules, we observed increased
numbers of CD44+ effector/memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in lymph nodes
(p &lt; 0.05), liver, lung (p &lt; 0.01) and spleen (p &lt; 0.01) but not in
kidney of PTPN2-CD11cCre mice, indicating an enhanced T cell activation
capacity of PTPN2-deficient DCs. Of note, levels of CD62L+ naïve T cells
were reduced in liver, lung and spleen. In addition, frequencies of
IFN-gamma+CD4+ Th1 T cells were increased in lung (p &lt; 0.05), skin
(p &lt; 0.05), spleen (p = 0.056), and liver but reduced in the kidney.
However, there was no difference regarding differentiation into IL13+ Th2
and IL17+ Th17 T cells. Moreover, loss of PTPN2 in DCs did not affect gamma
delta T cells. Further, there was an increase of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells
in mesenteric lymph nodes (p &lt; 0.05) but we did not observe any
difference in frequencies of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells in kidney, liver,
lung and spleen of PTPN2-CD11cCre mice.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In conclusion, our results show that PTPN2 has an
important anti-inflammatory role in DCs. Loss of PTPN2 in DCs promotes T
cell activation as well as increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules
CD80 and CD86. Further, it affects differentiation into Th1 but not Th2 or
Th17 T cells. However, PTPN2 in DCs does not play a major role in the
differentiation of regulatory T cells. Further studies will investigate the
interaction of PTPN2-deficient DCs and T cells in terms of antigen
presentation and subsequent T cell proliferation and differentiation.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Intestinal fibrosis is a common complication
associated with Crohn's Disease (CD) which cannot be reverted with any drug
and forces repeated surgery. It has been reported that succinate, a
metabolite accumulated in inflammatory pathologies, plays an important role
in the activation of synovial fibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells through
its receptor called SUCNR1 or GPR91.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aim to analyze the relevance of SUCNR1
receptor in intestinal fibrosis.</p>
<p>Intestinal resections from CD patients and colon carcinoma patients were
obtained and the expression of SUCNR1 and α-sma were analzyed by
immunostaining. Primary intestinal fibroblasts from human resections or from
colon of wild-type (WT) or SUCNR1-/- (KO) mice were isolated, maintained in
culture and treated with different concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5mM) of
succinate for 24 hours. Intestinal fibrosis was induced
<italic>in vivo</italic> introducing one intestinal graft from WT or
KO mice into the neck of a receptor mice for 7 days. The expression of
pro-fibrotic markers was analyzed by qPCR. Sirius Red staining was performed
and the collagen layer was quantified using ImageJ. Results are expressed by
mean ± SEM (n≥5). Statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA
followed by Newman-Keuls test. Correlations were analyzed with the Spearman
coefficient.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> SUCNR1 is expressed in epithelial cells and α-sma+ cells
of intestinal resections from CD patients. The SUCNR1 expression positively
and significantly correlates with the expression of α-sma (r = 0.759,
p &lt; 0.0001, n = 24) and co1lA1 (r = 0.82, p &lt; 0.001, n = 24). In
primary fibroblasts isolated from CD patients (13.54 ± 4.6) the expression
of SUCNR1 was significantly higher than in those obtained from control
patients (2.07 ± 0.86). In these cells, succinate induced the expression of
profibrotic markers such as Col1A1, α-sma, Tgfb, and TIMP1 in a
dose-response manner. This profibrotic effect of succinate was also observed
in fibroblasts from WT mice and it was completely reverted in fibroblasts
obtained from KO mice. The murine model of intestinal fibrosis
<italic>in vivo</italic> revealed that: a) the thickness of the
collagen layer was significantly reduced in colons from KO mice compared
with those from WT mice; b) the expression of pro-fibrotic markers such as
col1A1, α-sma and vimentin was also significantly reduced in colons from KO
mice vs colons from WT mice (19.7 ± 10.1 vs 69.8 ± 26.6, 0.9 ± 0.1 vs
2.5 ± 0.5, 1.7 ± 0 vs 12.4 ± 0.3, respectively).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> An increased expression of SUCNR1 receptor is detected
in fibroblasts from CD patients the activation of which induces a
pro-fibrotic effect. This receptor mediates murine intestinal fibrosis and
we propose its blockade as a new pharmacological target in CD treatment.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Imbalance between proteases and their inhibitors
appears to be crucial to the development of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases
(IBD). We have previously shown that colonic biopsies from IBD patients
released higher elastolytic activity compared to biopsies from healthy
controls. In addition, expression of ELAFIN, an endogenous elastase
inhibitor, was significantly down-regulated in mucosa from IBD patients,
compared to heathly controls.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of our study was to<bold>
i</bold>dentify the source of elastase hyperactivity released by IBD
biopsies and to examine its impacts on colonic barrier function and
inflammatory response. <italic>In situ</italic> zymography with FITC-elastin
was performed on cryosections of colonic biopsies from healthy and IBD
patients taken from inflamed and non-inflamed areas. Immunostaining for
epithelial elastase was performed on cryosections from human biopsies, human
organoïds, or from mouse colon. A Caco2 epithelial cell line overexpressing
epithelial elastase (Tg-ELA) was constructed and the potential of elastase
hyperactivity to modulate the release of cytokines and permeability changes
was evaluated. Transgenic murine model, which over-expressed the epithelial
elastase specifically in epithelial cells in a temporally controlled manner,
was developed (pVillin-CRE<sup>ERT2</sup> -ELA) and analyzed at macroscopic
and molecular levels.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold>
<italic>In situ</italic> zymography evidenced strong elastolytic activity in
enterocytes of healthy human colonic tissues, which was greatly enhanced in
inflamed biopsies as well as in non-inflamed biopsies from IBD patients. An
elastase cDNA was cloned from human enterocytes. Immunostaining of colonic
tissues showed that this elastase was only expressed in epithelial cells and
secreted into the lumen. In IBD, the expression of this elastase was
enhanced in the epithelium. Tg-ELA epithelial cells exhibited defective
barrier function accompanied by an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine
expression. Western blot analyses revealed that the major elements of tight
junction, Occludin and Claudin-1, were targeted by elastase hyperactivity
secreted in the medium.</p>
<p>In addition, <italic>in vivo</italic>, over-expression of elastase in the
intestinal epithelium (pVillin-ELA mice) for 3 weeks led to increased
permeability and overexpression of antimicrobial peptides (Reg3g and Reg3b).
Macroscopic damage scoring highlighted intestinal inflammation, with strong
adhesive phenotype.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We demonstrate the presence of an epithelial form of
elastase in the intestine. Imbalance between elastase and its inhibitor in
the epithelium participates in the generation of IBD-associated
symptoms.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2
(PTPN2) has been recetly identified as potential cancer immunotherapy
target. We have previously recognised PTPN2 as a key regulator for
inflammatory responses in the intestine. Our recent data demonstrate that
loss of PTPN2 in myeloid cells using PTPN2xLysMCre conditional PTPN2
knock-out mice results in reduced tumour burden in the azoxymethane
(AOM)-dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) induced model of colitis-associated
colorectal carcinoma. However the role and mechanism of action how PTPN2 is
involved in colon carcinoma development has not yet been studied in detail.
Here, we showed that the tissue specific loss of PTPN2 in dendritic cells
results in reduced tumour load in AOM/DSS mice model.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We generated a mouse line lacking PTPN2 in
specifically in dendritic (PTPN2-CD11cCre) cells. We then induced colon
tumor formation in wild-type (WT) and PTPN2-deficient mice using the AOM/DSS
model of colitis-associated cancer and analysed immune cells in spleen,
mesenteric lymph nodes (LN) and lamina propia in PTPN2-CD11cCre and their WT
littermate controls using flow cytometry and RNA expression levels.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> AOM/DSS treatment resulted in the formation of colon
tumours in both WT and KO mice. Tumour burden varied between individual
mice, however PTPN2-CD11cCre mice had less and smaller tumours comparing to
their WT littermate controls. In turn, PTPN2-CD11cCre mice exhibited
significantly increased levels of CD44+ effector/memory CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells in spleen, lymph nodes and lamina propia, showing an enhanced T cell
activation by PTPN2-deficient dendritic cells. In addition, we observed that
PTPN2-deficient mice also presented significantly increased levels of CD4+
PD-1 and CD8+ PD-1 cell surface receptors on the T cells in spleen and LN.
While expression of PDL-1 checkpoint inhibitor molecule did not differ
between WT and KO in treated and untreated groups, PDL-2 expression was
significantly decreased in the spleen of the treated KO mice comparing to
the DSS/AOM treated WT mice.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In conclusion, our results demonstrate a role for
PTPN2 in the pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma in vivo. Loss of PTPN2 in
dendritic cells exerts anti-tumour effect and results in lower colon tumour
burden in AOM/DSS treated mice. This effect is likely mediated via promoting
anti-cancer immune responses by modulating checkpoint inhibitor molecule
expression.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> In colitis-associated cancer (CAC), tumor protein
p53(TP53) mutation often occurs in the early phase of colon carcinogenesis
known as dysplasia-carcinoma sequence. Although there are some reports about
the relation between TP53 mutation and colon carcinogenesis in mice model, a
direct effect of TP53 mutation on colon epithelial cells and carcinogenesis
in human are still unknown. We therefore aimed to assess the influence of
TP53 mutation by using a CRISPR Cas9 system on human colon epithelial
organoids under long-term inflammation model which we originally
launched.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> TP53 mutation was generated by using lentiviral
CRISPR Cas9 system in 3 different epithelial organoids derived from
individual human colonic mucosa with wild-type TP53 (WT-TP53). Written
informed consent was obtained from all included patients and this study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of Tokyo Medical and Dental University. The
guide RNA was designed to bind exon 10 of TP53. TP53 mutation in organoids
was confirmed by direct sequencing. The expression of TP53 protein was
assessed by immunohistochemistry. Loss of function of TP53 was assessed by
Nutlin3a-resistance and the expression of TP53 target genes. Gene expression
was assessed by microarray analysis and quantitative PCR. The long-term
inflammation model was established by culturing organoids with inflammatory
factors (TNF-a, Flagellin and IL-1β) for 60 weeks. Inflammatory response in
the organoids was assessed by gene expression of inflammatory-related genes
and the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Phenotypes of each organoids
were assessed by MTS Assay, sphere formation assay for cell proliferation
and stemness, respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> At first, we successfully established TP53 mutation in 3
different human colon epithelial organoids. Mutant TP53 was strongly
expressed in nuclei of all organoid cells as often shown in dysplastic
lesion of ulcerative colitis (UC), whereas WT-TP53 was not expressed in
naive organoids. Mutant TP53 also showed Nutlin3a-resistance and
down-regulation of TP53 target genes, indicating the loss of function of
TP53. Moreover, microarray analysis revealed up-regulated genes in the
organoids with mutant TP53, suggesting the gain of specific function of
mutant TP53. We then assessed the effect of mutant TP53 with or without
inflammatory stimulation for 60 weeks. Long-term inflammatory stimulation
attenuated cell proliferation and sphere formation of the organoids with
WT-TP53. Mutant TP53 however enhanced cell growth and stemness with
increased gene expression of c-myc and Lgr5 compared to WT-TP53 under the
inflammatory situation, nevertheless inflammatory response in the organoids
with mutant TP53 was equal to that in the organoids with WT-TP53.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We for the first time showed TP53 mutation alone
enhances cell proliferation and stemness of human colonic organoids under
long-term inflammation. Mutant TP53 cancelled epithelial cell damage by
chronic inflammation, suggesting that these results might mimic the early
step of colitis associated carcinogenesis.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic
nonspecific intestinal inflammatory disease, and its incidence and
prevalence have been increasing in recent years. To date, the etiology and
pathogenesis of IBD are still not very clear, and the latest research
indicates that the imbalance of Th17/Treg cells may play an important role
in the occurrence of IBD. The drugs for IBD mainly include 5-aminosalicylic
acid, glucocorticoid and immunosuppressants and biological agents; although
these medications in many cases are effective, most of the patients are not
stable and can not get good control. Therefore, to explore the pathogenesis
of IBD and find new therapeutic drugs is an urgent problem to be solved in
clinical. Mica is one of the silicate mineral drugs. Previous studies have
shown that mica has the effect of promoting the regeneration and maintenance
of mucosal barrier and anti-inflammatory action of gastrointestinal mucosal
epithelial cells. In this study, the role of Thl7/Treg cells in the
pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and the protective effect and possible
mechanism of mica were investigated by observing the changes of Foxp3/ROR-
in mice with ulcerative colitis induced by TNBS.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Observation the change of the Foxp3/ROR-γt on
tnbs-induced experimental colitis mice. Investigation of the role of
Th17/Treg in ulcerative colitis and investigation of the prevention and
possible mechanism of mica. 30 male balb/c mice of clean grade were randomly
divided into control group, model group and mica group, 10 mice in each
group. In first day, the model group and mica group were initiated by
intrarectal administration of TNBS to establish the model. From the second
day, the control group and model group were intrarectally administrated with
normal saline, the mica group was intrarectally administrated with mica for
three days. On day 5, all the mice were killed, specimens were taken. We
observed the gross and histological damage of colon in mice, tested the
expression of ROR-γt, Foxp3, IL-17A, IL-10 in the colon tissue used by
RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, ELISA.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 1. General situation: The disease activity index score in
model group mice was significantly higher than control group. After the
intervention of mica, the disease activity index score had obviously
decreased comparing with model group. 2. The macroscopic and histological
damage score: The model group was higher than control group. After the
intervention of mica, the score had obviously decreased comparing with model
group. 3. RT-qPCR comparing with control group the ROR-γt, Foxp3, IL-17A,
IL-10 mRNA of model group all were higher expression. The ROR-γt, IL-17A
mRNA of mica group was obviously more decreased than model group, but the
Foxp3, IL-10 mRNA of mica group was higher expression compared with model
group. 4. Immunohistochemistry: Comparing with control group, Foxp3, IL-10,
ROR-γt of model group were higher expression comparing with model group,
ROR-γt of mica group was obviously more decreased than model group. Foxp3,
IL-10 of mica group further increased than model group. 5. ELISA: IL-17A of
model group was higher expression than control group. Mica group was
obviously decreased than model group.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The Th17/Treg and inflammation-related cytokines was
imbalanced in TNBS-induced ulcerative colitis mice; this may be the
important pathogenesis. Mica has a protective effect on ulcerative colitis
mice and its mechanism may be related to adjust the imbalance of Th17/Treg,
increase the expression of IL-10, restrain the expression of IL-17 and
ultimately reduce inflammation.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> While increased Trypsin activity was described in
tissues from IBS patients, the presence and activity of other proteases have
been barely studied. We have recently demonstrated that human intestinal
epithelium is capable of producing a form of epithelial elastase, as well as
its endogenous inhibitor Elafin. In inflammatory bowel disease patients,
epithelial elastase is up-regulated, while its inhibitor Elafin is
down-regulated. Here, we wanted to investigate the role of this epithelial
elastolytic balance in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We used different mouse models of colon
hypersensitivity: one model induced by intracolonic administration of
Protease-Activated Receptor-2 (PAR2) agonist, the mustard oil intracolonic
administration model, the post-infectious visceral hypersensitivity model
induced by <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> infection associated with
water avoidance stress, and the intracolonic administration of IBS patient
tissue supernatants. Visceral nociceptive response to colorectal distension
was measured in those mouse models. We also used tissues from IBS patients
to perform <italic>in situ</italic> zymography, and immunohistochemistry.
Transgenic murine model, which over-expressed specifically epithelial
elastase in a temporally controlled manner, was developed
(pVillin-CRE<sup>ERT2</sup> -ELA) and was used to analyse nociception
and barrier function.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Elastolytic activity was significantly increased in
colonic tissues from mice showing visceral hypersensitivity symptoms after
combined stress and <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection, but stayed at
basal levels in mice that did not develop signs of hypersensitivity.
Elastolytic activity was also up-regulated in tissue exudates from IBS
patients, and this activity was localized in intestinal epithelial cells by
<italic>in situ</italic> zymography. Elafin, the endogenous elastase
inhibitor was also up-regulated in epithelial cells from IBS patients,
compared to healthy controls, suggesting that tissues from IBS patients try
to re-equilibrate elastolytic balance. However, Elafin production does not
seem to be sufficient to bring back elastolytic activity to control levels
in IBS. We therefore tried to deliver exogenously Elafin, by the mean of
food-grade bacteria (<italic>L. lactis</italic>) recombinant for the
expression of Elafin. In hypersensitive mice (that have received
intracolonically PAR2 agonists, mustard oil or IBS tissue supernatants),
oral treatment with Elafin-expressing <italic>L. lactis</italic>
significantly inhibited allodynia and hyperalgesia, while the wild-type
<italic>L. lactis</italic> had no significant effect.
<italic>In vivo</italic>, over-expression of elastase in the
intestinal epithelium (pVillin-CRE<sup>ERT2</sup>-ELA mice) for 10 days
provoked visceral hypersensitivity in response to colorectal distension.
Increased intestinal permeability was also a phenotype observed in mice
overexpressing epithelial Elastase.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We demonstrate up-regulated elastolytic activity
associated with IBS and visceral hypersensitivity. Elastase inhibitor
protects against visceral hypersensitivity. A form of epithelial elastase
up-regulated in IBS generates IBS-associated symptoms (hypersensitivity and
barrier defects), and could constitute a new target for the treatment of
colonic hypersensitivity.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Individuals suffering from functional
gastrointestinal (GI) disorders have been shown to have altered central
processing of visceral stimuli relative to healthy controls (1). Further
such individuals appear to have selective attention to gastrointestinal
words (2) suggesting an attentional bias towards GI-relevant terms which may
explain this phenomenon. They also have increased threat perception (3).
However it remains unclear how much of the attention given to GI words is
conscious versus unconscious. Understanding the extent to which individuals
suffering from functional GI symptoms are unconsciously biased towards GI
words may offer insights into therapeutic approaches to individuals in whom
organic pathology has been ruled out. One previous study inferred an
unconscious attentional bias for GI words through indirect means (Stroop
test) (4) but its methodology was not designed to specifically measure the
pre-attentional phase of central processing.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This study aimed to objectively identify
differences between GI symptomatic and asymptomatic control individuals in
unconscious (pre-attentional) processing of GI words using
electroencephalography (EEG) which has fine temporal resolution. 26 GI
symptomatic and 23 asymptomatic individuals were recruited from the
community. Organic pathology and current mood disorders were ruled out by
self-report. All subjects viewed 20 GI-related words, 20 negative but non-GI
words and 20 neutral words from a validated word bank six times in a
randomised order. Reactions were measured through ERP peak amplitude in the
Occipital region in the P100 period (75-125 milliseconds) as this clearly
corresponds to pre-attentional processing.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Subjects generally exhibited distinctive peak amplitudes
in response to all word types for the P100 period. However there was no
difference in P100 peak amplitude across word type for the GI symptomatic
subjects (p = 0.3). There was no difference in P100 peak amplitude for
GI-relevant words between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects (p = 0.6),
nor was there an interaction between symptomatic status and word type
(p = 0.8). Hence there was no suggestion of difference in P100 peak
amplitude across GI-relevance of words nor symptomatic status.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In contrast to previous work, our data suggest that
attentional bias in FGID individuals is not due to pre-attentional
(unconscious) central processing and that this occurs at a later (conscious)
stage. This finding has positive consequences for the development of
psychological therapies targeting functional GI symptom burden since
unconscious biases are much more difficult to change. <table-wrap id="table30-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table30-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table30"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1">Subject group<hr/></th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Word type</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Symptomatic (n = 26)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Asymptomatic (n = 23)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Gastrointestinal</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">-3.22 (2.68)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">-3.60 (3.67)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Negative</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">-3.39 (2.44)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">-3.57 (3.58)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Neutral</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">-3.35 (2.86)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">-3.75 (3.75)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Combined</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">-3.32 (2.63)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">-3.64 (3.61)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) increases TNF-a
release from peripheral mononuclear cells as the immune system responds to
inflammation in mucosal tissue. This immune response is closely linked with
the intensity of gastrointestinal symptoms and extra-intestinal
comorbidities such as depression or anxiety. We have previously demonstrated
that anti-TNF-a treatment impacts on implicit health cognition via altering
brain function (Gray et al., 2018). Increased psychiatric symptoms in IBD
are commonly explained as driven by an interoceptive mechanism, however
there is scant direct evidence to support these interpretations. To address
this mechanism, we experimentally engaged core interoceptive circuitry and
then examined the influence of anti-TNF-a therapy on brain function in
patients with Crohn's disease.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> 10 patients with Crohn's disease (age
29.3 ± 13.0 yrs, 5 female, 5 ileocolonic, 2 colonic and 3 ileal disease) on
stable anti-TNFα therapy (6 adalimumab, 4 infliximab) were studied twice, in
randomized order, before and after anti-TNFα administration. On each
occasion patients underwent visceral sensory testing (standardized nutrient
challenge) and then functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the
brain during an interoception task. During sensory testing 600ml of enteral
feeding solution was consumed over 15 minutes while the intensity of GI
symptoms was quantified. We used a recognized and commonly employed
experimental protocol to recruit interoceptive neural circuits, heartbeat
perception (See Brener et al., 2016 for a review of experimental
methods)</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Within 72 hrs after administration of anti-TNF-a
unpleasant visceral sensation during nutrient challenge (subjective
fullness) was significantly reduced. Prior to anti-TNF-a, our experimental
task robustly activated core interoceptive circuitry including the
interoceptive sensory (anterior insula) cortex and interoceptive motor
(anterior cingulate) cortex. Surprisingly, activation of interoceptive
circuits was not significantly altered following anti-inflammatory therapy.
Instead, we observed the functional connectivity between the right anterior
insula and the right amygdala was significantly reduced following
anti-TNF-a.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Anti-TNFα agents significantly reduce symptoms during
a standardized nutrient challenge, and alter the strength of communication
between primary interoceptive sensory cortex (anterior insula) and limbic
circuitry (amygdala). Our findings are consistent with previous observations
that greater amygdala functional connectivity is associated with visceral
hypersensitivity (Icenhour et al., 2017). Our findings however are the first
to demonstrate altered amygdala connectivity specific to interoceptive
processing. These findings suggest that the functional coupling between
interoceptive circuits and limbic circuits may be implicated in the
translation of inflammatory conditions into psychological symptoms such as
depression and anxiety. These findings support further examination of how
cytokines including TNF-a may impact on mental health in gastrointestinal
patients.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Sensitization of enteric neurons occurs under stress
conditions such as pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Various
phenomena such as changes in some receptor affinity, production of
inflammatory cytokines and chemical mediators, elongation of enteric neurons
appeared around the enteric nervous system. In addition, morphological
alterations of colonic glial cells occur, and glia-neuronal system
contributes to the colonic hypercontraction of an IBS model
(<italic>Neurogastroenterol Motil,</italic> 2015). However, it is
unknown whether enteric glial cells changes or not under stress
conditions.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We investigated whether stress-related mediators
of the pathogenesis of IBS such as tryptase and corticosterone affect
enteric glial cell (EGC) on cellular activation, cell proliferation,
morphological alterations, and gene induction of neurotrophic factors and
axon guidance factors. EGC (CRL-2690 purchased from ATCC) were used for the
consequent experiments after reaching to sub-confluent condition. Presence
of tryptase-protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), glucocorticoid receptor,
and morphological changes of EGC was evaluated by immunofluorescence method.
For EGC activation, we evaluated expressions of phosphorylated extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (pERK) 1/2 by stimulations with tryptase (100 nM)
and corticosterone (1 µM) by western blotting, and mRNA expression of glial
fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) by real-time RT-PCR. For induction of
neurotrophic factors and an axon guidance factor after stimulation with
tryptase (100 nM) (0.5–6 hrs) and corticosterone (1 µM) (0.5–6 hrs), nerve
growth factor (NGF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and
netrin-1 were analyzed using a real-time RT-PCR. Expression of netrin-1 was
histologically evaluated. To evaluate cell proliferation, we used the MTT
assay method and cell number count.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> PAR-2 was localized in the nucleus of EGC, and
glucocorticoid receptor was observed in the cytoplasm of EGC. Expressions of
pERK1/2 were about 2-fold higher than those of the basal control, and peaked
at 2 min and 5 min after stimulation with tryptase and corticosterone,
respectively. Tryptase but not corticosterone stimulation induced cell
proliferation (1.8–fold). Tryptase significantly increased mRNA expression
levels of GFAP (1.7–fold) at 30 min and 1 hrs. Regarding with morphology of
EGC, corticosterone (1 µM, 6 hrs) but not tryptase remarkably caused EGC
process elongation and long thin process connecting with another distant
EGC. Extended cytoplasm of EGC also appeared by stimulation with
corticosterone alone. Tryptase increased NGF mRNA expression at 1 hr (about
2.5–fold) and GDNF mRNA expressions at 30 min (2.9–fold) and 1 hr
(3.7–fold). Then, increased NGF mRNA expression was continued until 6 hrs,
but GDNF mRNA expressions were gradually decreased. While, corticosterone
significantly decreased mRNA expression levels of NGF by 90% (1 µM), but
increased GDNF mRNA (4-fold, 1µM) at 30 min. Netrin-1 was expressed in the
cytoplasm of EGC. Netrin-1 mRNA expression was increased by both
stimulations (2.5–fold higher, tryptase: 1.8–fold higher, corticosterone),
and its higher expression levels continued until 6 hr.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> There appeared different responses of EGC between
proliferation and morphological changes stimulated by stress mediators.
Imbalanced responses of EGC may associate with induction of neuronal factors
(NGF, GDNF, netrin-1), which possibly regulates neuronal elongation under
stress conditions.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Colonic diverticula are an age-dependent event in
Western countries occurring in up to 65% of people over the age of 60 years.
Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) is a syndrome
characterized by abdominal symptoms similar to irritable bowel syndrome
(IBS) attributed to diverticula. A role for inflammation, sensory-motor
dysfunction, and dysbiosis may have a role in diverticular disease in a
clinical picture that mimics IBS. We hypothesized that mucosal immune
activation, nerve fiber density and sprouting may play a role in symptom
generation in patients with SUDD.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of the present study was to characterize
immune cells, nerve density and sprouting in patients with SUDD,
diverticulosis and healthy controls (HC). 14 HC, 16 patients with
diverticulosis and 10 with SUDD were enrolled in the study. In patients with
diverticula, mucosal biopsies were obtained close to diverticula
(peridiverticular region) and in the normal mucosa. In HC, biopsies were
performed at sigmoid and at descending colon. Immunohistochemistry was used
to stain and quantify immune cells (mast cells, T cells, macrophages), nerve
fibers (using anti-neuronal specific enolase [NSE] antibody) and neuronal
outgrowth (using anti-growth-associated protein 43 [GAP-43] antibody).
Correlation analyses were performed between immune cell counts and nerve
fiber ones.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> No differences were detected in mast cell nor in T cell
counts among the three groups. Macrophages were significantly increased in
patients with SUDD and diverticulosis as compared to HC, both in the
peridiverticular (5.8 ± 0.4%, 6.9 ± 0.6%, 4.9 ± 0.4%, respectively;
p &lt; 0.05) and in normal mucosa (7.1 ± 0.7%, 6.6 ± 0.4%, 4.0 ± 0.3%,
respectively; p &lt; 0.001). The density of NSE+ fibers was significantly
enhanced in patients with SUDD and diverticulosis in comparison with HC
(5.1 ± 0.7%, 5.5 ± 0.8% vs 3.4 ± 0.4%, respectively; p &lt; 0.05) in the
peridiverticular region. GAP-43+ fibers were significantly increased only in
patients with SUDD as compared to HC (p &lt; 0.05) in the peridiverticular
region. The peridiverticular region of patients with SUDD was characterized
by a higher number of GAP43+ fibers close to immune cells compared to HC
(p &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Patients with SUDD and diverticulosis are
characterized by increased macrophage counts. The colonic mucosa of patients
with SUDD is characterized by nerve fiber sprouting and neuro-immune
interactions which could be involved in symptom generation.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most commonly
diagnosed functional gastrointestinal disorder with a psychological distress
comorbidity rate of 15.5%-39.5%, especially with depressive disorder (DD).
Twins' studies and population genome wild association studies (GWAS) suggest
there is a genetic contribution to development of IBS, rare results could
display the high comorbidity rate of IBS and depression.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to distinguish the
genetic associations of IBS and depressive disorder. 35 diarrhea dominated
IBS patients (IBS) and 35 depressive disorder patients (DD) were recruited
according the Rome III criteria and MINI Diagnostic, 35 matched healthy
volunteer (HC) without any gastroenterology or mental disease were also
recruited at the same time in Peking university third hospital and Beijing
HuiLongGuan Hospital. Peripheral blood DNA of each sample in the same group
were extracted and mixed as a pool, the whole exome single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNPs) of 3 pools were measured through the pooled-sequencing
(Pool-seq)[1]. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking
University Health Science Center (no. 2013-112).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 10 SNPs in IBS and 12 SNPs in DD significantly different
from HC and located in extronic, nonsynonymous and damage protein structure.
7 of them are the same: Methylation in SSPO gene were positively correlated
with HAD depression scores in IBS patients [3, 4]. Methyl-CpG binding domain
1 (MBD1) gene, have the ability to bind DNA at methylated CpG sites. MBD1
rs125555 was found in a singleton Caucasian family and was carried by each
family member who diagnosed with anxiety or depression [5]. Mbd1−/− mouse is
also showing increased anxiety, greater susceptibility to depression. RECQL4
rs4251691 and SLC7A6OS rs8063446 are the risk variants in IBS while ANKRD11
rs113527563 is the protective one. RECQL4 rs4251691 is reported in
Rothmund-Thomson syndrome patients. Detailed clinical data were collected
from 16 patients having RECQL4 mutations and diarrhea was reported in 12 out
of 14 patients [6, 7]. For depressive disorder patients, COMT rs6267, EDN3
rs11570255 and PPBP rs201450284 are risk variants, SCARF1 rs3744644 and VASN
rs3810818 show some protective effect. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)
associated with experimental pain sensitivity. COMT rs6267 minor alleles in
the high pain sensitive haplotype coding for 20-fold reductions in COMT
enzymatic activity and correlated with schizophrenia or Parkinson's' disease
[8, 9].</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This is the first study using whole exome pool-seq to
look at genetic associations of IBS and depressive disorder together in
Chinese population. Our results show IBS and DD patients have the same risk
mutation which are associated with neuronal modulation or depression.

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The <italic>H. pylori</italic> management
preferences and decisions of primary care physicians, or their access to
different health technologies (i.e. diagnostic methods), courses and
information have not generally been taken in consideration by the literature
even though they currently manage most of the infections.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To evaluate the preferences, decisions and
access to health technology of Spanish Primary Care physicians. A
multidisciplinary committee formed by <italic>H. pylori</italic> experts
from the Spanish Association of Gastroenterology (AEG) and the 3 societies
of primary care in Spain (SEMFyC, SEMERGEN and SEMG) designed an online
survey registering 140 variables regarding demographics, type of practice,
continuous education received, preferences on management and access to
health technology. Survey was submitted via e-mail to the members of the
three societies. Responses were anonymously codified. Truncated responses
were considered up to disconnection, in identified duplicates the most
complete and/or latest response was used. Responses were weighted by
province, gender, age and type of practice. Survey was performed using the
AEG-REDCap platform. Margin of error of the survey is 2.5%.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 1,581 responses were received between December
2017 and March 2018. After removing blank and duplicate responses 1,425 were
valid for analysis. 66% (95% CI = 64-68%) were women and the average age was
48 years (SD = 11). 59% were from urban context, 20% from semi-urban and 21%
from rural. 93% provided public practice. Only 84% of GPs have direct access
to diagnostic methods (55% stool antigen test SAT, 50% to upper GI
endoscopy, 44% to urea breath test UBT, and 30% to serology). 19% of GPs
prescribed eradication treatment without diagnostic testing (14%
occasionally, 3.4% usually, and 1.4% always). Table shows strategy taken
based on the conditions of the patient. The most common management option
for patients below 55 years old and no-alarm symptoms was antisecretory
treatment (67%) mostly alone (33%) although sometimes combined with SAT
(15%), UBT (9%), Serology (3%) or derivation to gastroenterologist (3%). The
next most common were SAT (35%, alone 14%), and UBT (25%). For patients with
alarm symptoms or above 55, the most common strategies were endoscopy (48%),
derivation to gastroenterologist (45%) and antisecretory treatment (20%).
After treatment 68% perform confirmatory test, 5% never and 28% depending on
the clinical situation (If symptoms persist 96%, in duodenal ulcer 74%,
gastric ulcer 83%, non-investigated dyspepsia 50%, investigated dyspepsia
32%, if symptoms disappear 10%). Only 67% tested 4 weeks or more after
treatment. The most common first-line treatment of choice was triple (59%;
with a Proton pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin and amoxicillin 56% and
other triple 3%) followed by non-bismuth quadruple concomitant with
clarithromycin, metronidazole, amoxicillin and a PPI (28%), bismuth
quadruple therapy (single capsule 6.8% or doxycycline combination 3.0%),
other (1.1%).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our survey shows there is a significant deviation from
recommended strategies in Spain to the real access to health technology and
decisions taken by primary care physicians. A strong national program is
needed to ensure adequate access to technologies and continuous medical
education by primary care physicians. <table-wrap id="table32-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table32-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table32"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Duodenal Ulcer</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Gastric Ulcer</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Non- investigated Dyspepsia</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Investigated Dyspepsia</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">1st Degree family of cancer</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Afraid of cancer</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">GERD</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Anaemia</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Never</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">19%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">29%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">29%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">51%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">70%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">52%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Occasionally</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">16%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">14%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">24%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">25%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">21%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">21%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">31%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">31%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Usually</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">21%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">23%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">28%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">15%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5.6%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">25%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">11%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Always</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">44%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">43%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">17%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">18%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">13%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3.3%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">15%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">6.7%</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold>
<italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (Hp) infection treatment is still a
challenge for clinicians. Eradication rates of first-line
clarithromycin-based regimens have fallen in the last 20 years, mainly due
to the increase of clarithromycin resistant Hp strains. Hp culture is
difficult, time consuming, not always successful and it requires an invasive
procedure. 12 point mutations in the 23SrRNA gene related to clarithromycin
resistance have been so far identified, in particular A2142C, A2142G, A2143G
are present in 90% of cases.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To evaluate the accuracy of RT-PCR performed on
stool samples to detect the presence of <italic>Hp</italic> DNA while
concurrently detecting point mutations in the 23SrRNA gene. Results were
compared with RT-PCR carried on bioptic samples.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Between January and April 2018, 93 dyspeptic patients (30
males, 63 females, mean age 49.5 years) referred to our Unit to perform an
upper endoscopy, were enrolled. Composite reference method (CRM):
<sup>13</sup>C urea breath test (<sup>13</sup>C UBT), rapid urease
test, histology and culture were performed to establish Hp status. On Hp
positive cultures, antibiogram was performed with the E-test method. On the
day of endoscopy, stools specimens were collected and rapidly frozen at
-20°C.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> With the CRM method 69 patients resulted Hp positive and
24 Hp negative. In stools, 64 out of the 69 positive specimens were deemed
<italic>true positive</italic> and all the negative specimens were
detected properly (accuracy: 94.6%, 95% CI: 87.9% to 98.2%). Among the 64
positive samples, 30 out of 32 were deemed <italic>true sensitive</italic>
and 22 out of 32 <italic>true resistant</italic> (accuracy: 81.3%, 95% CI:
69.5% to 89.9%). In biopsies, 66 out of the 69 positive specimens were
deemed <italic>true positive</italic> and all the negative specimens were
detected properly (accuracy: 97.8%, 95% CI: 92.4% to 99.7%). Among the 66
positive samples, 32 out of 33 were deemed <italic>true sensitive</italic>
and 23 out of 33 <italic>true resistant</italic> (accuracy: 83.4%, 95% CI:
72.1% to 91.4%). PCR on stools and biopsies were highly concordant, being
Cohen K coefficient 0.9 for Hp detection and 0.8 for resistance
prediction.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold>
<italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> DNA and 23SrRNA point mutations can be
detected in human stool specimens with high accuracy, obtaining the same
performance of DNA extraction from biopsies. RT-PCR on stools can therefore
be used to determine the presence of the bacterium and the genotypic
resistance to clarithromycin, facilitating the choice of the right
therapeutic approach when endoscopy or culture can't be performed.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Randomized controlled trials comparing
susceptibility testing guided therapy and empirical therapy for patients who
fail after 2 or more eradication therapies for <italic>H. pylori</italic>
are lacking.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to compare the efficacy of genotypic
resistance guided therapy versus empirical therapy for eradication of
refractory <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. This multicenter, open
label, parallel group, randomized trial was conducted between Oct 2012 and
Sep 2017. Adult (≥20 years old) patients who failed after at least 2
eradication therapies for <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection were
enrolled. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either (A) genotypic
resistance guided therapy for 14 days; or (B) empirical therapy according to
medication history for 14 days. Eradication status was determined by
<sup>13</sup>C-urea breath test. The primary outcome was the
eradication rate at least 6 weeks after eradication therapy according to
intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Genotypic resistances of clarithromycin
(23S rRNA) and levofloxacin (gyrase A) were determined by PCR with direct
sequencing.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Upon recruitment of 41 patients, trial 1 was terminated
because of low efficacy of doxycycline sequential therapy (57.7%, 15/26). We
replaced doxycycline with tetracycline in trial 2 and a total of 410
patients were randomized as the original design. The overall prevalence of
resistance for clarithromycin, metronidazole, levofloxacin, amoxicillin,
tetracycline, and rifabutin were 90.4% (381/411), 66.2% (272/411), 61.1%
(251/411), 13.3% (55/411), 7.5% (31/411), and 1.5% (6/411), respectively.
The eradication rates of genotypic resistance guided therapy and empirical
therapy were 81% (17/21) and 60% (12/20) in trial 1 (p = 0.181),
respectively, and were 78% (160/205) and 72.2% (148/205) in trial 2
(p = 0.170), respectively, according to ITT analysis. The frequencies of
adverse effects and compliance were not significantly different in the 2
treatment groups in trial 1 and trial 2.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Properly designed empirical therapy according to
medication history in this trial may be an alternative strategy to genotypic
resistance-guided therapy for eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic>
infection after 2 or more eradication failures if susceptibility testing is
not available.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Antibiotics treatment may affect the indigenous gut
microbiota and lead to a violation in the host-microbiota balance.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of the study was to assess the human gut
microbiota composition in <italic>H.pylori</italic>-positive patients
before, immediately after and 1 month after eradication therapy.</p>
<p>Stool samples from 83 <italic>H.pylori</italic>-positive patients before and
immediately after eradication therapy as well as 14 stool samples one month
after the eradication from the same patients were collected. Eradication
therapy included amoxicillin (1000 mg), clarithromycin (500 mg), proton pump
inhibitor and bismuth subsalicylate (240 mg) bid for 14 days.</p>
<p>Stool samples total DNA shotgun sequencing was performed on SOLiD 5500xl-W
platform. Overall microbial composition as well as Shannon diversity index
were used for evaluating the changes in gut microbiome.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In general, 4 fila were predominant in gut microbiota of
<italic>H.pylori</italic>-positive patients before eradication
therapy: Firmicutes (56.73 ± 21.8)%, Bacteroidetes (35.97 ± 23.65)%,
Actinobacteria (2.42 ± 4.23)%, Proteobacteria (2.37 ± 6.99)%. The relative
abundance of Firmicutes decreased immediately after therapy (48.76 ± 23.66)%
vs. (56.73 ± 21.8)% (p = 0.06) and 1 month after: (40.85 ± 18.26)% vs.
(56.73 ± 21.8)% before therapy (p = 0.047). However relative abundance of
Bacteroidetes increased immediately after therapy and one month after the
eradication therapy, thus becoming the most represented phyla. Abundance of
Actinobacteria, Euryarchaeota, Verrucomicrobia reduced, whereas the number
of Proteobacteria increased immediately after eradication, however, the
tendency to return to the initial level was observed in a month after the
treatment.</p>
<p>Bacteria of the following genus: Bacteroides (15.1 ± 17.32)%, Prevotella
(14.1 ± 21.60)%, Eubacterium (13.79 ± 10.49)%, Faecalibacterium
(6.26 ± 5.85)%, Ruminococcus (5.61 ± 5.77)%, Subdoligranulum (5.3 ± 5.77)%,
Butyrivibrio (4.6 ± 13.26)%, Coprococcus (4.57 ± 13.26)%, Roseburia
(4.0 ± 4.56)%, which could be considered as “core microbiota” members, were
the most represented before the initiation of therapy. Immediately after
eradication therapy the relative abundance of almost all these bacterial
genera decreased, except Bacteroides, which representation increased:
(21.9 ± 19.71)% vs. (15.1 ± 17.32)% before therapy (p = 0.049). The
abundance of Escherichia and Klebsiella increased as well: (6.02 ± 13.68) %
vs. (1.73 ± 6.32)% initially (p = 0.0019) and (3.02 ± 13.26)% vs.
(0.17 ± 0.79)% before therapy (p = 0.0068), respectively. These bacteria are
considered to be potentially pathogenic and could have a negative effect on
human health.</p>
<p>There was a tendency to return to the initial level for the abundance of most
of bacterial genus by 1 month after eradication therapy, except for the
Subdoligranulum, Ruminococcus, Eubacterium genera.</p>
<p>The Shannon index was found to be significantly decreased immediately after the
eradication therapy compared with baseline: (2.43 ± 0.61)% vs.
(2.66 ± 0.55)% (p = 0.015), which may indicate the instability of the gut
microbiota, reduction of the overall bacterial diversity and the possible
dominance of 1 or several particular species. 1 month after the end of
therapy the Shannon index increased, but was still slightly lower than the
baseline level (2.54 ± 0.33)% vs. (2.66 ± 0.55)% (p = 0.103).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> So <italic>H.pylori</italic> eradication therapy
causes significant changes in the gut microbiota composition, which can
indirectly affect human health. Changes are individual in the majority of
patients. Apart from the tendency to return to baseline level, some changes
persist even 1 month after completion of eradication therapy.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> It was estimated that approximately 4.4 billion
individuals were infected with <italic>Helicobacter pylori (H.
pylori)</italic> worldwide by year 2015. As we know, <italic>H.
pylori</italic> is the dominant bacterial species of gastric
microbiota in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-infected patients. The domination
of <italic>H. pylori</italic> can change the gastric microenvironment and
result in the reconstitution of gastric microbial community. However, the
influence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection on gut microbiota
homeostasis is still largely unknown.</p>
<p>As is well known, eradication therapy of <italic>H. pylori</italic> is followed
by gastric and gut microbiota alterations. Whether the alterations are
beneficial or detrimental, and the effect of eradication therapy on gut
microbiota were not thoroughly studied. As a typical butyric acid-producing
bacterium, <italic>Clostridium butyricum</italic> (<italic>C.
butyricum</italic>) has been studied in several test models and human
for the eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic>. However, most studies of
<italic>C. butyricum</italic> were conducted with standard triple
eradication therapy, analyzed gut microbiota alterations using bacterial
culture, and emphasized the effect on eradication rate and side effects. Our
study analyzed the effect of <italic>C. butyricum</italic> supplementation
on gut microbiota homeostasis using 16S rRNA sequencing.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Our study aimed to investigate the impact of
<italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, 14-day BQ therapy and probiotic
supplementation on gut microbiota homeostasis and to provide suggestions for
clinical decision. A total of 70 <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive
patients and 35 <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative patients were enrolled.
<italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients were randomly assigned to
group A and group B. Patients in Group A received 14-day BQ therapy
consisting of pantoprazole, amoxicillin, furazolidone and colloidal bismuth
pectin. Patients in Group B were supplemented with <italic>C.
butyricum</italic>. Stool samples of <italic>H.
pylori</italic>-positive patients were collected on day 0, day 14 and day 56
while stool samples of <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative patients were
collected on day 0. Gut microbiota was investigated by 16S rRNA sequencing.
<italic>H. pylori</italic> status was reassessed by <sup>13</sup>C
urea breath test on day 56 for patients in group A and group B. <italic>H.
pylori</italic>-negative status indicated the success of eradication
treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 63 <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients and 35
<italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative patients completed this study.
Several important metabolism pathways were predicted to be more abundant in
<italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive community while some human
diseases pathways were with higher potential in <italic>H.
pylori</italic>-negative community through KEGG pathway analysis. The
abundances of most butyric acid-producing bacteria significantly decreased
and those of several detrimental bacteria increased immediately after 14-day
BQ therapy. The gut microenvironment homeostasis was not completely
reconstituted 6 weeks after treatment in spite of a recovery tendency.
Although no significant improvement of eradication rate was observed, more
gastrointestinal symptoms were relieved with the supplementation of
<italic>C. butyricum</italic>.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The role of <italic>H. pylor</italic>i in human
disease and gut microenvironment homeostasis may not be necessarily
detrimental. The eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> should be based
on comprehensive analysis of individual patients, especially for
asymptomatic <italic>H. pylori</italic>-infected patients. The gut
microbiota was extremely changed immediately after eradication therapy and 6
weeks was not enough to thoroughly reconstitute gut microenvironment balance
in spite of a recovery tendency. <italic>C. butyricum</italic> might promote
the recovery of gut microenvironment balance through immunological and
non-immunological mechanisms.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold>
<italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> eradication therapy induces clinical
and histological regression of gastric extranodal marginal zone B-cell
lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) in the
majority of cases and was approved for the first-line, standard treatment of
<italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive gastric MALT lymphoma by Japanese
government in 2010. Although several retrospective studies or small-scale
single-centre studies have been reported, a prospective, large-scale, multi
center study has not yet been conducted in Japan.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We have conducted a prospective, nationwide,
multicenter study to evaluate the clinical efficacy of rabeprazole-based
triple <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy for the patients with
localized gastric MALT lymphoma in practice-based clinical trial
(ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01264822). The 108 <italic>H.
pylori</italic>-positive patients with clinical stage I/II1 (Lugano staging
system) underwent <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy. The
primary endpoints were complete remission (CR) rate and the rate of transfer
to secondary treatment. The secondary endpoints were CR maintenance duration
and overall survival (OS).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold>
<italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication was successfully achieved in all 97
patients of the efficacy analysis set. CR of lymphoma was achieved in 84 of
the 97 patients (86.6%), during the period of 2.0–44.7 months (median, 5.3
months) following <italic>H. pylori</italic>eradication treatment. CR was
maintained in 77 of 81 patients (95.1%), who were followed for 0.4–53.2
months (median, 33.1months). Kaplan-Meier estimates for the cumulative
probability of CR maintenance were 97.3% (95% CI; 89.6–99.3%) at 12 months
and 94.2% (95% CI; 85.3–97.8%) at 24 months, 36 months and 48 months.
Secondary treatments (radiotherapy, rituximab, or gastrectomy) for gastric
MALT lymphoma were needed in 10 of the 97 patients (10.31%). During
follow-up, OS rate was 96.9% (94/97). 3 patients died of causes unrelated to
gastric lymphoma.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold>
<italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy demonstrated a high CR rate,
long CR maintenance for patients with localized and <italic>H.
pylori</italic>-positive gastric MALT lymphoma in this prospective,
practice-based, nationwide, multicenter study. The results suggested that
the follow-up interval could be extended after 24 months of CR maintenance
by <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication in the patients with the same
clinical characteristics enrolled in this study.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Vedolizumab (VDZ), an
anti-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> integrin monoclonal antibody, is
effective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and leads to
long-term mucosal healing. There is emerging data that early trough levels
(TL) predict mucosal healing (1), while the correlation of maintenance TL
and mucosal healing remains unknown.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We investigated the correlation between
induction and maintenance VDZ TL on mucosal healing in a prospectively
followed cohort.</p>
<p>We measured TL at weeks 2, 6, 10, 14, 22, 38, 54 and at the infusion closest to
endoscopy or treatment discontinuation using the apDia Vedolizumab ELISA in
all patients starting vedolizumab treatment at our centre between May 2016
and April 2017. Our main outcome was mucosal healing, defined as
SES-CD &lt; 4 and Mayo endoscopic subscore 0 or 1, assessed at endoscopy
between w30 and w54, evaluated centrally by a blinded expert endoscopist.
Patients who discontinued treatment due to inefficacy were considered to
have active disease. Predictive cut-off values were identified using
receiver operating curve analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 54 patients in the study population, 25 (46%) had
ulcerative colitis. The vast majority (83%) had failed treatment with
anti-TNFα agents. 21 (39%) achieved mucosal healing by week 54. Patients
with mucosal healing had significantly higher median VDZ TL at weeks 6, 10,
22, but not later on in the maintenance phase (Table 1). A cut-off of 19.1
µg/ml at week 6 predicted mucosal healing with 81% sensitivity and 70%
specificity (AUC 0.742, 95% confidence interval: 0.587–0.897;
<italic>p = </italic>0.007), while a cut-off of 10.1 µg/ml at week 22
identified patients with mucosal healing with 53% sensitivity and 76%
specificity (AUC 0.783, 95% confidence interval: 0.646–0.920; p = 0.001).
Among patients with both TL below the cut-offs 5/23 (21.7%) achieved mucosal
healing, while 16/25 (64%) of those with at least one of the TL above the
cut-off achieved mucosal healing (p<italic> = </italic>0.003). <table-wrap id="table33-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table33-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table33"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Median vedolizumab trough level (IQR)

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has an established
role in the use of anti-TNF therapies in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
The role of TDM for vedolizumab (VDZ) therapy has not been well
characterized. Suggested trough levels associated with clinical and
endoscopic remission range from 5.1ug/ml to &gt;11ug/ml in previous
studies.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to determine whether maintenance VDZ
levels correlate with clinical remission and mucosal healing in patients
with IBD.</p>
<p>We performed a cross-sectional, observational study in a single IBD centre.
Included patients had a minimum of 3 VDZ infusions and VDZ levels drawn
within 14 days of their infusion. Chart review was performed to determine
the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) score or the partial Mayo score at the time
of VDZ level as well as endoscopic scores if applicable. The primary
endpoint was clinical remission (HBI score of &lt; 5, partial Mayo score
of &lt; 2, or pouch disease activity index score &lt; 7). The secondary
endpoint was mucosal healing, defined as an SES-CD score of &lt; 5 or a Mayo
endoscopic subscore of &lt; 2. Endoscopy data were included if performed
within 8 weeks of drug level testing. Serum VDZ levels and
antibodies-to-vedolizumab (ATV) were obtained using a drug-tolerant assay
(Prometheus Labs, San Diego, California). VDZ levels were expressed as
median with inter-quartile ranges (IQR). Statistical analysis was performed
using the Kruskill-Wallis test, Chi-squared test and ROC curves.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 60 patients were included (25 Crohn's disease, 34
ulcerative colitis/IBD-U, and 2 with pouchitis). 38 (63%) were anti-TNF
experienced and 1 patient was co-treated with anti-TNF therapy. 9 patients
(15%) were on concomitant immunomodulator therapy. 25 patients (42%) were on
q4week dosing, 31 (52%) were on q8week dosing, and 4(6%) were on q6week
dosing. Median VDZ level was 10.6ug/ml (6.3–18.6). Patients receiving VDZ
q4weeks had significantly higher levels than those receiving q8week dosing
(20.6ug/ml vs 8.35ug/ml, p &lt; 0.0001) without significant differences in
remission rates (40% vs 45%, p = 0.530). 2 patients had low-titre detectable
ATV although both these patients had detectable drug levels. Clinical
remission rates were not significantly higher in patients with higher levels
(14.6ug/ml vs 10.1ug/ml, p = 0.287). The area under the curve (AUC) for VDZ
levels and clinical remission was 0.619. Of the cohort studied, 24 (40%) had
endoscopic data available. Of these, 10 patients (42%) achieved mucosal
healing while 14 (58%) did not. There was no difference between VDZ
maintenance levels of those with mucosal healing when compared to those
without mucosal healing (17.56 ug/ml vs 16.10ug/ml, p = 0.682). The AUC for
VDZ levels and mucosal healing was 0.55.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In a single-centre cohort of IBD patients, there was
no association between maintenance VDZ levels and clinical remission or
endoscopic mucosal healing. Shortening the dosing interval achieves higher
VDZ levels, but this did not correlate with improved clinical response. This
finding supports our observation that dose escalation of VDZ does not
improve clinical response rates in patients with IBD. Interestingly, few
patients had detectable ATV despite lower rates of concomitant
immunomodulator use than previously studied populations, supporting the
suggestion that VDZ has lower immunogenicity than other biologics.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> In patients experiencing a loss of response to an
anti-TNF with unfavorable pharmacokinetics (undetectable levels and
anti-drug antibodies), the algorithms propose a switch of the anti-TNF but
is frequently accompanied by the subsequent appearance of antibodies
directed against the second anti-TNF.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Between 2012 and 2016, all patients with IBD in
loss of response to a first optimized anti-TNF given in monotherapy at
induction or 6 months later and with an undetectable level of anti-TNF with
a high level of anti-drug antibodies were included. They were randomized to
receive either AZA or nothing and induction by a second anti-TNF was
performed at standard doses. They were followed for 2 years after the
switch, with a measurement of the clinical activity and pharmacokinetics of
the second TNF at 6, 12 and 24 months. Non-primary responders after the
change were excluded. A clinical failure was defined as a disease outbreak
defined on a Harvey Bradshaw score &gt;5 associated with a faecal
calprotectin level 250 µg/g stool for Crohn's disease or a Mayo score &gt;3
with an endoscopic sub-score &gt;1 in the case of ulcerative colitis and the
need for a therapeutic change (dose intensification, change in treatment,
addition of corticosteroids or AZA, use of surgery). The appearance of
unfavorable pharmacokinetics was defined by the appearance of low or
undetectable levels of anti-TNF with anti-drug antibodies.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 90 patients (48 CD, mean age: 39.5 years, sex ratio M/W:
0.95) were included. The second anti-TNF was adalimumab (ADA) and infliximab
(IFX) in 40 and 50 patients, respectively. 45 patients were randomized to
receive AZA (2 to 2.5 mg/kg mg/kg). Groups with or without AZA were
comparable. At 12 months and 24 months, clinical safe survival rates and
unfavorable pharmacokinetics were significantly higher in combination
therapy (Log rank &lt; 0.0001): 85% vs. 62% and 80% vs. 59% at 12 months and
80% respectively <italic>vs</italic> 20% and 84% vs. 30% at 24 months. These
rates were not different at 6 months (90% vs. 76% and 85% vs. 68%; p = 0.1).
These results did not differ according to the type of anti-TNF. With the ADA
for reference, hazard ratios (HR) were for the IFX of 1.2 [0.6–2.3], for
ADA-AZA combination therapy of 0.1 [0-0.4] and for combotherapy IFX-AZA of
0.2 [0.1–0.4]. In univariate and multivariate analysis, only the use of
combination therapy was significantly associated with a favorable change
after anti-TNF switch. The type of IBD, the duration of the disease or the
characteristics of the patient were not associated to clinical outcome.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> During a switch of anti-TNF (IFX to ADA or ADA to IFX)
required for a loss of response due to unfavorable pharmacokinetics with the
presence of anti-drug antibodies, it is necessary to associate the second
anti-TNF with AZA.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> ABIRISK is a multicenter, prospective,
non-interventional study based on cohorts of patients with IBD, multiple
sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis. Patients are included at the start of
biopharmaceuticals. Biological samples are collected, to find biomarkers
predictive of efficacy and immunization. We herein report the results
observed in the IBD cohort of patients treated with anti-TNFs.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Patients treated with adalimumab (ADL) or
infliximab (IFX) as a first-line therapy for active IBD were eligible.
Anti-drug antibodies (ADAb) were measured a chemo-luminescence drug tolerant
capture ELISA assay at W0, W6, W12 and W52. Immunogenicity was defined as
ADAb within the first 12 months of anti TNF treatment. Clinical activity was
assessed at W6, W12, W52 and at withdrawal if the drug was discontinued.
Surgical and medical history, including previous medications were reported
at inclusion, while adverse events, including those related to ADAb, and
concomitant medications were reported at any time points. Clinical remission
was defined as a HBI≤3 in CD patients and a Mayo subscore ≤4 in UC patients.
Patients who discontinued ADL or IFX or who were lost to follow-up were
considered as treatment failures.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 204 eligible patients were recruited from 17 centers
(France, Belgium and Israel). 197 were included (7 screen failures) of whom
184 patients could be assessed (mean age was 36.9 (SD:13.7), 48.4% were
women). There were 148 patients with CD and 36 with UC. 86 patients were
treated with IFX (n = 86, REM or CT-P13) and 98 with ADL. Median disease
duration was 3.69 (IQR: 10.37) years. In CD, median Harvey-Bradshaw index
was 6, 27 had a penetrating phenotype (B3) (IFX, n = 17; ADL, n = 10) and 23
had perianal fistulas (IFX, n = 18 ADL, n = 6). In UC, median Mayo subscore
was 6. 19.6% had extra-intestinal manifestations. Concomitant
immunosuppressants were prescribed in 68% and 40% of patients treated with
IFX and ADA respectively. 82% and 35 % of patients treated with IFX and ADL
received corticosteroids, respectively. At 1 year, 95 patients (51.6%) were
in clinical remission, including 73 (40%) without optimization of anti-TNF
therapy. ADAb were detected in 51 patients (27.7%). The immunogenicity rate
for ADL and IFX was 38.8% and 15.1%, respectively. Mean time to onset of
ADAb was 2.5 months, and ADAb persisted over time in 72%. Drug levels at 6
weeks of therapy were significantly lower in patients who developed ADAb.
Immunogenicity was associated with non-remission at 1 year (58.6% in
patients with ADAb vs 35.7% in patients without ADAb, p = 0.008). In
multivariate cox regression analysis of time to ADAb development,
immunogenicity was associated with concomitant immunosuppressant (HR: 0.39
[95% CI 0.2–0.75]), anti-TNF levels at 6 weeks of therapy (HR: 0.86 [95% CI
0.8–0.91]), antibiotics usage during the study (HR: 0.3 [95% CI 0.14–0.65])
and vaccine in the year before start of anti-TNF therapy (HR: 3.1 [95% CI
1.5–6.3]).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In IBD patients, immunogenicity towards anti-TNFs is
associated with a lower remission rate and lower drug levels. Concomitant
immunosuppressants and antibiotics are associated with a lower risk of
immunogenicity while vaccine received before the start of anti-TNF are
associated with an increased risk of immunogenicity.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Magnetic resonance enterography (MREn) may be used
in clinical practice to assess disease activity in Crohn's disease
(CD).<sup>1,2</sup> Vedolizumab (VDZ) is clinically effective in
patients (pts) with moderately to severely active CD,<sup>3</sup> but
healing with VDZ on MREn has not been previously measured. This study
evaluated the effect of VDZ on radiologic remission using MREn at weeks
(wks) 26 and 52 in pts with active CD.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> VERSIFY (NCT02425111) was a Phase 3b, open-label
study evaluating endoscopic remission with VDZ in 101 pts at 26 wks, and in
56 eligible pts at 52 wks following a protocol amendment extending treatment
duration. Only patients receiving VDZ at the time of the amendment, or
enrolled after the amendment was implemented, were eligible to be treated to
wk 52. Pts were enrolled with moderate-severe CD (≥3 months; CD Activity
Index 220-450; Simple Endoscopic Score for CD ≥7; ≥1 mucosal ulceration on
centrally read endoscopy) and who had prior failure to a corticosteroid,
immunomodulator, and/or ≥1 TNF [tumour necrosis factor] antagonist). The
MREn substudy enrolled 37 pts, of whom 21 were eligible to continue
treatment to wk 52. The exploratory endpoint was Magnetic Resonance Index of
Activity (MaRIA) score;<sup>4</sup> quantified in 6 ileocolonic segments (1
ileal and 5 colonic). MaRIA-7 remission of all active lesions and MaRIA-11
remission of only severe lesions were deﬁned as scores of &lt; 7
and &lt; 11, respectively, in all segments, and were assessed at wk 26 and
wk 52. Data were analysed in the full analysis set (FAS; all treated pts)
and in the per-protocol set (PPS; treated pts with sufficient data at
baseline and post-baseline). Only pts with an abnormal MaRIA score of ≥7 or
≥11 in ≥1 segment at baseline, respectively, were included in the analysis.
If no relevant post-baseline MaRIA scores were available then they were
considered non-responders in the FAS. Subgroup analyses of the FAS and PPS
by prior TNF exposure were performed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 37 pts enrolled into the MREn substudy, 32 pts had a
baseline MaRIA score ≥7 in ≥1 segment and 32 had a baseline score ≥11 in ≥1
segment. These pts were included in the MaRIA-7 and MaRIA-11 remission
analysis. The 5 pts who did not meet the threshold for inclusion in the
MaRIA-7 remission analysis were classified as having ‘suboptimal' MREn exams
at baseline. 27/32 pts had 26 wk observations. 15/21 MREn pts had 52 wk
observations. At baseline, in the FAS-MREn population (n = 32), the mean
MaRIA score for the most severely affected segment was 24.8. MaRIA-7 and
MaRIA-11 remission at wk 26 and wk 52 for the FAS-MREn population are shown
in Table 1. MREn remission rates at wk 26 and wk 52 in the PPS-MREn
population (n = 26) were similar to those observed in the FAS-MREn
population (overall and in anti-TNF naïve and failure pts) (Table 1).

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Vedolizumab (VDZ), a humanized monoclonal antibody
targeting α4β7 integrin, is effective in induction and maintenance therapy
in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who have not adequately
responded to standard therapies, and high levels of vedolizumab trough
levels (VTL) have been associated with clinical remission. The α4β7 integrin
binds to endothelial MAdCAM-1 and is up-regulated by retinoic acid (RA).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To determine the relations between soluble
MAdCAM-1 (sMAdCAM-1) and RA concentrations with clinical remission during
VDZ maintenance therapy.In a retrospective study performed in IBD patients
treated with VDZ we measured VTL, sMAdCAM-1 and RA concentrations.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Among the 62 included patients (38 Crohn's disease) 24
relapsed and 38 stayed in remission between weeks 10 to 30 after VDZ
initiation. During this maintenance therapy, median values of VTL and RA
were 15.4 µg/mL and 0.97 ng/mL, whereas sMAdCAM-1 was undetectable
(&lt;0.41 ng/mL) in 67.3% of samples. The positive predictive value (PPV) of
undetectable sMAdCAM-1 for clinical remission was 80.0% with a corresponding
sensitivity of 74.6%. On multivariate analysis undetectable sMAdCAM-1 and
high VTL (&gt; 19 µg/mL) were independently associated with clinical
remission (OR = 7.5, p = 0.006 and OR = 2.2, p = 0.045, respectively). The
combination of sMAdCAM-1 &lt; 0.41 ng/mL and VTL &gt; 19 µg/mL was the best
pharmacokinetic profile with a PPV of 95.2%. Median values of sMAdCAM-1 and
RA were significantly higher (p = 0.0001) before VDZ therapy than during the
follow-up (sMAdCAM-1: 40.5 vs. &lt; 0.41 ng/mL; RA: 1.7 vs. 0.97 ng/mL).
Only RA &gt; 1.86 ng/mL before VDZ therapy was predictive of clinical
remission during the follow-up (AUROC = 80.7%).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Undetectable sMAdCAM-1 appears strongly associated
with clinical remission during VDZ maintenance therapy. Combination of
undetectable sMAdCAM-1 with high VTL is also potentially interesting for
therapeutic drug monitoring. Baseline RA concentrations are predictive of
clinical remission. These findings need to be confirmed in further
prospective studies.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Intestinal microbiome disruption (dybiosis) is
linked to many human diseases and chronic conditions, most notably recurrent
<italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infections (rCDI). In response,
there are numerous efforts to develop FDA-approved microbiota-based drugs to
restore a healthier microbiome. These include RBX2660, a standardized,
stabilized liquid microbiota suspension delivered by enema, and RBX7455, a
lyophilized, non-frozen, orally administered microbiota product. Given the
lack of established biomarkers for microbiome restoration, we are evaluating
unidimensional Microbiome Health Indices (MHI) to measure microbiome
restoration, which are based on the associations of
<italic>Bacteroidia</italic> and <italic>Clostridia</italic> with
colonization resistance, and <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> and
<italic>Bacilli</italic> with dysbiosis. Herein we evaluate MHI data
from three clinical trials for preventing rCDI, including 2 controlled Phase
2 trials of RBX2660 and 1 Phase 1 trial of RBX7455.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Patient fecal samples were collected as part of
three clinical trials for preventing rCDI in which treatment success was
freedom from CDI recurrence at 8 weeks after treatment. Fecal samples and
RBX2660 or RBX7455 product samples were extracted and sequenced using
standard 16S or shallow shotgun methods, and the resulting operational
taxonomic units (OTU) data were used to calculate MHI values. MHIs from the
2 RBX2660 trials were pooled, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC)
analysis was used to define an MHI cut-point for distinguishing rCDI
subjects prior to RBX2660 treatment (baseline) from the RBX2660 drug
product. Post-treatment MHIs from patients in all trials were assessed
longitudinally and by outcome.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Baseline MHI values were not significantly different
among all 3 trials (p &gt; 0.05). ROC analysis indicated that the pooled
baseline samples from RBX2660 trials could be distinguished from the pooled
RBX2660 profile with a maximum likelihood ratio of 121 (AUC = 0.99,
sensitivity = 0.96, specificity = 0.99, cutpoint = 8.2). Among patients who
responded to treatment, MHIs were significantly higher 7 days after
treatment (p &lt; 0.001) for the RBX2660 trials, with 58% of responders
having an MHI &gt; 8.2, and an increasing percentage of participant MHIs
above the cutpoint at 30 and 60 days post-treatment. Similar results were
observed in the RBX7455 trial, with 38%, 75%, and 87% of participants above
MHI = 8.2 at 7, 30, and 60 days post treatment. Among patients who failed
treatment, MHIs were also significantly higher 7 ± 4 days after treatment
(p &lt; .001), but only 21% were above the MHI = 8.2 cutpoint. More
importantly, among pooled data from all 3 trials, MHI of successes could be
distinguished from failures at 7 ± 4 days post-treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> MHI values and trends pre- and post-treatment are
consistent across 2 controlled Phase 2 clinical trials for RBX2660 and 1
Phase 1 trial of RBX7455, suggesting potential for prospective evaluation of
MHI as an exploratory microbiome endpoint. MHI can also effectively
distinguish patients with dysbiosis from healthier patients. Significant MHI
increases can be measured post-treatment, and in this analysis MHI can
differentiate successes from failures at 7 ± 4 days post-treatment. These
results generate prospectively evaluable hypotheses for future clinical
trials and emphasize the value of a unidimensional MHI.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Since 2016, the Netherlands Donor Feces Banks (NDFB)
is facilitating the treatment of patients with multiple recurrences of
<italic>Clostrididiodes difficile</italic> infections (rCDI) with
fecal microbiota transplantations (FMT).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> An observational study was performed using a
standardized approach of data collection and guidance of an expert team of
medical microbiologists, infectious diseases physicians and
gastroenterologists. Furthermore, microbiota analysis was performed on 10
patient fecal samples before and after FMT, and their corresponding donor
fecal samples. Shotgun metagenomics was performed on an Illumina Nextseq.
The sequencing data was quality controlled and taxonomically profiled with
the One Codex platform and afterwards all reads were cross-assembled with
the MegaHit assembler. Taxonomic annotation was performed with
Megablast/LCA.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Between March 2016 and March 2018, 260 of 472 donor
candidates completed a questionnaire; 220 (85%) were excluded, mainly
because age above 50 and an unhealthy BMI. 39 (15%) donor candidates were
invited for laboratory screening of blood and feces of which 15 (38%) passed
this screening. Carriership of <italic>Blastocystis hominis</italic>,
<italic>Dientamoeba fragilis</italic> and Multi Drug Resistant
Organisms were the most observed exclusion criteria. Of 15 donors, 6 failed
at a following screening test, which is performed every 2 months. Finally, 9
(3.5%) active donors were enrolled. Between March 2016 and April 2018, 99
patients were evaluated by our FMT expert team. Of these 99 patients, 76
(77%) were considered as suitable candidates for FMT treatment and 23 (23%)
were interpreted as patients with underlying bowel disease who concomitantly
carried <italic>C. difficile</italic>. The mean age of the 76 FMT treated
patients was 72 year, 58.6% was female, and the mean recurrence rate was 3.4
CDI episodes. The treatment was performed in 28 different hospitals with a
success rate of 89%. 8 patients suffered a CDI relapse, of which 4 were
associated with antibiotic use within one month after FMT. All 8 were
successfully treated, of which 7 with anti-CDI antibiotics again. 2 serious
adverse events (SAE) of faecal regurgitation were reported without further
complications. The microbiota analysis indicated that patients with active
CDI had a reduced diversity and extremely diversity composition of their
microbiota compared to healthy donors, and compared to the microbiota after
FMT. The patient microbiota after FMT was more similar to its donor
microbial community than to the other microbiota samples in the study.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Only a low percentage (3.5%) of healthy volunteers are
qualified as suitable feces donors. Critical evaluation of FMT applications
in a multidisciplinary setting is useful, as a high percentage (23%) of FMT
request was rejected due to <italic>C. difficile</italic> carriership
instead of infection. An high success rate (of 89%) of FMT for multiple
recurrent CDI was observed. Furthermore, we observe that antibiotic
stewardship after FMT is of importance as a high proportion of CDI relapses
after FMT is caused by antibiotic use. Microbiota analysis confirmed that
FMT is associated with an increase in diversity of the microbiota.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Recently, double-blind randomized studies
investigating fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in chronic active
ulcerative colitis (UC) have shown promising results. The use of variable
FMT protocols used for this indication raises questions concerning the route
and frequency of application and preparation of donor stool. The use of
frozen stool in <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection has been
shown to be as effective as fresh donor stool and increases availability of
FMT for this indication.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this analysis was to assess the
clinical efficacy of frozen and fresh donor stool for FMT in ulcerative
colitis. 49 patients suffering from chronic active ulcerative colitis
received repeated fecal microbiota transplantation (5 times every second
week) using the same protocol, except for donor stool preparation. 25
patients (mean age 36 y ± 15) were treated with frozen donor stool (mixed
with sodium chloride and glycerol, stored at -80°C), 24 patients (mean age
44y ± 9) with freshly prepared donor stool (not older than 6 hours).
Remission and response were determined by the total Mayo score (TMS) before
FMT and after 90 days. Clinical response was defined as a decrease of ≥3
points in TMS from baseline, along with either a decrease of &gt;1 point in
the rectal bleeding subscore or the absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0
or 1. Remission was defined as a TMS &lt; 2 and an endoscopic subscore of 0
or 1.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean TMS was 9.2 ± 2.2 (frozen stool) and 8.9 ± 1.8
(fresh stool) at baseline and was reduced to 5.1 ± 2.7 in the frozen donor
stool group and to 5.3 ± 3.6 in the fresh donor stool group at day 90. The
mean improvement in TMS between baseline and day 90 was statistically not
significant different between the two groups (p = 0.691). Furthermore,
remission and response rates were comparable between frozen donor stool and
fresh donor stool cohorts (No response/Response/Remission: 40%/40%/20% vs.
42%/33%/25%; p = 1.00/0.769/0.742).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In chronic active ulcerative colitis frozen donor
stool for FMT is as effective as fresh donor stool in inducing response and
remission in ulcerative colitis. By using frozen donor stool FMT may become
more available for the clinical use in this patient group.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Although faecal microbiota transplantation is a
highly effective treatment against recurrent <italic>Clostridium
difficile</italic> infection (CDI) its dissemination is prevented by
many issues, including regulation, long-term safety, screening costs,
identification of optimal protocols. Specific microbiota suspensions may
help overcoming these concerns and provide a fine-tuning therapeutic option
for CDI and other dysbiosis-related disorders.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study is to assess the safety
and efficacy of a culturomics-based synthetic microbiota suspension, derived
from successful bacterial engrafters, in treating patients with recurrent
CDI.</p>
<p>The synthetic microbiota consortium was composed of 15 bacterial species
belonging to the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria,
Actinobacteria. To select bacterial species composing the consortium we
assessed the engraftment between 5 patients with recurrent CDI and a single
healthy donor after clinically successful FMT, and selected those engrafting
the recipients' gut. Then, selected bacterial strains were cultured on each
one conditions and resuspended in NaCl 0.9% solution in order to obtain a
final concentration of 2 MCFarland unit in a total of 500 ml per
patient.</p>
<p>Each patient received a 500 ml-suspension of synthetic microbiota consortium by
colonoscopy after a 3-day vancomycin course and a bowel lavage. The primary
end point was the cure of <italic>C. difficile</italic>-associated diarrhea
8 weeks after the end of the treatment. Safety was evaluated by monitoring
adverse events.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> From November 2016 to December 2017, 10 patients (6
males; mean age 75 years old) with recurrent CDI were enrolled. 6 patients
had resolution of <italic>C. difficile</italic>-associated diarrhea after
the first infusion of microbiota consortium, while the 4 remaining patients
cured CDI after a second infusion. Overall, the synthetic microbiota
consortium cured all 10 patients (100% both in per-protocol and
intention-to-treat analyses). No serious adverse events associated with the
treatment were observed. We found significant shifts in the microbiota
composition of treated patients. Additional metagenomic analyses are
currently running and will be presented at the UEG Week if this abstract is
selected.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In our pilot study, a culturomics-based synthetic
microbiota consortium, derived from successful bacterial engrafter, cured
all patients with recurrent CDI, and had a favorable safety profile. Should
these preliminary results be confirmed, synthetic microbiota suspensions may
be considered as a potential therapy for the treatment of recurrent CDI.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly
effective treatment against recurrent <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>
infection. Far less evidence exists on the efficacy of FMT in treating
severe <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection refractory to
antibiotics.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy
of 2 FMT-based protocols associated with vancomycin in curing subjects with
severe <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection refractory to
antibiotics.</p>
<p>Subjects with severe <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection
refractory to antibiotics were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 following
treatment arms: 1) FMT-S, including a single faecal infusion via colonoscopy
followed by a 14-day vancomycin course; 2) FMT-M, including multiple faecal
infusions plus a 14-day vancomycin course. In the FMT-M group, all subjects
received at least 2 infusions, while those with pseudomembranous colitis
(PMC) underwent further infusions until the disappearance of
pseudomembranes. The primary outcome was the cure of refractory
<italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 56 subjects, 28 in each treatment arm, were enrolled. 21
patients in the FMT-S group and 28 patients in the FMT-M group were cured,
respectively (75% versus 100%, respectively, both in PP and ITT analyses;
p = 0.01). No SAEs associated with any of the 2 treatment protocols were
observed.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A vancomycin-associated and PMC-driven FMT protocol
based on multiple faecal infusions was significantly more effective than a
vancomycin-associated single-shot FMT protocol in curing severe
<italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection refractory to
antibiotics.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> To broaden access to microbiota-based therapeutics
therapies, RBX7455, a non-frozen, lyophilized, orally-administered
microbiota-restoring drug candidate was developed. We report additional
interim results from an open-label Phase 1 trial of RBX7455 for preventing
recurrent <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infections (rCDI).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> 25 patients with ≥2 CDI episodes following ≥2
courses of antibiotic therapy have been enrolled to date in 3 cohorts as
follows: 1) 4 RBX7455 capsules twice daily for 4 days, n = 10; 2) 4 RBX7455
capsules twice daily for 2 days, n = 10; 3) 2 RBX7455 capsules twice daily
for 2 days, n = 5 to date. Success was defined as absence of CDI recurrence
through 8 weeks after treatment completion, and adverse events were
monitored during and after treatment.</p>
<p>Recipient stool samples prior to and at 1, 7, 30, and 60 days after treatment
were collected. Stool and representative RBX7455 product samples were
sequenced using an ultra-shallow shotgun sequencing method. Operational
taxonomic unit (OTU) data were grouped by cohort and compared using a
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity calculation. Relative OTU abundances at the class
level were compared among time points.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 9 of 10 patients in cohort 1, 8 of 10 patients in cohort
2, and 5 of 5 patients in cohort 3 were recurrence-free at the 8-week
endpoint, with an overall success rate of 88% (22/25). A total of 37
non-serious adverse events (AEs) have been recorded to date, with
gastrointestinal AEs being most common. No serious AEs have been
observed.</p>
<p>Prior to treatment, the taxonomic compositions of responder microbiomes were
significantly dissimilar from the RBX7455 composition and were dominated by
Gammaproteobacteria and Bacilli. After treatment, patient microbiomes
converged toward the RBX7455 composition, with Bacteroidia and Clostridia
becoming more predominant. Microbiome changes were similar among responders
from all cohorts.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> 3 different dosing regimens of RBX7455 had a high
success rate in preventing rCDI with no serious AEs. In addition, RBX7455
appears to restore patient microbiomes toward the RBX7455 composition.
Microbiome and safety data collection will continue for 6 months after
treatment.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Gastric varices are present in 5-33% of patients
with portal hypertension with incidence of bleeding of around 25% in 2
years<sup>1</sup>. If gastric varices are identified as the source of
bleeding, therapeutic options include endoscopic methods, TIPSS, surgery and
non-selective beta blockade<sup>2</sup>. There are reports of EUS-guided
coiling combined with cyanoacrylate glue<sup>3</sup> but limited literature
on safety and efficacy of EUS-guided coil embolisation with human thrombin
injection. We report our experience.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We analysed data of all EUS-guided interventions
for the management of bleeding gastric varices between 2015-2017 at a liver
transplant center. Olympus EUS linear scope was used to inject human
thrombin (Tisseel®; 500IU/ML) in gastric varices with or without coils
(Nester® Embolization Coils).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 10 EUS-guided interventions in 6 patients (4M
&amp; 2F), aged 55 (41-59) yrs for secondary prophylaxis. 67% patients had
cirrhosis with MELD score of 14 (10-21) and 75% were Child-Pugh class C. The
remainder had non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. All patients had previous
bleeding from gastric varices and 2/3<sup>rd</sup> were intolerant of
beta-blockers. 67% had previous thrombin injection that had failed to
obliterate the gastric varices. EUS-guided coil embolisation was undertaken
with thrombin injection in 6, and thrombin alone in 40 (2 had previous coils
embolisation). The largest feeding vessel was 120 (7-16) mm with a median 5
(2-10) coils placement followed by thrombin injection of 3500 (2500- 5000)
IU.</p>
<p>Most (8/10) stayed overnight after intervention and only 2 required longer
stays, Median F/U was 9 (3-20) months with zero 30-day mortality. 1 patient
had fever 2 days post procedure requiring IV antibiotics. No reported
episodes of re-bleeding except in 1 patient at 23 months. 4 had follow up
EUS (5-7 months) and showed no flow at the level of the coils. 1 patient
died within 3 months of procedure secondary to hepatic decompensation.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In our experience EUS-guided coil embolisation and
injection of thrombin is a technically safe and well-tolerated procedure
even in patients with advanced liver disease especially who have failed
eradication of gastric varices from single modality therapy. Due to the
lower incidence of gastric variceal bleeding in comparison to oesophageal
varices bleeding, we recommend multi-center prospective data collection
evaluating the modalities being used and reporting of outcomes to help
inform national guidelines.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Patients with thrombocytopenia (TCP) associated with
chronic liver disease (CLD) have an increased risk of bleeding during
planned invasive procedures. Lusutrombopag (LUSU) is a small-molecule orally
active agonist of human thrombopoietin receptor. At the 2015 and 2017 annual
meetings of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases
(AASLD), Izumi N et al and Afdhal NH et al reported the results from phase 3
studies (L-PLUS 1 in Japan and L-PLUS 2 in multiple nations) evaluating LUSU
treatment of TCP in patients with CLD who were undergoing non-emergency
invasive procedures, and concluded that LUSU 3 mg once daily was an
effective and safe alternative to platelet transfusions (1, 2). Here we
report the further analysis for characterizing the
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of LUSU based on the multiethnic
data and assessing a risk of platelet overshooting during the treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Population PK/PD analyses were performed using a
total of 4196 plasma LUSU concentrations from 427 subjects (78 healthy
subjects and 349 thrombocytopenic patients with CLD) and 3526 platelet
counts from 347 of the above 349 patients. Covariates were explored from
subjects' background data. PK/PD simulations were performed to calculate
platelet metrics, ie, the probabilities of platelet counts ≥50 G/L on Days 9
to 14 (efficacy index) and &gt;200 G/L (safety index defined as overshoot)
for assessing dose response.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The developed models well described the PK/PD of LUSU.
Body weight was an influential covariate on PK, but no effects of covariates
(including ethnicity, body weight, age, sex, and Child-Pugh score) on
response profiles of thrombopoiesis were clinically significant. In the
simulations, the 3-mg dose provided a probability of 87.1% and 80.8% of
platelet count ≥50 G/L on Days 9 to 14 in Japanese and non-Japanese
patients, respectively. The probabilities of platelet overshooting (&gt;200
G/L) at the 3-mg dose were low in Japanese and non-Japanese patients: 1.52%
and 0.43%, respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The modeling and simulation in the multiethnic data
support that oral LUSU 3 mg once daily for 7 days has no ethnic differences
in efficacy and has low risk for platelet overshoot in treating TCP in
patients with CLD undergoing invasive procedures.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Esophageal Varices is one of the dreadful
complications of portal hypertension <sup>[1]</sup>. Upper endoscopy is the
gold standard for diagnosing esophageal varices <sup>[2]</sup>. Noninvasive
methods were applied in order to predict the presence of esophageal varices
and their response to medical treatment <sup>[3]</sup>.</p>
<p>A recent method is the assessment by splenic stiffness measurement
<sup>[4]</sup>. Many studies were carried out for evaluating this
technique, all of them agreed on the benefit, however, their results were
different regarding a specific united cut-off value and the capability of
identifying the size of the varices <sup>[5]</sup>. These differences were
thought to be due to readings exceeding the maximum value (75 kPa) of the
machine <sup>[6]</sup>.</p>
<p>Carvedilol is a nonselective β-blocker used to reduce portal pressure in order
to prevent variceal bleeding <sup>[7]</sup>, being a potent therapeutic
agent with dual action (non-selective β-blocker and α1-adrenergic blocker)
<sup>[8]</sup>. Effective dose of carvedilol for reducing portal
pressure with the least arterial hypotension was found to be 12.5mg/d
<sup>[9]</sup>.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study is to investigate the
possibility of using the spleen stiffness measurement by transient
elastography as a noninvasive approach to detect esophageal varices, and
comparing the results obtained to liver stiffness measurement and platelet
count to spleen diameter ratio in detecting and grading the size of varices.
The study also aims to monitor changes in spleen stiffness before and after
carvedilol therapy.</p>
<p>This was a single-center, prospective cross-sectional study, conducted on 110
individuals (90 chronic HCV patients and 20 healthy controls). Patients were
divided into 4 groups; <bold>Group 1:</bold> Healthy controls, <bold>Group
2:</bold> Chronic Hepatitis, <bold>Group 3:</bold> Cirrhotics without
varices, <bold>Group 4:</bold> Cirrhotics with varices.</p>
<p>All patients enrolled were over 18 years of age. Patients with transient
elastography technical difficulty, contraindication to β-blockers, pregnant
females, those receiving portal hypotensive medications, and those undergone
previous endoscopic management of esophageal varices were excluded from the
beginning.</p>
<p>Each patient underwent abdominal ultrasound and laboratory investigations,
cirrhotic patients (60) were furtherly subjected to doppler ultrasonography
to confirm portal hypertension, then upper endoscopy to verify the presence
of esophageal varices, patients with esophageal varices were prescribed
carvedilol (6.25mg twice daily) (30). Liver and spleen stiffness was done
for all patients once and it was repeated again for patients who received
carvedilol after three month of treatment as described.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There was statistical significant difference between all
groups in terms of both liver and spleen stiffness (p &lt; 0.001). An
inverse correlation was found in <bold>group 4</bold> between spleen
stiffness before treatment and the spleen size (R-value -0.438, p = 0.016).
Patients in <bold>group 4</bold> showed a statistical significant difference
in spleen stiffness measurement before and after treatment (p &lt; 0.001).
Spleen stiffness measurement was capable of predicting the presence of
esophageal varices at cut off 59.85kPa with AUC 0.768, showing sensitivity
80% and specificity 70%. However, neither spleen stiffness nor platelet
count to spleen size ratio were capable of predicting the size of the
varices.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Spleen stiffness measurement by transient elastography
is a reliable noninvasive method in predicting the presence of esophageal
varices compared to other noninvasive methods and monitoring of treatment by
carvedilol; however, it was not capable of identifying the size nor the risk
of variceal bleeding.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Gastric variceal bleeding is less common than
esophageal variceal bleeding; however, it is associated with a high
morbidity and mortality rate. The aim of our study was to compare the
balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) with
cyanoacrylate injection for the prophylaxis of recurrent gastric variceal
bleeding.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Between June 2015 and June 2018, 64 patients
with variceal bleeding were randomly assigned either balloon-occluded
retrograde transvenous obliteration (n = 32) or cyanoacrylate injection
(n = 32). The mean duration of follow−up period was 415 ± 250 days in the
BRTO group and 404 ± 210 days in the cyanoacrylate group. Foam sclerotherapy
using lauromacrogol by BRTO was performed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The technical success rate was 100% (32/32 patients) in
the BRTO group. The amount of lauromacrogol used was 12.5 ± 4.5 ml (range,
3-20 ml). Significant rebleeding occurred in 1 patients (21.9%) of the BRTO
group, and 7 patients (21.9%) of cyanoacrylate injection group (p = 0.023).
The cumulative probability of remaining free of all-cause rebleeding was
significantly higher in the BRTO group than in the cyanoacrylate group; the
probability at 1 year was 88.9% in the BRTO group and 78.1 % in the
cyanoacrylate group (p = 0.024). There was no difference in survival with
estimated 1-year survival rates for BRTO and cyanoacrylate injection treated
patients of 90.5% and 86.3%, and 2-year survival rates of 69.6% and 86.3%,
respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These results suggest that the BRTO is more effective
than cyanoacrylate injection in prevention of gastric variceal rebleeding.
Survival is similar in the 2 groups.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Recurrent bleeding from stomal varices secondary to
portal hypertension can be challenging to treat. Treatments available
include transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) and/or coil
embolisation of the dominant vein passing to the stoma or surgical
portosystemic shunt formation<sup>1</sup>. A more recent approach to treat
gastric varices is using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guidance using coil
embolisation or in combination with cyanoacrylate glue<sup>2</sup>.
Endoscopic use of human thrombin in gastric varices has also been proposed
as a treatment<sup>3</sup>. To date there are no publications on the
EUS-guided thrombin injection combined with coil embolisation. We have
experience of adopting this approach to treat stomal varices by EUS
guidance</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We analysed data and outcomes of all EUS-guided
intervention for bleeding stomal varices from January 2014 to October 2017
at a regional liver transplant centre. All cases were done using Olympus EUS
linear scopes, human thrombin (Tisseel®; 500IU/ML) ± coils (Nester®
Embolization Coils). After intubation of the stoma with the EUS scope, the
dominant feeding vessel to the stoma was targeted for injection with
thrombin ± coils. All procedures were undertaken without sedation, and the
majority without analgesia. Data presented as median (lower and upper
quartile), unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 19 patients (7 M &amp; 12 F) aged 63.5 (54-70) years with
recurrent bleeding from parastomal varices despite optimal medical therapy
for portal hypertension had a total 27 EUS-guided injections of 3000
(2500-4500) IU of human thrombin. 47% (9/19) had thrombin alone and 53%
(10/19) had concomitant coil embolisation. 68% (13/19) required single
intervention, 21% (4/19) required 2 interventions and 11% (2/19) required 3
interventions with median follow-up of 8 (6-17) months, 3 lost f/u and 3
died due to primary disease. Failure of treatment was defined as bleeding
requiring transfusion or hospital admission. Only 1 patient failed treatment
and went on to have an emergency venogram + embolisation. No immediate
complications or 30-day mortality were encountered.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> EUS-guided injection of thrombin ± coil embolisation
appears to be technically feasible and safe with good efficacy. To our
knowledge this is the first series of EUS-guided thrombin
injection ± embolisation of stomal varices. Due to the relative low number
of patients and short follow-up, further prospective evaluation of this
promising technique is required.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare
chronic cholestatic liver disease that leads to liver cirrhosis and
predisposes the development of cholangiocarcinoma<sup>1</sup>. At present,
no medication has been shown to delay the disease progression and liver
transplantation (LT) is the only effective treatment for end stage liver
disease. In previous studies mean time from diagnosis to liver
transplantation or death varies between 12 and 20 years<sup>1</sup>.
Concomitant inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is present in 20-80% of
patients, most commonly (80%) ulcerative colitis. Very few large
population-based studies of PSC are available<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Aim of the study: to assess the survival of PSC
patients in a large population-based cohort in Finland. All PSC patients
from 1990 to 2015 in a defined area of Finland, the Hospital District of
Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS), were retrieved. HUS has a comprehensive register
that includes all hospital admissions and discharge diagnoses, procedure
codes and admission and discharge dates. In 2015 the HUS area comprised 29%
(1,616,321) of the total Finnish population. Medical records of all patients
included were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis and establish the time of
the diagnosis. Cumulative survival and cumulative relative survival were
calculated. Four endpoints for survival calculations were used: 1) death or
LT 2) PSC-related death or LT 3) PSC-related death and 4) all deaths.
PSC-related death was defined as death from liver disease,
cholangiocarcinoma or colorectal cancer.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 580 patient were retrieved of whom 54% were male. All
resided in the HUS area at diagnosis and the diagnosis was established
within the study period of 1990-2015. Median age at diagnosis was 40.6
years. Age at diagnosis was categorized into 4 groups: &lt; 20 years, 20-39
years, 40-59 years, and ≥ 60 years. Within the study period 45 patients
underwent LT and 68 died. Of the 68 deaths 39 were PSC-related. Estimated
mean survival from diagnosis were 18.3 years (death or LT), 19.8 years
(PSC-related death or LT), 23.1 years (PSC-related death) or 21.9 years (all
deaths). The estimated mean time from diagnosis to death or LT for the
age-groups at diagnosis were 18.7 (&lt;20 years), 20.1 (20-39 years), 17.7
(40-49 years) and 13.7 (≥ 60 years), respectively. The relative survival
decreased for both sexes with time from diagnosis. The cumulative and
relative survival for males was slightly poorer than that for females. For
patients who had a LT median time from diagnosis to LT was 6.4 years. The
time to LT did not differ between males and females. Patients with IBD had a
better prognosis than non-IBD patients, this was also true for ulcerative
colitis and Crohn’s disease versus non-IBD patients.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We confirm the longer survival in PSC previously
reported. PSC patients in Finland with IBD have a better prognosis than
non-IBD patients, in contrast to previously published data<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic,
progressive structuring disease of bile ducts that may eventually lead to
cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). The etiopathogenesis is
heterogeneous, involving both genetic and environmental factors. Early
diagnosis and better tools for monitoring progression of PSC and detection
of biliary dysplasia is a major medical challenge. Novel biomarkers enabling
a more precise diagnostic and prognostic markers of both PSC and biliary
dysplasia are urgently needed.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This study aimed identifying a set of lipids in
bile that would serve as biomarkers for detection and prognosis of PSC and
biliary dysplasia. After informed consent, bile samples (n = 151) were drawn
from participants (n = 147) distributed across 4 experimental groups:
non-advanced PSC (n = 63), advanced PSC (n = 58), biliary dysplasia
(n = 24), and healthy controls (n = 6). The samples were subsequently
analyzed using a novel lipid-screening platform (Lipidyzer™, Sciex) to
determine the concentration of 1134 lipids species across 13 lipid
classes.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Model based analyses (Generalized Estimating Equations)
pinpointed the following set of lipids as altered in PSC patients with
respect to healthy controls, after correcting for type-I error:
lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC(18:3), LPC(20:4), LPC(20:5), LPC(22:5), and
LPC(22:6); lowest p = 6.46·10<sup>−12</sup>), lysophosphatidylethanolamines
(LPE(20:3); p = 3.06·10<sup>−6</sup>), phosphatidylcholines (PC(14:0/16:1),
PC(14:0/20:4), PC(17:0/18:1), PC(17:0/20:4), PC(18:0/18:1), and
PC(18:0/18:3); lowest p = 3.27·10<sup>−6</sup>), phosphatidylethanolamines
(total PE, PE(16:0/16:1), PE(16:0/18:1), PE(16:0/18:2), PE(16:0/18:3),
PE(16:0/20:4), PE(18:0/18:3), PE(18:0/20:3), PE(18:0/20:4), PE(18:1/18:1),
PE(18:1/18:2), PE(O-18:0/18:1); lowest p = 3.27·10<sup>−6</sup>), and
multiple fatty acids in LPC (alpha-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid,
eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid;
lowest p = 6.46·10<sup>−12</sup>), LPE (eicosatrienoic acid;
p = 3.06·10<sup>−6</sup>), PC (pentadecanoic acid and heptadecanoic
acid; p = 2.01·10<sup>−5</sup>and 1.65·10<sup>−5</sup>, respectively), and
PE (hexadecanoic acid, heptadecanoic acid, oleic acid, alpha-linoleic acid,
eicosatrienoic acid, and arachidonic acid; lowest p = 1.85·10<sup>−9</sup>).
All the above except PC(18:0/18:3) PE(16:0/18:2), PE(16:0/20:4), and
eicosatrienoic acid in PE were also altered when comparing all affected
patients (PSC and dysplasia) to healthy controls.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> From the extensive lipid panel initially screened,
this study was capable of detecting a set of 34 candidate bile biomarkers
that allowed differentiating between persons affected with PSC and biliary
dysplasia from the healthy controls.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The cornerstone of treatment in cholangitis exist of
adequate drainage of the biliary tract by means of an ERCP in combination
with antibiotics. Recommendations in current international guidelines
regarding the duration of antibiotic treatment after adequate drainage vary
from 3 days or less up to 10 days. The Dutch (SWAB) guideline recommends
antibiotics for 3 days or less. However, high level of evidence to justify
this recommendation is lacking. Our aim was to assess the incidence of
infectious complications after adequate drainage of ascending cholangitis
and to evaluate the potential influence of the antibiotic duration.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective multicenter study
in 7 medical centers in the Amsterdam region. Patients with cholangitis due
to choledocholithiasis between January 2012 and January 2017 were extracted
from local prospective endoscopy databases. Adequate drainage by means of
ERCP was required. The primary outcome was number of infectious
complications within 3 months after the initial ERCP. An infectious
complication was defined as the need for antibiotics within 3 months after
ERCP. Secondary outcomes included duration of hospital stay and guideline
adherence.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 426 patients with cholangitis due to choledocholithiasis
were identified of which 303 patients met all inclusion criteria. During
follow-up 68 infectious complications occurred in 64 patients (21%). The
median duration of antibiotics given after adequate drainage was 4 days (IQR
2-6 days). In 141 patients (47%) the Dutch guideline was adhered, and
antibiotics were given for 3 days or less. 39 of 68 complications (24%)
occurred in patients receiving antibiotics more than 3 days versus 29 (21%)
in the patients treated less than 3 days (p = 0.615). Severity of
cholangitis (according to Tokyo guideline) did not differ between patients
receiving antibiotics for 3 days or less or longer. The median duration of
hospital stay was 6 days (IQR 4-9 days). Hospital stay in patients receiving
antibiotics for 3 days or less was shorter in comparison with patients
receiving antibiotics for more than 3 days; 6 days (IQR 4-8.5 days) and 7
days (IQR 5-9.5 days) respectively (p = 0.026).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The Dutch guideline regarding duration of antibiotics
in cholangitic patients after successful ERCP is not consistently followed.
Our data confirms that antibiotics for less than 3 days after adequate
drainage does not lead to an increase in infectious complications in
comparison with longer treatment. Moreover, treating for more than 3 days
increases, likely unnecessary, hospital stay. We therefore recommend
stricter adherence to the Dutch guideline.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a complex,
chronic cholestatic disease with unknown aetiology. Genetic factors have
been identified and whilst an environmental trigger has been postulated its
identity is unknown (1-4). This is a unique study examining the role of
putative environmental risk factors in a comprehensive, well-defined cohort
of PSC patients.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The study aimed to identify all patients with
PSC in a defined geographical region within England and examine whether
there was evidence of environmental factors related to disease prevalence.
The study was based in the Academic Health Science Network for the North
East and North Cumbria (AHSN NENC); a region with a heterogeneous mix of
urban and rural landscapes including areas of intensive historical and
well-documented industrialisation.</p>
<p>Extensive, multi-source case-finding methodology was used. Besag-York-Mollie
models were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of PSC in individual
postcode districts in relation to putative risk factors for disease. The
null model was developed to look for clusters of disease. Models were then
fitted with various single spatial covariates: urban-ness, traffic, landfill
sites, coal mines, lead mines, sandstone quarries, limestone quarries,
Townsend score (a measure of social deprivation), cadmium, arsenic, lead,
manganese, iron, stream sediment pH) and a multi-covariate model containing
covariates shown to be significant at 95% Bayesian Credibility Intervals
(BCIs). Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) was used to compare the fits of
models. All analyses were performed after controlling for the area size of
each postcode district. There were 3 main questions:</p>
<p>1. Is the prevalence of PSC in a defined area greater than that expected by
chance i.e. disease clustering?</p>
<p>2. If so, is elevated risk associated with any environmental risk factors local
to the cases?</p>
<p>3. Is elevated risk dependent on socio-economic status?</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 472 patients were identified (diagnosed between 1972 and
2018); 321/472 (68%) male, median age at diagnosis 51 (11-92) years. The
null model showed evidence of disease clustering with areas of high and low
disease prevalence (controlled for population size). The areas of highest
risk were in rural Cumbria (RR 1.755) and lowest risk in urban Darlington
and Teeside (RR 0.6243).</p>
<p>Models using single spatial covariates showed that only urban-ness and Townsend
score significantly improved the ‘null model' with 2.5% and 97.5% confidence
intervals not crossing 0. A multi-covariate model (combining urban-ness and
Townsend score) did not improve the model further. There was a statistically
significant difference in the Townsend scores of the 20 patients living in
areas of highest and lowest prevalence (p &lt; 0.0001) with lower Townsend
scores (i.e. less social deprivation) seen in areas of high disease
prevalence.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A higher prevalence of PSC was seen in more rural,
less deprived areas. This inverse association with social deprivation is the
opposite to that seen in epidemiological studies of many other diseases,
including liver diseases, and warrants further investigation into potential
disease triggers. The association with rurality raises the possibility of an
association with processes in these areas e.g. farming, pesticide use.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Obeticholic Acid (OCA) is a selective and potent
farnesoid X receptor agonist indicated for treatment of primary biliary
cholangitis (PBC). POISE is a 12-month double-blind (DB), placebo
(PBO)-controlled, Phase 3 PBC study including an open-label extension
(OLE).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The purpose of the OLE is to assess safety and
durability of the OCA effect on serum markers of cholestasis. Key POISE
inclusion criteria: PBC diagnosis, ALP ≥1.67x ULN and/or total bilirubin
(TB) &gt;ULN to &lt; 2x ULN, stable UDCA dose or unable to tolerate UDCA.
During the DB phase, 216 patients were randomized and dosed to: daily PBO,
n = 73; OCA 5-10 mg (titration after 6 months based on response and
tolerability), n = 70; or OCA 10 mg, n = 73. In the OLE, all patients were
initially treated with OCA 5 mg regardless of DB treatment with the option
to increase after 3 months based on response and tolerability.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 193 of 198 (97%) patients completing the DB phase of the
study enrolled in the OLE; 165 reached 36 months of the OLE: PBO, n = 49;
OCA 5-10 mg, n = 59; OCA 10 mg, n = 57. At the end of the DB phase, patients
on OCA had significant reductions in ALP and patients on PBO did not (Table
1). ALP reduction observed in OCA-treated patients was durable through 36
months OLE. PBO-treated patients experienced a significant reduction in ALP
after switching to OCA, which was durable through 36 months OLE. Similar
durable improvements were seen for GGT, ALT, and AST (data not shown). For
OCA-treated patients, mean TB remained below BL through 36 months OLE. For
PBO-treated patients, mean TB increased at 12 months DB, but trended back
toward baseline (BL) with 36 months of OCA during OLE. During the OLE, 28
(15%) patients discontinued treatment, 7 (4%) patients for pruritus.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> OCA treatment results in improvement in liver
biochemistry; this improvement is shown to be durable in this analysis. For
patients initially treated with PBO, switching to OCA is also associated
with a durable biochemical response. Consistent with the DB phase, pruritus
was the most common side effect of OCA, but discontinuation due to pruritus
continues to be infrequent. <table-wrap id="table35-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table35-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table35"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">DB Phase Treatment Group</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">PBO</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">OCA 5-10 mg</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">OCA 10 mg</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">ALP (U/L)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">DB BL</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">327 (115)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">326 (116)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">316 (104)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">ΔDB 12 Mo</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">−8 (88)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">−104 (87)***</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">−118 (73)***</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">ΔOLE 24 Mo</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">−101 (87)***</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">−121 (97)***</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">−103 (79)***</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">ΔOLE 36 Mo</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">−113 (90)***</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">−101 (110)***</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">−85 (137)***</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">TB (μmol/L)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">DB BL</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">11.8 (7.2)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">10.2 (5.5)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">11.3 (6.6)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">ΔDB 12 Mo</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.5 (4.1)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">−0.5 (3.4)**</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">−1.2 (4.3)***</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">ΔOLE 24 Mo</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.9 (7.6)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">−0.4 (3.6)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">−0.6 (4.8)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">ΔOLE 36 Mo</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.5 (3.6)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">−0.5 (3.4)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">−0.9 (4.1)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.0001.

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors are emerging as a
promising treatment option for ulcerative colitis (UC). The efficacy and
safety of upadacitinib (UPA), a JAK1-selective inhibitor, was assessed in an
8-week double-blind placebo (PBO)-controlled dose-ranging Phase 2b induction
study in patients (pts) with moderately-to-severely active UC who had
inadequate response, loss of response or intolerance to corticosteroids
(CS), immunosuppressants (IS), or biologic therapies.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Adult pts with moderately-to-severely active UC
(Adapted Mayo Score [Mayo score without Physician Global Assessment] 5-9
points and centrally-read endoscopy subscore 2-3) were randomized to receive
extended-release UPA 7.5, 15, 30, 45 mg once daily (QD) or PBO for 8 weeks.
Pts were stratified by previous biologic use, baseline (BL) CS use, and BL
Adapted Mayo score (≤7/&gt;7). A dose-response relationship between UPA
doses and PBO for the primary endpoint, clinical remission per Adapted Mayo
Score at week 8 (defined as stool frequency subscore [SFS]≤1, rectal
bleeding subscore [RBS] = 0, endoscopic subscore [ES]≤1), was tested by
Multiple Comparison Procedures Modeling (MCP-Mod) using pre-specified
candidate models in the intent-to-treat population. Pairwise comparisons
between UPA doses and PBO for the primary and ranked secondary endpoints
were also conducted using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by
randomization factors. Non-responder and last observation carried forward
imputations were utilized for missing values in categorical and continuous
efficacy variables. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported
from first dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 250 pts were randomised with a mean (SD) age
of 42.3 (14.2) years and a disease duration of 8.2 (2.5) years. At BL, 77.6%
had prior use of biologics, 36% had an Adapted Mayo Score &gt;7, and 79% had
an ES of 3. A significant and consistent dose-response relationship was
observed with UPA for the primary and secondary endpoints with highest rates
observed with 45 mg QD treatment. At Week 8, the primary endpoint and
secondary endpoints of endoscopic improvement, clinical remission per full
Mayo score, and clinical response per adapted Mayo score were achieved with
all doses from 15 mg to 45 mg QD (Table). Incidences of AEs and AEs leading
to discontinuation were similar across UPA groups, and numerically higher in
the PBO group. Rates of serious AEs (SAE) were 10.9%, 0%, 4.1%, 5.8% and
5.4%,for PBO, 7.5, 15, 30, and 45 mg QD, respectively; UC worsening was
reported in 4.3%, 0%, 2.1%, 5.8% and 1.8% among SAEs, respectively in each
arm. Serious infections occurred in pts receiving PBO (4.3%, n = 2), 15mg QD
(2.0%, n = 1), and 45mg QD (3.6%, n = 2). One event of herpes zoster with 45
mg QD and no events of TB were reported. One malignancy (malignant melanoma)
occurred with 7.5mg QD. No venous thromboembolic events or deaths were
reported. <table-wrap id="table36-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Abstract No: OP195</label><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table36-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table36"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Endpoints</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Placebo n = 46</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">UPA 7.5 mg QD n = 47</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">UPA 15 mg QD n = 49</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">UPA 30 mg QD n = 52</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">UPA 45 mg QD n = 56</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Clinical remission per Adapted Mayo Score at

<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this dose-ranging 8-week induction study, UPA
demonstrated statistically significantly greater efficacy compared to PBO in
pts with moderately-to-severely active UC. A dose-response relationship of
efficacy was demonstrated by MCP-Mod in doses up to 45 mg QD. UPA was
well-tolerated, and no new safety concerns were identified compared to
previous studies of UPA.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Many patients with Crohn's disease (CD) report that
the use of medical cannabis improves their symptoms, however studies
evaluating objective disease parameters including inflammatory markers and
endoscopic score are lacking.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To assess the effect of cannabis treatment on
Crohn's disease patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> In a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
on CD patients with active disease Patients were randomized to receive
either cannabis oil with 15%Cannabidiol (CBD) and 4%tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) or placebo for 8 weeks. All other medications remained unchanged.
Disease-related outcome measures including Crohn's disease activity index
(CDAI), C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectine, simple endoscopic
score for Crohn’s disease (SES-CD) and SF-36 quality of life (QOL) were
assessed before, during and after treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 46 patients, 31 males (62%), mean age 35 ± 12,
were investigated. Each study group included 23 patients. CDAI before the
treatment was 288.4 ± 78.0 and 298.5 ± 112.2 (p = 0.71), after 8 weeks of
treatment the CDAI was 143.1 ± 96.0 and 209.5 ± 113.0 in the cannabis and
placebo groups, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Remission rate (defined as
CDAI &lt; 150) was achieved in 65% of the cannabis group and 35% of the
placebo group (p &lt; 0.05). Median quality of life score after 8 weeks was
90.1 (IQR 83-102) in the cannabis group and 76 (IQR 68-92) in the placebo
group (p &lt; 0.05). CRP before treatment was 3.1 ± 4.4mg/dl and
3.6 ± 5.4mg/dl (p = 0.62), after treatment it was 2.4 ± 8mg/dl and
4.1 ± 8.8mg/dl in the cannabis and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.40).
Calprotectine before treatment was 182 ± 133 and 122 ± 91 (p = 0.37), after
treatment it was 170 ± 115.6 and 137 ± 115 (p = 0.76) in the cannabis and
placebo groups, respectively. SES-CD was 9.5 ± 6.511.9 ± 6 (p = 0.93) before
treatment and 7.17 ± 6 and 9.8 ± 5.4 (p = 0.17) after treatment in the
cannabis and placebo groups, respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> 8 weeks of CBD-rich cannabis treatment induced
significant clinical improvement but no change in inflammatory parameters or
endoscopic score. Cannabis treatment in Crohn's disease could be considered
for temporary symptom relief. The potential anti-inflammatory properties of
cannabis treatment in IBD/Crohn's disease requires further
investigation.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule Janus kinase
inhibitor that is being investigated for ulcerative colitis (UC). The
efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily (BID) induction therapy
for UC was previously reported in 2 8-week, Phase 3 trials (OCTAVE Induction
1 &amp; 2 [NCT01465763 &amp; NCT01458951]).<sup>1</sup> The initial trial
protocols called for patients to be randomised (2:2:1) to either tofacitinib
10 or 15 mg BID or placebo. Randomisation to the tofacitinib 15 mg BID dose
ceased after a protocol amendment.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We report pooled efficacy and safety analyses
from OCTAVE Induction 1 &amp; 2 for the tofacitinib 15 mg BID dose alongside
data from the placebo and tofacitinib 10 mg BID groups previously
reported.<sup>1</sup> Patients were ≥18 years of age and had failed,
or were intolerant to, corticosteroids, immunomodulators or tumour necrosis
factor inhibitors. Remission (total Mayo score ≤2, no subscore &gt;1 and
rectal bleeding subscore of 0), mucosal healing (Mayo endoscopic subscore
≤1) and clinical response (decrease from baseline total Mayo score of ≥3
points and ≥30%, plus decrease in rectal bleeding subscore ≥1 or absolute
subscore ≤1) were evaluated based on central reading of endoscopic subscore.
Differences from placebo and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated
using an exact method.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Baseline demographics and disease characteristics of the
22 patients who received tofacitinib 15 mg BID during OCTAVE Induction 1
&amp; 2 were generally consistent with the overall study population. At Week
8 in the tofacitinib 15 mg BID group, the primary efficacy endpoint of
remission was achieved by 9 (40.9%) patients, mucosal healing by 13 (59.1%)
patients, and clinical response by 19 patients (86.4%). Treatment effect
sizes (ie difference from placebo [95% CI]) were 34.9% (15.6, 56.4) for
remission, 45.4% (23.5, 65.3) for mucosal healing, and 55.6% (32.3, 67.8)
for clinical response. There were numerically greater rates of adverse
events (AEs) and infections with tofacitinib 15 mg BID compared with
tofacitinib 10 mg BID and with placebo. There were no deaths, serious AEs,
serious infections, herpes zoster, gastrointestinal perforations,
opportunistic infections, malignancies, non-melanoma skin cancers or major
adverse cardiovascular events with tofacitinib 15 mg BID (Table).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Based on a small sample size of 22 patients who
received tofacitinib 15 mg BID in OCTAVE Induction 1 &amp; 2, efficacy with
tofacitinib 15 mg BID was greater than with placebo, and there were
numerically greater rates of AEs and infections with tofacitinib 15 mg BID
compared with tofacitinib 10 mg BID and placebo. <table-wrap id="table37-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table37-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table37"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="4" rowspan="1">Table.

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> An observed deficiency of phosphatidylcholine (PC)
in the intestinal mucus in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) [1] led to
the hypothesis that daily oral administration and subsequent
gastro-resistant release of PC into the ileum could restore the protective
mucus barrier function.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This was a prospective, double-blind,
randomised, multicenter phase 3 trial to compare the efficacy and safety of
2 different dosing regimen of LT-02 (LT-02 0.8 g QID, LT-02 1.6 g BID) with
placebo over 12 weeks for induction of remission in patients with active
ulcerative colitis (mDAI score 4-10, with≥ 1 point in each of the four
subscores) refractory to mesalazine despite either continued treatment with
oral 5-ASA ≥ 2.4 g/d for ≥ 6 weeks or combination of oral 5-ASA ≥ 2.4 g/d
and a rectal 5-ASA preparation for ≥10-14 days. Subjects had to have fecal
calprotectin (FCP) ≥ 250 µg/g at screening or FCP ≥ 100 µg/g and &lt; 250
µg/g and Histological Index (HI) &gt;1. Primary endpoint was the percentage
of patients in deep remission defined as mDAI Score ≤ 1 with a score of ‘0'
points for rectal bleeding and stool frequency, and ≥ 1 point reduction from
baseline in the mucosal appearance score. After a pre-specified
interim-analysis, the study was stopped for futility.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Vedolizumab (VDZ), a humanized monoclonal antibody
inhibiting α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> integrin, is approved globally for the
treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). However, data on its safety and
efficacy is limited in the Asian population. We conducted a phase 3,
randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled study in Japanese
patients (pts) with UC (NCT02039505), where 1 of 2 primary endpoints were
met: clinical response at Week 10 (induction phase, IP) was numerically
greater but not significant, and clinical remission at Week 60 (maintenance
phase, MP) was statistically superior, in the VDZ compared with the PBO arm.
Here we report the results of predefined exploratory endpoints for the MP:
the effect of VDZ on time to disease worsening (TDW) and time to treatment
failure (TTF).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Japanese pts with moderate-to-severe UC received
300mg VDZ or PBO at Weeks 0, 2 and 6 in the IP. Pts showing a clinical
response to VDZ at Week 10 were then randomized 1:1 to receive VDZ (N = 41)
or PBO (N = 42) in the MP, at Weeks 14, 22, 30, 38, 46 and 54. Disease
worsening in the MP was defined as an increase of the partial Mayo score
(range: 0-9 points) by ≥3 points compared with that of Week 10 for 2
successive visits, and a partial Mayo score of ≥5 points (or ≥9 points in 2
successive visits, in the case of &gt;6 points at Week 10). Treatment
failure was defined as any of the following: disease worsening, use of
rescue medication, or study discontinuation due to drug-related adverse
events.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Kaplan-Meier analysis of TDW showed that at Month 6, the
proportion of pts without disease worsening was higher for the VDZ group
(89.6%) compared with the PBO group (74.4%); this difference was sustained
at Month 12 with rates of 89.6% for VDZ and 67.0% for PBO groups. The
proportion of pts without treatment failure was 82.5% in the VDZ and 61.5%
for PBO groups at Month 6, and was 68.8% and 52.4%, respectively, at Month
12. In a stratified log-rank test based on prior TNFα antagonist use,
statistically significant differences were observed between the treatment
groups for both TDW (p<italic> = </italic>0.0446) and TTF
(p<italic> = </italic>0.0166).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> VDZ showed statistically significant difference
between treatment groups on TDW and TTF in Japanese pts with UC.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Unlike anti-TNFs, ustekinumab (UST, an anti-IL-12/23
monoclonal antibody) appears minimally immunogenic, and therefore may not
require combination with immunosuppresants (IS) AZA, 6-MP, or MTX to achieve
maximum efficacy. As previously reported, UST is superior to PBO across a
wide range of subgroups, including combo &amp; mono therapy. In this post
hoc analysis of the UNITI program, we further investigate the role of
combining IS with UST.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The efficacy of UST in induction and maintenance
was stratified according to IS use, then tested for potential correlation
between the effect size of the response of UST and the use of IS
(Chi-square, without corrections or error control). For the safety
population, we created odds ratios for all AEs and infections, for combo and
mono groups. Safety data was corrected for follow-up and stratified by
concomitant IS use.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> We compared the efficacy of UST and PBO at primary and
major secondary endpoints for the induction and maintenance ph3 trials.
During the induction trials (UNITI-1 &amp; -2) we could not detect an
association between concomitant IS use and efficacy at any endpoint (Data
for approved ∼6mg/kg induction dose in Table 1), nor was there any
consistently obvious benefit for combo therapy with IS. During maintenance
therapy (IM-UNITI), we failed to detect significant interactions between
concomitant IS use and efficacy in either Q8W or Q12W UST groups (Table1).
Rates of total AEs were not obviously different between groups, though combo
therapy tended to have lower rates than monotherapy. When examining rates of
infections, there were no trends when contrasting dose groups or IS use. PBO
pts treated with concomitant IS had infections rates of 156, 182, and 114
per 100 pt-yrs (PBO, UST 90mg Q12W, and UST 90mg Q8W) vs. 167, 130, 173 per
100 pt-yrs (PBO, UST 90mg Q12W, and UST 90mg Q8W) without IS. Odds ratios
did not appear different when contrasting mono and combo therapy; with 95%
CI's were broadly overlapping and crossing 1.0.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this analysis, we were unable to detect a
significant interaction between any dosage of UST and IS. Taken with
previously presented data on serum [UST] being independent of IS use, and
low overall immunogenicity; these data suggest that similar benefit is
achieved when UST is administered as monotherapy or given as combination
therapy with IS in patients with moderate to severe CD. <table-wrap id="table39-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Abstract No: OP200 Table 1</label><caption><p>Role of concomitant immunosuppression in the efficacy of UST

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Multiple techniques exist for the management of
colorectal polyps. Recent (2017) ESGE guidelines [1] have defined an
evidence based approach to the optimal technique for removing different
sizes of polyps.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Previously the decision on optimal polypectomy
technique often depended on an individual operator's experience and
training. We sought to examine current polypectomy practice amongst United
Kingdom endoscopy trainees with reference to these guidelines.</p>
<p>The ESGE polypectomy guideline 2017 suggests polyps &lt; 10mm should be removed
using cold snare polypectomy (CSP) or cold biopsy forceps (CBF)
[ &lt;  = 3mm only], 10-19mm using endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or hot
snare polypectomy (HSP) and 20mm or larger using EMR. The JETS database is a
prospectively collected record of trainee colonoscopic procedures in the
United Kingdom and its use during training is mandatory for accreditation.
Data is entered by trainees on their own endoscopic procedures. Adverse
events were classified as delayed bleeding or delayed perforation. We
retrospectively analysed procedures entered into the JETS database from Jan
2008 to December 2017 for polypectomy technique and compared this to the
2017 ESGE guideline.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 291,778 polypectomies were performed in 176,569
trainee-performed procedures by 3395 trainees over the study period. 10,584
polypectomies were missing data. 281,194 polypectomies were analysed.</p>
<p>Of 250,783 polyps <bold> &lt; 10mm in size</bold> removed, 29.5% were performed
using CBF, 27.9% by CSP, 25.1% by hot snare polypectomy HSP, 9.5% by hot
biopsy forceps HBF, and 8.0% by endoscopic mucosal resection EMR. Of 26,605
polyps <bold>10-19mm in size</bold>, 55.3% were removed by HSP, 31.0% by EMR
and 3.5% by CSP. 8.4% of lesions were biopsied and not removed. Of 3806
polyps <bold>≥ 20mm in size</bold>, 39.4% were removed by EMR, 36.3% by HSP,
1.1% were removed by CSP and 21.9% of these lesions were biopsied and not
removed.</p>
<p>Overall, adherence to the ESGE guidance was observed in 154,948 polypectomies
(55.1%). Nurse endoscopists were more adherent (61.7%), versus physicians
(57.9%) versus surgeons (44.3%), p &lt; 0.001.</p>
<p>Of 219 (0.1%) adverse events reported amongst all polypectomies, 50.8% were
amongst HSP, 19.2% EMR, 16.9% CSP and 12.7% after HBF, p &lt; 0.001. Of 20
delayed perforations (event rate 0.01%), 55% were due to EMR, 30% to HSP and
15% to HBF. No perforations resulted from CSP. 0.03% of all polypectomies
resulted in unplanned hospital admission. Of these admissions 45.1% were
after EMR, 35.1% after HSP and 6.4% after CSP, p &lt; 0.001.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Cold snare polypectomy is under-utilised for
diminutive polypectomy, despite its proven safety and efficacy; its use
amongst trainees should be promoted in line with ESGE guidance. Trainees are
likely to follow the example of their trainers and, as such, this study
likely provides an insight into current polypectomy practice in the wider UK
endoscopic community. Trainees in the United Kingdom predominantly remove
diminutive polyps with extremely low reported rates of adverse events, but
do not often perform more complex polypectomy.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) allows safe and
effective resection of large laterally spreading lesions ≥ 20mm (LSL).
Adenoma recurrence is commonplace when resection is performed piecemeal. En
bloc EMR, however, has been shown to achieve low adenoma recurrence rates
but long term outcomes are unknown.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Over 9 years to April 2017 analysis of LSL
resected by EMR from a prospectively collected database at 8 Australian
Tertiary Referral Centres was performed. LSL ≤ 25mm in the left colon and ≤
20mm in the right colon were included. Multiple LSL in the same patient were
excluded. Standard inject and resect EMR was performed. LSL resections were
identified as piecemeal or en bloc (single snare resection) and their
outcomes were compared. Scheduled surveillance colonoscopy was performed at
desired intervals of 4-6 months and 18 months after EMR. Late recurrence
described adenoma recurrence after a negative surveillance procedure.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 587 LSL were included of which 267 (46.1%) were resected
en bloc, with histologic clear margins in 80.4%. Larger and previously
attempted LSL were more likely to be removed piecemeal (p = 0.015 and
p &lt; 0.001 respectively). Neither colonic location nor morphology
predicted en bloc resection. En bloc resections took less time, median 10
versus 20 minutes, p &lt; 0.001. Muscularis propria injury was more common
with en bloc resection (p = 0.038). Other adverse events were not more
common between the groups (table 1).</p>
<p>406 (69%) LSL underwent first surveillance with recurrence in 5 (2.6%) LSL
which were resected en bloc and 23 (9.3%) resected piecemeal (p = 0.004).
251 (63%) LSL underwent second surveillance at median 19.5 months
(interquartile range 15.5–25). Recurrence was present in 1 (0.8%) EMR scar
where the LSL was resected en bloc and 7 (5.4%) resected piecemeal
(p = 0.066). In the piecemeal group 4/7 of these recurrences were after
treatment of a previous recurrence. Need for surgery was infrequent in both
groups during surveillance and was due to inability to resect recurrence in
all cases. <table-wrap id="table40-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table40-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table40"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">En bloc (n = 267)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Piecemeal (n = 320)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">P</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Underwent first surveillance, n (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">195 (77)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">246 (77)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Time to first surveillance, months, median

</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> LSL resected piecemeal by EMR have higher recurrence
rates at first surveillance, but comparable rates of late recurrence at
second surveillance compared to those resected en bloc. Adenoma recurrence
at surveillance procedures is readily treated endoscopically. En bloc
resection may lead to higher rates of adverse events versus piecemeal
resection. Unless there is concern for invasive disease, en bloc resection
need not be pursued at all costs.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Cold snare polypectomy (CSP) for colorectal adenomas
is used worldwide because of its excellent safety. However, the rate of R0
resection is not adequately high [1]. Few studies have reported on the
efficacy of underwater endoscopic mucosal resection for colorectal adenomas
[2]. We hypothesized that CSP for colorectal adenomas in underwater
environment may combine high safety and high R0 resection rate; we named
this procedure underwater CSP (UCSP). We prospectively analyzed the safety
and efficacy of UCSP.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> [Study 1] Between May 2017 and January 2018, 161
lesions from 53 patients were resected using UCSP. Patients with
pathologically confirmed adenomas underwent follow-up colonoscopy 3 weeks
after UCSP whether or not they achieved R0 resection. Any post-UCSP scars
were biopsied to confirm the presence or absence of residual adenomas.</p>
<p>[Study 2] We used propensity score-matching (PSM) analysis to compare the
safety and efficacy of UCSP in the resection of 175 adenomas and to confirm
the presence of residual adenomas in the 102 lesions resected using
conventional CSP, between March 2015 and April 2017; the follow-up schedule
for both groups was the same. The location, macroscopic type, and size of
the lesions were used as covariates.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> [Study 1] The patients included 33 men and 20 women (mean
age, 68.0 ± 8.1 years). The number of lesions in the cecum, ascending colon,
transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoidal colon, and rectum, was 15, 51,
53, 22, 35, and 15, respectively. The number of lesions with type Ip, Isp,
Is, and IIa macroscopic appearance was 3, 49, 62, and 78, respectively. The
mean lesion size was 4.5 ± 1.5 mm (range, 2-8 mm; median, 4 mm). The en bloc
resection and complete retrieval rates of specimens were 100% and 99.5%,
respectively. In the final pathological diagnoses, 13, 157, 6, 8, 1, 1, and
4 lesions were non-tumor, low-grade tubular adenoma, low-grade
tubulo-villous adenoma, high-grade tubular adenoma, high-grade
tubulo-villous adenoma, intra-mucosal carcinoma, and SSA/P, respectively.
The R0 resection rate of 177 tumorous lesions was 74.0% (131/177). No cases
of perforation or delayed bleeding were found. Of the 177 scars post-CSP for
adenomas, 175 (98.9%) were identified, and one residual adenoma (0.57%) was
pathologically identified from all the biopsied scar specimens.</p>
<p>[Study 2] For PSM analysis, 204 lesions (102 pairs) were included. No
significant differences were observed in the location, macroscopic type, or
size of the lesions between the two groups. The R0 resection rate of UCSP
was significantly higher than that of CSP (75.5% vs. 32.4%; p &lt; 0.001).
The rate of pathological residual adenomas 3 weeks after resection was 0.98%
in both groups (1/102).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The R0 resection rate of UCSP was significantly higher
than that of conventional CSP, with both procedures showing similar safety.
Therefore, UCSP may be adequate therapy for small colorectal adenomas.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Endoscopic full thickness resection (eFTR) of the
colon using the full thickness resection device (FTRD) is a novel method for
removing lesions involving, or tethered to, deeper layers of the colonic
wall. The UK FTRD registry collects data from multiple centres performing
this procedure. We describe the feasibility and early outcomes of this
technique.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Registry data from April 2015 – January 2018 was
analysed. Main outcome measures were technical success, procedural time,
specimen size, R0 resection, endoscopic clearance, and adverse events.
Reported technical difficulties were collated.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 38 cases were performed across 8 centres (median 2 cases
per centre, range 1-23). Mean patient age was 70 years (39-93). Indications
for eFTR include non-lifting adenoma (18 cases), T1 tumour resection (10),
submucosal tumour (7), and appendix base adenoma (3).</p>
<p>In 97.4% (37/38) of patients the lesion was reached with the FTRD. 1 caecal
lesion could not be reached due to sigmoid diverticulosis. The procedure was
technically successful in 91.9% of patients (34/37). Median procedure time
was 41 minutes (11-86), median resection time 6 minutes (2-36), and median
specimen size 22mm (10-30). R0 resection was achieved in 76.5% of patients
(26/34). R0 resection was not achieved in 8 patients, of which 5 had no
residual lesion on follow up, giving a total endoscopic clearance rate of
91.2% (31/34).</p>
<p>Technical difficulty occurred in 9 patients; 6 due to snare failure and 3 due
to lesion slippage on clip deployment. Of these 9 cases, 7 achieved R0
resection by use of further snare. Of the 2 patients with R1 resection, one
has had follow-up at 4 months with no evidence of residual lesion.</p>
<p>Resection was unsuccessful in 3 patients; 2 due to significant tethering
restricting lesion capture, and 1 due to haemodynamic instability from
atrial fibrillation whilst pulling lesion into cap.</p>
<p>Complications occurred in 2 patients; 1 acute appendicitis at day 6 after
resection of appendix base adenoma, and 1 with mild asymptomatic stricture
at eFTR site at follow-up. There were no cases of bleeding, perforation, or
fistula.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> eFTR has a high success rate in treating lesions not
previously amenable to endoscopic therapy. Whilst technical difficulties may
arise, complication rates are low and outcomes acceptable, making eFTR a
viable alternative to surgery.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Among early colorectal carcinomas, lesions with
little possibility of lymph node metastasis are usually treated
endoscopically [1]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no report has
described the problem with endoscopic treatment for early carcinomas arising
in sessile serrated adenoma/polyps (SSA/Ps). Although invasive carcinomas
with SSA/Ps (CA-SSA/Ps) are rare, these tumours are critical because SSA/Ps
may grow into subsequent SSA/Ps with high-grade dysplasia or those with
submucosal carcinoma more rapidly [2]. Furthermore, mucinous histology has
also been found in CA-SSA/Ps [3], [4].</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to elucidate the
clinicopathological features of CA-SSA/Ps and to investigate the possibility
of endoscopic resection for these lesions. We reviewed all lesions
pathologically diagnosed as T1 colorectal carcinomas that were
endoscopically or surgically resected at Juntendo University Hospital and
our affiliated hospitals between 2006 and 2017. We identified 45 CA-SSA/P
lesions (from 45 patients) that were endoscopically (n = 18) or surgically
resected (n = 27). For comparison, we randomly selected 200 invasive
carcinomas with adenomas (CA-ADs) that were endoscopically (n = 87) or
surgically resected (n = 113) from 200 patients.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The clinicopathological characteristics of the studied
lesions are summarized in Table 1. The patients with CA-SSA/P were older
than those with CA-AD and were predominantly female. CA-SSA/Ps were more
frequently located in the proximal colon than CA-ADs. Furthermore, CA-SSA/Ps
more frequently exhibited sessile morphology than CA-ADs. CA-SSA/Ps were
significantly smaller than CA-ADs. Well to moderately differentiated
adenocarcinomas were predominant in both groups. In addition, a mucinous
component in the submucosa was more common in CA-SSA/Ps than in CA-ADs.
CA-SSA/Ps invaded less deeply into the submucosal layer than CA-ADs.
Lymphatic invasion was observed more often in CA-SSA/Ps than in CA-ADs, as
was lymph node metastasis.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although CA-SSA/Ps were smaller and invaded less
deeply into the submucosal layer than CA-ADs, they frequently had a mucinous
component and exhibited a higher potential for lymphatic invasion and lymph
node metastasis. Therefore, the risk of lymph node metastasis should be
considered when performing endoscopic treatment for CA-SSA/Ps even if the
lesions are small. <table-wrap id="table41-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table41-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table41"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Variable</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">SSA/P-CA (n = 45)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">AD-CA (n = 200)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">P value</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age (years)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">71.3 ± 8.2 (55–89)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">66.2 ± 10.0 (40–86)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.002</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Sex</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> Male</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">19 (42%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">124 (62%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.019</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> Female</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">26 (58%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">76 (38%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Location</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> Proximal colon</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">43 (96%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">38 (19%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &lt; 0.001</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> Distal colon</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2 (4%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">162 (81%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Macroscopic type</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> Sessile</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">31 (69%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">87 (43%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.002</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> Semipedunculated</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12 (27%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">60 (30%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> Pedunculated</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2 (4%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">53 (27%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Size of tumour (mm)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">14.8 ± 8.8 (5–54)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">21.7 ± 14.4 (6–99)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &lt; 0.001</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Differentiation</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> Well differentiated</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">27 (60%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">119 (59%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">NS</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> Moderately differentiated</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">17 (38%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">78 (39%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> Poorly differentiated</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1 (2%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3 (2%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Mucinous component</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">15 (33%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">7 (4%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &lt; 0.001</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Depth of invasion (µm)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1496 ± 941 (100–4500)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2188 ± 1878 (100–10000)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.046</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Lymphatic invasion</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">13 (29%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">25 (13%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.011</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Venous invasion</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3 (7%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20 (10%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">NS</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Lymph nodes metastasis</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">8/27 (30%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">8/113 (7%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.003</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Cumulative colon cancer risk is estimated at 2-18%
depending on the duration of colitis. The management of neoplasia in colitis
remains controversial. BSG guidelines recommend colectomy if complete
endoscopic resection isn't guaranteed.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to assess the need for
surgery in the management of neoplasia in colitis. This is a multicentre
cohort study of all neoplasia endoscopically resected in patients with
colitis from 5 tertiary European centres between 2008-2017. The following
endoscopic resection techniques were used: endoscopic mucosal resection
(EMR) and hybrid endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 101 neoplasia were resected in 85 patients at 5 European
centres. Mean age 61 years (range 28-82). Mean size of lesions 34 mm (range
8-120mm). <table-wrap id="table42-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Abstract No: OP206 Table 1</label><caption><p>Endoscopic Resections According to Location, Presence of

<p>40% of the lesions were treated by hybrid ESD. There was no difference in
lesion location between EMR and hybrid ESD. Lesions &gt;20mm in size were
removed more by hybrid ESD than EMR. More of the lesions removed by hybrid
ESD (26) had fibrosis compared to EMR (15). 7 complications occurred in the
cohort; 3 cases of bleeding and 4 perforations. Bleeding was controlled
endoscopically. 3 perforations were managed endoscopically and 1 required
surgery. 7/86 (8.1%) lesions with follow up data had recurrence.</p>
<p>Multi-variate regression analysis concluded;</p>
<p>• EMR leads to higher recurrence rates, irrespective of size, location and
fibrosis (p-value of 0.048)</p>
<p>• Hybrid ESD leads to higher complication rates in the colon compared to the
rectum (p-value of 0.045)</p>
<p>• Hybrid ESD shows a trend towards better en-bloc resection (p-value 0.063)</p>
<p>5 lesions underwent surgery; 3 due to cancer; 1 due to perforation; 1 due to
failure of endoscopic resection. Histology; 88 adenomas (low-grade
dysplasia), 6 adenomas (high-grade dysplasia), 3 cancers and 4 sessile
serrated polyps.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This is the largest reported cohort of endoscopic
resections of neoplasia in colitis. We demonstrate that both hybrid ESD and
EMR are feasible in colitis with only 5% of patients requiring surgery.
Fibrosis is very common in colitis. Recurrence is higher with EMR and
complications higher with hybrid ESD. Our data shows that lesions with
fibrosis are best treated by hybrid ESD, and those without fibrosis
and &lt; 20mm in size can be managed by EMR.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has
proposed the 8th edition of the TNM staging system in pancreatic cancer in
order to improve prognostic accuracy and guide treatment decisions. An
international validation study in a cohort with representative heterogeneity
and sufficient long-term follow-up is currently lacking. The objective of
this study is to validate the proposed 8th edition of the AJCC TNM staging
system in an international cohort of resected pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy for
non-metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma between 2000-2015 at 5
referral centers from 4 countries were retrospectively staged according to
the 8th edition of the TNM staging system, based on tumor size (T1: ≤2cm,
T2: &gt;2 and ≤4cm, T3: &gt;4cm, T4: involves celiac axis/superior
mesenteric artery) and number of positive lymph nodes (N0: no positive lymph
nodes (LN), N1: 1-3 positive LNs, N2: ≥4 positive LNs). Prognostic accuracy
on overall survival was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier estimates and concordance
statistics (Uno's C-statistic) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to compare
both editions of the TNM staging system.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 1528 patients were included for analysis.
Distribution among stages changed from 2.7%, 3.0%, 13.2%, 80.4%, 0.8% in the
7th edition to 7.9%, 9.6%, 1.4%, 42.0%, 39.1% in the 8th edition for stage
IA, IB, IIA, IIB and III, respectively. With the 8th edition, 781 patients
(51.1%) migrated to a different stage, of whom 188 patients (12.3%) to a
lower stage and 593 patients (38.7%) to a higher stage. Median overall
survival for the entire cohort was 24.4 months. Five-year survival rates
changed from 37.6%, 39.3%, 35.1%, 16.5%, 0% (log-rank p &lt; 0.0001) in the
7th edition, to 39.4%, 34.2%, 27.6%, 21.0% and 10.8% (log-rank
p &lt; 0.0001) in the 8th edition for stage IA, IB, IIA, IIB and III,
respectively. T-stage for node-negative patients (stage IA, IB, IIA only
differ in T-stage) was neither predictive for survival in the 7th edition
(log-rank p = 0.96), nor in the 8th edition (log-rank p = 0.24). The 8th
edition N-stage was highly prognostic with 5-year survival rates of 35.6%,
20.1% and 10.9% for N0, N1 and N2 patients, respectively (log-rank
p &lt; 0.0001). When comparing prognostic accuracy, the C-statistic improved
from 0.55 (95% CI, 0.52–0.57) in the 7th to 0.58 (95% CI, 0.55–0.60) in the
8th edition.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this international cohort, the AJCC 8th edition of
the TNM staging system for pancreatic cancer demonstrated a better
distribution among different stages and an increased prognostic accuracy
compared to the AJCC 7th edition. The new T-stage alone is still not
predictive for survival, whereas the new N-stage is highly prognostic.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a poor
prognostic cancer, commonly arises from premalignant pancreatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) stages. After accumulation of mutations,
these lesions further evolve into PDAC. Poor understanding of the
patho-mechanisms and inability of early detection of PDAC necessitates
better understanding of mechanisms leading to PDAC development and
identifying biomarkers for early detection.</p>
<p>While understanding the biological role of PanIN lesions in pancreatic cancer
using a genetic mouse model of pancreatic cancer (KC mice), we discovered
high gastrokine 1 (GKN1) expression in premalignant pancreatic lesions in
mice. We also detected GKN1 in peri-tumoral regions of human PDAC samples.
GKN1 has been well described in gastric mucosa and suggested as a gastric
specific tumor suppressor. However, GKN1 has never been associated with
pancreatic carcinogenesis before. Therefore, we aim to investigate
gastrokine expression and function in the pancreas, to understand the early
events that underlie the development of premalignant lesions leading to
pancreatic tumor formation.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> GKN1 expression in human and mouse pancreas
samples was analyzed by qPCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Mouse pancreatic juice and serum were analyzed by proteomic analysis. To
clarify the role of GKNs in pancreatic carcinogenesis, we intercrossed KC
mice with Gkn1-/- mice. To study contribution of peripheral gastrokine in
tumor development, syngeneic tumor cells (Panc02) were injected
subcutaneously and orthotopicaly into Gkn wt and Gkn1-/- mice. Tumors were
assessed by IHC, qPCR and FACS.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Thorough analysis of human and mouse pancreatic tissues
showed, that GKN1 expression is absent in healthy pancreatic cells and on
malignant tumors. GKN1 expression is restricted to low-grade premalignant
lesions, it is abundant in the cytoplasm of dysplastic epithelium. Proteomic
analysis in KC mice confirmed the secretion of GKNs into pancreatic juice
but not in the serum. Analysis of pancreatic tissue from GKN1-/- KC mice, at
3 months, showed faster development of PanIN with accelerated tumor
development. Investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms focused on
tissue remodeling (epithelial mesenchymal transition, tight junctions),
apoptosis, senescence and inflammatory environment. Gkn1-/- mice injected
with Panc02 cells developed significantly smaller subcutaneous tumors,
possibly due to increased CD8+/CD4+ T cells ratio within tumors.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Collectively, our data establishes a role for
Gastrokine 1 in PanIN and PDAC development. The accelerated PanIN
development in the absence of GKN1 <italic>in vivo</italic> suggest that
gastrokines expression can delay PanIN formation and subsequent PDAC
development. Secretion of gastrokine in pancreatic juice during
carcinogenesis could make them potential early biomarker(s) to detect
PDAC.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Dysfunctionalities of Cosmc result in the expression
of Tn antigen (Tn) and thereby in formation of truncated O-glycosylation
with pathophysiological implications.<sup>1−4</sup> Tn is a hallmark of
cancer and appears early in carcinogenesis.<sup>5,6</sup> Tn expression also
arises in up to 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) and is
associated with poor prognosis.<sup>7</sup> This is of particular relevance,
since PDAC is one of the most aggressive human tumors with a dismal overall
prognosis.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of the present study was to investigate
the impact of Tn expression on PDAC development <italic>in vivo.</italic>
Therefore, we hypothesized that Tn expression promotes oncogenic properties
and in this way pancreatic carcinogenesis. For this purpose, we generated a
transgenic mouse model with a conditional <italic>Cosmc</italic> knockout
and concomitant activation of oncogenic
<italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic>, mediated by the <italic>pancreas
specific transcription factor 1a</italic> (<italic>Ptf1a</italic>)-cre
mouse strain.<sup>9</sup> Tn-modified proteins were identified using the
plant lectin <italic>Vicia villosa agglutinin</italic> (VVA) for
purification and subsequent mass spectrometric proteome analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Additional deletion of <italic>Cosmc in
Ptf1a<sup>+/Cre</sup>;Kras<sup>+/G12D</sup></italic> mouse
strain induces Tn expression in murine pancreas. We observed an activation
of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with consecutive increased Ki-67 proliferation
rate in
<italic>Ptf1a<sup>+/Cre</sup>;Kras<sup>+/G12D</sup>;Cosmc<sup>−</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>−</sup></italic>mouse strain. Moreover, histopathological analyses reveal an
advanced tumor stage in
<italic>Ptf1a<sup>+/Cre</sup>;Kras<sup>+/G12D</sup>;Cosmc<sup>−</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>−</sup></italic>
mice with pronounced tumor stroma formation. Furthermore,
<italic>Ptf1a<sup>+/Cre</sup>;Kras<sup>+/G12D</sup>;Cosmc<sup>−</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>−</sup></italic>
mice display an early epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In summary, in our transgenic mouse model presented
here, causality between Tn expression and accelerated carcinogenesis of PDAC
is shown, which highlights the pathophysiological relevance of truncated
O-glycan formation. Moreover, it is conceivable that the identified
Tn-modified proteins may also be relevant as potential new biomarkers for
early detection of PDAC.</p>

interactions in pancreatic cancer (PDAC) microenvironment has been
dramatically enhanced by the development of mouse models. However, recent
studies demonstrated that the immune response in existing murine models does
not correspond to that of the human disease. In this study, we analyzed the
effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (neoCTx) on the histopathological
features of a novel R0-resectable, genetically induced mouse model (termed
Pfl mice) and compared it to human PDAC.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Using double immunofluorescence stainings with
multiple markers and software-based analysis, we quantified the
angiogenesis, tumor desmoplasia (activated stroma index/ASI), and the
tumor-associated infiltration with cytotoxic T-lymphocytes,
myeloid-derived-suppressor cells/MDSC and natural killer cells (NK) in
tissue specimens of 36 neoadjuvantly treated PCa patients and 6 Pfl mice and
compared the results with matched cohorts of primarily resected
specimens.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In contrast to human PDAC, the stromal activity in the
murine tumor microenvironment remained constant after neoCTx. No significant
change was observed in the microvessel density in both human and mice
(p = 0.179; p = 0.560). NeoCTx led to a reduction of the CD45+ leucocytes
(human: 266.7 ± 22.75 vs 186.6 ± 25.33; p = 0.021; mice:
6.3 × 10<sup>−4</sup> ± 1.0 × 10<sup>−4</sup> vs
1.3 × 10<sup>−4</sup> ± 5.0 × 10<sup>−5</sup>; p = 0.005) as well as
to an increase of the CD8+ T-lymphocytes/CD45+ leucocyte ratio in both
populations (human: 0.22 ± 0.01 vs 0.37 ± 0.01; p &lt; 0.001; mice:
0.01267 ± 0.03972; p = 0.035). Simultaneously, our findings showed a marked
decrease of MDSCs (human:16.95 ± 2.36 vs 5.58 ± 0.88; p &lt; 0.0001; mice:
6.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup> ± 1.0 × 10<sup>−5</sup> vs
2.6 × 10<sup>−5</sup> ± 1.8 × 10<sup>−5</sup>; p = 0.074) and NCAM+ NK
cells (human: 1.33 × 10<sup>−4</sup> ± 2.13 × 10<sup>−4</sup> vs
2.13 × 10<sup>−5</sup> ± 3.03 × 10<sup>−6</sup>; p &lt; 0.0001; mice:
12.2 × 10<sup>−5</sup> ± 3.2 × 10<sup>−5</sup> vs
2.5 × 10<sup>−5</sup> ± 1.7 × 10<sup>−5</sup>; p = 0.069) after neoCTx
in human and murine tissue specimens.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our data suggest that the reactivation of anti-tumoral
immune responses in the tumor microenvironment of the Pfl PDAC mouse model
after neoCTx strongly mimics that of the human disease and therefore proved
its suitability for its use in future preclinical trials for molecular
immunotherapy.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Pancreatic cancer (PCa) has the worst prognosis
among all gastrointestinal cancers. Recent studies identified a remarkably
better prognosis of PCa patients with isolated pulmonary metastasis. The
reason behind this peculiarly better prognosis of this interesting patient
subgroup is yet unknown.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> In the present study, we hypothesized that some
subtypes of PCa might preferentially foster the growth of endothelial cells
in the lung, and less in the liver and thereby lead to isolated pulmonary
metastases. For this purpose, we made use of endothelial cells specifically
isolated from the human liver and lung, and treated these with several types
of human pancreatic cancer cell lines. The proliferation and the tube
formation rate by each PCa cell line was digitally quantified and compared.
Cell lines that preferentially increased the growth of lung versus liver
endothelial cells were subjected to a secretomics analysis comprising more
than 600 secreted soluble factors. Tissue sections from primary tumours,
lung metastasis and liver metastasis derived from human PCa patients and
from the genetically engineered KPC
(<italic>Ptf1-Cre;LSL-Kras<sup>G12D</sup>;p53<sup>lox/+</sup></italic>)
mouse model of PCa were further analyzed for the expression of the
pro-angiogenic factor Angiopoetin-2 (<italic>Angpt2</italic>) and of the
anti-angiogenic receptor <italic>Dscr1</italic>.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In humans and mouse tissue sections, we identified lower
levels of <italic>Dscr1</italic> in cancer cells within lung metastases and
relatively higher levels of <italic>Angpt2</italic>. In vitro, certain types
of PCa cell lines preferentially induced the growth of lung endothelium and
not of the liver endothelium. Comparative secretomic analysis of lung-
versus liver endothelium growth-promoting cell lines revealed selectively
increased secretion of <italic>plasminogen</italic> and
<italic>transferrin</italic> from cancer cells that specifically
promote lung endothelial growth.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Occurrence of isolated pulmonary metastasis in PCa may
be due to the selective promotion of lung endothelial growth by cancer cell
subgroups. In this pulmonary pro-angiogenic capacity of PCa cells,
<italic>plasminogen</italic> and<italic> transferrin</italic> may be
among the key mediators.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Pancreatic cancer is characterised by an
unparalleled degree of neural invasion (NI). NI is associated with reduced
overall survival, increased local recurrence rate, and with neuropathic
pain. One of the major mechanisms leading to NI is the specific affinity of
tumor cells to neurons. This affinity can be mimicked by means of
3-dimensional migration assays that include neurons and cancer cells.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of the study was to identify genetic
alterations that specifically promotes neural invasion in pancreatic cancer
by means of <italic>in vivo</italic> piggyback-transposon mutagenesis. A set
of genetically pre-characterized mouse pancreatic cancer cell lines, which
were generated by means of piggybac-transposon mediated mutagenesis, was
used in three-dimensional migration assays with neurons. The cell lines with
the highest affinity to neurons were analyzed for the sites of transposon
integration in a pre-existing sequencing data base. The identified loci were
were functionally analyzed in the cells by means of Crispr/Cas9 gene
editing.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In the genetically pre-characterized group of 22 mouse
pancreatic cancer cell lines, 3 cell lines were identified to exhibit a high
neuroaffinity. In the analysis of their transposon insertion sites, we found
a specific, de-activating integration in the <italic>Galnt2</italic> and
<italic>St3Gal6</italic> genes. In accordance, Crispr-Cas9-mediated
gene editing resulted in increased migration of pancreatic cancer cells to
Neurons.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The <italic>in vivo</italic> mutagenesis screen allows
identification of neural invasion-promoting genetic alterations in
pancreatic cancer. These results suggest that galactoaminyltransferases may
promote neural invasion in pancreatic cancer.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Barrett's esophagus (BE) is an intestinal metaplasia
characterized by crypt-structured columnar epithelium with distal
gastrointestinal (GI)-tract characteristics. This homeotic transformation
predisposes to adenocarcionoma of the esophagus. <italic>HOX</italic> genes
are known mediators of homeotic transformations. HOX genes encode master
regulators of anterior to posterior specification in organogenesis and
tissue homeostasis. The 3' to 5' sequence of <italic>HOX</italic> genes
corresponds to the sequence in which they act along the anterior to
posterior axes of the body. This property is termed collinearity and links
clustering to function. HOX collinearity has not been thoroughly
investigated in the human gut. Recent evidence from human and mouse studies
has shown BE might originate from the glands at the gastro-esophageal
junction (see refs). If it can be shown that these glands contain elements
associated with positional misspecification, this theory could be
substantially bolstered.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was firstly to
characterize <italic>HOX</italic> gene expression in physiology, metaplasia
and heterotopia of the GI-tract. The second aim was to find
<italic>HOXA13</italic> expression in the gastro-esophageal junction.
The third aim was to find the effect of <italic>HOXA13</italic> expression
in BE. Expression of 39 <italic>HOX</italic> genes was determined by RT-qPCR
and verified by RNA-ISH in tissues along the gut, BE, gastric intestinal
metaplasia, and gastric heterotopia in the esophagus, Meckel's diverticula,
and colon. <italic>HOXA13</italic> RNA-ISH was performed to verify the
findings. Published data was analyzed to for <italic>HOX</italic> gene
expression in epithelium specific stem cells. Squamous esophageal cell lines
were exposed to acid and bile to simulate gastro esophageal reflux disease
(GERD). A <italic>Hoxa13</italic>-GFP mouse model was employed to study the
<italic>Hoxa13</italic> promotor activity in the colon and
gastro-esophageal junction. Mouse embryonic stem cells were differentiated
to definitive endoderm, the progenitor cell of intestinal epithelia, as a
model of the cell of origin of BE. <italic>HOXA13</italic> was transduced
and overexpressed in a primary immortalized squamous esophageal cell line
and knocked down in a primary immortalized BE cell line. HOXA13 function in
the BE cell line was further studied in an <italic>in vivo</italic>
organotypic model.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold>
<italic>HOX</italic> cluster gene expression in the gastrointestinal tract
is collinear in men and mice, this coding is established at the level of the
location specific stem cell. Metaplasias and heterotopias in the upper
GI-tract are characterized by high <italic>HOXA13</italic> expression, while
HOXA13 expression is characteristic for the colon. HOX coding is paralleled
in epithelium specific stem cells of squamous and BE and stomach.
<italic>HOXA13</italic> expression is epithelial and is not
upregulated in squamous epithelium <italic>in vivo</italic> and
<italic>in vitro</italic>. The <italic>Hoxa13</italic> promotor is
regulated binary along the rostral-caudal body axis in the murine and human
large intestine alike. Strikingly, we found a specific mouse to human- and
lifespan-conserved patch of <italic>HOXA13</italic> positive cells at the
gastro-esophageal junction. These cells might represent the cells of origin
of BE. In the model of the cell of origin of BE, forced
<italic>HOXA13</italic> confers a relative competitive advantage
through upregulation of <italic>Nanog</italic> signaling and downregulation
of <italic>Wnt</italic> signaling. <italic>HOXA13</italic> downregulates the
chromosome 1q21.3 epidermal differentiation complex and other cornified
envelope genes and has pro-oncogenic characteristics
<italic>in vitro</italic>. The <italic>in vivo</italic> organotypic
culture model showed <italic>HOXA13</italic> conveys typical characteristics
of the BE phenotype.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold>
<italic>HOXA13</italic> offers an explanation for the etiology, phenotype,
and oncogenic potential of Barrett's esophagus.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a metaplastic precursor
lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and current evidence supports an
origin from stem cells in the gastric cardia. There is an ongoing discussion
about the importance and role of intestinal metaplasia (IM), with the
presence of goblet cells, in the definition of BE, as many patients seem not
to show IM before the diagnosis of EAC. It was recently demonstrated that
the appearance of goblet-like cells is indicative of intestinal metaplasia
and inversely correlates with carcinogenesis. Notch signaling supports stem
cell maintenance and potentially attenuates goblet cell maturation in the
intestine, suggesting a role during esophageal carcinogenesis.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To unravel the functional impact of Notch
signaling on BE and EAC development we crossed the IL-1b mouse model of BE
with conditionally overexpressing (pL2.Lgr5.N2IC) or knockout
(pL2.Lgr5.N2<sup>fl/fl</sup>) mice of Notch2 specifically in
Lgr5<sup>+</sup> stem cells (Lgr5CreTm). The triple transgenic mice
were aged and histopathological, gene expression and FACS analysis were
performed to characterize tumor development. Moreover, we utilized a p65
floxed mouse model (pL2.Lgr5.p65<sup>fl/fl</sup>) to analyse the effect of
NFkB activation in Lgr5 stem cells in our IL-1b mouse model.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In IL-1b mice and in human tissue gene expression
analyses indicated that in particular Notch2 receptor appears to be a
relevant player during metaplastic and neoplastic transformation and
inversely correlated with goblet cell maturation. In pL2.Lgr5.N2IC mice in
contrast to the conditional knockout of Notch2,
(pL2.Lgr5.N2<sup>fl/fl</sup>) Notch signalling activation lead to mitigated
goblet-like cell maturation, increased crypt fission, and accelerated tumour
progression. Lgr5-cell derived BE organoids from all mouse lines and
treatment with g-secretase inhibitor (DAPT) supported the <italic>in
vivo</italic> observations of Notch-dependent differentiation and
organoid growth. Furthermore, global gene expression profiling and
immunohistochemistry hinted to a Notch-associated activation of NFkB
activity specifically in Lgr5+ stem cells which prompted the generation of a
conditional p65 knockout mouse model. Indeed, in
pL2.Lgr5.p65<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, the occurrence of dysplastic tissue
was significantly reduced while the frequency of goblet cells increased
accordingly, indicating a concomitant enhancement of both pathways during
disease progression. Moreover, 3D BE organoid culture supported the
implications of NFkB on cell proliferation and differentiation.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In conclusion, we show an importance of activated
Notch signaling during progression from BE to EAC, whereas elimination of
Notch signaling leads to goblet cell differentiation and reduced
carcinogenesis. Activated Notch signaling induces NFkB pathway activation
leading to increased stem cell expansion. In contrast elimination of NFkB
signaling, results in intestinal differentiation and attenuated
carcinogenesis. These data point to a novel role of Notch signaling in NFkB
dependent stem cell expansion during esophageal carcinogenesis and introduce
Notch activation as a novel biomarker for BE to EAC progression.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a premalignant,
inflammation-dependent condition of the esophagus and a known precursor of
esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The incidence of EAC has increased at a
rate of 4 to 10% annually in parts of the Western World. Though endoscopic
surveillance is utilized to detect and treat dysplasia and early malignancy,
it may not detect early cancers in nearly half of patients. Furthermore
endoscopic therapy shows durable response in only up to 75% of cases and
treatment specific risks have to be factored in. Novel biomarkers would
ideally help in identifying patients with BE at increased risk of disease
progression, prompting extended surveillance programs. A number of
predictive markers have been reported in the literature including DNA
content abnormalities. Genomic instability is a known driver for
carcinogenesis and can occur with impaired telomere function. However, the
functional role of short telomeres has not been evaluated during esophageal
carcinogenesis.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Here we utilize the L2-IL-1β<sup>1</sup>
transgenic mouse model of BE that recapitulates the human histopathologic
progression to EAC while inducing chronic inflammation in the esophagus. To
study the role of telomerase dysfunction and shortening of telomeres we
crossed a telomerase k.o. mouse model (mTerc-/-) into our IL-1β model and
analyzed progression to dysplasia as well as its implication for cellular
differentiation in different backcrossed IL-1β.mTerc generations. Telomere
length was measured quantitatively with <italic>in situ</italic>
Hybridization (FISH) on a per cell basis. Results were compared to a human
cohort of which full-length resected surgical esophagi were
histopathologically scored and epithelial telomere length was measured at
different stages of disease for each individual (27 samples of 9
individuals).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In the mouse model, significant dysfunction of telomeres
was observed in the second generation (IL-1β.mTerc-/- G2). Therefore we
compared IL-1β.mTerc-/- G2 mice (n = 16) with IL-1β mice (n = 16).
IL-1β.mTerc-/- G2 mice exhibited significantly shorter telomeres (p = 0.02)
and a significantly higher grade of dysplasia (p = 0.02) than their
age-matched IL-1β counterparts. Telomere length assessment of human biopsies
of EAC precursor lesions confirm prior findings that BE- and LGD- epithelial
cells possess significantly shorter telomeres than epithelial control cells
of the gastric cardia with reduced ratios in BE-Cardia (p &lt; 0.01) and
LGD-Cardia (p &lt;  &lt; 0.01) samples, suggesting a progressive shortening
with accelerated malignant transformation. Importantly, discrimination of
epithelial cells into columnar cells and goblet cells displayed
significantly shorter telomeres in columnar lined cells than in goblet cells
of human BE tissue (p &lt; 0.01) and LGD tissue (p &lt; 0.01).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Shortening of telomeres accelerated dysplastia in our
mouse model of BE. This proves for the first time the functional importance
of dysfunctional telomeres as a potential driver in early stages of
esophageal carcinogenesis. In addition epithelial telomere shortness was
correlated with disease progression and cellular de-differentiation in
murine and human EAC precursor lesions. Thus telomere length qualifies as a
potential biomarker in EAC precursor lesions and should therefore be further
tested in large human cohorts to prove its validity. Remarkably the result
that goblet cells possess longer telomeres than columnar cells within the
same histologically defined samples complements earlier findings that higher
goblet-to-columnar-cell ratios are more likely to be found in stages of
metaplasia than dysplasia.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Minichromosome maintenance component complex 5
(MCM5) is an integral component of the cell cycle, forming part of the DNA
replicative helicase and facilitating cell replication and proliferation.
Exfoilated cells obtained from patients with urothelial and oesophageal
cancer demonstrate aberrant expression of MCM5. Barrett's oesophagus (BE) is
a premalignant condition, but up to 36% of BE associated neoplasia is missed
on endoscopic surveillance in the year preceding diagnosis. Quantification
of potential biomarkers in aspirated gastric fluid from patients undergoing
upper endoscopy may allow the identification of those with BE or early
neoplasia. Such a validated biomarker also has potential as a screening test
for Barrett's oesophagus or OAC, to stratify symptomatic patients presenting
to clinicians. We assess whether MCM5 expression, quantified using a
proprietary assay, can be used to discriminate between patients undergoing
endoscopy with a macroscopically normal oesophagus (NE), non-dysplastic
Barrett's oesophagus (NDBE), dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus (DBE) and
OAC.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Patients were recruited from a UK referral
centre between Aug 2017 and Apr 2018. All patients with NDBE, DBE or OAC had
endoscopic and matched histologic confirmation of the diagnosis. High-grade
dysplasia was considered DBE. Patients previously treated with
radiofrequency ablation, chemo-radiotherapy, with systemic inflammatory
disease, BE low-grade dysplasia or other malignancy were excluded. The
oesophagus was carefully intubated to avoid mucosal disruption and no fluid
was passed through the working channel before aspiration of 5ml of gastric
fluid via a white tube and suction. Aspirated Gastric fluid was refrigerated
at 4C prior to centrifugation at 4400rpm. Cells were then resuspended in
lysis buffer and stored at -80°C prior to MCM5 quantification using a
proprietary MCM5 assay. Normality was assessed by Shapiro-Wilks testing.
Median MCM5 expression and interquartile range (IQR) was calculated and a
two-tailed t-test was used to assess for differences in expression levels
between the groups.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 61 patients were recruited (15 NE; 14 NDBE; 18 HGD and 14
OAC). We demonstrate a stepwise increase in MCM5 expression for patients
with acid reflux, NDBE, DBE and BE associated OAC. The median expression for
each group was 47pg/ml (IQR 32.8 [26.92–59.77]) for NE, 116.6pg/ml (IQR
411.3 [17.23–428.54]) for NDBE, 229.9pg/ml (IQR 1070.4 [29.59–1099-96]) for
DBE and 279pg/ml (IQR 1462.7[10.09–1500]) for OAC. There was a significant
difference in MCM5 expression between patients with a macroscopically normal
oesophagus and those with DBE or adenocarcinoma (p &lt; 0.001). We also
observed a trend towards higher mean MCM5 expression in patients with NDBE
compared to those with a normal oesophagus (p = 0.06). There was no
significant difference between patients with NDBE and DBE/OAC, although 2
patients in the NDBE group demonstrated very high expression compared to the
rest of the group.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We demonstrate that raised MCM5 expression in
exfoliated cells obtained from aspirating gastric fluid at upper endoscopy
is a feasible approach to differentiating patients with a normal oesophagus
from those with DBE and OAC. Further work should focus on appropriately
powered multi-centre trials to assess for significant differences in MCM5
expression in patients with AR (NE), NDBE compared to DBE/OAC.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a premalignant
condition, where surveillance is carried out to reduce morbidity and
mortality related to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The harm-benefit ratio
of this strategy is questionable, because identification of high-risk
patients is difficult. To improve risk stratification, additional
biomarkers, and their variations between and -in particular- within patients
should be taken into account. P53 and SOX2 are immunohistochemical markers
which have been shown to be valuable in predicting progression to high-grade
dysplasia (HGD) or EAC in BE patients. To date, no more than 2 time points
have been included when studying the risk of neoplastic progression.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to develop a model incorporating
<italic>all</italic> follow-up (FU) measurements of low-grade
dysplasia (LGD), p53, and SOX2 to study their predictive performance. In
this multicenter prospective cohort study, we included consecutive BE
patients from 15 hospitals in the Netherlands with histologically confirmed
BE, a segment of ≥2 cm, and a FU time of at least 0.5 year. The study
endpoint was identification of HGD or EAC. The surveillance guidelines of
the American College of Gastroenterology were followed. Data were collected
during every FU. 2 BE expert pathologists independently reviewed all H&amp;E
slides and immunohistochemistry of p53 and SOX2. We incorporated the dynamic
values of LGD, p53, and SOX2 as registered at each endoscopy in a
multivariate joint model, adjusted for age, sex, length of BE, and
esophagitis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The median FU time was 7.2 years (IQR 5.4–9.9) of 628
patients included (69% male, median age 60 years, 76% length of BE ≥3 cm);
48 developed HGD or EAC. If a patient would have only 2 FU moments, 1 with
normal (0) expression of the biomarker, 1 with aberrant (1), the hazard
ratio (HR) of neoplastic progression was 1.2 for LGD (p = 0.61), 1.5 for p53
(p = 0.004), and 5.0 for SOX2 (p = 0.004), annually. With more FU
endoscopies, these multiple observations will set the probability of
aberrant expression to a value between 0 and 1, with a ditto proportion of
the previously mentioned hazard ratios. Dynamic risk profiles of neoplastic
progression could be estimated for individual patients during their FU,
based on these biomarker patterns.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The risk of neoplastic progression can be estimated
better by p53 and SOX2 than LGD if measurements of all FU endoscopies are
taken into account. In the future, this prediction model will provide an
updated prediction of neoplastic progression based on new observations in
ongoing FU. The combination of dynamic observations of biomarkers such as
p53 and SOX2 merits further study to improve the identification of high-risk
patients in a personalized surveillance program, eventually reducing the
burden of surveillance.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Barrett's Esophagus (BE) is a premalignant condition
defined by replacement of the squamous epithelium in the distal esophagus by
specialized intestinal metaplasia. Previous work implicated that hedgehog
signaling and BMP4 signaling were involved in the differentiation of
squamous epithelium toward intestinal-type columnar epithelium<sup>1</sup>,
which was charactered by increased expression of columnar cell transcription
factors, such as sox9<sup>2</sup> and CDX2<sup>3</sup>. Conceivably,
inhibitors targeting hedgehog signaling and BMP4 signaling might block
progression of BE, however, drugs mostly used to treat BE in the present are
associated with acid suppression and reflux control. Drugs targeting BE
progression is to be discovered.</p>
<p>Clinical studies revealed that the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) but not
histamine receptor antagonists was associated with a decreased risk of
oesophageal adenocarcinoma<sup>4−5</sup>. Huo, X. et al revealed that PPIs
exerted anti-inflammatory effects on reflux oesophagitis independent of
effects on gastric acid secretion<sup>6</sup>. This research indicated that
PPIs could benefit BE patients by Acid-Independent Mechanism.</p>
<p>Noting that BE might be driven by increased columnar cell transcription factors
targeted by hedgehog signaling and BMP4 signaling, and that PPIs can benefit
BE patients through acid-independent mechanisms, we hypothesized that PPIs
might interfere with activation of hedgehog signaling and BMP4 signaling,
expression of columnar cell transcription factors, such as sox9 and CDX2,
and that this acid-independent mechanism might contribute to the efficacy of
PPI therapy in BE progression.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We exposed CPA and CPB cells to omeprazole, and
evaluated its effects on activation of hedgehog signaling and BMP4
signaling, expression of CDX2 and SOX9 by realtime PCR and western blot.
Moreover, miRNA microarray technology was used to identify the differentialy
expressed miRNAs in BE organoids treated with Omeprazole, realtime PCR
validated these results. Dual Luciferase Assay was used to validated
miRNA/mRNA interactions.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Omeprazole inhibited activation of hedgehog signaling and
BMP4 signaling,and reduced expression of CDX2 and SOX9. Moreover, Omeprazole
inhibited hedgehog signaling and BMP4 signaling by up-regulating
hsa-miR-2116-3p and hsa-miR-18a-5p, respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In Barrett's Esophagus cells, omeprazole inhibits CDX2
and SOX9 expression through effects on hedgehog signaling and BMP4
signaling, which is entirely independent of effects on gastric acid
secretion. These previously unrecognized PPI effects might contribute to
blocking progression of BE.</p>

</p>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and vonoprazan are
widely used for healing post-ESD ulcers and they both prevent post-ESD
bleeding<sup>1,2</sup> in Japan. However, PPIs take about 72 hours to
inhibit gastric acid secretion. Therefore, patients must take PPIs a few
days before ESD to increase gastric pH effectively. On the other hand,
vonoprazan (VPZ), a potaissium-competitive acid blocker, is a new class of
acid-suppressing agents, and takes only 3 hours to inhibit gastric acid
secretion<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Data for 129 patients was reviewed, who
underwent gastric ESD from December 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017 at Osaka
City General Hospital and were treated with VPZ. We compared the incidence
of bleeding after gastric ESD between subjects to whom VPZ was first
administered on the day of ESD (the A group, <italic>n</italic> = 70) and
those to whom VPZ was first administered by the day before ESD (the B group,
<italic>n = </italic>39). The patients exclusion criteria for the
study included the following: (1) patients who underwent multiple sites ESD
on the same day (<italic>n</italic> = 14), (2) patients to whom second-look
GI endoscopy was not performed (<italic>n</italic> = 5), (3) patients whose
ESD was cancelled (<italic>n</italic> = 1). A case which has active bleeding
or exposed vessels on post-ESD gastric ulcers with hematemesis, melena or a
decline in hemoglobin levels from not less than 2 g/dl within 4 weeks after
ESD was defined as “post-ESD bleeding”. In addition, we perform second-look
endoscopy on the day after ESD. A case in which hemostasis was needed with
hemorrhage of Forrest Ia and Ib when we underwent the second-look GI
endoscopy was defined as “next-day hemostasis case”. We investigated
retrospectively post-ESD bleeding rate and next-day hemostasis rate in the A
group and the B group.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Gender, use of anti-thrombotic agents, dialysis, mean
age, and ulcer size were not significantly different in both groups. 4 of
the 70 patients in the A group (5.7%) and 3 of the 39 patients in the B
group (7.7%) had Post-ESD bleeding. In addition, 17 patients in the A group
(24.3%) and 8 patients in the B group (20.5%) had next-day hemostasis. There
was no significant difference in both groups regarding post-ESD bleeding
(<italic>p</italic> = 0.813) and next-day hemostasis
(<italic>p</italic> = 0.699) (Table). That is possibly because VPZ
rapidly inhibits gastric acid secretion within 3 hours after administration,
prevents acid exposure, and reduces the percentage of bleeding on post-ESD
gastric ulcers. In our hospital, 38 patients underwent gastric ESD and
esomeprazole (EPZ) was first administered by 2 days before ESD, from
December 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017. 4 of those 38 patients (10.5%) had
post-ESD bleeding, and 8 of them (21.1%) had next-day hemostasis. We did not
investigate VPZ vs. EPZ in this study. However, the effect on bleeding after
gastric ESD was similar with the case with first administration of VPZ a few
hours after ESD. Therefore, patients do not need to start taking PPIs a few
days in advance of ESD but should start taking VPZ by a few hours after ESD.

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Antithrombotic therapy has been known to increase
post-endoscopic resection (ER) bleeding risk; however, there are few studies
quantifying the effect of antithrombotic agents.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This study aimed to analyze the incidence of
delayed bleeding (DB) based on antithrombotic agents administered and to
identify the proper timing of drug cessation. Between January 2011 and March
2017, 7752 patients with 8242 lesions underwent ER for single gastric
neoplasm. After a 2:1 propensity score matching using age, sex, specimen
size, tumor location, diagnosis, chronic kidney disease and liver cirrhosis,
798 and 399 lesions were classified as belonging to the matched control (MC)
group and antithrombotics (AT) group, respectively. The clinical outcomes
were compared between the 2 groups.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The DB rate of the MC and AT groups was 6.3% and 10.0%,
respectively. There was no significant difference in the early DB rate
between the 2 groups; however, the late DB rate of the AT group was higher
than the MC group. The continuation group of the AT group had a higher
incidence of DB than their matched controls (15.9% vs. 5.1%, OR 3.55 [95% CI
1.24–10.14]; p = 0.018). In patients taking anticoagulants, heparin bridging
therapy (HBT) increased the incidence of DB compared with non-HBT (35.7% vs.
10.0%, OR 5.00 [95% CI 1.11–22.50]; p = 0.036). A thromboembolic event was
not observed in all patients taking antithrombotic agents.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Patients receiving antithrombotic therapy had a higher
incidence of DB than those not receiving antithrombotic therapy, especially
with the continued administration of antithrombotic agents and HBT.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is sometimes
accompanied by serious adverse events such as postoperative bleeding and
perforation. Tentative guidelines concerning the continuation and cessation
of anticoagulants have been published by several societies including the
Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society and the European Society of
Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. According to the Japanese guidelines, heparin
bridge therapy is commonly performed during the cessation of warfarin in
patients with a high risk of thromboembolism; however, heparin bridge
therapy may increase the risk of postoperative bleeding. Although direct
oral anticoagulant drugs (DOACs) are increasingly used in clinical practice,
the association between DOACs and the risk of post-ESD bleeding is not fully
understood. Recently, the continuous administration of anticoagulants (no
bridge to heparin) has been recommended in Japan.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect
of continuous anticoagulants including DOACs on postoperative adverse events
after ESD for gastric tumors. A total of 76 patients who had taken
anticoagulants underwent gastric ESD between April 2005 and March 2018. ESD
was performed in 49 patients under the cessation of anticoagulants or
bridging anticoagulants to heparin before March 2013 and in 27 patients
under the continuous administration of anticoagulants after April 2013. The
clinical outcomes of ESD were retrospectively compared between the
non-continuous and continuous groups.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The study population included 60 men and 16 women (median
age, 77.5 years). Warfarin was taken by all 49 patients in the
non-continuous group and 16 patients in the continuous group. The remaining
11 patients received DOACs (dabigatran, n = 3; apixaban, n = 4; and
rivaroxaban, n = 4). The clinical characteristics (including age, gender,
tumor location, macroscopic appearance, tumor size, presence of ulcer scar
and tumor depth) did not differ between the two groups to a statistically
significant extent. <italic>En-bloc</italic> resection was achieved in all
patients with a complete resection rate of 96% in the non-continuous group
(47 of 49 patients) and 100% in the continuous group (27 of 27 patients).
The median procedure time was 78 minutes in the non-continuous group and 70
minutes in the continuous group (p = 0.99). Postoperative bleeding occurred
in 4 patients in the non-continuous group (8.2%) and 2 patients in the
continuous group (7.4%); the difference was not statistically significant
(p = 1.00). None of the patients developed perforation during the study
period. One patient in non-continuous group suffered from cerebrovascular
disease.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The continuous administration of anticoagulants did
not significantly increase the incidence of adverse events in our cases.
Considering the risk of cerebrovascular disease, the continuous
administration of anticoagulants might be feasible and safe in gastric
ESD.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) still has not
been widely adopted around the world because endoscopists sometimes face
difficulty in achieving hemostasis during ESD. Our group developed dual red
imaging (DRI), a novel endoscopic imaging technology. We push the operation
button of the endoscope once and we can change White Light Imaging (WLI) to
DRI easily. DRI may facilitate hemostasis management due to being able to
clearly identify the bleeding point as a yellow color. However, there is no
evidence for easiness of hemostasis management using DRI. In this study, we
examined the safety and efficacy of DRI for hemostasis management during
ESD.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We performed 3 prospective studies. Study 1. DRI
and WLI were used alternately for the management of 380 bleeding events in
patients undergoing ESD. Study 2. 46 patients underwent ESD using DRI for
hemostasis management during ESD. The endoscopist commenced the ESD using
WLI, switched to DRI immediately when bleeding was detected, then switched
back to WLI upon obtaining hemostasis. Study 3. 45 patients underwent ESD
using DRI throughout the entire intervention. The psychological stress
experienced by the endoscopist and time required to achieve hemostasis
(hemostasis time) were examined in Study 1. We also examined the treatment
result and ESD operation time in Study 2 and 3. We evaluated psychological
stress with 5 phases of score depending on degree of the stress. We also
compared the treatment results and operation time between DRI and WLI.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Study1. The average hemostasis time was significantly
shorter in the DRI group than in the WLI group (60.7 vs 50.8 seconds,
p = 0.012), and the average score for psychological stress in the DRI group
was significantly lower (2.30 vs 1.68, p &lt; 0.0001). Study 2. The success
rates of intervention, en bloc resection, and en bloc R0 resection were
46/46 (100%), 46/46 (100%) and 43/46 (93.4%), respectively, and the rates of
perforation and delayed bleeding were 1/46 (2.1%) and 3/46 (6.5%),
respectively. Study 3. The rates of intervention success, en bloc resection,
and en bloc R0 resection, perforation, and delayed bleeding were 42/45
(93.3%), 42/42 (100%), 38/42 (90.4%), 5/45 (11.1%), and 2/45 (4.4%),
respectively. All of the perforation cases were lesions with severe
fibrosis. The operation time in the DRI groups was shorter than the control
groups, however, there was no significant difference between the DRI and
control groups when DRI was used throughout the entire ESD procedure or used
only for hemostasis management.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> DRI is a novel endoscopic imaging technology that
facilitates hemostasis during ESD. DRI can only be safely used for
hemostasis management during the ESD procedure, because dissection by DRI
poses a high risk of perforation in lesions with fibrosis.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> ESD has been performed on many patients with early
esophageal cancer. However, postoperative stricture after ≥2/3
circumferential ESD is the most important issues for quality of life in
patients which is drastically decreased and repeat, periodic endoscopic
balloon dilation (EBD) is usually required. We explored an innovative
strategy with oral mixture of hydrocortisone sodium succinate and aluminum
phosphate gel for prevention of the stricture and evaluate the efficacy of
this mixture in single center of Beijing, China.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> 27 patients who underwent more than 2/3 circular
circular ESD from September 2014 to November 2017 were included. They were
randomized into control and study groups. 13 patients received endoscopic
intralesional steroid injection accompanied with systemic steroid
treatment(IT+ST group; control group), 14 patients received oral mixture of
hydrocortisone sodium succinate and aluminum phosphate gel (OHA group; study
group). IT+ST group started with 80mg introlesional steroid at the end of
ESD procedure, and 30mg/day prednisolone on the second day post-ESD, then
continued with a gradually tapering prednisolone dose, finally discontinuing
systemic steroid administration 8 weeks later. OHA group started with
mixture of hydrocortisone sodium succinate 50mg and aluminum phosphate gel
20g, qid for 2weeks and continued with a gradually tapering OHA dose on the
second day post-ESD. EBD was performed when patients experienced persistent
dysphagia. If the patient had no complaint of dysphagia,
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed 8 weeks after ESD to evaluate
any possible stricture. The primary end point in this part was the stricture
rate after ESD. The secondary end point was the number of EBD sessions
required to resolve the stricture. A stricture was defined as a difficulty
in swallowing solids or an inability to pass an EGD (9.2mm diameter
endoscope).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> No significant differences were seen among the 2 groups
in terms of demographic parameters including age, sex, tumor location,
resection size. The stricture rates of IT+ST, OHA group after ESD were 53.8%
(7 of 13 patients), 7.1% (1 of 14 patients), respectively (95% confidence
interval, p = 0.013). OHA group needed less EBD sessions than IT+ST group
(median 0, interquartile ranged from 0 to 0 vs. median 0.5, interquartile
ranged from 0 to 1; p = 0.018).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Oral mixture of hydrocortisone sodium succinate and
aluminum phosphate gel showed promising results for the prevention of
stricture after ESD for early esophageal cancer.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Mesna is a mucolytic agent, which chemically
dissolves disulfide bonds in connective tissues. We previously reported that
the use of mesna as an injectate to create a submucosal fluid bleb shortened
the procedure time of gastric and esophageal ESD reducing the need for
electrosurgical dissection. However, the chemical effect of mesna is
inactivated within a short period of time and the substance with a low
osmotic pressure quickly dissipates into surrounding tissues. A novel
infusion pump system was recently developed to enable mesna to be
continuously applied onto tissues while dissecting the submucosal tissue
plane.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To explore the procedural feasibility of ESD
with the chemical blunt dissection technique (COLD ESD) using the newly
developed mesna infusion pump (CADISS Remote System, Auxin surgery) in
<italic>in vivo</italic> porcine models evaluating the effect of mesna
as a chemical tissue dissector comparing with saline. In this study, 5
porcine models were used under general anesthesia. We created 2 tentative
lesions sized about 20mm in the body and the antrum of the stomach
respectively. A total of 4 lesions were created for each pig. Then, each
lesion was randomly assigned into the mesna group or the saline group as a
control. After the circumcision around the lesion was made, mesna or saline
was injected into the submucosal layer underneath the isolated lesion with
the CADISS Remote System. The information of the injectate used was blinded
to the operator. First, the blunt cleavage of the submucosa was attempted
while continuously applying one of the injectates using a Hook Knife J
(Olympus medical systems), connected to the pump. However, the use of
electrosurgical dissection was allowed when the operator felt excessive
tissue resistance ad lib. We counted the number of electrosurgical incisions
used with the VIO Doku software in real-time (ERBE). All endoscopic
procedures were performed by 2 endoscopists. The levels of procedural
difficulty were evaluated with a 5-point analogue scale. The burned area
ratio (burned area/specimen area) of the excised specimen was evaluated with
a picture of the specimen using Image J software (NIH).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> En bloc resection rate was 100% in both groups. The total
procedure time (mesna group 18.1 ± 7.9 min vs. saline group 20.9 ± 12.5 min,
p = 0.54), the submucosal dissection time (mesna group 11.1 ± 8.0 vs saline
group 12.5 ± 9.4 minutes, p = 0.57), the total amount of injectate used
(mesna group 19.0 ± 7.5 ml vs saline group 23.7 ± 10.3 ml, p = 0.30), the
number of electrosurgical incisions (mesna group 26.6 ± 17.2 vs saline group
33.0 ± 42.4 times, p = 0.62), the subjective sore of the procedural
difficulty (mesna group 3.8 ± 1.0 vs saline group 3.1 ± 1.0, p = 0.17)
showed no significant difference between the 2 groups. However, the burned
area ratio was significantly smaller in the mesna group (mesna group
9.0 ± 8.9% vs saline group 17.7 ± 8.7%, p = 0.02).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this randomized controlled animal study, the
procedural feasibility of the mesna assisted cold-ESD using the novel
pumping system was confirmed. The results of this study indicated that the
continuous topical application of mesna would minimize the thermal damage on
the tissues, which may provide optimal tissue sampling for accurate
histological evaluation of specimens and reduce bystander tissue burns
associated with electrosurgical incisions.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy (LPD) is gaining
popularity because of potential advantages including less operative blood
loss, less delayed gastric emptying, and shorter hospital stay but concerns
exist regarding increased pancreatic fistula rates and, in low-volume
centers, increased postoperative mortality. Multicenter randomized trials
investigating this subject are lacking. In the Netherlands, LPD was
introduced according to the IDEAL framework for surgical innovation
including a training program (LAELAPS-2) with a 3.5% 90-day mortality and
34% pancreatic fistula rate in the first 114 LPDs in 4 centers. According to
the IDEAL framework, we hereafter initiated an RCT to assess whether LPD
could reduce time to functional recovery.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> A multicenter randomized controlled,
patient-blinded, trial comparing LPD with OPD was performed in 4 centers
that each perform ≥20 pancreatoduodenectomies annually (median 37 (range
23-77)), completed the LPD training program, and had performed at least 20
LPDs during the 18 months training period (range 23-34). Adult patients with
an indication for pancreatoduodenectomy because of a neoplasm without signs
of vascular involvement were included. Primary outcome was time (days) to
functional recovery.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The data safety monitoring board (DSMB) recommended early
termination of the trial because of a difference in 90-day
complication-related mortality (LPD 5 (10%) vs. OPD 1 (2%), p = 0.2). The
DSMB stated that the possible harm for patients did not outweigh the
hypothesized patient benefit of faster recovery. In total, 99 of the
projected 136 patients were included (50 LPD and 49 OPD). Time to functional
recovery was 9 days (95% CI 6-12) after LPD vs. 8 days (95% CI 6-10) after
OPD (p = 0.9). The conversion rate with LPD was 20% (N = 10). Operative
blood loss was 300 mL (IQR 200-519) vs. 400 mL (300-975) (p = 0.13) and
operative time 383 (IQR 231–454) vs. 215 (IQR 180–299) minutes
(p &lt; 0.001) for LPD and OPD respectively. Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3
complications were seen in 25 (50%) vs. 19 patients (39%) (p = 0.3),
pancreatic fistula grade B/C in 14 (28%) vs. 12 (24%) (p = 0.8),
hepaticojejunostomy leakage grade B/C in 6 (12%) vs. 5 (10%) (p = 0.8) and
postpancreatectomy haemorrhage grade B/C in 5 (10%) vs. 7 (14%) (p = 0.5)
for LPD and OPD respectively. Hospital stay was 11 days (IQR 7-20) after LPD
and 10 (IQR 7-20) after OPD (p = 0.8). The median annual volume of LPD per
center during the trial was 11 (range 6-15).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This early terminated first multicenter RCT showed
comparable time to functional recovery and morbidity after LPD versus OPD.
The mortality rate after LPD raises concerns, especially in the absence of
patient benefits, even in trained centers. Potentially, the learning curve
for LPD is longer than previously perceived and possibly a greater annual
volume is required.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> In 2010, the PANTER trial demonstrated that a
step-up approach for infected necrotizing pancreatitis led to a reduction in
the combined primary endpoint of major complications and death, as compared
to open necrosectomy. A third of patients was successfully treated with
catheter drainage only. The step-up approach could be associated with more
reinterventions in the long term. We therefore performed a long-term
follow-up study.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We prospectively evaluated the 73 surviving out
of 88 randomized patients at a mean follow-up of 86 months ( ± 11 months).
We collected data on clinical and health care resource utilization endpoints
throughout follow-up. Primary endpoint was a composite of major
complications and death, in accordance with the PANTER trial. During a final
follow-up visit, we measured pancreatic exocrine function, quality of life
(SF-36, EQ-5D) and Izbicki pain-scores.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> From index admission to final follow-up, the primary
endpoint occurred in 19 (44%) patients in the step-up group and in 33 (73%)
patients in the open necrosectomy group (p = 0.005). Patients in the step-up
group had fewer incisional hernias (23% vs. 53%; p = 0.004), less pancreatic
exocrine insufficiency (29% vs. 56%; p = 0.03) and less endocrine
insufficiency (40% vs. 64%; p = 0.05). There were no differences in
additional drainage procedures (11% vs. 13%; p = 0.99), pancreatic surgery
(11% vs. 5%; p = 0.43), recurrent acute pancreatitis [b1] and Izbicki
pain-scores. Quality of life increased during follow-up without a
significant difference between groups. Combined medical costs were similar
in both groups.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A step-up approach for necrotizing pancreatitis
remains superior to open necrosectomy during long-term follow-up, without an
increased risk for reinterventions.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Wire-guided biliary cannulation is reported to be an
appropriate first-line cannulation technique, since it is associated with a
high success rate and low risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP). However, the
conventional guidewire (CGW; 0.025 inch) is sometimes too rigid to pass
through the long curved narrow distal segment, resulting in increased
biliary cannulation time and even an unsuccessful biliary cannulation. At
UEGW 2017, we reported that a micro guidewire (GTW; GT wire; 0.016 inch, 300
cm, TERUMO, Japan) designed for super-selective angiography was helpful in
such cases. Rapid biliary cannulation is desirable because a prolonged
procedure may induce PEP. The use of GTW-assisted cannulation as the
first-line cannulation technique for ERCP could reduce biliary cannulation
time.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to evaluate whether biliary cannulation
was achieved in lesser time using GTW than when using CGW in ERCP. In total,
118 consecutive ERCP-naïve patients were randomly assigned to undergo
biliary cannulation with GTW (GTW group) or CGW (CGW group). We measured the
cannulation time (from the time the cannula advanced out of the endoscope
channel to the time successful deep cannulation was confirmed) and the serum
amylase level on the following day. The endoscopist performed ERCP with the
designated guidewire for less than 10 min and was permitted to switch to the
other guidewire to achieve cannulation after 10 min from initiation of the
procedure. The primary outcome was the success rate of biliary cannulation
within the first 10 min, which was then compared between both groups. The
secondary outcome was the overall success rate of biliary cannulation as
well as the incidence of PEP and asymptomatic hyperamylasemia in both
groups. Additionally, among patients in whom biliary cannulation was
successful, we compared the frequency of switching to the other guidewire
and the biliary cannulation success rate between both groups.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The biliary cannulation success rate within the first 10
min was significantly higher in the GTW group than in the CGW group (39/59
patients, 66% and 29/59 patients, 49%, respectively; p = 0.047 by Fisher’s
exact test). The overall biliary cannulation success rate (57/59 patients,
97% and 57/59 patients, 97%) and incidence of PEP (1/59 patients, 1.7% and
1/59 patients, 1.7%) was equal in both groups. The overall asymptomatic
hyperamylasemia was 13.6% (8/59 patients) in the GTW group and 15.3% (9/59
patients) in the CGW group. Among the 114 patients in whom biliary
cannulation was successfully achieved, 32% (18/57 patients) in the CGW group
were switched to GTW. No patients in the GTW group were switched to CGW
after 10 min from initiation of the procedure. The biliary cannulation
success rate in the GTW group was significantly higher than that in the CGW
group (p = 0.036, by the Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The use of GTW-assisted cannulation as the first-line
cannulation technique for ERCP significantly improved the biliary
cannulation success rate and reduced biliary cannulation time.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Currently available methods for small bowel
endoscopy are complex to use and time consuming. Novel Motorized Spiral
Endoscopy (NMSE) represents a new technology which offers all advantages of
spiral enteroscopy with a faster and less invasive approach.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To prospectively study the efficacy and safety
of peroral NMSE. Primary objective: diagnostic yield of NMSE in patients
with suspected small bowel diseases. Secondary objectives: procedural
success, – time, depth of maximal insertion, therapeutic yield, adverse
events.</p>
<p>Patients with occult gastrointestinal bleeding, indeterminate iron-deficiency
anemia or positive findings of small bowel imaging examinations were
included in a 2-center prospective clinical trial. A novel reusable
endoscope with an integrated electric motor was used for rotating a
disposable short spiral overtube mounted on the insertion tube portion.
Rotation of the spiral allows to “pleat” or “unpleat” the bowel either on or
off the insertion tube as the spiral thread rotates in a clockwise or
counter-clockwise direction.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 140 procedures were performed in 132 patients (63 f, 79
m; mean age [range]: 62 [20-100] years) with suspected small bowel disease
and positive findings of video capsule endoscopy or other small bowel
imaging modality. Technical success of NMSE (advancement of the endoscope
beyond the ligament of Treitz) was 98%. Mean insertion time to the jejunum
was 4.7 [1-25] min and to the deepest point of insertion distal from
ligament of Treitz 28.4 [3-122] min. The mean maximum insertion depth from
ligament of Treitz was 425 [0-600] cm. Anterograde panenteroscopy to cecum
was achieved in 14 patients (10%). The diagnostic yield of NMSE was 76%
(arteriovenous malformations AVM n = 80, benign polyps n = 22, other
findings n = 51). 167 interventions were performed in 116 procedures
(biopsies n = 39, argon plasma coagulation APC n = 69, ink injection n = 33,
clipping n = 17, EMR n = 9). Mean withdrawel time without interventions was
14.6 [4-45] min. 1 delayed perforation of the terminal ileum following APC
of AVM resolved without consequences after laparoscopic suturing
(anticipated serious adverse event, 0.7%). Mild adverse events (mainly
asymptomatic superficial mucosal lesions) occurred in 12% of the
procedures.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Final results of a first prospective clinical trial
demonstrate that NMSE is safe and effective for diagnostic and therapeutic
anterograde enteroscopy. The novel technique seems to offer advantages over
traditional methods in terms of procedural duration and ease of use.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Colon polyp detection and optical biopsy are key
performance indicators in colonoscopy. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the
potential to greatly improve both. However, practical real-time applications
with standard scopes are elusive.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We have published on real-time optical biopsy of
diminutive colon polyps using AI, surpassing the 90% negative predictive
value (NPV) for adenomas, as per PIVI guidelines. We sought to use latest AI
techniques to further improve our optical biopsy performance. In relation to
polyp detection, most AI detection tools are trained using still images or
videos with obvious polyps. In contrast, we planned our tool around
difficult sequences from clinical screening videos that start when the polyp
first becomes visible. Finally, an AI model capable of detecting NBI light
was the cornerstone that allowed us to propose a “full clinical workflow”
for colon polyp detection immediately followed by optical biopsy. Our
workflow was optimized to allow for real-time clinical use, a first in this
field.</p>
<p>The full workflow captures the video feed from a tower and consists of 3
distinct AI models: a NBI light detector, a polyp detector, and an optical
biopsy. The NBI light detector runs continuously and triggers either the
detection mode (white light) or the optical biopsy mode (NBI). This allows a
seamless interface without the need for a switching signal from either the
tower or operator.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The NBI light model was tested on 21,804 unseen frames
and achieved a near-perfect accuracy of 99.94%.</p>
<p>The polyp detection model was tested on the polyp approach sequence part of 30
previously unseen colonoscopy videos (&gt;20min each). The model detected
polyps with a sensitivity of 79.0% while triggering on 13.7% of frames
without polyps. Notably, polyps are detected, on average, 403 milliseconds
after their first appearance.</p>
<p>The optical biopsy was tested on videos of 125 previously unseen polyps and
achieved a sensitivity of 95.95%, specificity of 91.66%, and NPV of 93.6%.
Even if the model can abstain when unsure, it committed to a prediction for
97.6% of polyps, an absolute increase of 12.8% over our previous
work<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, results are displayed in real-time and the user interface is updated
30 times per second.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We propose the first real-time AI full colonoscopy
workflow for automatic detection followed by optical biopsy of colorectal
polyps. It consists of three separate AI models allowing for real-time
detection of colon polyps, automatic recognition of the switch from white
light to NBI, followed by immediate optical biopsy of detected polyps.
Detection shows very promising results, especially on difficult approach
sequences, and our AI optical biopsy has been even further improved. A
clinical trial is planned for the near future.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Implementation of the optical diagnosis of
diminutive polyps increases the efficacy and reduces the economic burden of
a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening program. To adopt such strategy in
clinical practice, the ASGE PIVI thresholds should be met: ≥90% negative
predictive value (NPV) for diagnosis of adenomatous histology and ≥90%
agreement between optical diagnosis and histological diagnosis in
determining the post-polypectomy surveillance intervals. We evaluated these
performance parameters in the Dutch CRC screening program.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We collected endoscopic and histopathologic data
from participants to the FIT Dutch CRC screening program from February 2014
to August 2015 at 4 endoscopy units (1 academic centre and 3 non-academic
centers). All endoscopists were familiarized with optical diagnosis of
colorectal polyps. High-definition white light colonoscopy was used, and if
necessary (virtual) chromoendoscopy was used. The classification options
were: adenomatous polyp, hyperplastic polyp, sessile serrated polyp,
carcinoma and other. The ‘diagnose and leave in place' scenario was applied
to hyperplastic polyps ≤5mm in the rectosigmoid while the ‘resect and
discard' scenario was applied to polyps ≤5mm in the entire colon. We
measured the agreement between optical diagnosis and histological diagnosis
in determining the post-polypectomy surveillance intervals according to the
post-polypectomy colonoscopy surveillance guideline from the
ESGE<sup>1</sup>. For this, the percentage of congruent pairs was
calculated.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 3.028 diminutive polyps were included and 14
certified endoscopists participated in this study. Optical diagnosis of
diminutive adenomatous polyps predicted histology with 76% (95% CI 74-77)
accuracy and 69% (95% CI 66-73) NPV. Optical diagnosis of diminutive
hyperplastic polyps in the rectosigmoid (n = 1.222) predicted histology with
71% (95% CI 69-74) accuracy, 61% (95% CI 56-66) PPV and 72% (95% CI 68-76)
NPV. In 2.470 patients both optical diagnosis and histopathological data for
index colonoscopy were available. Applying the ‘diagnose and leave in place'
strategy resulted in 96% agreement on surveillance intervals, while applying
the ‘resect and discard' strategy resulted in 91% agreement on surveillance
intervals (Table 1).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In the Dutch CRC screening program the optical
diagnosis of diminutive polyps remains difficult. According to the ASGE PIVI
thresholds, the NPV for optical diagnosis in this setting was too low but
the thresholds for determining surveillance intervals, based on optical
diagnosis, are met. Systematic training in optical diagnosis can optimize
the efficacy of our nationwide CRC screening program. <table-wrap id="table44-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table44-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table44"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="3" rowspan="1">Based on histopathology <hr/></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">3 year</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">10 year</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">No surveillance</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Total</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Based on</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3 year</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's
colitis are known to have an increased risk of colorectal cancer compared
with that of the background population. The recent SCENIC consensus
statement endorses high definition chromoendoscopy (HDCE) with targeted
biopsies for dysplasia detection but required more evidence regarding
optimal dye concentrations and mode of delivery. No trials have previously
studied this. Our aim was to compare 0.2% indigo carmine (IC) using a spray
catheter with that of 0.03% IC via a foot pump, for dysplasia detection in
patients undergoing surveillance in IBD colitis.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> A parallel group randomized controlled trial
(ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03250780) in which patients undergoing
surveillance endoscopy for IBD colitis were randomized into either HDCE
using 0.2% IC using a spray catheter or HDCE using 0.03% IC via a foot pump.
HD scopes (Olympus CF-HQ290L) and processors (Elite CV 290) were used. 2
expert GI histopathologists confirmed presence of dysplasia. Time of
withdrawal and ampoules of IC were also recorded.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 75 patients in each arm (total n = 150).
Baseline characteristics including colitis phenotype, disease duration, BSG
risk category, number of biopsies, concomitant PSC and previous dysplasia
were similar in both arms. Dysplasia within the colitic area was found in 12
patients (16.0%) in the 0.2% IC group and 13 patients (17.3%) within the
0.03% IC group, p = 0.666 (table 1). Withdrawal was significantly
(p &lt; 0.001) quicker in the 0.03% IC group (16.36 ± 5.92, 95% CI
14.9–17.7) than in the 0.2% IC group (21.23 ± 6.69, 95% CI 19.7–22.8). The
0.03% IC group used significantly less IC ampoules (2, IQR 2-3) compared
with 0.2% IC group (5, IQR 4-5.25), p &lt; 0.001). Dysplasia on random
biopsies only, was found in 3.3% (n = 5) of the cohort. Univariate analysis
for dysplasia on random biopsies showed association with BSG high-risk
category group (p &lt; 0.001), concomitant PSC (p = 0.033) and having
previous dysplasia (p &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> There is no significant difference in dysplasia
detection between 0.2% and 0.03% IC concentration. 0.03% IC seems to be on
average 5 minutes quicker and uses less ampoules of IC. There maybe still a
place for random biopsies in patients defined by the BSG as high-risk.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Adenoma recurrence after wide field endoscopic
mucosal resection (EMR) of laterally spreading colonic lesions ≥ 20mm (LSLs)
is a major limitation. Data on the optimal methods and outcomes of
endoscopic treatment of recurrence (ETOR) is absent and no evidence based
standard exists. We examined the techniques and success of ETOR over time in
a large prospective cohort.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Over 100 months to January 2017 data on all
recurrences after consective EMR procedures for LSLs at the lead centre of
the Australian Colonic Endoscopic Resection Study (ACE) was recorded.
Recurrence at the EMR scar was 1 discerned using high definition endoscopic
imaging as previously described. ETOR comprised coagulation snare 2
resection (ERBE Effect 2, 30W), cold avulsion forceps with adjuvant snare
tip soft coagulation [CAST] (ERBE Effect 4, 80W) or a combination of the
two. The primary outcomes were complete adenoma clearance using ETOR at
first surveillance (desired interval 4-6 months) and absence of recurrence
at subsequent surveillance procedures.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 1558 patients with 1558 LSLs were included. 150 LSLs
(9.6%) had recurrence at first surveillance colonoscopy. The mean age of
patients with recurrence was 68 years and 55% were male. Recurrent LSLs were
median 50mm in size (IQR 35-60mm) and located distal to the hepatic flexure
in 52.7%. They were commonly of Paris 0-IIa+Is morphology (46.7%) and
displayed tubulovillous adenoma at histopathology (75.3%), with high grade
dysplasia in 23.3%. 4 (2.7%) were resected en-bloc.</p>
<p>Recurrence at the EMR scar was ≤ 5mm in size (64%), uni-focal (75%) and within
the scar (55%) or at the edge (45%). The commonest modality used to resect
recurrence was hot snare with adjuvant snare tip soft coagulation (35%).
CAST was used in 30% and was also used in combination with hot snare (9%).
CAST was more commonly used in the second temporal half (62.5%) than the
first half (10.6%, p &lt; 0.001) of the cohort. Prior injection was
performed in a minority (16%). In 124/143 (86.7%) cases where tissue was
retrieved, there was histologic confirmation of recurrence.</p>
<p>ETOR achieved clearance of recurrent adenoma in 94.7% of cases at first
surveillance colonoscopy with 8 (5.3%) referred for surgery primarily due to
an inability to resect recurrence. For LSLs that underwent further
surveillance, 89% (1 further surveillance), 86.5% (2 further surveillances)

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is associated
with intraprocedural bleeding which is usually treated with heat applied to
the visible bleeding vessel. Prolonged and repeated applications of heat can
increase the risk of perforation. Purastat<sup>®</sup> is a transparent gel
with a novel extracellular scaffold matrix which forms a mechanical barrier
over the bleeding point. It may be an alternative non diathermic option for
intraprocedural bleeding.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy
of Purastat<sup>®</sup> in reducing the use of intraprocedural heat therapy
during ESD.</p>
<p>This was a randomised controlled trial conducted in a tertiary referral centre
between May 2016 to April 2018. Patients undergoing ESD in the oesophagus or
colorectum were randomised in equal proportions to receive
Purastat<sup>®</sup> as the primary haemostat during intraprocedural
bleeding (intervention) or heat therapy (control). Patients in the
Purastat<sup>®</sup> arm were not excluded from heat therapy treatment
when required to achieve haemostasis. The primary endpoint was the reduction
in the amount of heat therapy required for intraprocedural haemostasis
between Purastat<sup>®</sup> and control groups.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 100 patients were recruited to the study. There were 2
withdrawals (ESD aborted) and 7 had no bleeds. An intention to treat
analysis was performed on 91 patients (see table). <table-wrap id="table46-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table46-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table46"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Purastat group (n = 46)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Control group (n = 45)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Significance</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Total number of bleeds</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">232</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">269</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Total number of bleeds requiring

</p>
<p>Both groups were well matched in terms of baseline characteristics (mean lesion
size 33.7mm in the Purastat<sup>®</sup> group and 36.6mm in the control
group, age 68.6 vs 71.5 years, adenocarcinoma and high-grade dysplasia 60.9%
vs 53.3%). There were 221 bleeds requiring haemostasis in the
Purastat<sup>®</sup> group compared to 262 in the control group with
no significant difference in the mean number of bleeds per patient. There
was a significant reduction in the proportion of bleeds treated with heat
therapy in the patients receiving Purastat<sup>®</sup> compared to controls
(110/221 or 49.8% vs 261/262 or 99.6%, p &lt; 0.001). Purastat<sup>®</sup>
was used in 54.8% of bleeds in the interventional group and haemostasis was
achieved with this device as a single agent in 91.7% (111/121) of cases when
used.</p>
<p>All bleeds were managed endoscopically with no blood transfusion or hospital
admission for management required. There were no complications related to
the application of Purastat<sup>®</sup> in this study and it did not
interfere with subsequent use of diathermy for haemostasis if required.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This is the first randomised controlled trial of this
haemostatic device and our results show that Purastat<sup>®</sup>
successfully reduced the use of intraprocedural heat therapy for haemostasis
in ESD by almost 50%. The device was easy to use and did not prolong the
time taken for haemostasis or the total procedure time. This study supports
its use as a safe and effective haemostat for bleeding during endoscopic
resection.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Intravenous (IV) use of CT-P13, an infliximab
biosimilar, has resulted in comparable efficacy, safety and immunogenicity
as innovator infliximab in various indications including Crohn's disease
(CD)<sup>1</sup> and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)<sup>2</sup>. A
subcutaneous (SC) formulation of CT-P13 is developed to provide patients
with opportunities for self-injection, thereby enhancing convenience and
flexibility in treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This work aimed to investigate immunogenicity by
post-hoc analysis of 2 randomised controlled trials comparing
pharmacokinetics of CT-P13 IV and CT-P13 SC. Patients with active CD
(Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score of 220–450) and RA (presence of
6 or more swollen and tender joints [of 28 assessed], and serum C-reactive
protein [CRP] concentration &gt;0.6 mg/dL) were treated with CT-P13 IV at
Weeks 0 and 2. At Week 6, patients were randomised for continuation with IV
or SC administration. The IV cohorts received CT-P13 IV (5 mg/kg for CD and
3 mg/kg for RA) every 8 weeks and the SC cohorts were treated with CT-P13 SC
(120, 180 and 240 mg for CD and 90, 120, 180 mg for RA) every 2 weeks up to
Week 30. Trough serum concentrations (C<sub>trough</sub>) were assessed at
Weeks 6, 14 and 22 for IV and Weeks 6, 8, 10, 14, 22, 24, 26 and 28 for SC.
Target exposure level was considered as 5 µg/mL for CD<sup>3,4</sup> and 1
µg/mL for RA<sup>5,6</sup>. Anti-drug antibody (ADA) was assessed before
study drug administration at Weeks 0, 6, 14, 22 and 30 by a drug-sensitive,
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 92 CD (n = 44) and RA (n = 48) patients were
randomised at Week 6 to IV (CD: n = 13, RA: n = 13) or SC (CD: n = 31, RA:
n = 35). Among CD patients, immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine
or methotrexate) were used at Week 6 by 9 (69.2%) and 15 (48.4%) patients in
IV and SC cohorts, respectively. All RA patients used methotrexate as
concomitant medication throughout the study. Efficacy results in each
indication (CDAI-70 responder rate for CD and EULAR [CRP] responder rate for
RA) were comparable between the IV and SC cohorts. Systemic safety profiles
observed from CT-P13 SC after randomisation were also comparable to those of
IV. A sub-therapeutic C<sub>trough</sub> level below target exposure was
detected at least once in 23 (92.0%) and 9 (14.1%) patients in IV and SC
cohorts, respectively. ADA were detected at least once in 16 (64.0%) versus
11 (18.1%) of patients in the IV and SC cohorts (p &lt; 0.0001),
respectively. <table-wrap id="table47-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table47-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table47"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Efficacy</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">IV cohort</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">SC cohort</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><italic>p</italic> value <sup>a</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">CDAI-70 responder rate at Week 30 in CD

<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> After initial loading two doses of infliximab IV,
patients subsequently receiving biweekly maintenance treatment with
injections of CT-P13 SC achieve more stable steady state therapeutic blood
levels of infliximab and have lower rate of anti-infliximab antibodies
compared with patients receiving continued IV treatment. Further work to
corroborate these findings is ongoing through a confirmatory efficacy
trial.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic
cholestatic biliary disease of unknown etiology, which increases the risk of
developing cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). In addition, PSC patients frequently
(80%) present inflammatory bowel disease, mainly ulcerative colitis (UC)
(PSC-UC). Currently, there are not available accurate non-invasive
biomarkers for surveillance or early diagnosis of PSC in UC patients, which
is warranted to monitor disease progression and to guide therapeutic
strategies. We recently showed [1] that serum extracellular vesicles (EVs)
contain protein biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of PSC, CCA and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to investigate the
usefulness of protein biomarkers in serum EVs for the differential diagnosis
of PSC-UC and UC patients, which could help in the early diagnosis of PSC in
UC patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Serum EVs were isolated from PSC-UC (n = 21), UC (n = 64;
without PSC) and healthy individuals (n = 62) using
ultracentrifugation/filtration methods. EV characterization was performed by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA)
and immunoblot. The proteome of EVs was analyzed by mass spectrometry-based
proteomics.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Serum EVs showed round morphology (by TEM), similar size
(180 nm diameter by NTA) and markers (CD9, CD63 and CD81 by immunoblotting)
consistent with exosomes and small-size microvesicles. The proteomic
profiles of serum EVs revealed 45 proteins to be differentially expressed in
UC vs. controls, 66 in PSC-UC vs. controls, and 62 in PSC-UC vs. UC patients
with high diagnostic performance(sensitivity and specificity). In
particular, proteins such as Aminopeptidase N (AMPN), Polymeric
immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR), G-protein coupled receptor family C group 5
member C (GPC5C) and Pantetheinase (VNN1) were exclusively upregulated
(p &lt; 0.05) in PSC-UC patients compared to UC and healthy controls. In
contrast, proteins such as Complement factor I (CFAI), Ficolin-2 (FCN2) and
Fibronectin (FINC) were downregulated (p &lt; 0.05) in PSC-UC patients
compared to UC and healthy controls.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Proteomic signatures found in serum EVs of PSC-UC and
UC patients show potential as non-invasive tools for diagnosis and
follow-up.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Upadacitinib (UPA), an oral selective JAK1 inhibitor
was associated with clinical and endoscopic efficacy over 52 weeks in
patients with moderate to severe refractory Crohn's disease.<sup>1</sup>
This is the first study assessing the long-term effects of a JAK inhibitor
(UPA) on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in Crohn's disease.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The 52-week data from the phase 2, randomised,
double-blind CELEST study (M13-740; NCT02365649) were analysed for long-term
effects of 4 UPA regimens on PROs. All patients who completed the 16-week
induction period were re-randomised 1:1:1 into an Extension Phase to receive
UPA 3 mg twice daily (BID), 12 mg BID or 24 mg daily (QD) for 36 weeks. The
24 mg QD arm was later stopped and a 6 mg BID arm was initiated to evaluate
an intermediate maintenance dose. Patients completed the Inflammatory Bowel
Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), EuroQol (EQ-5D) and Work Productivity and
Activity Impairment (WPAI) PROs at baseline, week 16, and week 52. Outcomes
at week 52 for patients who received UPA induction therapy and achieved
clinical response at week 16 were assessed. Percentages of patients who
achieved IBDQ response (defined as minimum clinically important differences
(MCID) ≥16-point increase in IBDQ score from baseline) and who achieved IBDQ
remission (IBDQ score ≥170) at week 52 were determined using non-responder
imputation (NRI). Changes from baseline to week 52 were calculated using
observed cases and analysis of covariance for IBDQ score, EQ-5D visual
analogue score (VAS) and WPAI.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Among 220 patients enrolled in CELEST, 180 were
re-randomized into the Extension Phase. Of these, 153 patients received UPA
induction therapy, of whom 94 achieved clinical response at week 16. Among
week-16 clinical responders, a greater proportion of patients in the BID
dose groups attained IBDQ response (43.8%-78.6%) and achieved IBDQ remission
(43.8%-50.0%) at week 52 than those in the 24mg QD dose group (Table).
Dose-related improvements in mean IBDQ scores (range 43-71) and EQ-5D VAS
(range 18-36) were observed in the 3mg, 6mg and 12mg BID dose groups at week
52. At week 52, improvements in WPAI including reduction of activity
impairment (26-42%) and work impairment (23-38%) were numerically greater
for the BID dose groups. <table-wrap id="table48-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table48-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table48"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Mean ± SD (n)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">UPA 3mg BID n = 32</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">UPA 6mg BID n = 14</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">UPA 12mg BID n = 29</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">UPA 24mg QD n = 19</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="5" rowspan="1">

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Recurrence after ileocaecal resection for Crohn's
Disease (CD) is frequent. Severity of post-operative endoscopic recurrence,
evaluated by the Rutgeerts score, is a predictive factor of long-term
outcome. Histological alterations of the ileal resection margins could be a
predictor of this post-operative endoscopic recurrence as suggested by
previous studies focused on myenteric or submucosal plexitis.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to study whether microscopic lesions at
ileal resection margins could predict endoscopic recurrence after
surgery.</p>
<p>We conducted a prospective multicentric study including CD patients who undergo
an ileocaecal resection. Clinical and biological data are collected and
analyzed in a network of gastroenterology research expert centers to define
predictors of recurrence.</p>
<p>Patients operated from April 2010 to December 2016 were included. An
ileocoloscopy was performed between 6 and 12 months after surgery.
Endoscopic recurrence was defined by a Rutgeerts score ≥ i2. Whole
paraffin-embedded ileal resection margins were blindly analyzed by 2 expert
pathologists to grade inflammatory lesions of mucosa, submucosa, muscularis
(plexitis) and subserosa. Correlation with post-operative endoscopic
recurrence was evaluated by both univariate (Chi-2) and multivariate
analyses (Logistic regression) for each item of the analysis grid.
Transcriptome analyses on ileal resection margins were performed using
microarrays after extraction of total RNA from whole intestinal mucosa
biopsies</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 228 patients included, 211 (92.5%) ileal resection
margins were available for histological analysis. 91 (43.1%) patients were
male, 70 (33.2%) active smokers and 52 (24.6%) received an anti TNF
treatment after surgery. 101 patients (49.3%) presented endoscopic
recurrence.</p>
<p>At histological examination, 98.1% (207) of patients had inflammation on ileal
margin, (limited to an increased lymphocyte count in the lamina propria in
21.7%) and only 4 patients (1.9%) had a strictly normal ileal wall.
Histological items significantly associated with recurrence were active
Epithelial alterations (Erosion, ulceration or cryptitis) (45.7% vs 61.2%,
p = 0.05), Submucosa Fibrosis (44.6% vs 59.2%, p = 0.04) and Subserosa
inflammation (44.6% vs 60.3%, p = 0.04). Myenteric and Submucosa plexitis
were not associated with recurrence.</p>
<p>We defined a score based on the presence of the three histological
abnormalities associated with recurrence (0 to 3). Post-operative recurrence
was observed in 44%, 44%, 50% and 75% in patients with a score of 0, 1, 2 or
3 respectively. Severe endoscopic recurrence (i3 or i4) was observed in 10%,
26%, 31% and 36% respectively. Patients with a histologic score of 3 had a
clear transcriptomic signature, corresponding to a strong inflammatory state
(DUOX2, CXCL6, CXCL8, Calprotectin genes).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Deep mural histological alterations defined by the
presence of Epithelium alterations, Submucosa fibrosis and Subserosa
inflammation were associated with a higher risk of endoscopic recurrence. A
strong inflammatory transcriptomic signature was associated with these
severe lesions.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Crohn's disease patients who fail corticosteroids
and immunomodulator therapy are generally upscaled to biological treatment.
The LIR!C trial showed that laparoscopic ileocecal resection (ICR) is a
valid alternative to infliximab (IFX) therapy for immunomodulator refractory
ileocecal Crohn's disease (1). Our aims were to compare the long-term
efficacy of both interventions and identify predictive factors associated
with time to therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Long-term follow-up data was retrospectively
collected for patients who participated in the LIR!C trial; a multicenter,
randomized controlled trial that compared laparoscopic ICR with IFX
induction and maintenance therapy for adult patients with non-stricturing
and immunomodulator refractory ileocecal Crohn's disease (≤40cm). Primary
outcome was the time to therapeutic intervention defined by the initiation
or modification of medical therapy or surgery for disease flare or
intolerance to treatment. Time to intervention was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis. Potential predictive factors were defined a priori,
identified through Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and
expressed as hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]. The following
baseline explanatory variables were included: gender, age, disease duration,
smoking, continued immunomodulator use, family history, extra intestinal
manifestations, corticosteroid use, perianal disease and C-reactive
protein.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Data were obtained for 128 of the 143 randomized patients
(89.5%). Median time of follow up was 25.5 [IQR 10.3–57.8] months. In the
ICR group, 24 (36.4%) patients received prophylactic immunomodulator
treatment after randomization as opposed to 37 (59.7%) in the IFX group. An
intervention was observed in 38 (57.6%) patients in the ICR and 38 (61.3%)
in the IFX group. No difference was observed in the distribution of
interventions between groups (log-rank p = 0.560). The incidence rate of an
intervention was 18% and 20% per patient-year in the ICR and IFX group
respectively. The median time without an intervention was 33 [IQR 3.1–62.9]
and 34 [IQR 0.0–68.9] months respectively. Cumulative incidences are
presented in table 1. Eventually, 18 (27.3%) patients allocated to the ICR
arm needed anti-TNF. Conversely, 28 (45.2%) patients in the IFX group
underwent an ICR. In both the ICR group (HR 0.306 [95%CI 0.144–0.648]
p = 0.002) and the IFX group (HR 0.457 [95%CI 0.224–0.932] p = 0.031),
prophylactic use of an immunomodulator was associated with lower risk of a
therapeutic intervention in multivariable analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> No difference in the need for additional therapeutic
intervention was observed for ICR compared to IFX in adult patients with
immunomodulator refractory ileocecal Crohn's disease. These long-term data
corroborate the results of the LIR!C trial. Prophylactic use of an
immunomodulator in conjunction with either treatment significantly decreased
the need for additional therapeutic intervention. <table-wrap id="table49-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table49-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table49"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The majority of patients with ileal Crohn's disease
(CD) undergo at least one intestinal resection during the course of their
disease. Postoperative recurrence is a major issue, as up to 70% of them
develop new lesions in their neoterminal ileum within 1 year of surgery. We
aim to determine whether the presence of adherent and invasive
<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (AIEC) bacteria at the time of
surgery was associated with endoscopic post-operative recurrence at 6
months.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The REMIND group (9 centers) has established a
homogeneous, prospective, multicenter cohort (POP-REMIND) of operated CD
patients. Tissue samples were taken from the surgical specimen (M0) and at
endoscopy (M6), and stored centrally in a bio-bank. The inclusion criteria
were: age ≥18 years, ileal or ileocaecal CD requiring intestinal resection.
Post-operative treatment was prescribed according to a standardized
algorithm. Clinical outcome, therapeutic, biological and endoscopic data
(Rutgeerts score) were collected 6 months after surgery. Clinical factors
(demographic variables, phenotypic and postoperative treatments) associated
with endoscopic recurrence were investigated by univariate analysis and
logistic (multivariate) regression. The search for mucosa-associated
<italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria was carried out by culturing on
Drigalski medium, and adherent-invasive characteristics of <italic>E.
coli</italic> was performed using Int-407 cells, and survival within
THP-1 macrophages.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The presence of mucosa-associated <italic>E.
coli</italic> strains was determined on the surgical specimen in 241
patients; 110 harbored mucosa-associated <italic>E. coli</italic> (45.6%).
The presence of mucosa-associated <italic>E. coli</italic> on the surgical
specimen was not correlated with age, disease duration, smoking, previous
surgical resection and with preoperative anti-TNF exposure. Of the 241
patients included, 172 had a postoperative colonoscopy at M6. Among these,
76 (44.2%) harbored mucosa-associated <italic>E. coli</italic>. The presence
of mucosa-associated <italic>E. coli</italic> on the surgical specimen was
associated to increase risk of endoscopic post-operative recurrence (defined
as Rutgeerts scores i2b, i3 and i4): 32 among 76 patients mucosa-associated
<italic>E. coli</italic> + (42.1%) versus 32/96 (33.4%) for
mucosa-associated <italic>E. coli</italic>-. In contrast, mucosa-associated
<italic>Enterococci</italic> have been isolated in 119 patients
(49.4%) but was not correlated with endoscopic recurrence at month 6. Among
the 76 patients colonized by mucosa-associated <italic>E. coli</italic>, 27
of them were carriers of adherent-invasive <italic>E. coli</italic> at the
time of surgery. The presence of AIEC on the surgical specimen was
predictive of severe endoscopic post-operative recurrence (defined as
Rutgeerts scores i2b, i3 and i4): 14 among 27 patients AIEC + (52%) versus
50/145 (34%) for AIEC -; p = 0.01. After adjusting for age, sex, pre- or
post-operative exposure to TNF antagonists and antibiotics, the presence of
AIEC on the surgical specimen was associated with endoscopic recurrence
i3-i4 (OR = 3.42 CI95% [1.31–8.84], p = 0.011).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this prospective POP-REMIND cohort of 172 patients,
abnormal colonization of ileal mucosa by <italic>E. coli</italic> increased
the risk of recurrence, and this is not the case for
<italic>Enterococci</italic> bacteria. Of interest, the presence of
AIEC on the surgical specimen was an independent risk factor for severe
endoscopic post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease. Thus, the detection
of AIEC at the time of surgery appears essential to adapt the postoperative
treatment.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> PF-00547659 (SHP647)<sup>1</sup> is a human
anti-mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) IgG2 monoclonal
antibody that decreases intestinal inflammation through blockade of
MAdCAM-dependent lymphocyte recruitment. A phase 2 study (NCT 01620255), in
patients with moderate to severe, active ulcerative colitis in the TURANDOT
study showed the therapeutic efficacy of PF-00547659 in a non-monotonic dose
responsive manner, with the intermediate 22.5 mg dose cohort demonstrating
greater efficacy than the highest 225 mg dose cohort<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to define novel pharmacodynamic and
efficacy biomarkers and to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying the
observed non-monotonic dose response.</p>
<p>Transcriptome (RNA seq), protein (Olink), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) data
were generated from the peripheral blood and intestinal biopsies of 310
patients from this phase 2 trial.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Compared to the placebo group, C-C Motif Chemokine
Receptor 9 (CCR9) gene expression demonstrated a 1.2, 2.0, 3.0 and 2.5-fold
increase in the 7.5 mg, 22.5mg, 75mg, and 225mg cohorts, respectively
(p = 0.21, 3e-8, 7.5e-18 and 1.8e-12) in peripheral blood; while in inflamed
intestinal tissue, it demonstrated a 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.5-fold decrease in
the 7.5 mg, 22.5mg, 75mg and 225mg cohorts, respectively (p = 0.046, 0.0070,
0.0015, 0.0028). Oncostatin M (OSM) gene or protein expression in peripheral
blood or intestinal tissue demonstrated a 0.2 to 0.9-fold decrease among
patients who showed efficacy (response, remission, or mucosal healing,
p = 0.01 to 2.6e-8). Compared to the placebo group, intestinal T regulatory
cells measured by IHC demonstrated a 5.4-fold increase in the intermediate
22.5 mg dose cohort (p = 0.02), but not in the highest 225 mg dose cohort
(p = 0.58).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These results reveal CCR9 and OSM as pharmacodynamic
and efficacy biomarkers, respectively. Furthermore, the increased number of
regulatory cells in the intermediate 22.5 mg cohort could suggest a greater
sensitivity for T effector versus T regulatory cells to PF-00547659-mediated
blockade, implicating a potential mechanistic rationale for the observed
non-monotonic efficacy response. Taken together, these findings may have
significant implications for our understanding of UC disease pathophysiology
and the development of future therapeutic approaches.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Macrophages contribute to fibrosis through the
release of different mediators and the pattern of secretion may vary
according to their phenotype. Strong evidence identifies the Wnt signalling
pathway as an emerging modulator of fibrosis. We have recently reported
differences in the Wnt signalling pathway in surgical resections from
Crohn's disease patients presenting a stricturing (B2) or a penetrating (B3)
behavior (1).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of the present study is to analyze the
pattern of expression of macrophages and the expression of Wnt ligands in
surgical resections from Crohn’s disease (CD, n = 43) patients with
different disease behavior. CD patients were categorized according to
Montreal classification (B2 or B3) and unaffected mucosa of patients with
colorectal cancer was used as control. mRNA was isolated and the expression
of macrophage markers, pro-inflammatory cytokines and Wnt2b was analyzed by
RT-PCR (Gene/b-actin) mRNA expression; fold induction vs control group). The
number of macrophages positive for the different markers (CD206, CD86, CD16
and WNT2b) was analysed by flow cytometry. Human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCS) were isolated from healthy donors and treated with
secretomes from control, B2 or B3 surgical resections for 5 days. mRNA from
PBMCS was isolated and the expression of macrophage markers and wnt2b was
determined. Results are expressed by mean ± SEM (n≥5). Statistical analysis
was performed by ANOVA + Newman-Keuls test. Correlations between data were
analysed using Pearson's correlation coefficient (p &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and
IL-6 and WNT2b was significantly higher in intestinal samples from B3 CD
patients (8.9 ± 2.0, 8.7 ± 1.8 and 2.3 ± 0.4, respectively) than in controls
(2.3 ± 0.4, 2.4 ± 0.6 and 1.1 ± 0.1, respectively) or B2 CD patients
(3.6 ± 1.0, 5.0 ± 0.8 and 0.7 ± 0.1, respectively). The number of CD16 or
CD86 positive macrophages was significantly higher in intestinal tissue from
B3 CD patients (69.7 ± 24.4% and 88.8 ± 18.4%, respectively) than in that
from B2 CD patients (36.12 ± 5.8% and 30.58 ± 10.9%, respectively). A high
percentage of CD16 positive macrophages were also positive for Wnt2b in
intestinal tissue from B3 CD patients (24.7 ± 8.8%). A significant and
positive correlation between WNT2b and CD16 (r = 0.8, p = 0.001) or CD86
(r = 0.7, p = 0.001) as well as CD16+ cells and CD86+ cells (r = 0.7,
p = 0.002) was detected in intestinal tissue from B3 CD patients. The mRNA
expression of CD16, CD86 and WNT2b was significantly higher in PBMCS treated
with B3-secretomes (138.6 ± 20.9, 35 ± 8.0 and 12 ± 3.2, respectively) than
in those treated with B2- (3.3 ± 1.8, 3.3 ± 1.8 and 3.3 ± 1.8, respectively)
or control (1.2 ± 0.5, 1.2 ± 0.5 and 1.2 ± 0.5, respectively)
secretomes.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A pro-inflammatory/profibrotic macrophage phenotype
may act as a source of Wnt2b in intestinal tissue from Crohn's disease
patients with a penetrating (B3) behavior.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The efficacy and safety of etrasimod, a selective,
oral sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1, 4, and 5 modulator, was evaluated
in patients (pts) with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
12-week (wk) phase 2 induction study evaluated etrasimod in pts with
moderate to severe UC, defined as a 3-component Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) of
4-9 with endoscopic subscore ≥2 and rectal bleeding (RB) subscore ≥1. The
3-component MCS (range 0-9) includes RB, stool frequency, and endoscopy. Pts
received once-daily etrasimod 1 mg (n = 52) or 2 mg (n = 50), with no dose
titration, or placebo (PBO; n = 54). The primary endpoint (EP) was change
from baseline (BL) in 3-component MCS at wk 12. Secondary EPs included the
proportion of pts with endoscopic remission (≤1 point). Exploratory EPs
included the proportion of pts achieving clinical remission and clinical
response at wk 12 and change in lymphocyte count (LC). Changes in MCS were
assessed by analysis of covariance with treatment as a factor and current
oral corticosteroid (CS) use, prior anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)α use,
and BL measures as covariates; LC was assessed by mixed-effects model and
parameters with proportions of pts by the Mantel-Haenszel method with
adjustment for current oral CS and prior anti-TNFα use.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 156 pts randomized, 90% completed the study. BL
characteristics, including age, sex, disease duration, current CS use, and
prior biologic use, were balanced among groups. At wk 12, dose-dependent
improvements occurred with etrasimod in all efficacy measures vs PBO
(Table). Etrasimod 2 mg improved change from BL in 3-component MCS vs PBO
(difference, 0.99 points; 90% confidence interval, 0.30–1.68; p = 0.009).
More pts receiving etrasimod 2 mg achieved endoscopic improvement (41.8% vs
17.8% for PBO; p = 0.003). At wk 12, there was a significant decrease in
circulating LCs from BL with etrasimod 1 and 2 mg relative to PBO (37.2% and
57.3%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001 for both). Adverse events (AEs) were
mostly mild to moderate and similar among groups. More PBO-treated pts
(11.1%) had a serious AE (SAE) vs etrasimod-treated pts (2 mg, 0%; 1 mg,
5.8%), reflecting disease worsening. No SAEs related to bradycardia or
atrioventricular block were noted.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In pts with moderate to severe UC, etrasimod was more
effective than PBO in achieving dose-dependent improvements in clinical
response, clinical remission, and endoscopic appearance. Etrasimod was safe
and well tolerated in this short-term study. <table-wrap id="table50-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table50-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table50"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Efficacy Measure</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">PBO (n = 54)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Etrasimod 1 mg (n = 52)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Etrasimod 2 mg (n = 50)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><bold>Primary Endpoint:</bold> Change from

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> In 2000 the UK two-week-wait (TWW) suspected cancer
pathway was launched, with comparable fast-track pathways in place across
Europe. The service utilises substantial time at primary and secondary care
level and with significant financial cost to NHS trusts, yet national TWW
performance data is lacking. This systematic review is the first to
comprehensively evaluate the latest evidence on colorectal cancer (CRC)
conversion rate, polyp detection rate and stage at diagnosis through the TWW
pathway for suspected lower gastrointestinal malignancy.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This systematic review is reported according to
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses
[PRISMA] 2009 statement. Cochrane, EMBASE, Medline via Pubmed, NHS Evidence,
Trip and the British Library Catalogue were searched, plus references were
hand-searched. Disagreements were resolved via consensus. Cancer conversion
rates were expressed as proportions along with their corresponding 95%
confidence intervals. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled
cancer conversion rates, polyp detection rates and cancer stage at diagnosis
using R package metaphor. Proportions of non-CRC malignancy and other
diagnoses were also calculated. Forest plots were produced for each outcome
measure.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 95 full papers and 28 conference abstracts were reviewed,
49 met eligibility criteria. 77.5% of full papers reported cancer conversion
rate, corresponding weighted mean was calculated with a cancer conversion
rate of 7.7% (95% CI 6.9–8.5). Cancer stage at diagnosis was reported in
28.5% of papers. Pooled data showed the proportion presenting at Dukes
A = 11.2% (95% CI 7.4–15.6), B = 36.7% (95% CI 30.8–42.8), C = 35.7% (95%
CI: 30.8–40.8) and D = 11.1% (95% CI 7.3–15.5). 30.6% of papers reported
polyp detection rate with an overall value of 10.8% (95% CI 8.5–16.3),
adenoma detection rate was 8.5% (95% CI 6.6–10.6). Diagnosis of non-CRC
cancer and IBD were very low at 3.2% (95% CI: 0.9–6.6) and 3.9 (95% CI:
2.9–4.9) respectively. 54.6% (95% CI: 46.2–62.8) of patients had a diagnosis
of normal or haemorrhoids.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The pooled cancer conversion rate via TWW is similar
to the cancer detection rate in the asymptomatic Bowel Cancer Screening
Population (latest figure 8%) and is not having its intended impact on
cancer diagnosis. When compared with the recent national staging data no
statistically significant difference in stage distribution was seen in the
TWW cohort compared with CRC diagnosed via any non-TWW route combined
(excluding emergencies). Nearly half of patients presented with stage 3 or 4
disease with corresponding survival of 47.7% and 6.6%
respectively<sup>1</sup>. The results provoke a reconsideration of the
benefits of the TWW pathway for CRC. Re-evaluation of the referral criteria
needs consideration with focus on symptoms with higher positive predictive
value (PPV) in cancer.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> In the Netherlands, a colorectal cancer (CRC)
screening program was initiated in January 2014, using biennial fecal
immunological testing (FIT). 6 months later, a higher than expected
participation and FIT positivity rate combined with a low positive
predictive value (PPV) necessitated an increase in the FIT cut-off level to
increase the PPV and to alleviate the colonoscopy capacity. This study
presents the impact of the increased FIT cut-off level on the results of the
second round of the CRC screening program.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We present outcomes of the Dutch national CRC
screening program in 2016. The target population for this year consisted of
3 groups of individuals: first-time invitees; second-time invitees that had
been invited to FIT at a cut-off level of 15 µg Hb/g feces in 2014; and
second-time invitees invited to FIT at a cut-off level of 47 µg Hb/g feces
in 2014. All participants in 2016 underwent screening with a 47 µg Hb/g
feces FIT cut-off level. The FIT positivity rate and PPV for detecting CRC
and/or Advanced Adenoma (AA) among FIT positive participants was compared
between the three groups of individuals. Data were collected from Screen-IT,
the national screening database covering the whole Dutch CRC screening
program from selection of individuals for invitation to the colonoscopy and
pathology reports.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 1,497,591 individuals were invited for FIT in
2016: 1,038,998 first-time invitees, 57,936 second-time invitees with a
previous 15 µg Hb/g feces cut-off level and 400,657 second-time invitees
with a previous 47 µg Hb/g feces cut-off level (Table). Participation was
high in both first- and second-time invitees: 71.8% and 76.2% respectively.
As expected, FIT positivity was highest among first-time invitees (6.0%,
95%CI: 5.9–6.1). In second-time invitees, positivity rate was lower in those
previously invited for a FIT with cut-off of 15 µg Hb/g feces (3.3%, 95%CI:
3.1–3.5), compared to those previously invited for a FIT with cut-off of 47
µg Hb/g feces (4.3%, 95%CI: 4.3–4.4). Results for detection rates and PPV
showed a similar pattern (Table). <table-wrap id="table51-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Abstract No: OP244 Table 1</label><caption><p>Age, Participation rate, Positivity rate, Detection rate and

<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Participation in the Dutch CRC screening program
remains among the highest in the world. The increase in FIT cut-off level in
2014 has not jeopardized participation. As expected, an increased FIT
cut-off level in the first screening round resulted in relatively more
positive FIT results and higher PPV in the subsequent screening round. This
suggests that most of the missed findings due to use of an increased FIT
cut-off level are detected in the subsequent round, emphasizing the
importance of repeated screening, especially within screening settings with
high cut-off levels.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Organized programs for colorectal cancer (CRC)
screening have been associated with a substantial degree of CRC prevention
in terms of its incidence and mortality. However, these programs demand a
high burden of medical and economic resources. The 2 preferred screening
methods are faecal immunochemical test (FIT) and primary colonoscopy. Our
aim was to perform a cost-utility analysis between these 2 tests in an
European setting.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> A Markov cost-utility analysis was performed for
the Portuguese population from a societal perspective comparing FIT or
colonoscopy screening versus non-screening. Clinical data and utilities were
collected from a systematic review and costs from published national data.
Population was screened from 50 to 74 years-old by biennial FIT or
colonoscopy every 10 years and efficacy was evaluated in quality-adjusted
life years (QALY). For the base case scenario, FIT cost was €3, with 50%
acceptance, sensitivity 70% and specificity 95%; colonoscopy cost was €397
with 38% acceptance. An annual discount of 3% was used and the threshold was
set at €39,760/QALY. The primary outcome was the incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER); deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity
analysis was done and colonoscopy burden was addressed according to the
screening option.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Biennial FIT screening and primary colonoscopy every 10
years screening resulted in a degree of CRC incidence and mortality
prevention of 30% and 30%, and 38% and 38%, respectively. This translated in
an incremental utility of 0.00157 QALY and 0.00185 QALY, as compared with no
screening. The overall cost was €17.9 for FIT and €199.4 for colonoscopy,
resulting in an additional cost of €10 and €191 vs. no screening,
respectively. At cost-effectiveness analysis, FIT was the most
cost-effective option providing an ICER of €6,383/QALY while colonoscopy
every 10 years provided an ICER of €103,633/QALY. FIT screening was the most
cost-effective option in 96% of simulations in sensitivity analysis.
Colonoscopies capacity would have to increase 1.3% for a FIT programme
(26,000 colonoscopies/year/million screened) or 31% for a colonoscopy
programme (48,000 colonoscopies/year/million screened).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Biennial FIT is a more suitable choice compared to
primary colonoscopy screening resulting in a more rational exploitation of
the limited endoscopic capacity. This further supports the progressive
implementation of FIT-based programs in Europe.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The fast-track colonoscopy program to detect
patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) based on high-risk symptoms is
associated with low sensitivity and specificity.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Derive a predictive score of advanced colonic
neoplasia (ACN) in symptomatic patients with indication of a fast-track
colonoscopy.</p>
<p>All the patients referred for colonoscopy with fast-track indication were
evaluated in the three participating centres. We performed in the included
patients: faecal immunological occult haemoglobin test (FIT) (3 samples)
considering positive &gt;4 µg Hb/g faeces; and a face-to-face survey to
register clinical variables of interest. The main outcome was ACN defined as
CRC or advanced adenoma (&gt;1 cm or high-grade dysplasia or villous
component). The overall maximun faecal haemoglobin (MAXFIT) value, which
maximizes the probability of ACN through the assessment of the diagnostic
odds ratio (OR) was calculated, and was 11 µg Hb/g faeces. We assumed 3
categories for the MAXFIT variable: ≤4, &gt;4 to 11, &gt;11 µg Hb/g faeces.
A minimum sample size of 600 individuals was calculated for each phase of
the study: Phase 1 (derivation cohort) and Phase 2 (validation cohort). A
Bayesian logistic regression analysis using R software was performed to
derive a predictive score and stratify the risk of ACN.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 1495 patients were included (Phase 1 + 2). Differences
were found between the derivation and the validation cohort in the variables
related to the FIT (in Phase 2 there were 3 CRCs with negative FIT), but not
in the rest of the study variables. Overall, there were 6/116 (5%) CRC
patients with only 1 out of 3 faecal samples positive. Age (OR, 21), MAXFIT
(OR, 2.3) and number of positive samples (OR, 28) presented the highest ORs.
The predictive clinical variables adjusted for age and FIT in Phase 1 were
previous colonoscopy (last 5 years) and smoking (no, ex/active). No clinical
symptom was a significant predictor after adjusting for age and FIT. With
these variables (age, FIT, previous colonoscopy, smoking) a predictive score
of ACN was derived (-4 to 24 points). Applying the score to Phase 2:
patients with a Score &gt;20 had an ACN probability of 66%, while in those
with a Score ≤10, the probability was 10% (CRC, 1%). Prioritizing patients
with Score &gt;10, 49.4% of patients were referred for fast-track
colonoscopy, diagnosing 98.3% of CRCs and 77% of advanced adenomas.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A scoring system was derived and validated to
prioritize fast-track colonoscopies according to risk, which was shown to be
efficient, simple and robust.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Post-Colonoscopy Colorectal Cancer (PCCRC) rate is a
key quality indicator of colonoscopy. The Word Endoscopy Organization has
reached consensus agreement to use one method for calculating 3-year PCCRC
rates (termed PCCRC-3y) to enable international benchmarking of rates (1).
This methodology, used previously by Morris et al (2), showed a PCCRC-3y
rate of 8.6% across the English National Health Service (NHS) from
2001-2007(2) with a rate of 7.3% in 2007. This study aimed to determine the
rate of PCCRC-3y in the English NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme
(BCSP).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Data from each colonoscopy in the BCSP is
entered into a national database, the Bowel Cancer Screening System. All
colorectal adenocarcinomas, within and outside the BCSP, are validated and
registered by the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service. This
retrospective observational study interrogated these databases to identify
those BCSP colonoscopies detecting colorectal cancers within 6 months (true
positive colonoscopies) and those BCSP colonoscopies in patients who
subsequently developed a colorectal cancer 6 months – 3 years after the
colonoscopy (false negatives) between 2006 and 2013.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 200 PCCRCs, 115 were detected at a subsequent BCSP
procedure and 85 detected outside the BCSP. <table-wrap id="table52-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table52-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table52"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Year</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">True Positive Colonoscopies</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">False Negative Colonoscopies</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">To year end</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">PCCRC-3y Rate</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2006-2008</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2288</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">47</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2009-2011</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2.05% (95% CI 1.5–2.7)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2009</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2303</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">62</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2012</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2.62% (95% CI 2.0–3.3)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2010</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3180</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">91</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2013</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2.78% (95% CI 2.2–3.4)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Total</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">7771</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">200</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2.50%(95% CI 2.2–2.9)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></p>

</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> 1. The overall English NHS BCSP PCCRC-3y rate from
2006-2010 is 2.5% – less than half the 7.3% PCCRC rate seen in the
symptomatic English NHS for 2007, providing further evidence that high
quality colonoscopy, such as that performed by screening-accredited
colonoscopists in the BCSP, results in a lower rate of PCCRC (3)(4).</p>
<p>2. Despite the high quality of colonoscopy in the BCSP, PCCRCs still occur,

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> After index colonoscopy patients with high-risk
adenomas (≥ 2 polyps or ≥ 10 mm or high-grade dysplasia or villous or
tubulovillous histology) should undergo surveillance colonoscopy after 3
years, patients with low-risk adenomas after 10 years. Although endoscopic
screening reached high quality standards, interval cancers still occur in a
significant number of patients and the underlying risk factors are poorly
understood.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To evaluate if patients with high-risk adenomas
are at increased risk for interval cancers. Screening colonoscopies
performed between 1/2009 and 6/2015 within a nationwide quality assurance
program were included. An interval cancer was defined as colorectal cancer
diagnosed at least 6 month after screening colonoscopy and the scheduled
time of surveillance colonoscopy.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 146,894 colonoscopies were included (50.8% women, median
age 60 years) of which 19% were classified as high risk. During a median
follow up of 36.9 month, 114 interval cancers were identified. Patients with
high-risk lesions had significantly higher incidence rates of interval
cancers than those in the low-risk group (HR 1.77 [1.18–2.66]; p = 0.006).
Other factors associated with interval cancer were older age (HR per 10
years 1.87 [1.52–2.29]; p &lt; 0.001) and adenoma detection rate ≤20% (HR
0.65 [0.44–0.95]; p = 0.025). Interestingly, there was no association with
female sex.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> High-risk lesions are a stronger predictor for the
occurrence of interval cancer than poor adenoma detection rate. In contrast
to previous studies there was no association with female sex.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Early detection of gastric cancer is difficult even
for well-trained endoscopists, therefore machine learning is expected to be
useful for reducing misdetection and interobserver variability in endoscopic
diagnosis. Dramatic changes in detection accuracy in machine learning have
been occurring since the upsurge in the utility of convolutional neural
network (CNN). Although many results have been reported, there are
relatively few effective methods to automatically detect early gastric
cancer with small morphological features, which implies that automatic
detection methods can be extremely difficult to construct. Additionally, it
is well-known that CNN-based methods require the preparation of a large
number of annotated datasets. Automatic detection scheme with high efficient
learning which can achieve high accuracy is required.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> In this study, we proposed a CNN-based automatic
detection scheme to assist endoscopic image diagnosis for early gastric
cancer with efficient learning system. We used one hundred non-magnifying
endoscopic images of early gastric cancer which were segmented and annotated
into 2 classes (cancer area and normal area) for learning. We also used 698
noncancerous images for learning. The images are 24-bit full-color images of
size 1000 × 870 pixels extracted from the endoscopic video taken under white
light (GIF-H290Z or GIF TYPE H260Z, Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) and a
standard video endoscope system (EVIS LUCERA ELITE, Olympus Optical). We
obtained detailed texture information based on randomly cropped small images
derived from cancer images and normal images of the learning data. The
information was utilized to perform a transfer learning for tuning CNN-based
prediction scheme. Validation was conducted with the 4,653 cancer small
images and 4,997 normal small images, which were randomly cropped from
cancer area and normal area of 128 gastric cancer images, not used as the
learning data. Detection of early gastric cancer on the full size endoscopic
images was performed in each blocks where the image was divided into 90
blocks. The detection results were shown as a color heat map, showing the
likelihood of cancerous area. The detection accuracy was evaluated by
counting the number of images when at least one block matches the ground
truth.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of our trained
CNN-based prediction scheme for 4,653 cancer images and 4,997 normal images
was 80.0%, 94.8%, and 87.6%. Automatic detection of early gastric cancer for
full size endoscopic images were successfully done with showing detected
cancerous area as pseudo colored heatmap, and detection success was
accomplished in a total of 106 images (82.8%) out of 128 cancer images.
Conversely, a total of 491 images (70.3%) out of 698 normal images were
correctly predicted as “normal.” The processing time was 4 ms per image,
except for the time required to input/output the image.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our preliminary CNN-based prediction scheme achieved
high accuracy in early gastric cancer detection from the small amount of
learning datasets. Automatic detection of early gastric cancer may offer
sufficient assistance to endoscopists in decision making.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer
worldwide, and the sixth cause of death. Patients are usually diagnosed at
an advanced stage when it is often too late for effective treatment, thus it
is important to detect in early stage. In recent years, artificial
intelligence (AI) using deep learning has made remarkable progress in
various medical fields, however, there is no report about the diagnosis of
esophageal cancer. Here, we demonstrate the diagnostic ability of AI to
detect esophageal cancer including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and
adenocarcinoma.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We collected 8428 training images of esophageal
cancer lesions that were histologically proven to be SCC or adenocarcinoma
in 384 patients in Cancer Institute Hospital, Tokyo, Japan from 2014 to
2017. The training esophageal cancer images included 397 lesions of
esophageal SCCs (ESCCs) which consisted of 332 lesions of superficial cancer
and 65 lesions of advanced cancer. A total of 32 lesions of esophageal
adenocarcinomas (EACs) were also included for training and consisted of 19
lesions of superficial cancers and 13 lesions of advanced cancers. With
these training images, we developed deep learning through convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). We also prepared 1118 test images in 47 patients
with 49 esophageal cancers, including 41 ESCCs and 8 EACs, (169 images of
esophageal cancer and 376 images without cancer)and 50 patients without
esophageal cancer (573 images of the non-cancerous part of the esophagus) to
evaluate the diagnostic accuracy. All cases of esophageal cancer were
confirmed to have no other cancer using WLI, NBI, iodine staining, and
follow-up endoscopy after the treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The CNN took 27 seconds to analyze 1118 test images and
correctly detected esophageal cancer cases with a sensitivity of 98%
(48/49). CNN could detect all 7 small cancer lesions less than 10 mm in
size. In contrast the CNN misdetected 42 non-cancerous lesions, which caused
low positive predictive value (54%). However, the PPV of NBI with
magnification was reported to be 45% in experienced endoscopists and 35% in
less experienced endoscopists, which was not so different from our outcomes.
The misdetected lesions included scars of endoscopic resection and
esophagogastric junction. This can be corrected by deep learning about each
normal structure and benign lesion, which will surely reduce false positives
and improve the PPV significantly. Each image of esophageal cancer, whether
taken with WLI or with NBI, was separately diagnosed as either superficial
or advanced cancer by the CNN. The accuracy in diagnosis was quite high for
both imaging modalities. The diagnostic accuracy was 99% (142/143) for
superficial cancer and 92% (23/25) for advanced cancer. The accuracy in
diagnosis for ESCC and EAC was 99% (146/147) and 90% (19/21), respectively.
In addition, the CNN could detect all 5 esophageal cancers in the video of
endoscopic screening in 5 cases.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> AI-based diagnostic systems developed by deep learning
demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy with high sensitivity to detect
esophageal cancer with surprising efficiency. For the first step, we
analyzed only still images and we think this system is useful for rechecking
the stored images after EGD. In addition, we succeeded demonstrating the
usefulness of the CNN system for videos, which could help identify
esophageal cancer during EGD in real time. We believe the AI-based
diagnostic system will support us in detecting esophageal cancers and allow
early detection of esophageal cancer in daily clinical practice in the near
future.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Early neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus (BE) is
difficult to detect during surveillance endoscopies. This is partly because
of its subtle appearance and partly because most endoscopists rarely
encounter early BE neoplasia and therefore are unfamiliar with its
endoscopic appearance. Computer- aided detection (CAD) systems might be able
to assist endoscopists real-time in the detection of early BE neoplasia,
thereby improving efficacy of BE surveillance. Recently, several
<italic>deep learning techniques</italic> using Transfer Learning in
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in other
fields. CAD systems using deep learning techniques allow for faster
execution time than the conventional clinically inspired algorithms, which
will be essential for real-time operation.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility of a deep learning algorithm
for detection of BE neoplasia using high-quality endoscopic images.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Endoscopic overview images of 40 subtle early
neoplastic BE lesions and 20 non-dysplastic BE patients were prospectively
collected in White Light Endoscopy (WLE) in three tertiary referral centers.
To establish a ground truth for detection and delineation, 6 international
BE experts delineated all neoplastic images using a proprietary online
delineation module.</p>
<p>The area ≥4 experts delineated was labelled as <italic>the sweet spot</italic>.
The area with at least 1 expert delineation was labelled as the <italic>soft
spot</italic>. Positive samples were extracted from the sweet spot of
the neoplastic images, while negatives samples were taken from the area
outside of the soft spot and from the NDBE images. The deep learning
algorithm was trained using transfer learning on a Resnet50 model
pre-trained on ImageNet. The images were divided in blocks of 128 x 128
pixels that were used as input to the CNN. Based on their location, each
image block was then classified as neoplastic or non-neoplastic separately
and aggregated to obtain a segmentation mask. For each detected neoplastic
image, the algorithm produced 2 separate delineations: A complete
delineation of the neoplastic area and a ‘red-flag' indication of only the
most suspicious part of the lesion.</p>
<p>Outcome parameters: 1) Detection scores: Diagnostic accuracy of the algorithm
per image in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV; 2)
Localization scores: Percentage of recognized neoplastic images where the
delineation of the algorithm detected the soft spot and sweet spot; 3)
Red-flag indication: Percentage of recognized neoplastic images where the
algorithm red-flagged the soft spot and sweet spot.</p>
<p>Performance was evaluated using 4-fold cross-validation.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV for
detection per image were 92%, 95%, 85%, 93% and 90%, respectively. On the
detected neoplastic images, the algorithm identified both the soft- and
sweet spot to be neoplastic in all cases (100%). On these images the
algorithm furthermore red-flagged the soft spot and sweet spot to be
neoplastic in 97% and 87%, respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Detection scores of the first version of this deep
learning algorithm were high. On all detected images, the algorithm
recognized the location of the neoplastic lesion. These results are
promising and show feasibility of computer-aided detection as a red-flag
detection technique in BE surveillance. Future steps will focus on further
development of the algorithm towards video- and real-time analyses.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Recently the American Society for Gastrointestinal
Endoscopy (ASGE) addressed the “resect and discard” strategy, which suggests
that diminutive polyps can be resected and discarded without submitting
pathological assessment, when it is estimated not as adenomatous polyps with
high confidence. This strategy can reduce the physician's burden,
complications caused by biopsy, and medical costs. However, endoscopists
need specific training until they can precisely detect and classify
colorectal polyps, and in this regard computer-assisted diagnose (CAD)
system may be of help. Previous studies have suggested promising application
of artificial intelligence (AI), using deep learning in object
recognition.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to construct a CAD using deep learning
method that can accurately identify and classify CP in stored colonoscopy
images. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture called Single
Shot MultiBox Detector was utilized to develop and validate the CAD system
in the present study. We trained the CNN using 16,418 images: 4,752 of CP
and 4,013 of normal colorectums, and subsequently validated the performance
of the trained CNN in 7,077 colonoscopy images, including 1,172 CP images
from 309 various types of CP. Diagnostic speed and yields for the detection
and classification of CP were evaluated as a measure of performance of the
trained CNN.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> he processing speed of the CNN was 20 ms per frame. The
trained CNN identified 1,247 CP with a sensitivity of 92% and a positive
predictive value (PPV) of 86%. Among the correctly detected polyps, 83% of
the CP were accurately classified, and furthermore, 97% of adenomas were
precisely identified.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> ur CNN showed robust performance to detect and
classify CP through colonoscopy images, highlighting its high potential for
future application as a CAD system of CP during colonoscopy.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Clinically significant post-endoscopic bleeding
(CSPEB) is the most common complication following colonic endoscopic mucosal
resection (EMR). Current prediction tools are based on peri-procedural
patient and lesion characteristics and do not account for the post-EMR
mucosal defect appearance. We hypothesized that CSPEB may be predicted by
analyzing the morphometric characteristics of blood vessels within the
post-EMR mucosal defect. Our aim was to create a tool that will allow
real-time identification of high-risk patients, which may benefit from
prophylactic treatment and close monitoring.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Patients from the Australian prospective EMR
cohort (ACE) were assigned to 2 groups based on presence or absence of
CSPEB. The groups were matched in a 1:1 ratio for the clinical variables
known to be associated with CSPEB (Age, aspirin use, lesion location in the
colon, lesion size, histological subtype and intraprocedural bleeding).
Standard EMR was performed, detailed patient lesion and procedural
characteristics were recorded and meticulous photo-documentation prior to,
during and after the procedure was obtained. A telephone interview was
conducted 14 days after the procedure as part of the ACE study protocol, to
record adverse events.</p>
<p>Computerized morphometric analysis was used to quantify various morphological
characteristics of the blood vessels within the post-EMR mucosal defect.
Multivariate Discriminant Regression Analysis and neural network were used
as prediction models.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Over the course of 6 years, until 2015, 1332 colonic
lateral spreading lesions (LSL) &gt;20 mm underwent EMR at Westmead hospital
as part of the ACE study. 88/1332 (6.6%) had CSPEB. 43 cases and 43 matched
controls with high quality images of the post EMR mucosal defect were
selected for the analysis (median lesion size 40 mm (IQR 30-51.25)). Out of
30 blood vessel characteristics, 5 morphometric characteristics were
independently associated with CSPEB (table 1).</p>
<p>Discriminant analysis using the 5 independent predictors yielded 86%
sensitivity and 76.7% specificity in correctly identifying patients at risk
of CSPEB. A Neural Network (NNET) classifier using the same independent
predictors was trained on 60 subjects (30 controls and 30 cases) and
subsequently tested on 26 subjects (13 controls and 13 cases). Training and
testing subjects were chosen by computer randomization. The validated NNET
algorithm yielded a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 76.9% for
correctly identifying patients at risk of CSPEB.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Morphological characteristics of blood vessels in
post-EMR defects can be used to predict delayed bleeding following colonic
EMR. Future applications may include real-time computerized image analysis
of blood vessels, which may assist in clinical decision-making regarding
high-risk patients. <table-wrap id="table53-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table53-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table53"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Independent morphometric variables:</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Variable description</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Multivariate means- Control group</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Multivariate means- CSPEB group</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">P value</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Endoscopic findings for patients with Ulcerative
Colitis (UC) are important to evaluate the extent and severity of the
disease, as well as to determine the management of UC. However, since
endoscopic diagnosis is an observer-dependent method, a certain period of
training time is necessary for endoscopists to acquire sufficient ability to
accurately evaluate the inflammatory disease activity. Inter-observer
variability is known to exist in endoscopic diagnosis. An image recognition
system with artificial intelligence (AI) has great potential to support
physicians' clinical practices by providing objective and specialist-level
diagnoses in the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy (1), including in the
diagnosis of UC.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> In this study, we constructed a
computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) system with a convolutional neural network
(CNN) and evaluated its performance with a large dataset of endoscopic
images from UC patients.</p>
<p>A retrospective review was performed of patients with UC who underwent
colonoscopy at a single center in Japan from October 2006 to June 2017. A
CNN-based CAD system, constructed based on GoogLeNet architecture, was
trained with 26,304 colonoscopy images from 841 UC patients that were tagged
with both anatomical locations and Mayo endoscopic scores (Mayo 0, Mayo 1,
and Mayo 2-3). The performance of the CNN to identify mucosal healing state
(Mayo endoscopic score 0 or 1) was evaluated in an independent test set of
4,589 images from 117 UC patients by using receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves and calculating the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curves (AUROCs). Additionally, AUROCs in each location of the
colorectum (right-sided colon, left-sided colon, and rectum) were
evaluated.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 4,589 images, 65% (1237 of 1890 images) of the
Mayo 0 images, 56% (1295 of 2293 images) of the Mayo 1 images, and 51% (206
of 406 images) of the Mayo 2-3 images were correctly classified as each
class of Mayo scores by the CNN-based CAD system. ROC curves of the
CNN-based CAD system showed high performance with an AUROC value of 0.95 to
identify Mayo endoscopic score 0 or 1 vs. 2 or 3. The performance of the CNN
was better in right-sided colon and left sided-colon than in rectum
(AUROC = 0.96, 0.97, and 0.88, respectively).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The CNN-based CAD system showed robust performance in
identifying endoscopic inflammation severity in patients with UC,
highlighting its capacity to support immature endoscopists and reduce
inter-observer variability.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Exogenous infusion of glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1) triggers appetite responses and can affect brain activity in areas
involved in the regulation of appetite, including hypothalamic and
reward-related brain regions. In contrast, the physiological role of
endogenous GLP-1 in the central regulation of appetite has hardly been
investigated.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The study was performed as randomized,
cross-over trial. 12 healthy lean male subjects received an intragastric
glucose (ig-gluc) load with or without intravenous (iv) exendin9-39 (ex9-39;
specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist). Functional magnetic resonance imaging
was used to investigate the effect of endogenous GLP-1 on resting state
functional connectivity (rsFC) between homeostatic and reward-related brain
regions. Visual analogue scales were used to rate appetite-related
sensations. Blood samples were collected for insulin and glucose
measurements.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The main findings can be summarized as follow: i) after
iv-ex9-39/ig-gluc a significantly higher rsFC was found relative to ig-gluc
between the hypothalamus and the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as
well as the left amygdala (p≤0.001, respectively); ii) after
iv-ex9-39/ig-gluc a significantly higher rsFC was found relative to ig-gluc
between the right nucleus accumbens and the right lateral OFC
(p &lt; 0.001); iii) after iv-ex9-39/ig-gluc a significantly lower rsFC was
found relative to ig-gluc between the midbrain (VTA) and the right caudate
nucleus (p = 0.001); iv) ig-gluc significantly decreased prospective food
consumption and increased fullness sensations compared to the pre-infusion
baseline (p = 0.028 and p = 0.019, respectively), these effects were not
present in the iv-ex9-39/ig-gluc condition v) after iv-ex9-39/ig-gluc an
attenuated increase in plasma insulin concentrations was found relative to
ig-gluc (p = 0.012).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In conclusion, this trial in healthy lean individuals
indicates that glucose-induced endogenous GLP-1 release affects central
regulation of appetite by modulating rsFC in homeostatic and reward-related
brain regions in a GLP-1 receptor-mediated fashion.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Morbid obesity is a worldwide major health problem
that carries enormous socio-economic costs and a high incidence of
comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and
dyslipidemia<sup>1</sup>. Bariatric surgery is the only proven
effective treatment; however, treatment rates remain low, because of poor
patient acceptance, high costs, and non-negligible risks of complications.
Any alternative treatment that could cure, control or even improve the
morbidity of obesity and related diseases would have a tremendous medical,
social and economic impact. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is an
incisionless procedure suitable for widespread clinical adoptionshown to be
effective to induce weight loss up to 24 months in moderately obese
patients<sup>2</sup>. Currently, few data are available concerning the
effects of ESG on comorbidities related to morbid obesity<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact
of ESG on comorbidities due to morbid obesity (diabetes, hypertension,
gastro-esophageal reflux, sleep apnea) at 6 months follow-up.</p>
<p>Between October 2016 and April 2018, 92 patients underwent ESG in 2 expert
centers.</p>
<p>ESG was performed by the application of 4 to 6 full-thickness sutures using the
OverStitch suturing platform. Patients mean % of excess weight loss (%EWL),
clinical outcomes and medication use were assessed. Quality of life (QOL)
was evaluated with the GIQLI and the BAROS questionnaires.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 24 patients (26%) had a mean follow-up of at least 6
months and 15 (62.5%) presented at least 1 comorbid condition at inclusion.
At 6 months %EWL was 29.95 ± 20.26 and 13 patients (86.6%), reduced (60%) or
suspended (53.3%) pre-operative medications (p &lt; 0.001) (Table 1.). No
correlation was found between weight loss and improvement or suspension of
medications with the exception of diabetic patients in whom a greater weight
loss resulted in a reduction of oral antidiabetics or insulin use (Pearson
0.746, p = 0.04; Spearman 0.737, p = 0.03).</p>
<p>Mean GIQLI score improved from 105.4 ± 17.2 (p = 0.06) to 113.4 ± 16.84 and
mean BAROS score from 0.9 ± 0.9 to 1.3 ± 1 (p = 0.13).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> ESG is a safe and effective bariatric endoscopic
procedure that resulted in a positive impact onboth metabolic diseases and
quality of life. Thus, ESG could provide a unique opportunity to reach a
greater number of obese patients, earlier in their disease or at a younger
age presenting with metabolic comorbid conditions. Larger studies are needed
to confirm these preliminary encouraging results.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Obesity is a complex, chronic medical condition with
a major negative impact on human health including type-2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM), hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The objective of the
current study was to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of an
orally taken biodegradable device (Epitomee Device, Epitomee Medical,
Caesarea, Israel) for induction of weight loss, and improvement of glycemic
control and blood pressure levels in high-risk patients. The technology is
based on absorbent pharmaceuticals polymers and bonding materials that
self-expand in the stomach to create a pH sensitive super absorbent scaffold
that stimulates gastric mechanoreceptors and activates early satiety
signaling.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This was a prospective, 12-week twice daily use
of the encapsulated device in patients with BMI of 27-40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>
and controlled hypertension and/or dyslipidemia conducted at the Assaf
Harofeh Medical Center from June 2014 through August 2017. Life
interventional program, hypocaloric diet and increased physical activity
were instructed. Weight, vital signs, laboratory tests and post treatment
endoscopies were performed. Efficacy endpoints were the percent change in
total body loss (TBL) and proportion of participants with at least 5% TBL at
week 12 as well as changes in cardio-metabolic markers. Safety assessments
included evaluation of treatment-associated adverse events, vital signs,
laboratory and endoscopic findings.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 52 subjects completed 12 weeks of treatment with a
clinically significant mean percentage TBL of 4.52 ± 2.97% (p &lt; 0.001)
and mean excess weight loss of 21.86 ± 16.15% (p &lt; 0.001). Of these, 42%
achieved significant weight loss of more than 5% TBL and approximately third
reduced their baseline weight more than 8%. Average patients' BMI declined
from 33 to 31 and waist circumference reduced by -4.41 ± 3.34 cm
(p &lt; 0.001). In hyperlipidemic (n = 9) or pre-diabetic patients (fasting
glucose &gt;100; n = 12) there was significant improvement in triglycerides
(254.11 ± 57.43 vs. 161.78 ± 46.60) (p = 0.0076) and fasting glucose
(104.92 ± 3.26 vs. 99.20 ± 7.73), (p = 0.04), respectively. 80% of
hypertensive patients became normalized at week 12 with an average systolic
BP reduced from 147 to 126 mmHg and diastolic BP improved from 96 to 74 mmHg
(p &lt; 0.02). In 50% or prediabetic patients, fasting glucose was reduced
from 104.0 ± 3.2 to 92.8 ± 7 (small sample size to calculate p value) and in
44% of the prediabetic patients with HbA1C%&gt;5.7 (n = 9), HbA1C% was
reduced from 6.03 ± 0.21 to 5.60 ± 0.21 (small sample size to calculate p
value) There was no device related serious adverse event (AE). All device
related AEs were mild and transient and most were headache, bloating,
nausea, constipation. Endoscopy in 26 enrolled subjects, 12 weeks after the
device ingestion, revealed mild non-clinical gastritis/duodenitis without
erosions in very few patients (n = 5).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> 12 weeks of treatment with the orally taken
biodegradable Epitomee Device resulted in meaningful weight loss,
accompanied by improvement in several cardio-metabolic parameters including
waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting glucose levels and blood
pressure. The novel device was well tolerated and has a favorable safety
profile without related SAE. Long-term randomized controlled trials are in
progress.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The clinical management of <italic>Helicobacter
Pylori</italic> (HP) infection in obese patients is complicated due to
the lower eradication rates with standard therapeutic therapy. Body Mass
Index (BMI) is an independent risk factor. Although the cause of this poor
eradication remain to be elucidated, the physiological changes that obesity
produce may lead to sub-therapeutic antibiotics concentrations and the
current paradigm “one dose fits all” may be changed. The impact of these
changes depends upon patient characteristics (degree obesity, underlying
organ function) and the chemical properties of the antibiotic (hydrophilic
or lipophilic). For most drugs, the interaction between drug
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and BMI is complex and there is a lack of
consensus formula that should be used for dosage calculation.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To evaluate the HP eradication of a tailored
Quadruple Concomitant regimen based on body weight compared to standard
Quadruple Concomitant therapy in obese patients undergoing bariatric
surgery.</p>
<p>This prospective, open-label study included 104 obese patients undergoing
bariatric surgery. Upper endoscopy and HP assessment by histology was
performed at baseline and the post-treatment status was assessed by C13 Urea
Breath Test, 6-8 weeks after the end of therapy. All patients were treated
14 days with a Quadruple Concomitant therapy with a proton pump inhibitor,
amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole. 51 obese patients received a
tailored regimen based on the body weight. Lipophilic antibiotics
(metronidazole and clarithromycin) were adjusted according with the Total
Body Weight until their maximal doses. Amoxicilin (hydrophilic drug) was
adjusted with the Adjusted Body Weight (Ideal Body Weight according to the
modified Devine formula and a weight correction factor of 0.3) until their
maximal dose. Simultaneously, 53 obese patients, received the standard
Quadruple Concomitant therapy with a proton pump inhibitor BID,
clarithromycin 500 mg BID, amoxicillin 1000 mg BID and metronidazole 500 mg
BID.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Per-protocol and intention-to-treat eradication after the
tailored body weight regimen were 90% (95% CI 77-96) and 86% (95% CI 73-93)
whereas in the standard treatment obese group were 67% per-protocol (95% CI
53-78) and 66% (95% CI 52-77) by intention to treat. HP eradication in obese
patients with the tailored body weight regimen were significantly higher
than the control obese group. p&lt; 0.001 Per-protocol and p &lt; 0.05
Intention-to-treat. The distribution of age, gender, smoking and diabetes
did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. 3 patients discontinued
the treatment due to adverse events</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A tailored Quadruple Concomitant regimen based on body
weight in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery is significantly more
effective than than standard Quadruple Concomitant therapy. A tailored
eradication treatment with the antibiotics adjusted according to the body
weight could be considered as a new strategy for obese patients.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The global population of elderly (&gt;65 years) is
increasing and will have a major impact on health-care systems (1, 2) due to
an increased incidence of age-related diseases. Gastrointestinal (GI)
symptoms are common among the elderly and approximately 60% are estimated to
be affected (3, 4). The elevated pharmaceutical load in elderly is of
potential harm to the intestine and it is known that long-term use of
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), commonly used for pain
management among elderly, can cause gastric ulceration, enteropathy (5, 6)
and increased intestinal permeability (7). A deteriorated barrier function
is associated with increased psychological distress in elderly with GI
symptoms (8), and many diseases of inflammatory character such as
inflammatory bowel disease (9). We have previously shown that specific
dietary fibres attenuate stress-induced hyperpermeability <italic>ex
vivo</italic> in ileal tissues from patients with Crohn's disease (9).
However, the potential of dietary fibres to strengthen the intestinal
barrier function <italic>in vivo</italic> in elderly individuals is, to our
knowledge, not known.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We performed a placebo-controlled parallel
clinical trial to investigate whether 6 weeks of oral supplementation of
wheat-endosperm derived arabinoxylan or oat β-glucan could strengthen the
intestinal barrier function of elderly individuals and reduce indomethacin
(NSAID)-induced gut permeability. Furthermore, inflammatory/oxidative status
and self-reported health was evaluated after dietary fibre intervention.</p>
<p>All qualified subjects (n = 49) participated in a 3-arm study design. Each arm
consisted of 6 weeks of intervention with arabinoxylan, oat β-glucan or
placebo (maltodextrin). Primary outcome was set to changes in
indomethacin-induced intestinal permeability before and after intervention
as assessed by an <italic>in vivo</italic> multi sugar test. Secondary
outcomes were set to changes in: systemic inflammatory/oxidative status and
self-reported health. Blood was collected during the beginning and end of
the study. Dietary intake was estimated using a food frequency questionnaire
(FFQ).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Indomethacin was found to significantly increase
gastroduodenal and small intestinal permeability in all 3 intervention arms
while colonic permeability was significantly increased in one of the
intervention arms. No significant effects on the primary parameters
(intestinal permeability) or secondary parameters (inflammatory/oxidative
levels in blood plasma and self-reported health) were observed after
intervention with either dietary fibre, compared to placebo. Intervention
with arabinoxylan demonstrated a significant decrease in symptoms of
diarrhoea within the intervention arm after stratification for GI symptoms,
however these results did not reach significance when compared to placebo.
FFQ analysis revealed that 85% of all 49 elderly participants had an
insufficient fibre intake, accounting only for a median of 64.6% (IQR
50.6–83.8%) of the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our data show that supplementation of arabinoxylan or
oat β-glucan was not able to attenuate indomethacin-induced intestinal
permeability. However, our results also show that dietary fibre intake among
elderly was below the NNR levels. This emphasises the importance to further
investigate the effect of dietary fibres on gut health and barrier function
in elderly for the development of appropriate dietary guidelines regarding
supplementation of dietary fibres.</p>
<p><bold>Disclosure:</bold> The EU 7th framework programme FibeBiotics financed
this study. Bioactor (Netherlands) and Swedish Oat Fiber (Sweden) provided
the study supplement arabinoxylan and oat β-glucan, respectively, but had no
involvement in the design, analysis or interpretation of the results in this
study.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Percutaneous transesophageal gastrotubing (PTEG) was
developed as an alternative route to access the gastrointestinal tract for
the patients that Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy was contraindicated
with conditions such as prior gastrectomy, gastric anterior wall
malignancies, or massive ascites. PTEG will be an ideal method for tube
feeding and decompression.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study is to evaluate the
clinical usefulness of PTEG for the patients who need tube feeding or
decompression from gastrointestinal tract. A rupture-free balloon (RFB)
catheter is inserted into the upper esophagus. Percutaneous balloon puncture
with a specialized needle is then performed from the left side of patient's
neck under ultrasonographic control. A guide wire is inserted through the
needle into the RFB, followed by a dilator and sheath. A placement tube is
then inserted through the sheath, and the sheath is removed. Double Balloons
equipped over tube type RFB were used instead of primary RFB in 25 cases
that the puncture needle is punctured into the over tube trough the balloon.
We perform PTEG in a total of 172 patients (109 men and 63 women, mean age
71.2 years) in whom PEG was not feasible. PTEG was performed for nutrition
in 97 patients and for decompression in 75.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Satisfactory results were achieved in all 172 patients.
Median follow-up was 305.0 days in those who received nutrition and 66.0
days in patients who received decompression. All patients were free from
nasal tube prior insertion. 6 of 97 patients for nutrition were able to be
freed from tube feeding due to PTEG tube feeding support, oral ingestion
could be achieved in 44.0% and home care could achieved in 66.0% of
decompression group patients. Major complications were bleeding in 2
patients required blood transfusion and 1 patient had tracheal penetration,
which was managed conservatively. Other complications were minor oozing
bleeding in 12 patients that did not require blood transfusion, subcutaneous
emphysema in 2 patients, which were managed conservatively. No patient
required surgical treatment or died after PTEG.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PTEG is safe and useful for long-term nutrition and/or
decompression for the patient who is contraindicated to PEG. PTEG is an only
procedure to be free from a nasal tube especially for the patients with
carcinomatous peritonitis. PTEG is a suitable procedure of the patients
having an eating disorder and/or the malignant disease as tubal feeding and
palliative care.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR) has a major role in pancreatic ductal secretion and its
genetic defects damage the pancreas. It is known that intracellular
Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is disturbed in bronchial epithelial cells
in cystic fibrosis (CF), but the connection of CFTR and the intracellular
Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has never been suggested in pancreatic
damage in CF before.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Our aim was to characterize the Ca<sup>2+</sup>
homeostasis of CFTR-deficient PDEC.</p>
<p>Wild type (WT) and CFTR knockout (KO) mouse pancreatic ductal (PDEC) and acinar
cells (PAC), human CF pancreatic cell line (CFPAC-1) and human pancreatic
organoids generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSC) of controls
and CF patients were used in the study. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>
levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>) and mitochondrial
morphology was assessed using fluorescent probes and transmission electron
microscopy, respectively. Immunofluorescent staining and quantitative PCR
measurements were performed to detect changes of protein expressions.
Protein ligation assay (PLA) was performed to detect contact between
proteins.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The plateau phase of the agonist-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>
signal was significantly elevated in CFTR KO PDEC caused by decreased
function of the plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup>pump (PMCA). Functional
inhibition of CFTR had no effect on the PMCA activity. Whereas native
CFPAC-1 cells, CF human organoids and murine PDEC treated with siCFTR showed
similarly impaired PMCA activity. On the other hand, different strategies to
restore the CFTR expression, such as Sendai virus mediated gene delivery in
CFPAC-1, or VX-809 treatment of CF organoids completely restored PMCA
function. As a downstream consequence, sustained
[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation decreased ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> and
released cytochrome c in CFTR KO PDEC without significant alteration of
mitochondrial morphology. Immunostaining revealed the colocalisation of
PMCA4 and CFTR on the apical membrane of polarized, primary PDEC and PLA
confirmed the intimate proximity of the proteins. Calmodulin, a possible
link among CFTR and other proteins, showed plasma membrane localization in
WT PDEC, which was shifted to the cytosol of CFTR KO cells.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Impaired expression of the CFTR leads to disturbed
Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and mitochondrial damage in primary PDEC
due to the decreased activity of PMCA. These changes can contribute to the
pancreatic damage seen in cystic fibrosis.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Acute pancreatitis is a complex gastro-intestinal
disorder with severe complications in around 20-30% of the patients.
Intestinal micro-organisms, collectively called the gut microbiome, are
thought to drive the key processes in pancreatitis disease progression, such
as bacterial translocation and increased systematic immune response. A
western, high-fat (HF) diet and antibiotics are known to cause alterations
in the microbiome composition and function. We hypothesize that severe
dysregulation of the gut microbiome attenuates severity and drives mortality
in experimental necrotizing pancreatitis.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of the experiment was to demonstrate the
role of the microbiome in an experimental mouse model of necrotizing
pancreatitis. Pancreatitis was induced by retrograde infusion of 4% sodium
taurocholate in the pancreatic duct of 12 week old C57BL/6 mice.<sup>1</sup>
Serum amylase was measured to confirm induction of pancreatitis. A group of
mice received 2 doses of meropenem (i.p. 100 mg/kg b.w.) prior to the
procedure. Other mice were additionally fed a diet for 3 weeks that
contained 60% poly unsaturated fatty acids (HF/antibiotic group). Control
groups of mice were fed a normal diet (chow) and underwent either sodium
taurocholate or saline infusion (sham group). The surviving mice were
sacrificed 48 hours after the procedure and blood and tissues were
collected. Severity of pancreatitis was evaluated by morbidity score (rated
1 to 5) and histology severity score of pancreatic tissue. Bacterial
dissemination was determined by blood culture on selective CNA and MacConkey
media plates.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Preliminary results show that all mice that were treated
with 4% sodium taurocholate developed severe necrotizing pancreatitis, with
mean serum amylase levels of 50,865 U/l after 24 hours. The sham-operated
group showed only slight hyperamylasemia (mean 3,915 U/l) and mild
pancreatic oedema. Mortality was increased in mice that received HF-diet and
meropenem (60%, 3 out of 5) or meropenem alone (29%, 5 out of 17) as
compared to the chow group, with average morbidity scores of respectively 4,
3 and 2. There was no mortality amongst the chow or sham group. Histology
severity scores of the pancreas were increased in the HF/antibiotic and
antibiotic alone groups. Blood cultures showed grow of mainly gram positive
bacteria (CNA media). Bacterial load in blood was increased in the meropenem
group (1.6×10<sup>6</sup> CFU/ml) as compared to the chow group
(3×10<sup>3</sup> CFU/ml). No bacterial growth was observed in the
sham group.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We are showing that exposure to factors that are known
to cause dysregulation of the intestinal microbiota, such as broad-spectrum
antibiotics and western diet, induces early mortality in experimental
pancreatitis. Although preliminary, the data suggests that increased
gut-derived bacterial dissemination is the main driver of mortality in this
model. Validation through additional experiments has to confirm this and
explain the underlying mechanisms. This novel model of microbiome-driven
mortality in acute pancreatitis may enable us to investigate novel treatment
approaches such as fecal microbiota transplantation.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of several
disease pathogenesis including acute pancreatitis (AP). Our previous results
suggest that mitochondrial damage is crucial in bile acid induced inhibition
of pancreatic ductal HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> secretion, however the
details of mitochondrial function and dysfunction in pancreatic ductal
epithalial cells (PDEC) is not known yet. Cyclophilin D (Cyp D) has a
crucial role in the opening of the mitochondrial transition pore (mPTP)
which could be a target to avoid mitochondrial Ca<sup>2 +</sup> overload and
cell death.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of our study was to study the effect of
the genetic inhibiton of Cyp D in the pancreatic ductal epithelial
cells.</p>
<p>Wild type (WT) and Cyp D knock out (KO) mouse pancreatic ducts were isolated by
microdissection. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ<sub>m</sub>) was
measured by confocal microscopy and pancreatic ductal
HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> secretion by microfluorometry.
Functionally active mitochondria in the pancreatic ducts were detected by
immunofluorescence microscopy using TOMM20 mitochondrial marker.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The genetic knock out of cyclophilin D significantly
reduced the loss of Δψ<sub>m</sub> and protected pancreatic ductal
HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> secretion during the administration of
500µM chenodeoxycholic acid or 100mM ethanol (EtOH) and 200µM palnitoleic
acid (PA) treatment. Immunfluorescence meaurements revealed a significant
difference in the amount of the newly synthetized mitochondrial preproteins
between the CDC and the EtOH+PA treated WT and Cyp D KO groups.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results suggest that mitochondrial function has a
central role in the function of PDEC presumably by providing ATP for fluid
and ion secretion. On the other hand the opening of MPTP seems to be crucial
in the bile acid induced toxicity offering a potential therapeutic target in
AP.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Abdominal pain is the most unpleasant and the most
frequent symptom in human chronic pancreatitis (CP). In the presen study, we
aimed to perform a detailed analysis of the neuropeptide content of
intrapancreatic nerves in human CP and at identifying novel
analgesic-therapeutic targets.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Intrapancreatic nerves in human CP (n = 23),
pancreatic cancer (n = 19) and normal human pancreas (NP, n = 10) specimens
were immunohistochemically stained against the nociceptive neuropeptides
substance P (SP), calcitonin-gene-related-peptide (CGRP), vasoactive
intestinal peptide (VIP), and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). The
proportion of nerve fibers that contain these neuropeptides was quatified
for each nerve and compared between these three entities. Mouse dorsal root
ganglia (DRG) neurons were treated with tissue extracts from human CP-, PCa-
und NP-specimens, and the sprouting of neurites that contain these
neuropeptides was compared. Specific inhibitors were applied to genetically
engineered mouse models of PCa (e.g. KPC and KC mice), of CP
(Ptf1a-Cre;Atg5lox/lox mice), and to mice with cerulein-induced CP, and
their pain-associated behavior was compared.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Human CP and NP specimens contained comparable amounts,
and PCa specimens rather lowered amounts of intra-neural SP, CGRP, VIP and
nNOS. However, CP patients with increasing pain severity exhibited higher
amounts of nNOS in their pancreatic nerves. Treatment of mouse DRG neurons
with CP tissue extracts led to specific enrichment of nNOS-containing
neurites ex vivo. The density of nNOS-containing neurites was enhanced upon
neutralization of brain-derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the human CP
extracts, and accordingly also in BDNF-knockout mice. Administration of the
specific nNOS inhibitor NPLA ameliorated the abdominal mechanosensitivity of
mice with the painful cerulein-induced CP. However, KPC mice or
Ptf1a-Cre;Atg5lox/lox mice with rather painless CP did not show any change
in their abdominal mechanosensitiviy upon NPLA treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Inhibiting nNOS via specific agents may represent a
novel mode of analgesic therapy for pain due to CP, which needs to be tested
in clinical studies.</p>

at the 2018 meeting of the European Pancreatic Club.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Pancreatic cancer (PCa) exhibits an unparalled
degree of neural invasion and neurogenesis. In our recent analyses, we could
show that neurogenesis and neural invasion in PCa correlate with
angiogenesis. Pericytes are perivascular cells that critically regulate
vessel permeability and metastasis in cancer. Here, we dissected the
potential role of pericytes in PCa-associated neurogenesis.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The proportion of pericyte-covered vessel area
(pericyte coverage index) and the proportion of pericyte-covered vessels
(pericyte-covered cells/PCV) was histologically and automatically quantified
in human PCa (n = 39) and normal pancreas (NP, n = 30) sections after
immunostaining with the pericyte markers CD146<sup>+</sup> and
αSMA<sup>+</sup>. Th results were correlated with the nerve and vessel
density, and the rate of neural invasion on each section. In a cross-species
analysis, we compared the pericyte coverage in KPC mice in comparison with
wildtype mice. To investiage the interactions between angiogenesis and
neurogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic>, we developed a 3D heterotypic
co-culture system with mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG), PCa cells and
pericytes, and determined the neurite density of DRG neurons. In a
transcriptomic analysis, we compared the transcription profile of pericytes
that were stimulated with PCa cell supernatants and compared this to
unstimulated pericytes.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In human PCa tissues, PCV and PCI were increased around
CD146<sup>+</sup> microcapillaries when compared to NP
(PCV<sub>PDAC</sub> = 38.8 ± 3.4%, vs. PCV<sub>NP</sub> = 23.4 ± 3.7%,
p = 0.0049; PCI<sub>PDAC</sub> = 19.6 ± 2.2% vs. PCI<sub>NP</sub> = 11.3
 ± 2.3%, p = 0.018). Similarly, PCV &amp; PCI were higher around
macrocapillaries-associated pericytes (αSMA<sup>+</sup>/CD31-stained areas),
when compared to NP. In KrasG12D-based mouse PCa models, there was a very
similar increase in PCV and PCI, especially in the KC, but also in the KPC
model (p = 0.0105). There was no correlation between PCI, PCV and nerve
density or neural invasion. In 3D co-cultures, DRG exhibited enhanced
neurite density upon co-culture with both PCa cells and pericytes.
PCa-cell-stimulated pericytes upregulated the expression of multiple
molecules in metabolic and pro-inflammatory pathways.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Increased pericyte coverage is one of the typical
alterations in the PCa microenvironment. Activated pericytes also seem to
contribute to PCa-associated neurogenesis.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is now accepted
as a new clinical entity of pancreatic disorder that is characterized by
diffuse irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct, lymphoplasmacytic
infiltration with fibrosis, Th-2-balanced inflammation, and high serum
levels of IgG or IgG4. Since the fibroinflammatory process of AIP responds
to immunosuppressants, abnormal immune systems are considered to be involved
in the development of AIP. However, the investigation of the complex
pathogenetic mechanisms underlying this disease remains to be
elucidated.</p>
<p>Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles secreted by myriad of cell
populations into body fluids, playing a pivotal role in cell-to-cell
communications. These vesicles convey nucleic acids, including microRNA, and
proteins derived from the cells which they are secreted to recipient cells.
Exosomes not only maintain immune homeostasis but are also involved in the
pathophysiology of various diseases such as cancer and autoimmunity.
However, it has not been addressed the correlation between disease exosomes
and the pathogenesis in type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). To clarify it,
we performed microRNA (miRNA) screening of serum-derived exosomes in
patients with type 1 AIP.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We comprehensively analyzed the miRNA expression
derived from serum exosomes using microarrays in patients with type 1 AIP
(n = 10) in comparison to that in healthy adults (n = 10). Differences in
signals of higher than 3 times or lower than 1/3 were regarded as represent
significant differences in expression. The expression of miRNAs selected by
microarrays were also analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In analysis of microarrays, the signals of 8 miRNAs
(miR-659-3p, -27a-3p, -99a-5p, -21-5p, -205-5p, -100-5p -29c 3p, and
-125b-1-3p) were higher, and the signals of 2 miRNAs (miR-4252 and -5004-5p)
were lower in patients with type 1 AIP, respectively, than in healthy
adults. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) revealed that exosomal miR-21-5p was significantly upregulated in
patients with type 1 AIP (n = 10) compared with that in healthy adults
(n = 10) (p = 0.04). qRT-PCR analysis also revealed that miR-21-5p
expression was upregulated in patients with type 1 AIP compared with that in
patients with chronic pancreatitis (n = 10); however, this difference was
not significant (p = 0.05).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Alterations in the expression of miRNA contained in
exosomes is considered to play a role in the initiation or modulation of the
pathophysiology of several diseases. The present study suggests that
dampening of gene expression by miR-21 may be involved in the
pathophysiology of type 1 AIP.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> A 74-year-old man had a 2-weeks history of repeated
right lower abdominal pain. Colonoscopy revealed a 10-mm subepithelial
lesion near the appendiceal orifice. The lesion could be pushed by a biopsy
forcep and was found to have a hard consistency. It was well defined and
appeared heterogeneous echotexture in endoscopic ultrasongraphy.
Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a 8×10mm high density mass in
the cecum. Chronic appendicitis caused by appendiceal fecalith obstruction
was suspected.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> After endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy
(ERAT) failed, a endoscopic treatment was still requested by patient.
Therefore, the endoscopic appendiceal fecalith extraction was attempted.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> First, along the marker dots, the anal side mucosa of the
lesion was incised using the flush-knife. Then, a metal clip with dental
floss bited the incised mucosa, and another metal clip was used to fix the
pull line to the opposite side of cecal wall. So, a pulley-like traction
device was structured to expose the subepithelial lays adequately. After the
full-thickness resection of cecum and appendix, a fecalith was exposed in
the appendix lumen and was taken out by a snare soon. After careful
hemostasis, the cecum and appendix defect were closed by metallic clips
partly, and the residual defect was unclosed to form a artificial fistula
(arrow) from appendix to cecum for internal drainage. The patient
experienced no procedure related adverse events.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This novel NOTES technique provides another choice for
management of the subepithelial lesion-like appendiceal fecaliths.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Small bowel diverticula are a rare cause of
gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Their pathogenesis is still unclear and can
be found in up to 1-2% of the general population. Although these lesions are
usually asymptomatic, mid-gut bleeding from diverticula in the jejunum or
ileum could lead to a life-threatening situation, warranting emergency
invasive therapy and often abdominal surgery.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Our aim was to demonstrate the usefulness of the
double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) in the setting of an acute, severe small
bowel diverticular bleed.</p>
<p>A 79-year-old woman with hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus was
referred to our institution with melaena and severe anaemia requiring
urgent, repeat blood transfusions. Bi-directional conventional endoscopy did
not reveal the cause of bleeding. Small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE)
showed multiple diverticula within the jejunum and ileum. Emergency computed
tomography (CT) mesenteric angiography demonstrated a faint ‘blush' at one
of the jejunal lesions.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Once the patient was haemodynamically stable, emergency
anterograde DBE was performed under general anaesthesia (GA) in our main
operating theatres. The enteroscope was inserted into the jejunum,
approximately 1.5 meters post-pylorus. The culprit cause of the bleeding was
identified within a large (5cm orifice) diverticulum, where a large,
adherent, pulsating blood clot was seen. In the first instance, peri-lesion,
quadrantic injection of a total of 20mLs of adrenaline solution (1 in 10,000
dilution) was performed. The clot was then cautiously removed with a long
endoclip to reveal the actively bleeding vessel which was then promptly
clipped. A total of 3 clips were placed for effective haemostasis and a
submucosal tattoo was placed adjacent to the bleeding point for future
reference. The patient remained stable after the procedure and did not
require any further blood transfusion.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> DBE facilitated endotherapy is a precise, safe and
minimally invasive approach to the effective management of severe bleeding
caused by small bowel diverticula.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Incidental duodenal non-ampullary lesions are found
at upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy in 1-5% of cases. Endoscopic
resection of duodenal lesions carries a higher risk of bleeding due to the
rich vascularity and exposure to bile and pancreatic enzymes. The risk of
perforation is also intrinsically increased due to thin nature of the
duodenal wall. In addition, endoscopic resection of fibrotic duodenal
lesions can be extremely challenging (even in expert hands) and carries high
failure and complication rates, often warranting extensive surgical
management. To date, there is no widely accepted optimal management strategy
for duodenal lesions and conservative management with endoscopic
surveillance is frequently adopted. Although at diagnosis, duodenal adenomas
are most often benign, they retain an intrinsic risk of malignant
transformation.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Our aim was to use a novel, combined endoscopic
approach for the management of an otherwise unresectable giant, fibrotic,
circumferential lesion involving the whole duodenal bulb.</p>
<p>A 72-year-old woman with hypertension presented with anaemia and melaena. An
upper GI endoscopy revealed a 7cm circumferential lesion (Paris 0-IIa,
0-IIb) laterally spreading tumour (LST) involving the entire duodenal bulb.
Histolopathological analysis of biopsies taken at another institution, were
in keeping with a tubulovillous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia. Invasion
of the muscularis propria was excluded by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A first resection attempt through a combination of
wide-field endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and saline-immersion
therapeutic endoscopy (SITE) hybrid-EMR techniques allowed only resection of
less that 10% of the lesion, due to severe fibrosis. Delayed bleeding 24
hours post-resection was successfully treated endoscopically. 6 weeks later,
a planned second attempt at endoscopic resection was performed under general
anaesthesia. The lesion was initially injected with adrenaline solution (1
in 10,000 dilution). A combination of the use of a novel, non-thermal,
automated-mechanical-suction-resection system with cold snaring allowed us
to achieve 50% resection of the lesion in less than 2 hours. Mild,
self-limiting, intra-procedural oozing did not require further endotherapy
and no major immediate or delayed adverse events occurred. Completion of the
resection using the same technique is planned to be performed shortly.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
of a resection technique using a novel non-thermal,
automated-mechanical-suction-resection system for a giant duodenal adenoma.
In our opinion, this novel salvage endoscopic technique appears to be a safe
and effective, minimally invasive alternative to major surgery and warrants
further study.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of
the pancreas are potentially malignant intraductal epithelial neoplasms that
are grossly visible and are composed of mucin-producing columnar cells. The
lesions show papillary proliferation, cyst formation, and varying degrees of
cellular atypia [1,2]. IPMNs may involve the main pancreatic duct and/or the
branch ducts, carring a risk of malignancy from 15%-60% [3]. The approach to
the diagnosis of pancreatic cystic neoplasms typically starts with
cross-sectional imaging as abdominal MRI or CT-scan [4]. Endoscopic
ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration aid to confirm a diagnosis or to
assess for malignant features. Pancreatoscopy and intraductal
ultrasonography can lead to the final diagnosis [5]</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We present an interesting case of an IPMN
diagnosis through peroral Santoriniscopy with target biopsies.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A 72 year-old male was admitted due to severe abdominal
pain. The laboratory work-up reveled high levels of bilirubin,
gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase. An abdominal MRI
revealed a suspect IPMN with significant ectasia of both the main and the
branch pancreatic ducts. Endoscopic ultrasound confirmed the suspect of IPMN
showing a significant amount of mucus trough the minor papilla. A peroral
Santoriniscopy using the SpyGlass System (Boston Scientific, Massachusetts,
USA) showed a frond-like projections from the epithelial lining and biopsies
were taken using SpyBite forceps (Boston Scientific, Massachusetts, USA).
Histology of the intraductal biopsies demonstrated severely atypical cells
compatible with the diagnosis of malignancy. The patient was subsequently
referred to the surgical oncology department and underwent a total
pancreatectomy. Final pathology demonstrated an intestinal-type IPMN with
associated invasive colloid carcinoma, rich in mucin. All lymph nodes were
negative for malignancy.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Spyglass pancreatoscopy can allow direct endoscopic
visualization of the pancreatobiliary ducts, and ductal lesions can be
directly biopsied. In our case, the pancreatoscopy, allowed the diagnosis to
be made before progression to invasive cancer and the subsequent
surgery.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Oesophageal duplications, accounts for 15% of all
digestive tract duplications. They are rare congenital malformations,
presenting as cystic, tubular or diverticular, which is the rarest of the
3.</p>
<p>Oesophageal duplications can remain asymptomatic for decades, and clinical
manifestations can occur at any moment.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We present the case of a 24-year-old man with an
oesophageal duplication, who received successful endoscopic treatment.</p>
<p>The young patient, with mental retardation, had a history of dysphagia since
the childhood. Dysphagia worsened recently, and was associated with
regurgitation and abdominal pain. For this reason, he underwent barium
oesophagram and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that showed a
paraesophageal diverticulum, on the right side of the mid oesophagus,
suggestive for diverticular oesophageal duplication.</p>
<p>Open surgery was attempted in another centre, but eventually the diverticulum
was not excised, being the resection considered too dangerous.</p>
<p>The patient was thus referred to our Unit.</p>
<p>Preliminary EGD confirmed the presence of a diverticulum of the middle tract of
the oesophagus, extended for 70 mm, and starting at 35 cm from the upper
incisors. A cap-assisted septotomy was performed, similarly to the treatment
usually deserved to Zenker's diverticulum. The endoscopic procedure was done
with the patient supine, under general anaesthesia with endotracheal
intubation. The septum between the original oesophageal lumen and the
diverticulum was carefully cut with a needle-knife (KD-10Q-11, Olympus,
Japan) and Endo-cut current (VIO 300D, ERBE, Tubingen, Germany).</p>
<p>Occasional bleedings at the site of incision were stopped by using haemostatic
forceps on the visible vessels.</p>
<p>At the end of the procedure, endoscopic clips were placed at the base of
incision, to prevent bleeding and perforation.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Post-operative course was uneventful. A water-soluble
contrast study on first post-operative day confirmed the absence of leakages
or stasis into the diverticulum. Contrast quickly passed through the
oesophagus and the oesophago-gastric junction into the stomach. On second
post-operative day the patient started oral feeding and, 2 days later, he
was discharged.</p>
<p>1 month after the treatment he is in good clinical conditions, having normal
diet, without dysphagia or regurgitation.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> To our knowledge, this is the first report of a
completely endoscopic treatment of diverticular oesophageal duplication. The
procedure was relatively easy and extremely rapid. Recovery after the
operation was very quick, with an early oral feeding. This procedure should
probably be considered as first line therapy of this rare disorder.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Thoracic diverticulae can be categorised according
to their location; 1) mid-oesophageal, 2) epiphrenic.They are thought to
arise either as a result of inflammation or in association with spastic
motility disorders such as achalasia.</p>
<p>Effective endoscopic therapy for thoracic diverticulae is yet to be
described.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This video describes 2 cases of the use of a
novel technique of intraluminal submucosal myotomy (ISM) for patients with
symptomatic epiphrenic diverticulae associated with spastic oesophageal
motility disorders.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> This video describes 2 cases showing the technique of
ISM.</p>
<p>Case: 1–39-year-old female with a 2-year history of worsening dysphagia, chest
and regurgitation of food. After a failed surgical diverticulotomy the
patient was diagnosed with hypertensive peristalsis on manometry. She
initially underwent a POEM procedure with some symptom resolution but
developed dysphagia due to stenosis at the site of the diverticulum. An ISM
was performed. The patient is symptom free at 6 months.</p>
<p>Case 2: 64-year-old female with a 12-month history of chest pain and
regurgitation of food. Manometric assessment confirmed diffuse oesophageal
spasm and was found to have a large diverticulum on endoscopic examination.
She also underwent a POEM procedure initially and subsequently underwent ISM
four weeks later. The patient is symptom free at 4 months.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> ISM is an effective and safe new novel technique for
treatment of epiphrenic diverticulae associated with spastic oesophageal
motility disorders.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Buried bumper syndrome (BBS) is a rare, long-term
complication of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement,
occurring in 2-6% of cases. BBS is thought to occur due to prolonged
compression of the tissue between the external and internal fixators,
leading to ‘burying' of the PEG bumper into the gastric wall. Consequences
of BBS include tube obstruction and more rarely bleeding, abscess formation,
and perforation. Several endoscopic techniques are described for the
management of BBS and these may be complimentary when used in
combination.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> A 32-year-old woman with diabetes, chronic
kidney disease, a history of hypoglycaemic brain injury and gastroparesis,
requiring a venting PEG, presented with abdominal pain. PEG tube obstruction
led to the suspicion of BBS and abdominal computerised tomography confirmed
this.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> At upper gastrointestinal endoscopy under general
anaesthesia, the internal bumper was found to be completely buried by
granulation and fibrotic tissue. A 2.5mm ball-tip, needle-type, irrigation
knife was initially used to partially dissect the overgrown gastric tissue
in order to achieve insertion of a biopsy forceps through the external
aspect of the PEG tube and through the dissected orifice. This maneuver
opened a track in the overgrown tissue for insertion of a sphincterotome
mounted on a guide wire through the external PEG tube. The sphincterotome
was then flexed completely and several radial incisions on the overgrown
tissue were performed using external traction on the sphincterotome.
Finally, a 6mm endoscopic balloon dilator was passed through the scope and
pulled into the PEG tube by the biopsy forceps inserted through the external
end of the tube. The balloon was then fully inflated within the PEG tube and
traction was applied to the balloon and endoscope for release of the buried
bumper and PEG tube remnant from the dissected overgrown tissue into the
stomach. The dissected orifice was then closed using endoscopic clips. The
procedure was performed under antibiotic prophylaxis.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of
a complementary, multimodality endoscopic approach for the effective,
minimally invasive, safe management of BBS.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Biliary drainage of hilary complex malignant
stenosis of the liver, after Whipple surgery is always challenging. We
report a case of biliary drainage with combination of EUS drainage and
bridge technique, associated with percutaneous drainage.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> A 73-year-old man had undergone a
pancreaticoduodenectomy for an ampullary degenerative tumour. He later
developed liver metastases and begun chemotherapy. Finally he suffered from
jaundice because of a recurrence in the biliary digestive anastomosis. A
4-step drainage was carried in our institution. The first one consisted of a
transgastric EUS-guided puncture of the left-side bile duct with a 19-gauge
needle (EchoTip® Ultra 19-A, Cook Medical). Then, the second step was the
insertion of a 0.035–inch guidewire, which was positioned in the right
biliary tree (Segment VII and VIII) crossing the bile bifurcation. After
crossing the hilum with a 6-Fr cystotome (Endo-Flex® company, Voerde,
Germany), and a dilation with a 4-mm balloon, a non-covered self-expandable
metal stent (Wallflex™ Biliary stent, Boston Scientific) placed
communicating the right and left biliary ducts. Finally, the third step was
to perform hepaticogastrostomy, inserting a second stent (GIOBOR™ Biliary
Stent, Taewoong Medical), partially covered, from the left biliary duct, to
the stomach. The fourth step was to carry out a puncture with a Neff needle
because of an absence of lateral liver drainage; a guidewire was, then,
inserted in the bile duct to jejunal limb. This was then replaced by an
Amplatz (after insertion of a catheter) and dilated with a 6-mm biliary
balloon. An 8-mm biliary stent (Zilver® Self-Expending Stent, Cook Medical)
was placed into the jejunal limb. An 8,5-Fr external drain was left in place
for 4 days.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> No biliary complication occurred and the patient could
have chemotherapy again. He died 4 months later due to progression of the
disease.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The bridge technique performed by EUS, associated in
the same session to percutaneous drainage can be an alternative, to drain
complex hilary malignant stenosis.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Biliary cast syndrome (BCS) is an uncommon
complication described in orthotopic liver transplant recipient
characterized by molded intrabiliary black material and secondary biliary
obstruction. Cholangiographic features of BCS are poorly known by
endoscopists and hepatologists.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We describe here a particular presentation of
BCS in which the follow-up gave the diagnosis.</p>
<p>We report a video-illustrated case of a BCS and its endoscopic management.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension and
liver transplantation for hepatocarcinoma with cirrhosis of mixed origin
(Hepatitis C and alcohol) 10 years ago, presented with cholestasis
associated to a 16 mm lesion suspended in the VIII biliary segment. An
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) allowed to extract
lithiasis fragments after biliary sphincterotomy and to brush segment VIII
for cytology sampling, which was negative for cholangiocarcinoma. An
Echoendoscopy (EUS) with Fine needle aspiration (FNA) disclosed inflammatory
tissue with no neoplastic cells. Knowing the negative balance and the
general condition of the patient, decision was made to follow the patient by
magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). A discrete increase in
the size of segment VIII lesions and changes in its characteristics on the
MRCP made 6 months later led to the decision to perform a cholangioscopy to
obtain histological evidence before a possible surgical treatment. The
cholangioscopic picture was in favour of intrahepatic biliary neoplasia
(villous aspect of the mucosa) with upstream intrahepatic black stone.
Several biopsies done under direct visualization was performed and showed
chronic cholangiopathy with no sign of associated malignancy.</p>
<p>Due to all the previous negative results and the good condition of the patient,
the decision was taken not to resect the lesion and to follow him by MRCP
every 6 months.</p>
<p>After 2 years, he developed a septic cholangitis episode and increased
cholestasis. MRCP showed necrotic saccular dilatation of the right
intrahepatic bile duct at the former segment VIII lesion site, associated
with distal migration of material at the choledoco-choledochal anastomosis.
By ERCP, we obtained complete removal of the material which was compatible
with cast in 2 sessions, with temporary plastic stents placement to ensure
optimal biliary drainage in between. The evolution of the patient was
rapidly favorable both clinically and biologically. At 3 months of
follow-up, there was no recurrence of cholangitis or cholestasis.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This case illustrates a rare presentation of tardive
intrahepatic BCS initially mimicking an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 10
years after liver transplantation. The follow-up of the patient gave the
clue, and highlights ERCP management of BCS</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Radiation proctitis (RP) is a complication occurring
in 5% to 20% of patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy (RT). Argon Plasma
Coagulation (APC) is the endoscopic treatment of choice for CRP, as it is
considered to be effective and well-tolerated.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> 3 patients (74, 82 and 60 yrs) with a history of
pelvic neoplasia underwent lower endoscopy that showed presence of
haemorrhagic chronic radiation proctitis (RP). All 3 patients received
treatment with rectal band ligation (RBL). We report 3 cases of patients
with a history of pelvic neoplasia who developed RP following RT, who have
been successfully treated with rectal band ligation (RBL).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The procedures were well tolerated and no pain was
referred during the RBL nor during the following days. 1 patient presented
tenesmus, resolved by conservative treatment with topical drugs. During
follow-up the 3 patients were asymptomatic and not further episodes of
rectorrhagia were reported.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> RBL is effective, safe and fast, and offers an
alternative treatment for radiation proctitis, especially in the case of
extensive disease.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Aspirin (ASA), Ace Inibitors/Sartans (ACEI/ARB) and
Statins (STAT) inhibit tumoral growth in several clinical and preclinical
models, including pancreatic cancer (PDAC). These drugs might, therefore,
slow the progression of PDAC precursor lesions, such as IPMNs, but this has
been poorly investigated.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> to evaluate the possible effect of ASA, ACEI/ARB
and STAT used for cardiovascular prevention on the progression of BD-IPMN in
follow-up (FU).</p>
<p>Multicenter, retrospective study on a cohort of BD-IPMN without indication for
surgery (asymptomatic, no mural nodules, main pancreatic duct (MPD)
diameter &lt; 5 mm, cyst diameter &lt; 4 cm) undergoing radiological follow
up according to current guidelines. Clinical and radiological
characteristics were collected and the possible association between the use
the drugs of interest and progression analyzed. Progression was defined as
dimensional if cyst size increased &gt;2 mm or new cysts appeared and
clinically relevant if changes representing an absolute or relative
indication for surgery appeared. Users and non-users of the drugs of
interest were compared.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> From 878 IPMN patients from a multicenter prospectively
collected database, 517 patients (2002-2017), fulfilled criteria for
inclusion: 58.8% from Karolinska University Hospital, 17.3% from San
Raffaele Scientific Institute and 23.9% from Sant'Andrea Hospital. Mean age
was 65.8 years (64.8–66.8), 37.9% were male; the mean cyst diameter at start
of FU was 17.2 mm (16.5–18.1). 53.6% underwent progression during a mean FU
of 39 months, 50.1% dimensional, 3% clinically relevant progression.</p>
<p>The rate of dimensional (52.2% vs 49.2%; p = 0.5) and of clinically relevant
progression (2.5% vs 4.0%; p = 0.4) were not different among ASA users and
no-users The same outcome was shown for patients treated with STAT, compared
to untreated patients (respectively 47.4% vs 51.5%, p = 0.3; 2.6% vs 3.9%,
p = 0.4), for patients who had been treated with ACE/ARB compared to
patients who hadn't, (52.5% vs 48.9%, p = 0.4; 4.9% vs 2.6%, p = 0.1), and
for patients who had been treated with a combination of the 3 drugs compared
to untreated ones (respectively 47.5% vs 50.4%, p = 0.6; 1.7% vs 3.5%,
p = 0.4).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The use of ASA, ACEI/ARB and STAT is not associated
with statistically significant lower rate of progression in BD-IPMN during
FU. Further analyses for subgroups of patients, cyst features and drugs
dosage or length of use are ongoing.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Neoplastic pancreatic cystic lesions are discovered
with increasing frequency, with the most prevalent being the intraductal
papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). Most IPMNs will never evolve into
malignancy, but because risk stratifying tools are lacking, the majority of
cysts currently undergo redundant lifelong surveillance.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to develop a score chart to identify
IPMN with low risk to progress and fulfill the resection criteria according
to the 2012 international Fukuoka guidelines. We retrospectively reviewed
the prospectively-maintained databases of three international academic
institutions, containing patients with a pancreatic cystic lesion identified
in the period 2003-2013. Patients were included if they had a presumed IPMN
on imaging, without worrisome features or high-risk stigmata at baseline, as
defined by the 2012 international Fukuoka guidelines, and were followed ≥12
months. Fulfilling resection criteria was defined as developing any of the
following: jaundice, an enhancing solid component, main pancreatic duct
≥5 mm, cyst size ≥3 cm, non-enhancing mural nodule, abrupt change in caliber
of pancreatic duct with distal pancreatic atrophy, and cytology suspect or
positive for malignancy.</p>
<p>We developed a multivariable prediction model using Cox-proportional hazard
regression analysis with stepwise backward selection. An internal-external
validation was performed within the subcohort of each of the three
participating centers. The Dutch American Risk stratification Tool (DART-I)
was developed to identify patients with low risk to progress and fulfill the
resection criteria.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 876 patients with presumed IPMN were included
(mean age 66 years, 37% male, 74% Caucasian). After a mean follow-up of 50
months (range 12-157) and a total follow-up of 3,651 person-years, 116
patients progressed to fulfill resection criteria. Age, history of diabetes,
BMI, smoking, cyst size, and cyst multifocality were analyzed as predictors.
The final model included cyst size (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.08–1.15), cyst
multifocality (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.01–2.17), and smoking (1.39, 95% CI
0.96–2.02) and had a moderate discriminative ability. The C-statistics in
the respective subcohorts were 0.691 (Columbia UMC), 0.718 (Mayo Clinic),
and 0.6115 (Erasmus UMC). When using the DART-I, a patient with unifocal
IPMN &lt; 10 mm and without a history of smoking has a predicted 3-year risk
of 1-2% and 5-year risk of 2-5% to progress and fulfill resection criteria.

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), especially when
extensive, <italic>H. pylori</italic>-related and intestinal
metaplasia-associated, is a recognized precursor of gastric cancer. Although
generally distinguished between <italic>H. pylori</italic>- and
autoimmune-induced, the first associated with intestinal gastric cancer (GC)
and the latter also with carcinoid tumors, there is epidemiological evidence
that autoimmunity, with development of anti-parietal cell antibodies (APCA)
may be triggered by <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of the present study was to establish
the incidence of CAG, the frequency of this condition in different age
groups, and to explore the distribution and severity of gastric lesions as
classified according to the Operative link for gastritis assessment (OLGA
system).</p>
<p>Records of all esophago-gastroduodenoscopies performed for all causes at our
Endoscopy unit between January 2015 and January 2018 were retrieved. At our
center, the performance of mucosal biopsies according to the Sydney protocol
(2 samples from the antrum, 1 sample from the incisura angularis, and 2
samples from gastric body), constitutes the standard practice, and since
2015, all cases are uniformly reported using the OLGA system, which grades
the GC risk according to both the topography and the severity of gastric
atrophy. For the purposes of the study, repeat endoscopy, age below 18 years
and previous esophageal or gastric surgery, esophagogastric endomucosal
resection or sub-mucosal dissection were excluded.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 3650 (F = 2133, mean age = 58.5 ± 16.4) were
included in the study. OLGA stages 0, I, II, III, and IV were respectively
found in 69.8%, 21.1%, 6.8 % 2.1%, and 0.2%. In particular, atrophy limited
to the antrum (A1/A2/A3 C0), to the body (A0 C1/C2/C3), or affecting both
antrum and body (all grades of A and C) were 793, 152, and 149,
respectively. Enterochromafin cell hyperplasia, was found in 52/152 and in
31/149 patients with atrophy of the body of both antrum and body,
respectively, while they were absent in patients with antrum atrophy only.
Overall prevalence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection was 16.3%; of 594
patients in whom <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection was documented, 61.6%
had no atrophy, whereas atrophy of the antrum only was significantly more
frequent (29.5%) than mixed body and antrum atrophy as well as atrophy of
the body only (5.6% and 3.4%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). Overall, gastric
cancer was diagnosed in 15/3650 (0.4%) patients, 14 cases of adenocarcinoma
and carcinoid tumor in 1. Tumor cases arose in patients without atrophy,
with atrophy of the antrum only, with atrophy of the body only, and with
mixed antrum and body atrophy in 7 (0.3%), 5 (0.6%), 2 (2.3%), and 1 (0.6%),
respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The overall low prevalence of <italic>H.
pylori</italic> infection observed is in correspondence with a large
group of patients with no atrophy, which probably represents early diagnosis
and eradication of infection in our population, before more advanced stages
of atrophy ensue. Survelliance endoscopy is warranted in more severe stages
of CAG, although gastric cancer in the absence of CAG reflects the
importance of other pathways leading to neoplasm development.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Atrophic gastritis (AG) is associated with gastric
cancer (GC) and type I gastric carcinoid (TIGC). Current European MAPS
guidelines (1), recommend for AG patients with extensive atrophy and/or
intestinal metaplasia endoscopic follow-up every 3-years after diagnosis.
OLGA/OLGIM (operative link on gastric atrophy/metaplasia) assessment was
proposed for staging of gastritis and stratifying neoplastic risk (2,3).
Prospective studies evaluating whether 3-years follow-up interval is
appropriate in terms of early detection of gastric neoplastic lesions are
lacking.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of
gastric neoplastic and preneoplastic lesions and changes of OLGA/OLGIM
scores in AG patients at 3-years endoscopic-histological follow-up.</p>
<p>A total of 80 consecutive, newly diagnosed AG patients (77.5% F, median age
64.5 (29-87) years) followed-up 3 years after diagnosis were included. Each
patient underwent gastroscopy with biopsies (Sydney System) at baseline and
at 3-years follow-up. Among them, 25 (31.1%) were cured from <italic>H.
pylori</italic>. At baseline OLGA scores 0, I, II, III, IV were
observed in 0, 9 (11.3%), 58 (72.5%), 10 (12.5%), 3 (3.7%) patients,
respectively; OLGIM scores 0, I, II, III, IV were observed in 11 (13.8%), 22
(27.5%), 43 (53.7%), 4 (5%), 0 patients, respectively.</p>
<p>Extensive atrophy/intestinal metaplasia was present in 21 (26.3%) patients. At
baseline 7 (8.7%) patients presented polypoid neoplastic lesions, all
removed by snare polypectomy: 3 low-grade dysplasia (LGD) adenomas and 4
TIGC. The number of gastroscopies needed to be performed (NNS) to detect 1
case of gastric neoplastic lesion was expressed as the number of 3-years
surveillance endoscopies by the number of detected neoplastic lesions.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> At 3-years follow-up overall 6 (7.5%) neoplastic lesions
were detected: 2 (2.5%) LGD adenomas in 2 patients, 4 (5%) carcinoids in 4
patients (in 2 of them recurrent), no GC. The NNS was 13.3.</p>
<p>OLGA and OLGIM scores were unchanged, increased and decreased in 58 (72.5%) and
49 (61.2%), 9 (11.3%) and 15 (18.8%), and 13 (16.2%) and 16 (20%) patients,
respectively.</p>
<p>The occurrence of gastric neoplastic lesions in patients with or without
extensive atrophy/intestinal metaplasia was not different (p = 0.943 by
chi-square test). When only the 21 (26.3%) patients with extensive
atrophy/intestinal metaplasia at baseline would have been considered
eligible for surveillance, at 3-years follow-up only 1 LGD adenoma would
have been detected, as the other neoplastic lesions 4 TIGC and the other LGD
adenoma occurred in patients without extensive atrophy/intestinal metaplasia
at baseline.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In AG patients, the 3-years endoscopic surveillance as
proposed by MAPS seems satisfactory to early detect potential gastric
neoplastic lesions. An increase of OLGA/OLGIM scores is observed in a low
proportion of patients (10% and 18%). Extensive atrophy/intestinal
metaplasia as eligibility criteria to offer surveillance in AG patients may
be restrictive.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> We aimed to determine the clinical outcomes of early
gastric cancer (EGC) beyond expanded criteria after endoscopic resection
according to the pathological extent.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> A total of 288 patients with 289 lesions beyond
expanded criteria of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for EGC were
analyzed between 2005 and 2016, and classified into 2 groups according to
additional treatment; observation (n = 175 patients, 175 lesions) and
surgery (n = 113 patients, 114 lesions).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Depth of tumor invasion was deeper, and tumor-positive
vertical margin, lymphatic and venous invasion were more common in the
surgery group compared with the observation group (p &lt; 0.001). Residual,
synchronous and metachronous tumor were more common in the observation
group, but regional lymph node (LN) and distant metastasis did not differ
between the groups. Overall survival (OS) and 5-year disease-specific
survival did not differ between the groups (88.6 vs 93.8%; p = 0.259, 98.2
vs 100%; p = 0.484), but 5-year disease-free survival was lower in the
observation group (73.5 vs 97.9%; p &lt; 0.001). On multivariate analysis,
presence of ulcer, large tumor size, tumor-positive lateral and vertical
margin were risk factors of residual tumor over T2 and lymphatic and venous
invasion were risk factors of regional LN metastasis.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In patients with the pathology beyond expanded
criteria of ESD for EGC with ulcer, large tumor size, tumor-positive lateral
and vertical margin, lymphatic and venous invasion, additional surgical
resection should be considered for the risk of residual tumor or LN
metastasis.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia are
sequential consequences of chronic <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection.
<italic>H. pylori</italic> infection is a well-known risk factor for
gastric adenocarcinoma and MALT lymphoma of the stomach. Atrophic gastritis
and intestinal metaplasia increase the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma
development. The relationship between gastric MALT lymphoma and atrophic
gastritis-intestinal metaplasia has not been on the spot of interest. We
here investigated the clinical characteristics of gastric MALT lymphoma and
co-presence of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Study was conducted by review of the electronic
medical record of patients who were diagnosed with gastric MALT lymphoma at
an academic institute, the Yeouido St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul, Korea, from
January 2001 to Mar 2018. Clinical characteristics and pathologic
backgrounds including <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection positivity,
atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia were investigated.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 47 subjects were enrolled consecutively during
the study period and analyzed retrospectively. The mean age was
57.19–year-old (range 36 ∼ 85). The male to female ratio was 1.19 (25/21).
Endoscopic appearances varied; thirteen subjects presented ulcerative mass
(28.26%), 12 (26.09%) flat atrophic patch of discoloration, 16 (34.78%)
erosive patches, 2 (4.35%) multiple polypoid lesions and 3 (6.52%)
subepithelial tumor-like appearance. <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection
was proved in 82.6 % (38/46). On histologic examination, background atrophic
gastritis-intestinal metaplasia was accompanied by 28.26% (13/46). Serum
pepsinogen I and II, as a serological marker for atrophy, was evaluated in
17 subjects. Only 5 of 17 (29.41%) showed compatible with atrophic gastritis
(pepsinogen I/II ratio of less than 3).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The background mucosa of gastric MALT lymphoma differs
from that of gastric adenocarcinoma in terms of atrophic
gastritis-intestinal metaplasia. Less than 30% of gastric MALT lymphoma
accompanied background atrophic gastritis. Age can be a confounding factor.
We will precede the age-matched comparison between patients with gastric
adenocarcinoma and MALT lymphoma.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Anti-TNFα-antibody therapy is one of the most potent
treatments in Crohn's disease (CD) for active disease as well as in
maintenance therapy, and it might alter the course of disease by preventing
irreversible bowel damage and further associated complications. Therefore,
since its introduction, anti-TNFα-antibodies (TNF-inhibitors) have been used
by gastroenterologists progressively earlier in the course of the
disease.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to assess the effect of early
intervention of TNF-inhibitors in CD patients of the Munich IBD Center on
mucosal healing, clinical remission, development of strictures and need for
surgery as compared to late intervention within an observation period of 2
years. Early intervention was defined as introduction of TNF-inhibitors
within 24 months after first diagnosis of CD and late intervention was
defined as introduction after 24 months. In this retrospective cohort
analysis we included data from 242 patients from 2007 to 2015 who had
received either infliximab (IFX) or adalimumab (ADA) for at least 2 years.
Chi2 and T-tests were used for statistical analysis to assess the rates of
mucosal healing, clinical remission, stricturing disease and need for
resective surgery within 2 years after the introduction of TNF-inhibitors.
Endoscopic findings of the last ileocolonoscopy before and the first
ileocolonoscopy after introduction of TNF-inhibitors provided data on
mucosal healing and strictures. Clinical remission was defined as CDAI score
of less than 150 points.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 90 patients had received early treatment with
TNF-inhibitors and were assigned to the early intervention group: 45.8%
received IFX, 10.7% ADA and 43.5% where switched from IFX to ADA or vice
versa. 152 patients met criteria for the late intervention group: 60.0%
received IFX, 3.8% ADA and 35.7% were switched. Both groups were comparable
to sex, genetic susceptibility (NOD2/CARD15), extraintestinal
manifestations, presence of bowel strictures and disease activity at the
time of introduction. Patients of the early intervention group were younger
at start of TNF-inhibitors (26 vs. 32 years; p = 0.001) and more often
showed upper GI- manifestations (23% vs. 5%; p &lt; 0.001). The early
intervention group had received less corticosteroids (p = 0.014), 5-ASA
(p &lt; 0.001), azathioprine (p &lt; 0.001) and methotrexate
(p = 0.057).</p>
<p>Within an observation period of 2 years, patients of the early intervention
group not only achieved higher mucosal healing rates than patients of the
late intervention group (47.5% vs. 25.0%; p = 0.005), they also developed
significantly less bowel strictures (10.2% vs. 28.4%; p = 0.008). The
combination of absence of mucosal healing and presence of strictures was
found significantly more often in the late intervention group (79.5% vs.
53.3%; p = 0.001).</p>
<p>Clinical remission rates 24 months after the introduction of TNF-inhibitors did
not differ between the 2 groups. (89.4% vs. 87.9%, p = 0.737).</p>
<p>Within 2 years after introduction, less patients in the early intervention
group underwent surgery, however the difference was not significant (17.8%
vs. 26.9%, n = 16 vs. n = 41, p = 0,103), possibly due to the small size of
the group and the short observation period of only 2 years.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In Crohn's disease, early introduction of
TNF-inhibitors within 2 years after diagnosis is associated with higher
rates of mucosal healing and lower rates of complications such as bowel
strictures when compared to late intervention. It may also reduce the risk
of the need for surgery. We conclude that anti-TNFα-antibody therapy could
alter the course of disease and prevent irreversible bowel damage.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk is increased in those
with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Guidelines advocate surveillance
colonoscopy for patients with longstanding IBD. Post-colonoscopy colorectal
cancer (PCCRC) is a key quality indicator of colonoscopy. There is limited
data exploring the rate of PCCRC in those with IBD and potential risk
factors associated with IBD-related PCCRC.</p>
<p>This study explored national and individual hospital rates of IBD-related PCCRC
in England since 2006. Further analysis explored potential associations with
IBD-related PCCRC in order to inform future quality improvement
interventions.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We identified all those who had undergone a
colonoscopy between 1/1/2006 and 31/12/2012 and developed a CRC before
31/12/2015 using linked national Hospital Episode Statistics and National
Cancer Registration and Analysis Service data. IBD cases were identified by
relevant ICD-10 codes. Using international consensus
guidelines.<sup>1,2</sup> The rate of PCCRC within 3 years (PCCRC-3yr)
was calculated as the number of false negative colonoscopies (within 6-36
months of CRC) divided by the sum of the true positive (within 6 months of
CRC) and false negative colonoscopies. The IBD-associated PCCRC-3yr rate in
each NHS hospital trust in England was ranked and trusts were separated into
quintiles. Factors associated with IBD-related PCCRC were investigated.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Between 2006 and 2012 we identified 7781 PCCRC, 800 (10%)
with a diagnosis of IBD. Nationally, the IBD-PCCRC-3yr rate was 35%, and
varied between hospital trusts with those in the lowest quintile having a
mean, unadjusted rate of 19% (SD +/- 7%) compared to 52% (SD +/- 7%) in the
highest quintile. PCCRC cases were younger at diagnosis (60yrs compared to
66yrs), were less likely to have diverticular disease (10% compared to 16%),
and had undergone more previous colonoscopies when compared to detected
cases (within 6 months of colonoscopy). There was no significant difference
for sex, bowel location, deprivation score, or metachronous tumours.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PCCRC-3yr in those with IBD is high, and accounted for
10% of all PCCRC-3yr in England between 2006 and 2012. There is a wide
variation in the unadjusted rates between NHS trusts in England that is
unlikely to be explained by natural variation. There is an urgent need to
investigate avoidable reasons for cancers in those with IBD to optimise
surveillance and prevention of CRC in IBD.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Histological healing may be the ultimate therapeutic
goal in ulcerative colitis (UC). Higher vedolizumab trough levels during
induction treatment have been associated with better outcomes in UC
patients. The association between vedolizumab trough levels and histological
healing during maintenance therapy in UC is unknown.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> In this single-center, retrospective cohort
study, we aimed to investigate the association between vedolizumab trough
levels and histological healing during maintenance therapy in UC, and to
identify potential factors associated with histological healing. Between
June 2014 and March 2018, all consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe
UC on vedolizumab maintenance therapy who had a histological evaluation and
underwent therapeutic drug monitoring within 3 months of this evaluation,
were included. Per event analysis was performed. Histological healing was
defined as Nancy histological index ≤ 1. Pathologists were blinded to the
results of the therapeutic drug monitoring.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 35 histological samples from 31 patients (n = 27 with 1
histological sample; n = 4 with 2 histological samples) were analyzed. Mean
(standard deviation) time between histological evaluation and therapeutic
drug monitoring was 11.1 (35.1) days. Histological healing was found in
18/35 (51.4%) of assessments (n = 15 with Nancy histologic index of 0; n = 3
with Nancy histological index of 1). Median (interquartile range) serum
vedolizumab trough levels were higher in the group with histological healing
compared with the group without histological healing (31.5 (25-49.1) µg/mL
vs. 15 (9-26.6) µg/mL; p = 0.02). The higher vedolizumab trough levels were
associated with higher rates of histological healing (p = 0.04; Table 1). A
cut-off vedolizumab trough level of 25 µg/mL predicted histological healing
with a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value and
negative predictive value of 77%, 71%, 74%, 74% and 75%, respectively,
leading to an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.62 (95%
confidence interval 0.58–0.92; p = 0.004). Vedolizumab trough levels higher
than 25 µg/mL were associated with histological healing on bivariate
analysis (odds ratio 8.4; 95% confidence interval 1.8–38.6; p = 0.006).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This is the first study looking at the association
between vedolizumab trough levels and histological healing in UC.
Histological healing rates were significantly greater in patients with the
highest vedolizumab trough levels during maintenance therapy in UC. A
vedolizumab trough level threshold of 25 µg/mL was found most optimal to
predict histological healing. <table-wrap id="table55-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table55-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table55"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Quartile</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Vedolizumab trough level</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Number of samples, n</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Histological healing (Nancy histological index

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Surgical resection is not curative in Crohn's
disease (CD) and recurrence after surgery is a common situation. The
identification of patients at high risk of recurrence remains disappointing
in clinical practice. The impact of residual microscopic disease on margins
on the risk of recurrence after ileocaecal resection is still subject to
debate.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> All patients who underwent ileocaecal resection
between January 1982 and December 2016 were prospectively identified.
Demographic data, clinical, surgical and histological variables were
retrospectively collected. Positive histologic margin was defined by the
presence of acute inflammatory lesions on margins: erosion, ulceration,
chorion infiltration by neutrophils polynuclears, cryptic abscesses or
cryptitis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 125 patients were included, with a median follow-up of 8
years (Interquartile Range (IQR), 4.3–15.2). Half (49.6%, n = 62) were
women, and the median age at surgery was 33 years (24–42). 56 (44.8%) had
positive inflammatory margins. Five years after surgery, respectively 29
(51%) and 23 (34%) patients with positive and negative margins had clinical
recurrence (p = 0.034). At the end of the follow-up, respectively 60%
(n = 34) and 47% (n = 33) patients had clinical recurrence (p = 0.07).
CD-related hospitalizations were observed in respectively 37.5% (n = 21) and
18.8% (n = 13) with positive and negative margins (p = 0.02). 14 patients
(25%) with positive intestinal margins were reoperated at the end of the
follow-up compared to 5 patients (7%) with negative margins (p = 0.04).
Multivariate analysis confirmed that positive intestinal margin was
independently associated with CD-related hospitalization (Odds Ratio (OR),
2.5 (CI95%, 1.1–5.5), p = 0.03) and surgical recurrence (OR, 4 (95% CI,
1.3–12.5), p = 0.01).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Positive histologic margin, as defined by the presence
of erosion, ulceration, chorion infiltration by neutrophils polynuclears,
cryptic abscesses or cryptitis, was associated with an increased risk of
clinical and surgical recurrence after ileocaecal resection for Crohn's
disease.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Scarce information on the effectiveness and safety
of vedolizumab (VDZ) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in clinical
practice is available.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and
safety of VDZ in IBD. Patients of the ENEIDA registry with active IBD that
received VDZ were included. Response was defined based on Harvey-Bradshaw
index (HBI) in Crohn's disease (CD) and Partial Mayo Score (PMS) in
ulcerative colitis (UC). Variables associated with short-term remission
(week 14) were identified by logistic regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier
curves and Cox model were used to evaluate the long-term durability of VDZ
treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 521 patients were included. 93% of them had been exposed
to prior anti-TNF agents. At week 14, 62% had response (47% remission). In
the multivariate analysis, CD (vs UC) [Odds ratio (OR) = 0.3, 95% confidence
interval (95% CI) = 0.3–0.9], higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (mg/dL) at
baseline [OR = 0.9 (95% CI = 0.8–0.9)], previous intestinal resection
[OR = 0.4 (95% CI = 0.3–0.9)] and mild (vs severe) disease at baseline
[OR = 8 (95% CI = 4-16)] were associated with impaired response to VDZ
treatment. 316 patients (62%) had endoscopic assessment at baseline;
endoscopic activity was not predictive factor for clinical remission at week
14. 307 patients (achieving at least response after induction) were included
in the long-term analysis. 79 patients discontinued VDZ (70% loss of
efficacy and 10% partial response) after a median of 13 months;
discontinuation rate was 22% per patient-year. The proportion of patients
remaining on VDZ was 81% at 12 months, 60% at 24 months and 38% at 36
months. To have CD (vs UC) [Hazard ratio (HR) = 1.8 (95%CI = 1.1–3)] and
higher CRP (mg/dL) at week 14 [HR = 1.05 (95%CI = 1.01–1.1)] were predictors
of VDZ discontinuation. 94 patients lost response during follow-up
(incidence rate 37% per patient-year). CD (vs. UC) [HR = 1.9
(95%CI = 1.2–2.9)] and higher CRP (mg/dL) at week 14 [HR = 1.04
(95%CI = 1.008–1.09)] were significantly associated with loss of response.
7% of patients had adverse events after 527 patient-years of exposure,
leading to the treatment discontinuation in 3% of patients (table 1).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Over 60% of IBD patients respond to VDZ treatment,
even in a refractory cohort. A relevant proportion of patients discontinue
the treatment over time, mainly due to loss of response. CD and disease
burden impair both short and long-term response. VDZ seems to be safe in
clinical practice. <table-wrap id="table56-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table56-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table56"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The ability to predict high-risk Crohn's disease
(CD) at diagnosis would enable physicians to intensify treatment earlier and
only in those at risk of severe outcomes, thus limiting the need for
intensification of treatment for patients at low risk. We attempted to
develop a model to detect patients at risk for early surgery, defined as
requiring surgery within 2 years from diagnosis.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> A prospective multicentre inception cohort of
newly diagnosed children with CD was established, with progress followed to
2 years post-diagnosis. Phenotypic characteristics, measures of disease
severity and inflammation, as well as serological markers were measured at
baseline and week 12, and follow-up data were collected at 8, 12, 26, 52,
78, and 104 weeks. Patients undergoing surgery for disease related
complications were recorded. Chi-square automatic interaction detection
(CHAID) algorithm was used to develop a model with predictors for early
surgical complications.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 285 patients had data collected with 31(10.9%)
needing surgery within 2 years. Multivariate analysis identified stricturing
disease at baseline (OR 5.26, 95% CI 2.02–13.67 (p = 0.001)), and Paediatric
Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) &gt;10 (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00–1.07
(p = 0.005)), together with low C-reactive protein (CRP) (OR 0.82, 95% CI
0.70–0.98, (p = 0.025)) at week 12 to be key predictors of the risk for
surgery within 2 years. Achieving clinical remission by week 12 modulated
the risk for surgery even if stricturing disease was present at diagnosis,
while immunomodulators only reduced risk for patients that achieved clinical
remission. In our CHAID model, a patient without stricturing disease, PCDAI
of &lt; 10 at 12 weeks and no immunosuppression therapy has a 0.8% chance of
surgery. In contrast, a patient without stricturing disease, PCDAI of &gt;10
at 12 weeks, and anti-OmpC positive has a 38% risk of surgery at
follow-up.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A risk stratified algorithm using PCDAI at 12 weeks,
OmpC status, behavioural phenotype and use of immunosuppression, can
categorise patients into high and low-risk groups for surgery at follow-up.
This data can be incorporated into management plans that personalise
treatment strategies soon after diagnosis.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Over the last decade neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy
(nCRT), preferably the CROSS regimen (carboplatin/paclitaxel + 41.4 Gy
radiotherapy), has become standard of care for resectable oesophageal cancer
in The Netherlands. About 20% to 50% of the patients achieve a pathological
complete response (pCR) after nCRT. A pCR is associated with improved
survival and the role of surgery is questioned in these patients.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this population-based cohort study
was to investigate factors associated with pCR after nCRT and surgery.</p>
<p>All oesophageal cancer patients treated with nCRT followed by oesophagectomy in
the period 2009-2015 were identified from the Nationwide Netherlands Cancer
Registry. Patients with unknown tumour response were excluded. Pathological
tumour response was categorized as pCR (ypT0N0) and non-pCR (ypT0N+,
ypT1-4N0 and ypT1-4N+). The 3-year survival rates were compared with
log-rank analysis. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models
were used to investigate the association between clinicopathological
variables and pCR. The effect of chemotherapy schedule and radiotherapy dose
on pCR were analysed in a subgroup of patients from whom details on
neoadjuvant treatment were available. Multivariable Cox regression on
overall survival within the group of patients with pCR was performed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 3533 patients were included and 841 patients
(24%) had a pCR (19% in adenocarcinoma and 41% in squamous cell carcinoma).
Patients with pCR had higher 3-year survival rate compared to non-pCR
patients (68% vs. 48%, p &lt; 0.001). In the non-pCR group, ypT1-4N+
patients had the lowest 3-year survival rate, followed by ypT0N+ and
ypT1-4N0 (respectively, 30%, 52% and 60%, p &lt; 0.001). In multivariable
analysis age above 70 years (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0–1.5), squamous cell
histology (OR 3.0, 95% CI 2.6–3.6), cT1-2 (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0–1.5), cN+ (OR
0.74, 95% CI 0.6–0.9) and cNx (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1–0.7) were associated with
higher or lower chance of pCR. In subgroup analysis (N = 668), completion of
the CROSS chemotherapy cycles (complete vs. incomplete, p = 0.86) and
radiotherapy dose (41.4 Gy vs. &gt;41.4 Gy, p = 0.22) were not associated
with pCR. Factors inversely associated with overall survival in patients who
achieved pCR were: age above 70 years (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0–1.7) and less than
10 dissected lymph nodes (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1–1.9).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Pathological tumour response is not only determined by
treatment-related (e.g. number of dissected lymph nodes) factors, but also
by patient-related (e.g. age) and tumour-related (e.g. histology and
clinical stage) factors. Completing recommended chemotherapy and/or
radiotherapy schedules was not related to pCR in our series.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The endoscopic resection of Gastrointestinal
Mesenchymal Tumors (GIMTs) is widely accepted due to its
minimal-invasiveness. However, a major concern for endoscopic resection is
its high rate of positive microscopic margin which was thought to be related
with a higher risk of recurrence. We herein designed this study to examine
the impact of R1 endoscopic resection for prognosis of GIMT, featuring a
large retrospectively maintained endoscopic resection cohort with long
follow up and specimen reevaluation by a single pathologist with expertise
on GIMT.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This study aimed to find out whether the
positive margin affects the recurrence rate of gastric GIMT and the factors
associated with positive margin. The patients with gastric GIMTs were
recruited in the pretrospectively cohort from January 2008 to December 2013.
Indications for endoscopic resection were as follows: (1) GIST or suspected
GIST &gt;2cm in size or &lt; 2cm but with rapid growth or high-risk features
(e.g. nuclear atypia, high mitotic rate, heterogeneous echogenicity); (2)
non-GIST mesenchymal tumors &gt;2-3cm in size, with rapid growth or high
risk features; (3) symptomatic gastric submucosal lesions; (4) undiagnosed
gastric submucosal lesions in young patients for whom the risk of resection
might be outweighed by the benefit of avoiding life-long surveillance of
these lesions (after careful discussion and informed consent). Clinical and
pathological features, endoscopic, and follow-up data were collected and
analyzed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 777 patients were included in the study. All tumors were
removed along pseudocapsule without macroscopic residual (ER0) and the
median tumor size was 15.2 mm (range 3-100 mm). Pathological evaluation
revealed 371(47.7%) gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). The rate of
microscopic R1 resection rate was 47.0% (443/777). On stepwise multivariate
analysis, a significantly increased incidence of R1 resection was recorded
in the GISTs (OR 11.13, 95% CI 3.00–41.37). In the subgroup analysis of
GIST, the univariate analysis revealed that EFTR achieved a higher rate of
R0 resection (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31–1.00) while it was proved insignificant
on stepwise multivariate analysis. Local recurrence occurred in 2 patients
during a mean follow-up time of 34.2 months. The recurrence rate of R0 and
R1 groups was statistically insignificant (p = 0.841).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Endoscopic resection is a feasible option for the
resection of gastric GIMT and has minimal risk of recurrence after a mean
follow-up of 34.2 months. The rate of R1 resection is high but is not
related to a high rate of recurrence compared to R0 resection. The ER0
resection is sufficient for gastric GIMT.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common
cause of cancer-related deaths. Clinical presentation varies with an overlap
with benign colorectal pathologies. Hence the dilemma for the clinician is
to distinguish those with significant versus non-significant pathology
without recourse to invasive and costly investigations.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We undertook a diagnostic accuracy study of CRC
using faecal immunochemical test for haemoglobin (FIT), faecal calprotectin
(FCP) and urinary volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in patients presenting
with lower gastrointestinal symptoms.</p>
<p>In this prospective single-centre cohort study 1016 symptomatic patients with
suspected CRC referred by general practicioners to secondary care were
recruited. A total of 562 patients, who returned stool samples for FIT and
FCP as well as urine samples for urinary VOC measurements and completed
colonic investigations, were included in the final statistical analysis.
Quantitative FIT was performed on automated HM-JACKarc analyser and FCP was
measured using the EliA Calprotectin fluoroimmunoassay on the automated
ThermoFisher ImmunoCap 250 analyser. A commercial gas analysis instrument
(Lonestar Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry (FAIMS), Owlstone
Medical, Cambridge, UK), based on ion mobility spectroscopy (IMS), was
utilised to analyse VOCs emanating from urine samples. Various statistical
parameters were calculated for each clinical group with 95% confidence
intervals (CIs).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The sensitivity and specificity for CRC using FIT were
0.80 (CI: 0.66–0.93) and 0.93 (CI: 0.91–0.95) respectively. The negative
predictive value (NPV) was 0.99 (CI: 0.98–1.0). Using urinary VOCs the
sensitivity and specificity were 0.63 (CI: 0.46–0.79) and 0.63 (CI:
0.59–0.67) respectively and the NPV was 0.96 (CI: 0.94–0.98). However, for
those with FIT negative CRC (false negatives), adding urinary VOCs resulted
in sensitivity of 0.97 (CI: 0.90–1.0) and specificity of 0.72 (CI:
0.68–0.76) with NPV of 1.0 (CI: 0.99–1.0).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Faecal biomarkers are useful in excluding CRC patients
in symptomatic population with NPV of 99% for FIT. The addition of urinary
VOCs shows promise as a second stage test improving FIT performance with NPV
of 100% for CRC. It is envisaged that both these non-invasive tests (FIT and
urinary VOCs) can be requested within primary care and analysed within a
central laboratory at low cost to guide secondary care referral
patterns.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Laterally spreading tumors (LSTs) of the colorectum
are classified into the following four subtypes according to their
morphology ; granular homogeneous type (LST-GH), granular nodular mixed type
(LST-GM), non-granular flat-elevated type (LST-NGF), and non-granular
pseudo-depressed type (LST-NGPD). Clinical features of each subtype of LSTs
have not been fully evaluated.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aims of this study was to clarify the
clinicopathological features of colorectal LSTs focusing on their subtypes.
We reviewed clinical charts and surgical pathology files of 6243
endoscopically resected specimens during January 2007 and December 2017 at
our institution. A total of 490 LSTs were detected. We examined the clinical
features (mean age, male to female ratio, size, location, Incidence of
concomitant carcinoma) according to their subtypes.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of these 490 lesions, a total of 180 (36.7%) were LST-GH,
43 (8.8%) LST-GM, 233 (47.6%) LST-NGF, and 34 (6.9%) LST-NGPD. Mean age of
patients with each subtype was 68.6 years old for LST-GH, 67.0 for LST-GM,
67.2 for LST-NGF, and 66.8 for LST-NGPD. Male to female ratio (M/F) was 1.31
for LST-GH, 1.87 for LST-GM, 1.84 for LST-NGF, and 1.62 for LST-NGPD. Mean
size of LST-GH (20.8mm) and LST-GM (25.1mm) were significantly larger than
that of LST-NGF (16.7mm) and LST-NGPD (15.3mm). All subtypes were located
predominantly in the proximal colon.</p>
<p>Incidences of concomitant carcinomas in LST-GH, LST-GM, LST-NGF, and LST-NGPD
were 17.8% (32 out of 180), 44.2% (19 out of 43), 15.9% (37 out of 233), and
52.9% (18 out of 34), respectively. Incidences of concomitant submucosal
carcinomas in LST-GH, LST-GM, LST-NGF, and LST-NGPD were 0% (0 out of 180),
14.0% (6 out of 43), 2.1% (5 out of 233), and 20.6% (7 out of 34),
respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Each subtype of LSTs has distinct clinical features.
LST-GM and LST-NGPD have higher malignant potentials than other subtypes.
Especially LST-NGPD has the highest risk of invasive carcinoma regardless of
its size. Therefore we should carefully detect these lesions and choose
appropriate treatment according to the subtypes.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Many factors associated with the development and
recurrence of colon lesions has been described. The clinical guidelines
follow up recommendations are based on the size, number and pathologic
characteristics of the removed lesions in baseline colonoscopy, although,
genetic clinical factors could also have influence over time. Identifying
predictors of metachronous lesions would provide a better risk
stratification and improve the efficiency of surveillance programs.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to determine predictive factors of
metachronous lesions at 3 years in individuals with advanced adenomas
(high-grade dysplasia, villous component or ≥10 mm) and/or multiplicity ≥3
polyps in baseline screening colonoscopy. Analysis of all cases with
advanced polyps and/or multiplicity from population-based screening for
colorectal cancer (CRC) of Barcelona representative area
(CiutatVella-SantMartí) detected at the first round of baseline colonoscopy
(2010-2011) with surveillance colonoscopy at 3 years. Epidemiological and
clinical information/data of all individuals were collected, and molecular
study was performed in baseline polyps, including immunochemistry expression
of p53, MLH1, CDX2, Keratin 20, Keratin 7, KI 67 and β-catenin proteins, as
well as mutations in KRAS, NRAS and BRAF genes. For the statistical study, a
bivariate analysis and logistic regression was performed.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 518 cases with a complete colonoscopy at 3 years were
included. 66.2% were men with a mean age of 64 years. 51.8% had
hypertension, 15% Diabetes, 46.5% dyslipidemia, 12.3% chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, 70.6%, exposure to tobacco 45.8% were overweight and
34.7% were obese. Regarding the surveillance colonoscopy, it was normal or
with low-risk polyps in 420 cases (80.1%); in 98 cases (18.9%) advanced
and/or multiplicity lesions were identified: 73 advanced adenomas in 59
cases (11.4%), ≥3 adenomas in 62 cases (11.9%), ≥3 adenomas and/or serrated
in 71 cases (13.7%). The immunohistochemical study of cytokeratin (CK) 7 and
20, KI 67, β-catenin<bold>,</bold> p53, MLH1 and CDX2 was performed in 460
cases and included localization of expression and the intensity of staining.
Among individuals with advanced adenoma at 3 years, none had loss of
expression of MLH1 or CDX2; in 7 cases (1.5%) loss of expression of p53 was
observed, Ki 67 nuclear expression was observed in 1.8% and B-catenin in
46.9%, CK7cytoplasmatic reaction in 9.4% and CK 20 in 85.5%, without
differences regarding intensity of staining in COR curve. Regarding
mutations, we identify 144 (32%) polyps mutation in KRAS gen, in 27 (5.9%)
polyps with NRAS mutation distributed more frequently in codons 12-13, 59-61
and 117-146. BRAF mutation was identified in 32 cases (7.1%) mainly
distributed in codon 600. None of these mutations were associated
statistically significantly with metachronous lesions. The presence of ≥3
polyps in the basal colonoscopy was the only independent predictor of
advanced lesion to the surveillance colonoscopy (p = 0.001).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The multiplicity in baseline colonoscopy seems to be
the most important factor to identify population at risk of advanced
metachronous polyps. We could not demonstrate usefulness of molecular
biomarkers in predicting metachronous advanced lesions in individuals with
intermediate or high-risk polyps. Increasing the surveillance interval after
a complete resection of lesions could be a strategy, maintaining the
surveillance at 3 years in case of multiplicity in the baseline colonoscopy.
More studies are needed to improve stratificationof thethe risk of
metachrony.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Genetic variation has been linked to increased
symptom burden with esophageal symptoms and functional gastrointestinal (GI)
disorders through centrally mediated mechanisms. We evaluated relationships
between symptom burden and SNPs in GNB3 (G-protein-coupled receptor in the
brain-gut axis), ADRB2 (mediator of stress response), ADAMTS17
(extracellular matrix protein involved cellular junction permeability), SGK1
(treatment response to venlafaxine and susceptibility to anxiety), and FAAH
(neuroendocrine regulation, associated with anxiety, IBS, depression), in an
enriched population with esophageal symptoms.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Consecutive subjects with esophageal symptoms
presenting for clinical evaluation or esophageal physiologic testing at a
tertiary care center were identified for inclusion. Patients with major
esophageal motor disorders and prior foregut surgery were excluded. Subjects
provided sputum samples for genotyping and completed a symptom questionnaire
that included GERDQ, short-form health survey-36 (SF-36), Beck Anxiety and
Depression Inventories (BAI and BDI), esophageal symptom surveys and 10 cm
visual analog scales (VAS) rating symptom bother and severity. We used
thresholds for symptoms scores derived using receiver operating
characteristic analysis to compare frequency of minor alleles between high
and low symptom burden. 6 selected SNPs from GNβ3, 2 from ADRB2 and 1 each
from ADAMTS17, SGK1, and FAAH were assessed. Data were compared to healthy
volunteer controls with no esophageal symptoms or anti-reflux therapy.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Sputum from 237 study subjects (54.3 ± 1.0 yrs, 64.3% F)
and 67 controls (49.3 ± 2.0 yrs, 66.7%) had sufficient genetic material for
genotyping, and adequate clinical data for analysis. Compared to controls,
study subjects had higher GI symptom scores, BDI, and BAI scores, lower
total and physical health SF-36 scores, (p≤0.02), but similar mental health
SF-36 and GERDQ scores (p≥0.10). There was a non-significant increase in
minor allele frequency in ADAMTS17 and FAAH in subjects compared to controls
(51% to 16.7%, p = 0.1 and 35% to 15%, p = 0.2, respectively); other SNPs
were distributed similarly between subjects and controls. Minor alleles in 3
SNPs in GNβ3 (Rs 5446, Rs 5443, and Rs 2301339) were associated with higher
symptom severity (p≤0.03). Rs5446 and Rs5443 had worse mental SF36 scores
(p = 0.04), Rs 2301339 also trended towards significance (p = 0.06). BDI was
higher in two GNβ3 SNPs (Rs5445 and Rs2301338) (p≤0.01); BAI was higher in
the ADRB2 SNP Rs1042713 (p = 0.05). Using previously derived cutoffs to
separate high from low symptom or inventory scores, subjects with high
symptom severity were more likely to have a minor allele in ADRB2 SNP
Rs1042713 (p = 0.045), and GNβ3 SNPs (Rs 5446, Rs 5443, and Rs 2301339)
(p≤0.03). Perceptive symptoms (heartburn, chest pain) were associated with a
minor allele in ADRB2 SNP Rs1042713 (64% to 43% p = 0.04). Subjects with
minor alleles in three GNβ3 SNPs were more likely to have evidence of
esophageal mucosal injury on endoscopy compared to major alleles only (Rs
5446: 63% vs. 37%, p = 0.04, Rs5443 62% vs 38%, p = 0.04, Rs2301339: 62% vs.
38%, p = 0.03, respectively). This same subset of patients had worse symptom
bother (VAS 6.5 ± 0.3 vs 5.4 ± 0.3, p = 0.02) and severity (VAS 6.2 ± 0.3 vs
4.7 ± 0.3, p &lt; 0.01), but GERD phenotypes and acid burden were not
predicted by these SNPs.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Genetic variation in GNβ3 and ADRB2 can explain
increased esophageal symptom burden, abnormal affect and more importantly,
likelihood of esophageal mucosal injury in patients with esophageal
symptoms.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Gastric distension and chemical stimulation of the
TRPV1 receptor with capsaicin elicit specific and distinct epigastric
symptoms. TRPA1 is another excitatory ion channel which is involved in
sensory processes including thermal (cold) nociception, and inflammatory
pain. Allicin in garlic is a strong activator of the TRPA1 channel.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to characterize the sensations induced
by intragastric application of allicin-containing garlic powder and to
compare the quality of sensations with capsaicin and distension induced
perception. Initially the allicin content of a commercially available garlic
powder was determined by HPLC (0.5%) and the stability of allicin for at
least 60 minutes after dilution of the powder was confirmed <italic>in
vitro</italic>. After a dose finding trial 2 g garlic powder (≙10 mg
allicin) dissolved in 10 mL H<sub>2</sub>O, was determined to induce
moderate but consistent sensations. A 3-luminal tube with a barostat balloon
was placed into the proximal stomach and was used for double blind, random
infusion of garlic solution or placebo and for stepwise gastric distension.
7 healthy volunteers were studied. Symptoms were recorded with a graded
symptom questionnaire evaluating 7 symptoms (5 grades per question). Symptom
recording was performed after the garlic/placebo bolus for 15 minutes and
during graded barostat-balloon distensions. Additionally, 25 healthy
subjects received a capsule containing 0.75 mg capsaicin and symptoms were
recorded every 5 minutes for 45 minutes thereafter. Symptom scores were
recorded and areas under the curves were calculated. A p-value &lt; 0.01 was
considered significant in view of multiple comparisons.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Bolus injection of garlic caused immediate epigastric
symptoms, mean aggregate symptom scores (AUC in 15 minutes) were 106 ± 49
vs. 35 ± 30 after placebo (p = 0.01). Garlic induced significant epigastric
pressure, stinging, and warmth (p &lt; 0.01 vs. placebo), while the symptoms
cramps, satiety, nausea and pain were not significantly different from
placebo (p &gt; 0.05). After capsaicin ingestion warmth and stinging were
the most intense symptoms overall, but the difference to other symptoms was
significant only compared to pain and cramps (p &lt; 0.01). During balloon
distension epigastric pressure was significantly more intense than all other
evaluated qualities of sensations (p &lt; 0.001), while warmth was
significantly less intense than all other evaluated qualities of sensations
(p &lt; 0.01).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Garlic powder containing allicin induces immediate
epigastric symptoms of pressure, stinging and warmth. Gastric TRPA1
stimulation by allicin induces specific epigastric symptoms that differ from
symptoms induced by TRPV1 stimulation and mechanical distension. TRPA1 is a
receptor that is involved in gastric sensation.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Minimal inflammation has been reported in functional
gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), but the causes of immune activation are
largely unknown. Alterations of the stool microbiota have been reported in
FGID patients, suggesting specific microbe-host interactions might be a key
driver of immune activation. However, these relationships are virtually
unexplored in the small intestine. Thus, we aimed to characterise the links
between alterations in immune function, the duodenal mucosa-associated
microbiome (d-MAM), and gastrointestinal symptoms in FGID patients.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> 148 patients undergoing endoscopy were recruited
in total. GI symptoms were assessed by a standardised questionnaire (SAGIS).
Based on all clinical data, the cohort was divided into FGID (n = 88) and
non-FGID control patients (n = 60) without relevant structural
abnormalities; controls including a positive FOBT and/or iron deficiency
anaemia test. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from
peripheral blood using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Lamina
propria (LP) cells were isolated from duodenal biopsies by collagenase.
T-cells in PBMCs and lamina propria were analysed by flow cytometry. Genomic
DNA was extracted from duodenal biopsies obtained using our patented aseptic
device (MTW, Germany), and used to produce bar-coded PCR amplicons of the
bacterial 16S rRNA gene, which were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq
technology. Bioinformatics analyses were performed using QIIME and Calypso
with statistical significance assessed by T-test or Spearman
correlation.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There was a significant increase of CD4 gut-homing
T-cells in peripheral blood of FGID patients vs controls (p &lt; 0.015).
However, the increase of peripheral CD4 gut-homing T-cells does not lead to
an increase of this population in the duodenal LP. Instead, there was
positive correlation between effector memory T-cells (T<sub>EM</sub>-cells)
in LP with both peripheral CD4 (r = 0.43, p &lt; 0.005) and CD8 (r = 0.33,
p &lt; 0.037) gut-homing T-cells. The T<sub>EM</sub>-cell number in the LP
was also strongly and positively correlated with the intensity of GI
symptoms (r = 0.44, p &lt; 0.0001) and a positive correlation between
T<sub>EM</sub>-cells number and the relative abundance of a specific
member of the d-MAM assigned to the genus <italic>Neisseria</italic>
(r = 0.34, p &lt; 0.04) was also found. Negative correlations were observed
between T<sub>EM</sub>-cell number in LP and the relative abundance of
specific members of the d-MAM assigned to <italic>Streptococcus</italic>
(r = −0.40, p &lt; 0.01), <italic>Prevotella</italic> (r = −0.39,
p &lt; 0.02), and <italic>Selenomonas</italic>, (r = −0.39, p &lt; 0.02).
Interestingly, patients with more severe symptoms showed lower numbers of
both CD4 and CD8 gut-homing T-cells in the mucosa (p &lt; 0.0001), as well
as a reduction in their d-MAM alpha diversity (within sample) (Chao1 metric;
r = 0.37, p &lt; 0.02). There was also a direct correlation between
proportion of LP gut homing T-cells and d-MAM diversity (p &lt; 0.035).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The increase of gut-homing T-cells in peripheral
blood, and T<sub>EM</sub>-cells in duodenal LP, are positively correlated to
symptom severity in FGID patients. In contrast, patients with the higher
symptom severity had lower numbers of gut-homing T-cells in the mucosa and
this was associated with lower bacterial diversity. The observed changes in
T<sub>EM</sub>-cells in duodenal LP were also linked to changes in the
relative abundance of specific bacterial lineages assigned to
<italic>Neisseria</italic> (positively),
<italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Prevotella</italic> and
<italic>Selenomonas</italic> (negatively), providing new insights into
specific microbe-host interactions affecting FGID pathophysiology and its
manifestations.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Functional dyspepsia (FD) affects 15% of the
population and is characterised by recurring upper gastrointestinal (GI)
symptoms in the absence of structural abnormalities identifiable by routine
diagnostic practice. Recent evidence has implicated subtle changes in immune
cell populations, namely eosinophils and mast cells in the pathophysiology
of FD. Psychological stress is a key factor associated with the onset of FD
and is a trigger of symptom exacerbations, however the biological mechanisms
through which stress may lead to FD have not yet been defined. Recent
pre-clinical work has identified that the primary stress hormone
corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) may regulate expression of the innate
immune protein NLRP6. NLRP6 in turn, regulates the release of IL-18, which
is potently chemotactic for eosinophils and mast cells. We hypothesised that
stress hormone levels are altered in patients with FD and that this leads to
alterations in GI mucosal homeostasis and immune cell recruitment.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Our aims were to examine stress hormone levels
in patients with FD compared to healthy subjects and correlate with
activation of NLRP6 in these patients. FD patients were identified by Rome
III criteria; asymptomatic individuals were recruited as controls.
Psychological stress was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (HADS) questionnaire. Serum CRH levels were measured by ELISA. Pinch
biopsies were collected from the duodenum of FD patients and non-FD
controls. Biopsies were either formalin fixed and stained
immunohistochemically for NLRP6 or RNA was extracted from enriched
epithelial cell preparations for qPCR analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, there was no difference in HADS score between FD
and non-FD cohorts (n = 10, p = 0.25). However, levels of CRH were
significantly reduced in both duodenal tissue (n = 6, p = 0.001) and serum
(n = 10, p = 0.013) of FD patients compared to non-FD controls. HADS
positively correlated with serum CRH in controls but not in patients with
FD. Duodenal NLRP6 was significantly increased in patients with FD compared
to non-FD controls (n = 6, p = 0.007) and epithelial expression of NLRP6 was
positively correlated with expression of IL-18, which was elevated at the
gene level (r = 0.95, p = 0.015) in FD patients compared to non-FD controls.
Overall, there was no difference in the number of CD117+ mast cells between
patients with FD and controls (n = 9, p = 0.45), however post-hoc analysis
revealed a significant increase in mast cell numbers between patients with
epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) compared to patients with post-prandial
distress syndrome (PDS) symptoms (n = 3 per group, p = 0.04).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study has identified 2 novel pathological
features of FD, (decreased CRH and increased NLRP6) and suggests a
dysregulation in the hormonal stress response disrupts GI mucosal
homeostasis in patients with FD. Additionally, our data indicates that EPS
and PDS subtypes of FD may be symptomatically and immunologically distinct,
confirming the heterogeneity of FD.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The vagus nerve carries sensorimotor information
between the brain and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Vagal tone plays an
important role in the regulation of appetite<sup>[1]</sup> and is associated
with a range of positive health behaviours. Upon consumption of a meal,
internal afferent signals are conveyed to the brainstem depending on the
size and nutrient composition of the meal. These are integrated with
external sensory information before descending and modulatory pathways
elicit an efferent motor response, accompanied by changes in
appetite-related sensations. Differences in vagal tone may moderate
periprandial responses to interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli and
influence eating behaviour. Previously, an interaction between intragastric
infusion of fatty-acid (FA) and negative mood induction has been reported to
effect behavioural and neural responses in healthy lean
subjects<sup>[2]</sup>.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this pilot study was to investigate
the relationship between vagal tone and eating behaviour and the effect of
the putative interaction between FA and negative mood on appetite-related
sensations and food consumption. 10 healthy subjects (3 male, median [range]
age 29 [22-52] BMI 22.5 [19.4–24.0]) completed the Three-Factor Eating
Questionnaire (TFEQ) and 4 visits in a 2x2 crossover design. Cardiac vagal
tone (CVT), affective state and appetite-related sensations were assessed at
baseline and following intragastric infusion of 250 ml 0.05 mol/L C-12
fatty-acid (“fat” condition vs saline). At 3 min pre-infusion (-3 min),
negative mood induction (“sad” condition vs neutral) began, up to 30min
post-infusion (PI). Subjects were offered an ad libitum buffet and
instructed to eat until comfortably full (40-70min PI). Spearman's ρ was
calculated for baseline CVT against TFEQ scores for cognitive restraint
(CR), emotional eating (EE) and unrestrained eating (UE) and the main effect
of “fat*sad” was tested with ANOVA including “condition” as a within-subject
variable for the following (compared to -3min baseline): Δ CVT, Δ fullness
(1-100 visual analogue scale, VAS), Δ arousal (1-9 self-assessment mannikin,
SAM) and Δ negative mood (1-9 SAM) at 20min PI controlling for baseline
values; and total energy (kcal) and total fat (g) consumed at 40-70min PI
controlling for baseline hunger rating.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Baseline CVT (median: 14.12 LVS, range: 2.9–26.8) was
negatively correlated with TFEQ-CR (r = -0.74, p = 0.013) but not UE
(r = -0.25, p = 0.51) or EE (r = -0.01 p = 0.98). The effect of “fat” on Δ
CVT (20min vs -3min PI) was significant (F(1) = 11.03, p = 0.003) and the
interaction term approached significance (F(1) = 3.14, p = 0.09).
Controlling for baseline ratings, there was no significant effect of either
“fat”, “sad” or “fat*sad” on Δ fullness, Δ arousal or Δ negative mood.
Baseline hunger had a significant effect on the amount of fat consumed
(F(1) = 4.86, p = 0.04), but here was no significant effect of condition or
interaction on total energy or fat consumption.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Relatively high baseline CVT and the strong
correlation with CR in this lean sample supports the association between
vagal tone and positive cognitive restraint. Small sample size, low dose and
volume of fatty-acid infused, and subtlety of the mood induction could
account for the limited effect of the experimental interventions on
subjective ratings and food consumption. However, this exploratory study
suggests that CVT could be a non-invasive biomarker of subconscious
physiological responses. Future work will investigate the role of
circulating gut peptides and the relationship between vagal tone and GI
motility.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Accumulating evidence suggests that the vagus nerve
exerts an anti-nociceptive effect in the viscera. Visceral pain
hypersensitivity is a key pathophysiological mechanism of number of common
disorders including subtypes of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
(GORD).</p>
<p>Pain hypersensitivity is an exaggerated response to an injury that may persist
despite the cessation of the injury. We have previously demonstrated that
Transcutaneous Vagal Nerve Stimulation (tVNS) prevents the development of
experimental acid-induced oesophageal pain hypersensitivity when applied at
the same time with the injury-causing agent (acid) (Farmer AD et al, DDW
2017). However, in patients, the exact onset of the injury is unpredictable,
thus a therapeutic intervention would preferably be able to reverse an
already established hypersensitivity.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Our aim was to determine whether electrical
stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve can reverse an
established experimental hypersensitivity in a validated model of acid
induced oesophageal pain hypersensitivity due to central sensitisation in
healthy subjects.</p>
<p>In a prospective randomised sham-controlled crossover trial in 24 healthy
participants (12 male, mean age 26.4 ± 6.24 years), we measured electrical
pain tolerance thresholds (PT) in the proximal oesophagus, at the start of
the experiment (T0), following that, we infused 240 ml of 0.15M hydrochloric
acid in the distal oesophagus (T0-T30). After that, we allowed participants
to rest for 30 min and then measured PT for the second time (T60). Only
participants with PT drop of ≥6 mA (milliamp) measured at (T60) were
considered to be sensitizers and therefore recruited. After that,
participants were randomized in a blinded crossover design to receive either
transcutaneous auricular electrical vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) (pulse
width: 250 µs, 25 Hz, cycle: 30s on, 30 s off), or sham stimulation with the
same parameters, for 30 minutes (T60-T90). PTs were measured both,
immediately (T90) and 30 min after the end of active/sham stimulation
(T120). PTs were analysed using a general linear model for repeated measures
with PTs as dependent variables, active/sham as factor and the difference in
the initial degree of sensitisation between visits as a covariate (IBS SPSS
23, USA).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 18 participants (8 male, mean age 26 ± 6.3 years)
sensitised and were included. When compared to sham, tVNS significantly
increased PT at the end of the stimulation; 19.4mA ( ± 21) vs. 2.7 mA
( ± 12.1), p = 0.01, 95% CI [4.16–27.96]. The effect of tVNS on PT remained
significant 30 min after the end of stimulation; 22.5 ( ± 23.8) vs. 7.69
( ± 18.44), p = 0.049, 95% CI [0.079–29.77].</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results suggest that tVNS reverses experimental
acid-induced oesophageal pain hypersensitivity in healthy participants.
Future studies are warranted to replicate this effect in patients with
reflux hypersensitivity and other disorders where pain hypersensitivity is
suspected.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
cancer in the United States and the second leading cause of all
cancer-related deaths. Although the incidence has been decreasing for adults
(≥50), it has been on the rise for adults younger than 50.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aim to identify potential risk factors in CRC
occurrence in young adults. A population-based study using a national
database, Explorys, was used to identify all CRC cases from Jan 2012 to Dec
2016. Subgroups were stratified based on age (25-49 years vs. ≥50 years).
Demographics, comorbidities, and symptom profiles were recorded and compared
between both age groups. Furthermore, the younger group was also compared
with a control group consisting of individuals aged 25-49 years without a
diagnosis of CRC. 20 data points for CRC related factors were analyzed to
identify potential risk factors specific to early-onset CRC. Odds ratio and
p-value calculations were performed and reported using social sciences
statistical software.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 68,860 patients were identified with CRC, of which 5,710
(8.3%) were younger than 50 years of age. Early-onset CRC demonstrated a
significantly higher incidence in African-Americans, family history (FH) of
cancer, FH of GI specific malignancy, FH of colonic polyps, obesity
(BMI≥30), presenting symptoms of abdominal pain, rectal pain, rectal
bleeding, colitis and altered bowel function as compared to patients ≥50
years with diagnosis of CRC. Additionally, early-onset CRC significantly had
higher rates of FH of cancer, GI cancer, colonic polyps, colitis, obesity,
and symptoms of abdominal pain, rectal pain, rectal bleeding, weight loss
and altered bowel function when compared to the control group.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The rise of CRC in the younger population remains
concerning. Identifying risk factors for early-onset CRC is necessary to
optimize guidelines for early screening. Pending further investigation,
these risk factors should lower the threshold of suspicion for early CRC and
potentially early CRC screening especially in patients 40-49 years of age.

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> In the North American population, colorectal cancer
(CRC) incidence for individuals older than 50 years steadily declines, but
an opposite trend has been suggested among young adults. In Europe, trends
in CRC incidence among younger individuals are lacking.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to analyze trends in
incidence rates of young adults with CRC in the European Union over the last
25 years.</p>
<p>Data on age-related incidence of CRC were retrieved from national European
cancer registries with a data time-frame of at least 10 years, ranging from
1990 until 2016. Young adults, defined as people between 20 to 49 years of
age, with confirmed colon or rectal cancer were included. 5-year incidence
and mortality rates were collected, expressed per 100.000 person-years and
corrected for age and population numbers. Trends were calculated using a
Joinpoint regression analysis, and expressed as annual percent change (APC)
with a 95% confidence.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Data from 20 European countries were included. In adults
aged 20 to 39 years of age, the overall CRC incidence rate increased by 4.9%
(95 % CI: 3.9–5.9) annually since 2005. For colon cancer, incidence rate
increased in men by 2.2% (95% CI: 1.4–3.0) per year from 1990-2010 and with
an even higher increase of 7.3% (95% CI: 2.3–12.5) per year from 2010-2016.
In women the incidence rate increased by 1.5% (95% CI: 0.4–2.7) per year
from 1990-2008 and increased even more by 8.9% (95% CI: 4.8–13.2) per year
from 2008-2016. Incidence rate of rectal cancer increased for both men and
women, respectively 2.4% (95% CI: 1.9–3.0) and 2.0% (95% CI: 1.2–2.8) per
year.</p>
<p>In adults aged 40 to 49 years, the overall CRC incidence rate increased by 1.2%
(95% CI: 0.6–1.8) per year from 2002. The incidence rate of colon cancer
increased in men by 0.5% (95% CI: 0.1–0.8) per year, and also in women by
0.5% (95 % CI: 0.0–1.0) per year. Incidence rate of rectal cancer in men
decreased by 3.9% (95% CI:-7.1– -0.7) from 1990-1997, and then increased
from 1997-2016 by 1.6% (95% CI: 0.8–2.3). Rectal cancer in women increased
by 8.3% (95% CI: 4.7–12.0) per year in 1990-1996, and remained stable from
1996-2016.</p>
<p>The overall age adjusted mortality rates for CRC did not show a significant
trend in adults 20 to 39 years of age. However, mortality rates in adults 40
to 49 years of age decreased by 3.8% (95 % CI: -4.4– -3.2) per year from
1990-2006, and remaind stable from 2006-2016.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> There is an increased incidence rate in CRC in young
adults in Europe. The cause for this trend is still unknown. Awareness and
future studies to elucidate causes for this trend are needed and may help to
set up screening strategies to prevent and detect these cancers at an early
and curable stage.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> There is a growing body of evidence that common,
low-risk genetic variants play a significant role in colorectal cancer (CRC)
risk due to their relatively high prevalence in the population. When
combined with family history, they have been shown to improve risk
stratification of the general population. We aimed to investigate the impact
of risk-based screening (RBS) for CRC, and compare it, in terms of
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, to uniform biennial screening.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We used the Microsimulation Screening
Analysis-Colon (MISCAN-Colon) to model the effects and costs of screening
for CRC in a risk stratified Australian population aged 40-74 years.
Individuals were placed into 1 of 5 risk groups based on relative risk (very
low, low, average, high, very high) which was determined by their polygenic
risk profile and family history of CRC. Screening strategies varied by start
age (40, 46, 50, 54 or 60), test (no screening, faecal immunochemical test
(FIT) and colonoscopy (COL)) and interval (annual, biennial or triennial
FIT, and 5- or 10-yearly COL).</p>
<p>We then assessed 6 screening scenarios – no screening, uniform biennial FIT
screening for individuals aged 50-74 years and 4 RBS scenarios (R1-4). RBS
scenarios increased in complexity: in R1 we modified screening start age,
while in R2 we modified start age and interval and in R3 and R4 we also
modified screening tests. Screening stop age was 74 years for all scenarios.
In a sensitivity analysis we included costs for obtaining risk profile which
included polygenic testing.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Without screening, 78.7 CRC cases per 1,000 40-year olds
were clinically detected over the 50-year follow-up period. This scenario
resulted in 26.6 CRC deaths, yielded 23,723 QALYs and cost AU$2.14 million.
Compared to no screening, uniform screening resulted in lower CRC incidence
(66.8 cases) and mortality (19.6) and an increased yield in QALYs (23,755
QALYs) and costs ($2.20 million). The RBS strategies resulted in similar CRC
incidence and mortality to uniform screening, with the most intensive
strategy (R4) having the lowest incidence and mortality. QALYs and costs
increased slightly in the RBS scenarios with R4 having the highest yield and
costs.</p>
<p>The average cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER) of uniform screening compared to no
screening was $2,149 per QALY gained. However, when we considered all
strategies, R2, where screening start age and interval were modified,
demonstrated cost-effectiveness with an ACER of $1,546 per QALYs gained
compared to no screening with R1 and uniform screening being dominated by R2
and R3 extendedly dominated by R4 (ICER $15,190). R4, where screening start
age and interval were modified, and those at highest risk were offered
5-yearly COL, was also cost-effective with an ICER of $10,989 compared to
R2. When costs for obtaining risk profile were included, only uniform
screening was deemed to be cost-effective.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results indicate that RBS determined by common
genetic variants and family history is cost-effective, however, overall the
gains are small. If, in addition to an earlier start age of screening,
individuals at highest risk are offered 5-yearly COL instead of FIT (R4),
benefits are expected to be largest. Including costs for obtaining risk
profile significantly alters the results, with only uniform screening being
cost-effective. The benefits of RBS may alter as new variants are
discovered.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common hereditary
cause of colorectal cancer (CRC) and is caused by germline mutations in the
MMR genes <italic>MLH1</italic>, <italic>MSH2</italic>,
<italic>MSH6</italic> or <italic>PMS2</italic>. Although different
genes may result in different CRC risk, all LS patients are currently
offered the same surveillance interval regardless of the gene involved.
Therefore, we aimed to assess the yield of LS surveillance for each
individual MMR gene carrier group.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> All patients diagnosed with LS in our center and
participating in LS surveillance were included. Patients who had developed
CRC before the identification of a MMR mutation were excluded. Data on age,
gender, MMR gene involved, number of colonoscopies performed, interval
between colonoscopies, and findings at each examination including
histopathology were collected. Adenomas were considered advanced in case of
a villous component, high-grade dysplasia and/or ≥10mm in size. We compared
the development of (advanced) adenomas and CRC between patients with
<italic>MLH1</italic>, <italic>MSH2</italic>, <italic>MSH6</italic>
and <italic>PMS2</italic> mutations.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 314 LS carriers were included. Colonoscopy
data were available for 264 (84%) patients from 113 different families (38%
male, median age at time of first colonoscopy was 44 years (IQR 35-56 years,
range 20-80 years)). Of these patients, 55 had a <italic>MLH1</italic>, 44 a
<italic>MSH2</italic>, 143 a <italic>MSH6</italic> and 22 a
<italic>PMS2</italic> mutation. Median follow-up time was 6 years (IQR
2-10 years). At first colonoscopy, adenomas were found in 70 (27%), advanced
adenomas in 33 (13%) and CRC in 8 patients (age range 46-69 years, 3
<italic>MLH1</italic>, 1 <italic>MSH2</italic> and 4
<italic>MSH6</italic> mutation carriers). A total of 916 follow-up
colonoscopies were performed in 220 patients. CRC was found in 9 patients, 4
in <italic>MLH1</italic> mutation carriers and 5 in <italic>MSH2</italic>
mutation carriers. No CRC was found in <italic>MSH6</italic> or
<italic>PMS2</italic> mutation carriers. There were no significant
differences in the number of colonoscopies with adenomas or advanced
adenomas between the different gene mutation carrier groups. In total, 264
adenomas were found in 103 different patients (47% of the patients). Mean
number of adenomas per procedure (MAP) was 0.28. Mean number of adenomas per
positive procedure (MAP+) was 1.38. There were also no significant
differences in MAP or MAP+ between the different gene mutation carrier
groups. Median time of adenoma development (calculated as the time since the
last adenoma identified or since the first colonoscopy in case no previous
adenomas were found) was 3 years (IQR 2-6 years). There were no significant
differences in time to development of an adenoma or advanced adenoma between
the groups adjusted for age and gender. In <italic>MLH1</italic> and
<italic>MSH2</italic> mutation carriers advanced neoplasia (advanced
adenoma or colorectal carcinoma) was found in shorter follow-up time than in
<italic>MSH6</italic> mutation carriers. 6 patients died during LS
surveillance. Only 1 patient died from CRC, which was diagnosed at the first
colonoscopy. In total 3/6 patients died from pancreatic cancer (1 MSH6 and 2
MSH2 mutation carriers).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Since no CRC was found during follow-up in
<italic>MSH6</italic> and <italic>PMS2</italic> mutation carriers and
advanced neoplasia was found in shorter follow-up time in
<italic>MLH1</italic> and <italic>MSH2</italic> mutation carriers, the
colonoscopy interval in <italic>MSH6</italic> and <italic>PMS2</italic>
mutation carriers might be less stringent than for <italic>MLH1</italic> and
<italic>MSH2</italic> mutation carriers.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Adenomas in Lynch syndrome have an accelerated
progression to colorectal cancer which might occur despite a regular
follow-up. Despite low evidence, clinical guidelines recommend using
high-definition technology and pan-chromoendoscopy (CE) for colonoscopy
surveillance in Lynch syndrome.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We hypothesized that high-definition white-light
endoscopy (WLE) could be equally effective than CE for detection of adenomas
in patients with LS. We conducted a multicenter randomized controlled study
with endoscopists with high ADR (39%-61% in screening colonoscopies),
devoted to high-risk conditions of colorectal cancer. Patients with
confirmed mismatch repair mutation were prospectively randomized 1:1 to WLE
or CE. The main outcome was the adenoma detection rate (ADR). 122 subjects
in each group were required to demonstrate non-inferiority of WLE versus CE
as reference group (non- inferiority margin of 15%; power 80%; drop-out 10%;
significance level of .025).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 256 patients were included in 14 Spanish centers (26
endoscopists). Patient baseline characteristics are shown in the table. The
ADR for WLE versus CE were 28.1% (95% confidence interval 21.1%-36.4%)
versus 34.4% (26.4%-43.3%) respectively (p = 0.281). The detection rate of
lesions in WLE versus CE group were as follow: total polyps 50.0%
(41.5%-58.5%) versus 57.7% (58.6%-74.7%) (p = 0.004), serrated lesions 23.4%
(16.9%-31.4%) versus 37.5% (29.5%-46.1%) (p = 0.015), proximal serrated
lesions 10.2% (6.0%-16.6%) versus 11.7% (7.0%-18.4%) (p = 0.689), sessile
serrated lesions 5.5% (2.4%-10.8%) versus 3.9% (1.6%-8.8%) (p = 0.554) and
advanced adenomas 7.8% (4.3%-13.7%) versus 3.9% (1.6%-3.9%) (p = 0.183)
respectively. The mean ( ± standard deviation) of lesions per patient for
WLE versus CE were as follow: adenomas 1.04 (1.37) versus 0.86 (1.04)
(p = 0.670), polyps 2.36 (1.77) versus 2.67 (2.29) (p = 0.004), serrated
lesions 0.67 (0.89) versus 1.04 (1.38) (p = 0.004), proximal serrated
lesions 0.25 (0.56) versus 0.25 (0.61) (p = 0.426), sessile serrated lesions
0.10 (0.31) versus 0.11 (0.67) (p = 0.660) respectively. The previous
colonoscopy was performed with standard definition white-light with adequate
bowel preparation. The total procedural time and withdrawal time
(mean ± standard deviation; in minutes) were superior in the CE arm:
22.42 ± 8.72 versus 30.67 ± 12.84 (p &lt; 0.001) and 13.5 ± 5.63 versus
18.37 ± 7.57 (p &lt; 0.001) respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In a scenario with expert endoscopists,
high-definition WLE is an optimal and efficient endoscopic technique for
surveillance of Lynch syndrome patients. CE prolonged the procedural time
without increasing detection of relevant lesions. <table-wrap id="table58-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table58-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table58"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">WLE n = 128</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">CE n = 128</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">p</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Female sex (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">55.5</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">64.1</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.161</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Age -years- (standard deviation)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">47.6 (13.6)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">46.7 (14.3)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.616</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">History of colorectal cancer (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">21.9</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20.3</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.759</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">History of extracolonic cancers (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">20.3</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">21.1</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.877</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">MLH1 (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">26.8</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30.5</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.514</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">MSH2 (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">44.1</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">39.1</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.415</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">MSH6 (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">18.9</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">25.8</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.187</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">PMS2 (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">9.4</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3.9</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.076</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Epcam (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.8</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.8</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.996</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Previous surveillance colonoscopies (%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">90.6</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">86.7</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.324</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Elapsed time since last colonoscopy  -months-

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal
dominant disorder that predisposes to colorectal cancer (CRC). It is
recommended that patients with FAP are monitored in national databases. The
Danish Polyposis Registry is a nationwide, complete registry of FAP patients
established in 1977 The aims of this study were to assess the current
incidence and prevalence of colorectal cancer in FAP patients, the choice of
surgical treatment, and finally to compare the course of disease for
probands and call-up patients.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The annual incidence rate was calculated by
diving number of newly diagnosed cases with the mean population for that
year (Statistics Denmark), while the prevalence was calculated by dividing
the number of FAP patients with the total population by end of the year
(Statistics Denmark). The complete number of CRC was extracted from Nordcan.
Probands were defined as patients diagnosed due to bowel symptoms and
without any knowledge of hereditary bowel disease. Call-up patients were
defined as screen detected patients diagnosed at prophylactic examination
due to FAP diagnosis in first degree relatives.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> By the end of 2017, the Danish Polyposis Registry
comprised 221 families with 722 affected individuals, including 610 with
histologically verified FAP (309 probands and 311 call-ups). The annual
incidence of FAP was 0.13/100,000, while the prevalence by the end of 2017
was 6.04/100,000. During 1999-2017, the proportion of FAP related CRC
(n = 34), constituted only 0.05% of the all cases of CRC (n = 72,218) in
Denmark. 198 (32%) patients had CRC when diagnosed with FAP. The rate of CRC
at the time of the FAP diagnosis was significantly higher in probands
compared to call-ups (62% vs. 2%, p &lt; 0.0001). Of 610 patients with
complete follow-up, 198 (32%) had CRC. Dukes classification was known in 154
patients; 26 (17%) were stage A, 42 (27%) stage B, and 86 (56%) stage C.
Colectomy was the preferred surgical modality in 78%, rising from 52% before
1975, to 89% since 2002. The use of colectomy was significantly higher in
call-ups (249/249) compared to probands (188/260) (100% vs. 73%,
p &lt; 0.0001). Of 295 patients with a known cause of death, 195 (66%) died
of CRC, 37 from another malignant disease (13%), while 65 (22%) died from a
non-malignant disease.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The Danish Polyposis Registry enables close monitoring
of the rate of CRC and quality measurements as the rate of colectomy.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Alternations of gut microbiota is well-known in
colorectal carcinogenesis. Gut microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles
(EVs) are widely distributed throughout the body including the blood and
urine. In this study, we investigated profiles of bacteria-derived EVs in
stool, blood and urine, and evaluated whether they can be a useful marker
for the metagenomic analysis of colorectal cancer (CRC).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This study incorporated 50 healthy controls and
14 patients with CRC. Information on anthropometric variables, location of
tumor, cancer stage, and smoking and drinking habits were collected in
patients with CRC. Additionally, we analyzed and compared the
bacteria-derived EVs of the study subjects by using 16S ribosomal RNA gene
sequencing of their stool, blood and urine samples, which allowed us to
identify over 3,200 operational taxonomic units corresponding to gut
microbiota reported in previous studies.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In stool, non-EV bacterial microbiome, microbial
diversity was significantly increased in CRC patients (Shannon index,
p = 0.006); relative abundance of phylum Proteobacteria was decreased (FDR
q = 0.003) and abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes was increased (q = 0.023)
in CRC patients; abundances of families Rikenellaceae and Porphyromonadaceae
were significantly different between controls and CRC patients
(q &lt; 0.05). In stool bacteria-derived EVs, microbial diversity was not
different between controls and CRC patients (Shannon index, p &gt; 0.05);
relative abundances of family Comamonadaceae was significantly increased in
CRC patients (q &lt; 0.001). In urine bacteria-derived EVs, abundances of
phylum Bacteroidetes (q = 0.003) was increased, whereas abundances of
Fusobacteria was decreased (q = 0.005); abundances of families
Pseudomonadaceae, Rhodocyclaceae, Comamonadaceae, and Oxalobacteraceae were
different between the 2 groups (q &lt; 0.01). In serum bacteria-derived EVs,
abundances of phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were increased
(q &lt; 0.001) and abundances of family Comamonadaceae was increased
(q = 0.002).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In stool, EV-derived microbiome shows a distinct
profile comparing to non-EV bacterial microbiome. These results suggest that
some of the bacteria-derived EVs such as Comamonadaceae in stool, blood or
urine may play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis and they might be
surrogate markers for the diagnosis of CRC. Further studies are necessary to
clarify this issue.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold>
<italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> (<italic>F. nucleatum</italic>) is
among the most prevalent bacterial species in colorectal cancer (CRC)
tissues and play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis [1, 2]. A
recent study reported <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> strains were
consistently detected in primary tumors and paired metastases, suggesting
that <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> might travels with the primary tumor
cells to distant sites, as part of metastatic tissue colonization [3].
However, whether <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> could drive the metastasis of
colorectal cancer is remained to be clarified. We aimed to clarified the
role of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> in metastasis of colorectal
cancer.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The abundance of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>
in fecal samples from CRC patients and healthy people were detected by
quantitative real-time PCR. Colorectal cancer cell lines were incubated with
<italic>F. nucleatum</italic> or phosphate buffer saline (PBS control)
and analyzed migration and invasion by transwell and wound healing assays.
Cells were incubated with <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> or PBS and injected
into tail vein of nude mice and metastasized nodules in the lungs were
counted. The relative expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were
analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The relative abundance of <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>
was increased in fecal samples of colorectal patients compared with healthy
people (N = 30, T = 37). Furthermore, the abundance of <italic>F.
nucleatum</italic> in fecal samples from CRC patients with lymph nodes
metastasis was more than patients without metastasis. <italic>F.
nucleatum</italic> co-culture promote CRC cells migration and invasion
<italic>in vitro</italic>. Similarly, injection of CRC cells infected
with <italic>F. nucleatum.</italic> We found MMPs (MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-7,
MMP-9, MMP-12) were significantly upregulated in CRC cells incubated with
<italic>F. nucleatum</italic> vs. PBS.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our research firstly provided novel evidence that
<italic>F. nucleatum</italic> promote metastasis of colorectal cancer,
suggesting tumor microbiota are essential components of the cancer
micro-eviroment.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Changes in the intestinal microbiota composition,
with potential contribution in carcinogenesis, have been reported in
patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). In particular, a decrease in the
<italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii)</italic>
population has been identified. A CD4/CD8aa double positive lymphocyte
population (CD4CD8aa) has been identified in human colonic mucosa and
peripheral blood. This population has a phenotype and a cytokinic profile
common to regulatory Treg lymphocytes and has a TCR repertoire with
specificity for <italic>F. prausnitzii</italic>. Their serum concentrations
are significantly reduced in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The objectives of this work were: 1) to detect
dysbiosis in the fecal microbiota of patients with CRC by metagenomic
analysis 2) to investigate changes in the levels of CD4CD8aa circulating
lymphocytes specific for <italic>F. prausnitzii.</italic> Patients with CRC
without IBD and control subjects were included prospectively. None had
received antibiotics in the previous month or any anti-tumor treatment. A
stool sample was collected for each participant, immediately frozen at -80°C
until analysis. The CD4CD8aa population was identified and quantified on
fresh whole blood by flow cytometry with anti-CD3, anti-CD4 and anti-CD8a
co-labelling.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 21 patients with CRC (mean age 66 years [extremes 44-79],
mean body mass index 25.2 kg/m<sup>2,</sup> right colon cancer n = 7, left
colon cancer n = 7, rectal cancer n = 6) and 20 controls subjects (mean age
66 years [extremes 46-79], mean body mass index 26.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were
included. Fecal microbiome diversity was not different between the 2 groups
(Permanova, Bray-Curtis distance, p = 0.086). The mean relative abundance of
<italic>F. prausnitzii</italic> was significantly decreased in CRC
patients compared with controls (0.018 +/- 0.015 versus 0.043 +/- 0.030,
respectively, p = 0.01). 2 other bacterial species were also decreased in
CRC patients compared with controls: <italic>Eubacterium hallii</italic> and
<italic>Eubacterium siraeum</italic>. The mean absolute count of
CD4CD8aa in the blood among CD3 + was significantly lower in patients
compared with control subjects (2.21 +/-5.47 versus 1.50 +/-1.4,
respectively, p = 0.04). There was a non-statistically significant decrease
in mean absolute count of CD4CD8aa among CD4 + (3.10 +/-7.16 versus 2.25 +/-
2.10, p = 0.07).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This work 1) objectives in metagenomic analysis the
presence of fecal microbiota dysbiosis in patients with CRC, 2) shows a
concomitant decrease in the frequency of the CD4CD8aa regulatory lymphocyte
population among circulating T cells and the <italic>F. prausnitzii</italic>
population in the fecal microbiota of these patients. This dysbiosis and
this modification of the regulatory lymphocyte population could be involved
in colonic carcinogenesis.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> In the majority of patients with multiple colonic
polyps, no genetic or other causes are found for their pathology. The
presence of an increased inflammatory response in the context of a metabolic
syndrome could predispose to this condition.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study is to analyze the presence
of inflammatory cytokines and levels of glucose, insulin and C-reactive
protein (CRP) in serum of patients with multiple colonic polyps and compare
it with healthy patients' serum. Factors such as smoking and the presence of
Diabetes Mellitus (DM) are also analyzed. 83 patients with 10 or more
adenomatous or serrated polyps from the EPIPOLIP multicenter project, in
which 22 hospitals participated, were included. Individuals with
hyperplastic rectosigmoid polyps as the only alteration were excluded. In
turn, 53 individuals with normal colonoscopy from the CCR screening program
of the Valencian Community were included as controls. Glucose, C-reactive
protein and basal insulin were determined. Quantification of IL-2, IL-4,
IL-6, IL-10, IL-11, IL-17A and IL-23 cytokines levels in serum was performed
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Data analysis was performed
using the SPSS statistical analysis tool.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age of diagnosis in both groups was 60 years. We
included 71 men (86%) and 12 women (14%) in the case group and 43 (81%) men
and 10 (19%) women in the control group. We found a significant increase of
IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-17A and IL-23 in the serum of patients with polyposis
compared to controls (p = 0.001, p = 0.001, p = 0.001, p = 0.001, p = 0.014
respectively). We did not detect significant differences of IL-11 and IL-10
between both groups (p = 0.164, p = 0.4). A significant increase of CRP was
found in the group of patients with polyposis; however, the HOMA index did
not present significant differences. We found a significantly higher number
of smokers in the group of patients with polyposis than the control group
(67% vs 16%, p = 0.001) respectively. Also, a significantly higher
percentage of cases had DM (11% vs. 5%, p = 0.01). 24% of individuals with
polyposis developed CC.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The high concentration of CRP and presence of high
levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-23 and IL-17A in the group of patients with
polyposis indicates the presence of an inflammatory response in these
patients. Signaling by IL-23/IL-17A axis along with other cytokines and
other factors such as tobacco consumption and DM may be playing an important
role in the development of polyposis in these patients.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The densities of CD3<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in association with TNM-staging may
modify prognostic estimates of non-metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC),
potentially leading to an innovative Immunoscore forecasting system.
FoxP3<sup>+</sup>TILs, not included in the Immunoscore, may as well
impact on CRC prognosis. Implementing the immune classification of CRC, we
compared the prognostic weight of CD3<sup>+</sup>, FoxP3<sup>+</sup>TILs,
and TNM classifiers for predicting the outcome of patients with stage II and
III CRC.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The surface covered by FoxP3<sup>+</sup> and
CD3<sup>+</sup>TILs at the invasive front of 413 stage II-III CRC and
TNM classifiers were first challenged by classification and regression tree
analysis (CART) by recursive partitioning to identify independent prognostic
factors. Significant prognostic factors and their interactions were then
re-assessed by logistic regression and Cox modeling, also in a validation
set of 215 stage II CRCs.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In the trial set, recursive partitioning recognized an
influence of TILs on recurrence risk only within the decisional tree of
stage II. Low-FoxP3<sup>+</sup>TIL densities ranked first (OR 5.20; 95% CI,
2.26–11.9; p &lt; 0.001), and low-CD3<sup>+</sup>TILs further stratified the
risk (OR, 4.46; 95% CI, 1.58–12.6; p &lt; 0.001) of low-FoxP3<sup>+</sup>
patients. Linear regression analysis showed no correlation (p = 0.26)
between the density of FoxP3<sup>+</sup> TILs and that of CD3<sup>+</sup>
cells. At standard multivariate analysis, TILs interacted with stage
(FoxP3<sup>+</sup>, p = 0.06; CD3<sup>+</sup>, p = 0.02) and
MS-instability (FoxP3<sup>+</sup>; p = 0.02). In stage II MS-stable cancers,
concomitant low-FoxP3<sup>+</sup>/low-CD3<sup>+</sup>TILs identified
patients with the highest risk of progression in the trial (HR 7.24; 95% CI,
3.41–15.4; p &lt; 0.001), and in the validation (HR 15.16; 95% CI,
3.43–66.9; p &lt; 0.001) sets. At ROC curve analysis of the trial set, TIL
densities identified recurrences in stage II MSS CRCs with an AUC of 0.75
for FoxP3<sup>+</sup> TILs, and of 0.71 for CD3<sup>+</sup> cells. In the
validation set, the AUCs were superimposable to those of the trial set (0.77
for FoxP3<sup>+</sup>, and 0.71 for CD3<sup>+</sup> TILs). In pooled stage
II analysis, patients with concomitant low-TILs had the poorest survival,
irrespectively of allocation to adjuvant therapy (43.5%) or to surveillance
(45.5%; p = 1.0).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Combined assessment of independent
FoxP3<sup>+</sup>-CD3<sup>+</sup>TILs accurately forecast the outcome
of stage II microsatellite-stable CRC patients, eventually outplayed by
nodal invasion. By contributing to improved stratification of the recurrence
risk, TIL assessment may clarify what patients would benefit from adjuvant
chemotherapy in stage II CRC. Combinations of the measurements of two
independent TIL populations can be inspected for determining refined
thresholds at which their prognostic (and predictive) value is maximized.
The foretelling power of TILs warrants refinement using data from randomized
controlled trials, to establish interactions with TNM and the with
post-surgical treatments.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Insufficient repair of DNA lesions results in the
acquisition of somatic mutations and displays the driving force in
cancerogenesis. Ribonucleotide incorporation by eukaryotic DNA polymerases
occurs during every round of genome duplication and represents by far the
most frequent type of naturally occurring DNA lesions. RNAse H2 removes
misincorporated ribonucleotides from genomic DNA in a process termed
ribonucleotide excision repair (RER). Whether intestinal epithelial
proliferation requires RER and whether abrogation of RER is involved in the
etiology of cancerogenesis at all is unknown.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Mice with an epithelial specific deletion of
RNase H2 subunit b (H2b<sup>ΔIEC</sup>) and co-deletion of the tumor
suppressor p53 (H2b/p53<sup>ΔIEC</sup>) were generated and phenotyped at
young and old age. RNA sequencing was performed in isolated epithelial cells
and intestinal organoids. Mutational signature of spontaneous tumors from
H2b/p53<sup>ΔIEC</sup> mice were characterized using exome sequencing.
Association of tumor RNase H2 expression and patient survival was assessed
in transcriptome data from 467 CRC patients.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> H2b<sup>ΔIEC</sup> mice display chronic epithelial DNA
damage and develop a p53-dependent proliferative exhaustion of the
intestinal stem cell compartment. H2b/p53<sup>ΔIEC</sup>mice have restored
epithelial proliferation and spontaneously develop small intestinal
carcinomas. Resulting tumors display a distinct mutational signature
characterized by T &gt; G base substitutions at GpTpG trinucleotides.
Transcriptome data from human colorectal cancer patients indicate that
reduced RNase H2 expression is associated with poor survival in CRC.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We propose a hitherto unappreciated role for RNase H2
as a tumor suppressor gene in CRC. Our mouse model provides a novel tool to
study the impact of abrogated RER on intestinal carcinogenesis.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The cytokine IL-23 is involved in inflammatory bowel
disease pathogenesis. A Phase 2, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind,
placebo (pbo)-controlled trial (NCT02589665) of mirikizumab (miri; IL-23p19
antibody) was conducted to evaluate miri's efficacy and safety in patients
with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC). The primary objective was
to evaluate superiority of miri to pbo in inducing clinical remission at wk
12. Other objectives included clinical response, safety, and adjunctive
inflammatory markers [faecal calprotectin (fCLP), serum C-reactive protein
(CRP)]. The ongoing study's completed induction phase results are reported
here (presented at DDW 2018).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Patients with moderate-to-severe UC (Mayo score
of 6 to 12; endoscopic subscore ≥2) were randomized at equal ratios to
receive pbo (N = 63), miri 50 mg (N = 63) or 200 mg (N = 62) with
possibility of exposure-based<sup>1</sup> increases (2-12-fold or
1.5–3-fold, respectively, up to a 600 mg dose), or a fixed miri 600 mg
(N = 61) dose intravenously at wks. 0, 4, and 8. Patients could receive oral
5-ASA or corticosteroids (≤20 mg/d prednisone equivalent), thiopurines, must
have failed ≥ 1 conventional UC therapy, and could be naïve to or had prior
exposure to biologics. Endoscopic videos were read centrally by experts
blinded to treatment allocation and time point. Comparisons of rates of
clinical remission<sup>2</sup> (primary outcome) and clinical
response<sup>3</sup> were made using logistic regression analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Baseline characteristics were similar among treatment
groups, although mean fCLP and CRP levels were higher in the miri 600 mg
group. Most patients (63%) had been previously exposed to or failed biologic
therapy, with 9.5% and 11.3% in the pbo and pooled miri (Miri all) groups
receiving ≥ 3 biologics, respectively. At wk 12, clinical remission rates
were greater (p &lt; 0.01) in patients treated with miri 200 mg, but not
miri 50 mg or miri 600 mg, versus pbo-treated patients. Clinical response
rates at wk 12 were greater (p &lt; 0.05) for all miri groups, compared to
pbo group. At wk 12, fCLP and CRP levels were reduced (p &lt; 0.05
and &lt; 0.01, respectively) in the Miri All group versus pbo. There were
similar rates of serious adverse events and treatment-emergent adverse
events (TEAEs) across treatment groups.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Miri demonstrated efficacy in the induction treatment
for patients with moderate-to-severe UC, as assessed by multiple measures.
Miri treatment reduced faecal calprotectin and CRP levels across all doses
compared to baseline. Overall adverse event frequencies were similar for
miri and pbo-treated patients. These are the first data evaluating the

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) remission
(CDAI &lt; 150) has been shown to correlate with Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Questionnaire (IBDQ) remission (IBDQ ≥170). However, the correlation between
new clinical endpoints that focus on patient-reported outcomes and quality
of life is not well understood. We examined the relationship between
definitions of clinical remission/endoscopic improvement and IBDQ defined
remission and IBDQ changes.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> In CELEST, adults with active CD (CDAI 220-450),
an average daily very soft/liquid stool frequency (SF) ≥2.5 or daily
abdominal pain (AP) score ≥2.0, and Simplified Endoscopic Score for CD
(SES-CD) ≥6 (≥4 for those with isolated ileitis) were randomised to placebo
or upadacitinib (UPA) 3, 6, 12, or 24 mg twice daily, or 24 mg once daily
for 16 wks. Patients who completed wk 16 were re-randomised to receive UPA
3, 6, 12 mg BID, or 24 mg QD for 36 wks. This analysis included patients who
received UPA induction treatment for 16 wks and patients who achieved
clinical response to UPA at wk 16 and continued to receive UPA until wk 52.
The proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission (SF≤2.8 and
AP≤1.0, both not worse than baseline [BL], among patients with BL SF ≥4 or
AP score ≥2) at wk 16 and 52 and endoscopic improvement (decrease in SES-CD
&gt;50% from BL or endoscopic remission, defined as SES-CD ≤4 and ≥2-point
reduction from BL and no subscore &gt;1) at wk 12/16 and 52 were analysed by
IBDQ remission cut-offs (&lt;170 or ≥170). Correlation of efficacy endpoints
(yes/no) with IBDQ score at wk 16 and 52 were assessed with polychoric
correlation and 2-sided Wald Chi-square test. Changes from BL in IBDQ score
at wk 16 and 52 were also assessed by clinical remission or endoscopic
improvement status at wk 12/16 and 52.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A high correlation between clinical remission and IBDQ
remission (IBDQ≥170) was observed at wk 16 and 52 (p &lt; 0.001;
<bold>Table</bold>). A moderate to high correlation was seen between
endoscopic improvement and IBDQ remission at both time points (p &lt; 0.001;
<bold>Table</bold>). The mean change from BL to wk 16 and 52 in IBDQ
score was numerically higher in patients who achieved clinical remission at
wk 16 and 52 (70.1 and 82.0, respectively) vs those who did not (18.9 and
33.1). Similarly, patients who achieved endoscopic improvement at wk 12/16
and 52 had numerically higher mean changes from BL to wk 16 and 52 in IBDQ
score (57.2 and 67.3, respectively) vs patients who did not (24.2 and
39.8).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In the phase 2 CELEST study of UPA in patients with
CD, the new definitions of clinical remission and endoscopic improvement
correlated significantly with improved quality of life. <table-wrap id="table60-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table60-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table60"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Endpoint</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Week</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">IBDQ ≥170 n/N (%)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">IBDQ &lt;170 n/N (%)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Polychoric correlation</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Clinical remission</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">16</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">30/49 (61.2%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12/93 (12.9%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.727; p&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">52</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">27/35 (77.1%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">8/36 (22.2%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.760; p&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Endoscopic  improvement</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12/16</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">28/54 (51.9%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">14/99 (14.1%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.616; p&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">52</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">24/36 (66.7%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12/40 (30%)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.545; p&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" rowspan="1">IBDQ, Inflammatory Bowel Disease

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Patients with adequately controlled ulcerative
colitis (UC) may have a need to stop pharmacological treatment for a range
of reasons, including adverse events, to accommodate surgery or transition
of care.<sup>1</sup> Tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule Janus kinase
inhibitor that is being investigated for UC. This analysis included patients
with clinical response to 8 weeks of tofacitinib treatment in OCTAVE
Induction 1 &amp; 2 (NCT01465763 &amp; NCT01458951), who were subsequently
randomised to receive placebo in the 52-week OCTAVE Sustain maintenance
study (NCT01458574),<sup>2</sup> ie a surrogate for treatment
interruption.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to evaluate time to treatment failure
following treatment interruption for clinical responders to tofacitinib as
induction therapy. Treatment failure was defined, based on total Mayo score,
as increase ≥3 points from OCTAVE Sustain baseline total Mayo score, plus
increase in rectal bleeding subscore and endoscopic subscore ≥1 point and
absolute endoscopic subscore ≥2 points. Patients with treatment failure
after ≥8 weeks in OCTAVE Sustain were required to discontinue the study.
Dropouts due to insufficient clinical response were treated as treatment
failures. Event rates for treatment failure and quartile event times were
estimated based on the Kaplan-Meier method.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> This analysis included 174 patients who had tofacitinib
induction therapy and were randomised to placebo in OCTAVE Sustain. Baseline
demographics and disease characteristics were consistent with the overall
study population (Table);<sup>2</sup> 52 patients (29.9%) were in remission
at OCTAVE Sustain baseline. The cumulative proportions of patients with
treatment failure over time in OCTAVE Sustain are summarised in the Table.
At Week 52 of OCTAVE Sustain, 124 patients (75.3%) had treatment failure.
The estimated first, second and third quartiles for time to treatment
failure were 65, 135 and 371 days, respectively. Using non-responder
imputation, rates of remission, mucosal healing and clinical response at
Week 52 of OCTAVE Sustain in this placebo group population were 10.3%, 12.6%
and 19.0%, respectively. In this placebo group, the most frequent reason for
discontinuation from the study was insufficient clinical response (including
worsening UC: 69.5% of patients). Subsequent retreatment with tofacitinib 10
mg twice daily in an open-label extension study recaptured remission,
mucosal healing and clinical response in 40.4%, 55.4% and 75.8% of patients,
respectively, by Month 2.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> For patients with initial clinical response to 8 weeks
of tofacitinib induction therapy, treatment failure occurred a median of 135
days after tofacitinib interruption, ie following re-randomisation to
placebo in OCTAVE Sustain. <table-wrap id="table61-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table61-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table61"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1">Table.

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Ustekinumab (UST) is a fully human mAB to IL
12/23p40 approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe active Crohn's
disease (CD). The ongoing IM-UNITI long-term extension (LTE) evaluates the
efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (SC) UST through approximately 5 years
of treatment, with results through wk156 (efficacy assessed at wk152)
reported herein.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> 1281 patients (pts) entered the maintenance
study, including 397 UST induction responders in the primary population
(randomized to SC placebo (PBO), n = 133; UST 90mg q12w, n = 132; or UST
90mg q8w, n = 132). A 1-time dose adjustment to 90mg q8w occurred in
randomized pts who met loss of response criteria between wks8 &amp; 32.
Non-randomized pts included: PBO induction responders who continued on PBO,
non-responders to PBO induction who received UST 130mg IV then UST 90mg SC
q12w if in clinical response at wk8, and non-responders to UST induction who
received UST 90mg SC and if in clinical response at wk8 continued on q8w.
All pts who completed treatment through wk44 were eligible to enter the LTE
continuing on the same treatment they were on at wk44; no dose adjustment
occurred in the LTE. This included 567 UST-treated pts, of which 237 were
from the primary population. PBO-treated patients discontinued treatment
after the study unblinding, which occurred after the Wk44 DBL. Efficacy was
collected every 12wks prior to the study unblinding and then at q12w or q8w
UST dosing visits.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Discontinuation of study agent prior to wk156 occurred in
29.6% of 567 UST-treated pts. Table 1 presents analyses for randomized pts
who entered the LTE where pts with missing data or who terminated study
participation prior to wk152 are assumed not to be in response or remission
at wk152, with 61.9% of q12w pts &amp; 69.5% of q8w pts (non-dose adjusted)
in remission at wk152. Among all UST-treated pts, remission rates at wk152
were 56.3% &amp; 55.1% for q12w and q8w, respectively. In an ITT analysis of
randomized pts from wk 0 of maintenance through wk152, 38% (49/129) of UST
induction responder q12w pts and 43% (55/128) of q8w pts were in remission
at wk152. Antibody to UST rates through wk156 remained low, occurring in
4.0% (8/202) of randomized patients continuously receiving UST (which
excludes randomized PBO dose adjusters) and 4.8% (27/567) of all pts treated
with UST. Safety events (per hundred patient-years) were not higher among
all UST-treated pts entering the LTE compared to PBO from wk44 through
wk156, including overall AE's (325.26 vs 358.8), SAEs (19.4 vs 23.11), and
serious infections (4.14 vs 4.62), with 1061.6 patient-years of follow-up
among UST-treated pts and 173.1 patient-years of follow-up among PBO pts.
Among all UST-treated pts, there were 3 deaths (ESRD, acute MI, sepsis)
between weeks 96 and 156. There were 2 non-NMSC malignancies (adenocarcinoma
of the small intestine and CML) reported between wks96 and 156.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> SC UST maintained clinical response and remission
through 3 years in a substantial proportion of patients, particularly those
who were naïve to TNF antagonists. UST was well-tolerated through 3 years,
with no new safety signals observed. <table-wrap id="table62-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table62-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table62"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Continuous 90 mg UST Q12 wks (n = 84)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Continuous 90 mg UST Q8wks (n = 82)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Patients with Prior Dose- adjustment

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The efficacy and safety of risankizumab (RZB), an
IL-23 inhibitor, as induction and maintenance treatment in patients (pts)
with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease (CD) have been previously
described.<sup>1,2</sup> Pts who responded to RZB in the Ph2 induction
and maintenance study<sup>2</sup> could enrol in an open-label extension
(OLE) study. Interim efficacy and safety of RZB maintenance treatment, up to
2 years, are reported from the ongoing OLE.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Pts who achieved clinical response (decrease
from baseline [BL] in CD Activity Index [CDAI] ≥100) without remission
(CDAI &lt; 150) after Period 2 (week 26) or clinical response and/or
remission after Period 3 (week 52) of the preceding study<sup>1</sup> were
enrolled to receive open-label 180 mg s.c. RZB every 8 weeks for up to 216
weeks. Pts who lost clinical response or remission after completion of the
preceding study were re-induced with open-label 600 mg i.v. RZB infusions at
weeks 0, 4, 8. Pts could only receive subsequent 180 mg s.c. RZB maintenance
treatment if they achieved response or remission following re-induction
treatment. Ileocolonoscopy was performed at yearly visits.
Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were collected throughout the study
participation for up to 15 weeks after the last dose of study drug or up to
the data cut-off date of March 31, 2018. Efficacy data (clinical remission
and endoscopic remission [CD Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) ≤4 or
CDEIS ≤2 for pts with initial isolated ileitis]) are reported up to week 48,
when all pts enrolled in the OLE had the opportunity to reach the visit date
before the interim cut-off date. Non-responder imputation (NRI) was used for
missing data.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 65 adults with CD were enrolled, including 4
pts who were re-induced. At BL of preceding study, median (range) age 34
(19-67) years and median disease duration 10 (2-38) years; 60 pts (92.3%)
were previously exposed to TNF antagonists; 13 pts (20%) and 21 pts (32.3%)
were receiving corticosteroids and immunomodulators, respectively at BL of
preceding study. The mean (SD) exposure to RZB was 657.2 (190.73) days
(Median: 689; Range: 164-900). As of the data cut-off date, 14 (21.5%) pts
have prematurely discontinued from the study. At Week 0 of the current
study, 48/65 (73.9%) pts were in clinical remission and 28/65 (43.1%) pts
had endoscopic remission. Clinical remission rates were sustained up to week
48 (Table). The proportion of pts with endoscopic remission increased from
BL to week 48 (Table). AEs were reported for 58/65 (89.2%) pts; 18 (27.7%)
pts had serious AEs. The most common AEs occurring in &gt;10% of pts were
nasopharyngitis (26.2%), fatigue (16.9%), arthralgia, and worsening CD
(15.4% each). 4 serious infections in 5 pts were perianal abscess (1 pt),
<italic>Campylobacter</italic> infection (1 pt), viral gastroenteritis
(2 pts), and peritonitis (2 pts). No events of tuberculosis, malignancies,
or deaths occurred in the study. <table-wrap id="table63-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table63-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table63"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Clinical remission n/N (%)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Endoscopic remission<sup>a</sup> n/N (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Week 0<sup>b</sup></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">48/65 (73.8)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">27/65 (41.5)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Week 8</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">47/65 (72.3)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Week 16</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">46/65 (70.8)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Week 32</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">48/65 (73.8)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Week 48</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">45/65 (69.2)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">35/65 (53.8)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>All patients in the OLE had the opportunity to reach

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> SHP647 is a fully human IgG<sub>2</sub> monoclonal
antibody that binds to human mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1
(MAdCAM-1) to reduce lymphocyte homing to the gastrointestinal tract. In a
12-week (wk), randomized, double-blind phase 2 trial (TURANDOT;
NCT01620255), SHP647 was well tolerated and superior to placebo for the
induction of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis
(UC).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This phase 2, multicentre, 2-part, open-label
(OL) extension study (TURANDOT II; NCT01771809) assessed the long-term
safety and tolerability of SHP647 in patients with moderate-to-severe UC who
previously completed the induction study TURANDOT I on placebo or 7.5mg,
22.5mg, 75mg or 225mg s.c. SHP647 every 4 wks and had discontinued
immunosuppressants. At TURANDOT II baseline, patients were randomized to
75mg or 225mg s.c. SHP647 every 4 wks for 18 months (wks 0-72; OL period 1).
Those assigned to 75mg and having relapse or no response by wk 8 could
undergo dose escalation to 225mg, at the investigator's discretion. In the
second OL treatment period (OL period 2), all patients received 75mg every 4
wks for a further 18 months (wks 76-144). Patients were followed up for
safety 3 and 6 months after treatment cessation. Primary endpoints were
adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs) and AEs leading to withdrawal.
Mucosal healing (Mayo endoscopic subscore 0 or 1, centrally-read endoscopy),
clinical remission (total Mayo score ≤2 with no individual subscore &gt;1,
rectal bleed subscore 0 or 1) and response (based on total Mayo score) were
assessed at wk 16.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 331 patients were screened and randomized to
75mg (n = 165) or 225mg (n = 166). One patient was randomized to 75mg but
not treated; 180 patients completed OL period 1 with 94 escalating from 75mg
to 225mg, and 127 patients completed OL period 2. Table 1 shows the
incidences of AEs and SAEs. 1 fatal treatment-emergent adverse event was
reported, a 26-year-old woman (75mg escalated to 225mg) who died of
pulmonary embolism; this was not considered drug-related. There were no
reports of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or lymphoproliferative
disorders. Serious infections were infrequent (n = 18, 5.5%). The most
reported term was gastroenteritis (n = 3, 0.9%), 1 case was considered
drug-related. Overall, UC was the most frequently-reported SAE (10.0%) and
the most common AE leading to treatment withdrawal (7.0%). At wk 16, the
following rates of clinical response (56.1% and 57.2%), clinical remission
(18.3% and 22.3%) and mucosal healing (27.4% and 29.5%) were observed in
patients in the 75mg and 225mg groups, respectively. Among patients who had
achieved clinical response in the induction study (75mg and 225mg groups),
rates of clinical response (79.7% and 77.3%), clinical remission (30.4% and
40.0%) and mucosal healing (43.0% and 50.7%) reported at wk 16 were markedly
higher. While the likelihood of completing OL period 1 was similar for
patients randomized to receive 75mg (54.9%) and 225mg (54.2%), within the
75mg group the completion rate was higher for the 70 patients who did not
escalate than for the 94 patients who did (81.4% vs 35.1%).</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The aim of endoscopic surveillance of Barrett's
oesophagus (BO) is prevention of invasive adenocarcinoma by detection of
early neoplasia. However, in the absence of histologic dysplasia it is
difficult to assess the risk of progression. Molecular biomarkers could aid
risk stratification. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of a
panel of biomarkers on a small number of biopsies in predicting neoplastic
progression of BO.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> In a previous prospective study in three
European centres we tested 9 biomarkers on endoscopic biopsies targeted by
autofluorescence imaging for diagnosis of dysplasia. The biomarker panel
included p53 and cyclinA immunohistochemistry (IHC), aneuploidy and
G2/tetraploidy, hypermethylation of p16, RUNX3 and HPP1, and loss of
heterozygosity at 9p and 17p loci. Patients without baseline high-grade
dysplasia (HGD) or intramucosal cancer (IMC) were followed up
endoscopically. Logistic regression by stepwise selection approach and LASSO
regularization was used to select the most predictive biomarkers to form a
small panel. Fisher's exact test was used to calculate odds ratios (OR).
Means and medians were compared with Mann-Whitney and Student t-test. The
primary endpoint was any histologic progression (progression from
non-dysplastic BO to any grade of dysplasia or progression from low-grade
[LGD] to HGD/IMC). Secondary endpoints included any progression to HGD/IMC
and time to progression.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 203 patients with BO in the original cohort, 78
were excluded due to HGD/IMC at baseline endoscopy (n = 29), LGD treated
with RFA at follow up (n = 8) and lack of follow up (n = 41). The
characteristics of the 125 patients included in the analysis are shown in

</p>
<p>Logistic regression analysis revealed that p53 and aneuploidy were the only
covariates which independently predicted progression to dysplasia
(Regression coefficient: 0.91 +/-0.46 and 1.39 +/-0.67, respectively). p53
had an OR for any neoplastic progression of 2.94 (CI 1.30–6.66,
p &lt; 0.01), while aneuploidy had an OR of 5.37 (CI 1.54–18.76,
p &lt; 0.01). Of the remaining biomarkers, cyclinA was a weak predictor but
missed statistical significance (p = 0.08). The ORs for progression to
HGD/IMC for p53 and aneuploidy were 3.77 (CI 1.53–9.29, p &lt; 0.01) and
6.17 (CI 1.65–23.11, p &lt; 0.01), respectively. When combined into a
2-biomarker panel with a cut-off of 1 positive biomarker, p53 and aneuploidy
had OR of 3.66 (CI 1.59–8.45, p &lt; 0.01) for any progression and 4.81 (CI
1.90–12.14, p &lt; 0.001) for progression to HGD/IMC. Moreover, we tested
whether the addition of cyclinA improved risk stratification. The
3-biomarker panel with a cut-off of 2 positive markers predicted any
neoplastic progression with an OR of 7.57 (CI 1.86–30.81, p &lt; 0.001), and
progression to HGD/IMC with an OR of 12.50 (CI 3.43–45.60, p &lt; 0.0001).
Finally, among progressors, those with positive biomarker panel had
significantly shorter time-to-progression compared to patients with negative
biomarker panel (Median 0.42 vs 1.47 yrs, p &lt; 0.01).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In conclusion, we found that a small 3-biomarker
panel, comprising of p53, aneuploidy and cyclinA, on biopsies targeted by
advanced imaging, is a strong predictor of neoplastic progression in
patients with BO and could inform endoscopic management.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Information for prediction factors of concurrent
chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) response has been limited. Patents derived
organoid have advantages in providing more physiologically relevant and
predictive data for <italic>in-vivo</italic> response.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Patient-derived organoid culture was performed
using tumor tissues acquired from esophageal cancer before 1st CCRT start.
After 7 days cultured, same sized organoids were collected and were treated
with 5-FU and 5Gy radiotherapy was provided. After 6 days, primary cultured
cells were stained and fluorescent images were captured. Clinical response
was assessed after 4th cycle CCRT. Clinical response was classified as
complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), and disease progression
(PD).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 27 esophageal cancer patients were enrolled.
Final success rate of patient-derived organoid culture was 78% (21/27). CCRT
response in patient-derived organoids were evaluated in 21 cases. A total of
16 persons were followed up more than 4 cycles of CCRT and were analyzed.
Clinical CR was observed in 10 persons and 2 persons showed clinical PR
(n = 4) or PD (n = 2). Live activity was noted in less than 10% of organoids
in all patients with clinical CR and was observed in 30-40% of organoids in
all patients with clinical PD. Live activity was noted in less than 20-30%
of organoids ls in all patients with clinical PR.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> It takes 2 weeks to evaluate the CCRT response in
organoids from tissue acquirement. High agreement between clinical response
and response in organoids was observed. The evaluation of CCRT response in
organoids will provide a good predictor of clinical CCRT response and
precision medicine.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The incidence of Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma (OAC) is
increasing, with the only known precursor lesion being Barrett's Oesophagus
(BO). Even though there is an association of BO and OAC with obesity and
diet, little is known about the responsible mechanisms. Confounding
environmental or dietary factors that are prevalent in obese patients might
also influence the risk of BO progression. Changes in diet lead to
alterations in the gut microbiome and such alterations could have an effect
on the susceptibility to gastrointestinal neoplasia. A possible link of
microbiome changes in BO and OAC needs to be analyzed in order to understand
the role of the microbiome for carcinogenesis or cancer prevention and
surveillance strategies.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To investigate whether the gut microbiota
influences inflammation and tumor development in our mouse model, we for the
first time re-derived germ-free (GF) L2-IL-1β mice (IL-1β). We further
utilized changes in the diet and housing, specifically a
specific-pathogen-free (SPF) and an open cage facility. Using histology and
immunohistochemistry the phenotype of the mice was evaluated. The microbiome
was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing followed by sequence analysis
using QIIME and mothur followed by LEfSe. The PICRUSt pipeline was then used
for <italic>in silico</italic> pathway analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> IL-1β mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) with 48% fat
compared to regular lab chow, or HFD matched control diet (Ctrl) showed a
more severe phenotype with increased dysplasia. The HFD phenotype could be
reproduced in the open cage facility, where we additionally observed an
increased phenotype with HFD leading to a further acceleration compared to
the SPF. Elimination of the microbiota led to a marked reduction of
inflammation, metaplasia and most important dysplasia in the BE mouse model.
This correlated with a reduced influx of neutrophils and immature myeloid
cells into the esophagus of germ-free IL-1β mice, directly linking the gut
microbiome to the inflammatory phenotype. In summary an increase of the
phenotype could be observed with decreasing hygiene level.</p>
<p>Since the lower GI tract harbors the majority of the intestinal microbiota, we
analyzed the intestinal microbiota by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of
fecal samples. While only a modest reduction in microbial diversity could be
observed, analysis of microbial β-diversity showed separate clustering of
HFD fed IL-1β mice in comparison to all other groups, due to a unique
taxonomic profile. We further observed an altered
<italic>Firmicutes</italic> to<italic> Bacteroidetes</italic> ratio,
correlating with similar alterations of this ratio in patients. Changes in
community structure in microbiota from HFD fed IL-1β mice pointed to unique
functions. PICRUSt analysis of 16S data generated a predictive metagenome
with different clustering of the KEGG data in the IL-1β mice with HFD
compared to Chow and Ctrl, suggesting a functional microbial high-fat
associated component contributing to disease acceleration. One of the most
significantly regulated pathways in the predictive KEGG analysis of the
community profile was bacterial Lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in HFD fed
IL-1β mice.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results demonstrate an influence of the gut
microbiome on oesophageal carcinogenesis. While the mechanisms responsible
for these differences need to be investigated, studies in patients should be
performed. Changes in the microbiome of BO patients could be used to
identify patients at risk for progression to OAC or the microbiome could be
changed by dietary or drug interventions for a more favorable outcome.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> HEROES was a 16-wk double-blind (DB),
placebo-controlled, phase 2, multicenter trial followed by a 52-wk
open-label extension (OLE) in adults with active eosinophilic esophagitis
(EoE) that demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in esophageal
eosinophil count and improvements in EoE Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS),
EoE Histology Grade, Stage Score (EoEHSS), and patient perception of disease
severity and symptoms. The objective of OLE was to characterize the effects
of RPC4046 for up to 52 wks.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Patients who completed the 16-wk DB,
placebo-controlled period entered OLE and received weekly doses of RPC4046
360 mg subcutaneously. Esophageal biopsies and clinical assessments occurred
at OLE wks 12, 24, and 52. Outcomes included assessment of mean and peak
esophageal eosinophil count, EoEHSS, EREFS, symptoms (EoE Activity Index
[EEsAI]), and safety. Esophageal eosinophil counts and histology scores were
determined by a central pathologist. OLE analysis was performed according to
the original DB treatment assignment.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In the DB period, 99 patients were randomized 1:1:1 to
RPC4046 360 mg (n = 34), RPC4046 180 mg (n = 31), or placebo (n = 34). 90
patients completed the 16-wk DB period, 86 entered OLE, and 66 completed the
additional 52 wks of therapy. Mean esophageal eosinophil counts (cells/hpf)
in OLE remained stable in patients on RPC4046 360 mg or 180 mg prior to OLE
but improved rapidly in patients on placebo prior to OLE. Similar effects by
treatment group before OLE entry were seen across other outcome measures:
peak eosinophil count, EREFS over all locations, and EoEHSS grade and stage.
In OLE, the proportion of patients achieving symptomatic remission as
determined by an EEsAI score ≤20 was 24.4% (OLE baseline), 44.4% (wk 12),
51.3% (wk 24), and 58.2% (wk 52). The most frequent adverse events (AEs)
(≥10%) in OLE were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis,
oropharyngeal pain, sinusitis, and headache. Types and incidence rates of
AEs in OLE were consistent with those in the DB period. The overall
incidence rate of AEs/100 patient-yrs of exposure remained consistent in OLE
relative to the DB period.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Patients who received RPC4046 360 mg or 180 mg in the
DB period and received 360 mg in OLE had sustained clinical and histologic
improvement of EoE disease activity through 52 wks. Patients who received
placebo during the DB period and then received RPC4046 360 mg in OLE showed
improvement by wk 12 that was maintained through wk 52. Generally, the

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The best approach for <italic>Helicobacter
pylori</italic> management remains unclear. An audit process is
essential to ensure that clinical practice is aligned with best standards of
care.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of most
common first line treatments. International multicenter prospective
non-interventional registry starting in 2013 aimed to evaluate the decisions
and outcomes of <italic>H. pylori</italic> management by European
gastroenterologists. National coordinators were selected from each country
to identify a representative group of recruiters. All infected adult
patients were systematically registered at an e-CRF by AEG-REDCap.
<italic>Variables included</italic>: Patient demographics, previous
eradication attempts, prescribed treatment, adverse events, and outcomes.
Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed. Data monitoring
was performed to ensure the quality of the data.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> So far, 21,300 patients from 27 European countries have
been evaluated. Average age was 49 years, 60% were women, and 18% had peptic
ulcer. The majority of cases (78%, 16,614 patients) were naïve to <italic>H.
pylori</italic> treatment. Pre-treatment resistance rates were: 24% to
clarithromycin, 34% to metronidazole, and 14% to both. Drug prescription and
efficacy is shown in the table. Triple therapy with amoxicillin and
clarithromycin was the most commonly prescribed (45%), achieving
overall &lt; 80% eradication rate. Over 90% eradication was obtained only
with 10-day bismuth quadruple therapies or 14-day concomitant treatment.
Longer treatment duration, higher acid inhibition and compliance were
associated with higher eradication rates in the multivariate analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Management of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection by
European gastroenterologists is heterogeneous, suboptimal and frequently
discrepant with current recommendations. Only quadruple therapies lasting at
least 10 days are able to achieve over 90% eradication rates. <table-wrap id="table67-2050640618792817" orientation="portrait" position="float"><alternatives><graphic specific-use="table67-2050640618792817" xlink:href="10.1177_2050640618792817-table67"></graphic><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left" valign="top"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Treatment</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">N</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">% Use</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">ITT</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">(95% CI)</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">PP</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">(95% CI)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left" valign="top"><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">PPI + C+A</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">6,998</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">41,4%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">70.7%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(74.6–76.7)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">77.9%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(76.9–78.8)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">PPI + C+A+M</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3,285</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">19.8%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">87.3%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(86.0–88.3)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">89.4%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(88.3–90.4)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">PPI + C+M</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">980</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5.8%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">74.6%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(71.3–79.6)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">81.4%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(78.8–83.9)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">PPI + C+A+T seq</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">795</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5.2%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">80.0%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(78.6–82.5)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">93.3%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(91.5–95.0)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">PPI + C+A+B</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">898</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">5.4%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">86.1%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(83.3–88.9)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">87.7%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(85.3–90.0)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">PPI + C+A+M seq</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">626</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">4.0%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">75.2%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(72.9–78.2)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">82.4%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(79.4–85.3)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">PPI + A+M</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">511</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3.1%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">70.5%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(67.9–74.8)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">82.4%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(79.0–85.7)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">PPI + A+L</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">378</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2.3%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">78.0%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(73.6–82.1)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">79.5%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(75.3–83.6)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">PPI + M+Tc+B s.c.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">422</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2.6%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">89.2%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(85.8–92.3)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">95.3%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(92.6–97.9)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">PPI + C+A+T</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">142</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.9%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">86.2%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(81.2–91.1)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">94.4%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(90.6–98.1)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">PPI + M+Tc+B</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">179</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.1%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">77.1%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(73.1–80.0)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">90.8%</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">(86.0–95.5)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>ITT – intention to treat, PP – per-protocol, 95%CI –

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Despite successful <italic>H. pylori</italic> (HP)
eradication, some individuals can still progress to gastric cancer (GC).
Although statin has been shown to reduce the risk of gastric cancer, the
results are largely confounded by the presence of HP infection. The aim of
this study was to explore the potential effects of statin uses on gastric
cancer development in a large cohort of HP-eradicated subjects.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> This cohort study was based on the
territory-wide electronic healthcare database of Hong Kong, from which all
subjects prescribed with clarithromycin-based triple therapy for HP
infection between 2003 and 2012 were identified. The observation period
commenced from the date of HP therapy and the follow-up was censored at GC
diagnosis, death or study end date (December 2015). Statin use was defined
as &gt;30-day use during the study period. Exclusion criteria included GC
diagnosed within the first year of HP therapy, prior history of GC or
gastrectomy, and failure of HP eradication. The hazard ratio (HR) of GC with
statin use was estimated by Cox model with propensity score adjustment for
other variables (age, sex, comorbidities and other medications use).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In total, 63,605 HP eradicated patients were included in
analysis including 15,990 (25.1%) statin users. During a median follow-up of
7.6 (IQR: 5.1–10.3) years, 169 (0.27%) developed GC (incidence rate: 3.5 per
10,000 person-years) and the median age at gastric cancer diagnosis was 71.1
(IQR 61.6–81.8) years. The median cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) of
statin users was 432. A lower GC risk was observed in statin users (HR
derived from propensity score adjustment with trimming 0.30; 95% CI
0.18–0.52) than non-users. The propensity score adjusted absolute risk
difference between statin and non-statin use was 2.76 fewer gastric cancers
(95% CI 1.89–3.24) per 10,000 person-years. By stratified analysis, the
protective effect of statin was significant for non-cardia cancer (HR 0.27;

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Besides refractory celiac diseases, severe
enteropathies with intestinal villous atrophy, autoimmune enteropathy (AIE)
or associated with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), remain
therapeutic challenges.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Identification of genetic defect may help for
targeted therapy. We used a dedicated next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS)
covering all exons of 100 genes on genomic DNA from 21 adult patients
referred for non-celiac enteropathy with villous atrophy (2001-2017).
Complementary analysis with Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed in 5
patients and their relatives.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> All the 21 patients (15F/6M) had chronic diarrhea,
malnutrition and intestinal villous atrophy refractory to a gluten free
diet. 5 patients had AIE with serum anti-AIE-75KD antibodies and 16 patients
had CVID. One patient had both CVID and detectable serum anti-AIE 75KD
antibodies. Monogenic intestinal disorder was identified in 10/21 (48%)
patients. Targeted NGS revealed mutations in following genes: STAT-3
(n = 3), CTLA-4 (n = 3), ICOS (n = 1), LRBA (n = 1), TNFA1P (n = 1) and
NFKB1 (n = 1). Targeted therapy was initiated in 2 patients with CTLA-4
mutations and in 1 patient with and STAT-3 mutation.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Genetic study of adult patients with non-celiac severe
enteropathy with villous atrophy reveals monogenic disorder in half of cases
with possibility of targeted therapy.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Several risk scores have been developed for
prediction of mortality in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding
(UGIB). It would be clinically useful if a score was accurate at predicting
mortality in both UGIB and lower GI bleeding (LGIB). The recently described
pre-endoscopic International Bleeding Risk Score (IBRS) includes the
variables: age, comorbidities (altered mental status, liver cirrhosis,
disseminated malignancy, ASA-score), and blood tests (urea, albumin,
creatinine) and was developed for predicting 30-day mortality in UGIB. IBRS
performed well in its derivation dataset but requires external
validation.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We sought to validate the IBRS in both UGIB and
LGIB using international datasets. We assessed the performance of the IBRS
for predicting 30-day mortality in UGIB using prospectively collected data
on 3324 consecutive cases from a national Italian database, 547 consecutive
cases admitted to a Spanish hospital, and retrospectively collected data on
148 consecutive patients admitted to an Israeli hospital. 2) We compared the
performance of the IBRS to the AIMS65 and Admission Rockall score (ARS)
using the IBRS derivation data from a recently published international study
of 3012 consecutive UGIB patients. 3) We assessed the performance of the
IBRS in predicting 30-day mortality in LGIB using data from a UK audit of
2340 patients.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 1) Validation of IBRS in UGIB: 4019 patients were
included in the validation cohorts with mean age 67 years, mean ASA-score of
2.3, and mortality 7.0%. The IBRS had an area under the receiving operator
characteristic curves (AUROC) for prediction of mortality of 0.81 (95% CI:
0.78–0.83). Patients with low IBRS (≤3; 34%) had a mortality rate of 1.0%
whereas patients with high IBRS (≥8; 15%) had a mortality rate of 25%.
Performance of IBRS in each cohort is shown in table 1. 2) Comparison of
IBRS with AIMS65 and ARS: IBRS had similar overall diagnostic ability for
prediction of mortality as AIMS65 (AUROCs: 0.81 vs 0.79; p = 0.23), but was
superior to ARS (AUROCs: 0.81 vs 0.76; p &lt; 0.012). Classified low-risk
patients using IBRS had lower mortality than those classified low-risk with
AIMS65 (threshold ≤ 1) (1.0 vs 3.4%; p &lt; 0.001). Although IBRS classified
a higher number of patients as being at low risk of death compared with ARS
(threshold ≤ 1) (34% vs 30%; p &lt; 0.001), the mortality rates were similar
among classified low-risk patients (1.0 vs. 1.3%). 3) Validation of IBRS in
LGIB: The IBRS was also closely associated with mortality in LGIB (AUROC:
0.84 (95% CI: 0.79–0.89). Patients with IBRS≤3 (55%) had a mortality rate of
0.6% whereas patients with IBRS≥8 (3.3%) had a mortality rate of 18%.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> IBRS has good performance for predicting 30-day
mortality in both UGIB and LGIB. One third of UGIB patients and more than
half of LGIB patients can be identified by IBRS as having very low risk of
death. IBRS enables identification of a higher number of true low-risk
patients than ARS, and mortality among classified low-risk patients is lower
with IBRS than AIMS65. IBRS also enables early identification of patients at
high risk of death which may allow targeted management to improve outcome.

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Microplastic is defined as plastic particles with a
size of 5mm to 1µm. The world plastic production has been growing
exponentially within the past years, reaching up to 300 megatons/year.
Pollution causes plastic to accumulate in the sea, where it is ingested by
sea animals, thus integrating plastic into the food chain. Significant
amounts of microplastic have been detected in tuna, lobster and shrimp.
Microplastic may harm via bioaccumulation (especially when the intestinal
barrier is damaged) and can serve as a vector for toxic chemicals or
pathogens. Moreover, ingested plastic may affect intestinal villi,
nutritional uptake and can induce hepatic stress. Since human data is very
scarce, we are the first to quantify and characterize microplastic in human
stool.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> In this prospective pilot study, 8 healthy
participants from Finland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia,
United Kingdom and Austria were included. Exclusion criteria were:
gastrointestinal disease, recent dental treatment, medical diets, alcohol
abuse and intake of drugs affecting stool frequency, consistency or
resorption. The participants documented daily food intake for a week before
sampling ∼100g of stool. After clearing samples from liquids and natural
organic solids (e.g., bacterial biomass, undigested plant matter, proteins,
and fats), the remaining particles of 50-500 micrometer size were
characterized using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) micro-spectroscopy.
The data analysis consisted of screening for 11 plastic types: PS, PU, PE,
PP, PVC, PET, PA, PC, PMMA, POM and MF.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Exposure to plastic was frequent among the 8 participants
(age 46 ± 12 years; 37% male). In the week before sampling 21 ± 12 dishes
with plastic wrapping were consumed and daily 740 ± 580ml water were drunk
from plastic bottles (11% fizzy drinks). None was vegetarian and sea fish
was consumed by 6 participants (2.6x/week). 3 participants used polyethylene
glycol (PEG) containing tooth-paste. 5/8 samples have been analyzed so far.
The analytical screening identified polystyrene (PS) and polyurethane (PU)
plastics in 2 of 5 samples, while in the other samples no definite results
are yet obtainable due to high residual cellulose and fat content masking
the presence of microplastic.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Increased plastic pollution can cause plastic
contamination of foods, which may affect the GI-tract. We are the first to
detect presence of polystyrene and polyurethane microparticles in human
stool samples. Currently, we are optimizing the stool-sample separation
technique of clearing non-plastic particles to further improve
quantification and characterisation of microplastic load by FT-IR
micro-spectroscopy.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Accurate differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy
is important to determine appropriate treatment course. Endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) with Doppler function is useful to obtain detailed images
of lymph nodes, although its capability for differential diagnosis remains
unsatisfactory. Contrast enhanced EUS (CE-EUS) allows qualitative and
quantitative evaluation based on real-time perfusion imaging. CE-EUS has
potential to be able to differentiate malignant from benign lesions more
accurately without any further invasive technique such as fine needle
aspiration (FNA).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to evaluate the
efficacy of CE-EUS in differentiating malignant from benign lymphadenopathy.
Patients who underwent EUS-FNA for abdominal or mediastinal lymphadenopathy
around upper gastrointestinal tract were prospectively enrolled between
August 2016 and March 2018 at 3 tertiary care centers. The lymphadenopathy
of long axis &gt; 10mm detected by B-mode EUS was included. The vascular
(hypervascular or hypovascular) and enhancement (homogeneous or
heterogeneous) patterns of lymphadenopathy were qualitatively evaluated
during CE-EUS. The echo intensity change in the lymphadenopathy was
quantitatively evaluated by time intensity curve (TIC) analysis with regard
to the following aspects: peak intensity, time to peak, intensity gain,
velocity of increase and velocity of reduction in 60 seconds. The final
diagnoses were obtained by either EUS-FNA diagnosis with at least 6 months
follow-up or surgical diagnosis.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Consecutive 100 patients with 34 mediastinal and 66
abdominal lymphadenopathies were enrolled. The final diagnoses were 70
malignant lesions [34 malignant lymphomas, 24 adenocarcinomas, 9 other
carcinomas, 2 neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and 1 neuroendocrine tumor
(NET)] and 30 benign lesions (18 reactive lymph nodes, 10 sarcoidosises, 1
tuberculosis and 1 nontuberculous mycobacterium infection). The vascular and
enhancement patterns were classified into the three categories:
hypervascular with homogeneous (23 malignant and 26 benign), hypervascular
with heterogeneous (11 malignant and 2 benign) and hypovascular with
heterogeneous (36 malignant and 2 benign). When the heterogeneous
enhancement was defined as malignancy, the sensitivity, specificity, and
accuracy of the qualitative assessment in CE-EUS were 67.1%, 86.7% and 73%,
respectively. Since hypervascular with homogenous enhancement in CE-EUS had
a mix of benign and malignant lesions, TIC for hypervascluar with homogenous
lesions was applied and showed that the velocity of reduction showed
significant difference between malignant lesion than benign one
(p = 0.0011). The ROC analysis of velocity of reduction for malignancy
showed area under the curve of 0.77 with the optimal cut-off value of 0.149
dB/s. With this cut-off value, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in
velocity of reduction for malignancy in hypervascluar with homogenous
lesions were 65%, 88.5% and 80.9%, respectively. The sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy of CE-EUS for malignancy were improved to 88.6%,
76.7%, and 85%, respectively, if the qualitative and quantitative analysis
were combined in CE-EUS.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although the qualitative analysis in CE-EUS for
mediastinal or abdominal lymphadenopathy only showed the decent diagnostic
accuracy of 73%, the combined qualitative and quantitative analyses improved
the diagnostic accuracy to 85%. CE-EUS with the combined qualitative and
quantitative analyses for lymphadenopathy might be useful to complement
regular EUS and EUS-FNA.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNA) has been the
preferred method of specimen evaluation for the past 25 years. Recently,
fine needle biopsy (FNB) has become increasingly popular to procure
histological core tissue. Although several studies have compared both
methods, the impact of FNB on clinical practice is unclear.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to evaluate the impact of FNB on
EUS-guided sampling of solid masses over a 4-year period. EUS-FNA using a 22
or 25G needle was the preferred technique for sampling solid mass lesions
from 2014-2015 and EUS-FNB using a 22G needle from 2016-2017. Suction was
not applied, stylet was not used after the first pass and fanning maneuver
was adopted. Per unit policy, after establishing an onsite diagnostic
adequacy by rapid evaluation (ROSE), 2 dedicated passes were performed for
offsite assessment by cell block preparation. The main outcome measures were
1) Compare the median number of passes required to achieve diagnostic
adequacy at ROSE, 2) Compare diagnostic yield at offsite assessment by cell
block, which was defined as presence of histological tissue conducive for
interpretation.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 3020 patients who underwent EUS-guided sampling of
solid masses, 2082 (68.9%) underwent FNA and 938 (31.1%) underwent FNB.
Lesions were pancreatic 2154 (71.3%), subepithelial 218 (7.2%), lymph nodes
352 (11.7%) or other 296 (9.8%). The median number of passes to achieve
diagnostic adequacy at ROSE was significantly lower for FNB compared to FNA
(1 [IQR 1-2] vs. 2 [IQR 1-3], p &lt; 0.001), irrespective of the lesion
type. Also, the diagnostic yield for offsite assessment by cell block was
significantly higher for FNB compared to FNA (92.3 vs. 71.1%, p &lt; 0.001).
On multivariable logistic regression analysis, the use of a FNB needle was
associated with the need for only 1 pass to achieve diagnostic adequacy at
ROSE (odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% CI, 2.4–3.4, p &lt; 0.001) and for obtaining
diagnostic adequacy at cell block (OR 4.4, 95% CI, 3.3–5.9,
p &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> EUS-guided FNB should be the preferred technique for
sampling solid mass lesions given its superior performance over EUS-FNA for
both onsite and offsite assessment.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) represents a heterogeneous
group of biliary cancers with poor prognosis. The etiology of the majority
of CCAs is unknown, but conditions such as primary sclerosing cholangitis
(PSC) are risk factors. Simultaneously, PSC patients frequently (80%)
present inflammatory bowel disease, mainly ulcerative colitis (UC). To date,
there are not available sensitive and specific non-invasive biomarkers for
the early diagnosis and monitoring of CCA, PSC and UC.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of this study was to investigate the
potential value of serum and urine extracellular vesicles (EVs) as carriers
of mRNA biomarkers for CCA, PSC and UC.</p>
<p>EVs were isolated from serum and urine of CCA (n = 13 and 28), PSC (n = 8 and
7), UC (n = 8 and 12) and healthy (n = 9 and 5) individuals, using
ultracentrifugation/filtration methods. The content of EVs was determined by
mRNA microarray-based transcriptomics<bold>.</bold></p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Both serum and urine EVs showed round morphology (by
transmission electron microscopy), similar size (∼180 nm diameter by
nanoparticle tracking analysis) and markers (CD9, CD63 and CD81 by
immunoblotting) consistent with exosomes and small-size microvesicles. The
mRNA profiles of serum EVs revealed 1,091 mRNA transcripts differentially
expressed (p &lt; 0.01) in CCA vs. controls, 100 in PSC vs. controls, 87 in
UC vs. controls, 1,522 in CCA vs. PSC, and 107 in PSC vs. UC. Moreover, the
mRNA profiles of urine EVs revealed 963 mRNA transcripts differentially
expressed (p &lt; 0.01) in CCA vs. controls, 334 in PSC vs. controls, 386 in
UC vs. controls, 263 in CCA vs. PSC, and 98 in PSC vs. UC. In serum EVs,
<italic>RCN1</italic> and <italic>PON1</italic> transcripts had area
under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.974 and 0.959 in CCA vs. controls,
respectively, <italic>MTRF1L</italic> (AUC = 0.947) and
<italic>XKR6</italic> (AUC = 0.936) in PSC vs. controls,
<italic>LOC441376</italic> (AUC = 0.937) and <italic>P4HA1</italic>
(AUC = 0.927) in UC vs. controls, <italic>CMIP</italic> (AUC = 1.000) and

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Nucleos(t)ical analogues appear to reduce the risk
of hepatocellular carinoma (HCC) compared to untreated patients due to
virosuppression. However, HCC continues to occur in treated patients with
virologic remission. The most important challenge is to identify of patients
requiring close monitoring of HCC undergoing treatment. For this, many
scores were used and appear to have good predictability.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aims of this study was to assess the
accuracy of the PAGE-B score and to compare its predictive value with that
of other conventional HCC risk prediction models such as REACH B score.</p>
<p>This is a retrospective study about 7 years (2011-2016) including all patients
with chronic hepatitis B with or without cirrhosis undergoing entecavir
(ETV) for at least 1 year. Date of inclusion was the start-up day treatment.
Patients with C, HIV or D coinfection were not included. Clinical
examination and biological examinations and abdominal ultrasound were
performed every 6 months. PAGE-B and REACH-B scores were calculated on the
inclusion date. PAGE-B was also calculated 1 year after treatment. The SPSS
software was used in its 22nd version to carry out the statistics.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, 65 patients were included with mean age of 47
years (24-73 years). There was a male predominance with a sex ratio
M/F = 3.4. 28 patients (43%) had previously received prior treatment: (Peg)
interferon (n = 25) and lamivudine (n = 3). Chronic hepatitis B was in
cirrhosis stage in 53% of cases (n = 35). Cirrhosis was compensated in 16
patients (45%) and hepatitis B virus was wild in 7.6% of cases (n = 5). HCC
occurred in 16 patients (22%) within 5 years in an average period of 45
months (12-58 months). At 1 year of ETV, virosuppresion was obtained in 45
patients (70%) without reducing the risk of HCC (p = 0.53). In univariate
analysis, predictors of HCC occurrence were: male gender (p = 0.046), older
age (p = 0.05), cirrhosis (p = 10<sup>−3</sup>), previous treatment
(p = 0.05), initial high viral load (p = 0.047), and hyper bilirubinemia
(p = 0.012). Positive HbeAg (p = 0.058) and platelet count (p = 0.055) were
factors close to the meaning. In multivariate analysis, male gender, older
age, platelet count, and positive HBeAg were independent predictors of HCC
occurrence. The AUROCs of PAGE-B were significantly higher than those of the
REACH-B (0.91 vs 0.80 at 5 years, p = 0,03). The HCC-free survival in
patients with PAGE-B score≤10 was 92% vs 50% with PAGE-B&gt;10 and 30% with
PAGE-B≥17 (p &lt; 10<sup>−3</sup>). The HCC-free survival in patients
without cirrhosis was 95% at 5 years vs 40% in cirrhotic patients
(p = 0.004). The HCC-free survival in patients without cirrhosis and having
PAGE-B score &lt; 10 was 100% at 5 years. AUROCs of PAGE-B calculated 1 year
after of antiviral therapy was 0.932 with (95% CI, 0.872–0.992).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PAGE-B represents an easy-to-use and repeatable risk
score for prediction of HCC in the first 5 years of ETV treatment, with a
better accuracy than the REACH-B score. It also appears to be a dynamic
score that can be calculated during treatment. We have shown that Tunisian
patients without cirrhosis with PAGE-B score &lt; 10 had a very low risk of
developing HCC within 5 years after treatment and therefore, do not require
close monitoring.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a very aggressive cancer
with a minimal responsiveness to chemotherapeutics. We have previously
demonstrated that CCA is enriched of Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs); these
features being associated with aggressiveness and drug resistance. In
different solid tumours, DCLK1 has been demonstrated as a CSC marker.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of our study was to evaluate
<italic>in vitro</italic> the expression and the biological function
of DCLK1 in mixed intrahepatic-CCA (iCCA) and mucin extrahepatic-CCA (eCCA).
Specimens of human CCA (from surgically resected patients) were
enzymatically digested, submitted to immunosorting for specific CSC markers
(LGR5, CD13, CD90, EpCAM, CD133) and, primary cell cultures were prepared.
DCLK1 expression was analysed in primary CCA cell cultures by RT-qPCR,
Western Blot (WB), immunofluorescence (IF) and ELISA. Functional studies
have been performed in immunosorted and unsorted cells by evaluating the
effects of a selective DCLK1 inhibitor (LRRK2-IN-1) on cell proliferation
(MTS Assay, cell population doubling time-PDT), apoptosis
(Annessin-V-FITC/Propidium Iodide) and colony formation capacity (Clonogenic
assay).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> RT-qPCR and WB analyses demonstrated an increased
expression of DCLK1 in LGR5<sup>+</sup> cells of mucin-eCCA and in
CD133<sup>+</sup> cells of mixed-iCCA with respect the unsorted cells
(p &lt; 0.01). DCLK1 showed similar cytoplasmic localization (IF) in
LGR5<sup>+</sup>, CD133<sup>+</sup> cells and unsorted CCA cells. Very
interestingly, DCLK1 was detected (ELISA) in the human serum samples of CCA
patients but it was almost undetectable in healthy controls. The DCLK1
inhibitor, LRRK2-IN-1 (5µM) added for 3 days in CCA cell cultures, markedly
impaired cell proliferation and increased PDT, induced apoptosis, decreased
colony formation capacity and colony size in both iCCA and eCCA, in
comparison with untreated control cells (p &lt; 0.01). The analyses of
dose-response curves (MTS assay) demonstrated the anti-proliferative effect
of LRRK2-IN-1 is dose-dependent (2.5µM-20µM) with an IC50 of 9.61 µM in
unsorted mucin-eCCA, 14.72 µM in unsorted mixed-iCCA, 4.51 µM in
mucin-LGR5<sup>+</sup> and 9.61µM in mixed-CD133<sup>+</sup>
cells.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In conclusion, DCLK1 expression characterizes specific
CSC subpopulations of mixed-iCCA (CD133<sup>+</sup>) and mucin-eCCA
(LGR5<sup>+</sup>) and, could represent a serum biomarker for CCA.
DCLK1 inhibition exerts anti-neoplastic effects in primary CCA cell
cultures.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> S100 calcium binding protein A4 (S100A4) which is
related to epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is mainly involved in
metastasis. Glypican-3 (GPC3) which is expressed mainly during pregnancy in
fetal organs regulating morphogenesis has been known to be engaged in HCC
development. This study evaluated both S100A4 and GPC3 expression in primary
HCC in relation to tumor aggressiveness and diagnosis.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Tissues of 70 patients that met the inclusion
criteria for hepatectomy out of 400 cases of HCC in Egyptian cirrhotic HCV
patients were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using antibodies
against SA100A4 and GPC3 on the slides of tissue microarrays (TMAs) and
compared with tumor-adjacent tissue (controls). All patients were followed
up for survival, local recurrence and metastasis over a period of at least 6
months.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> GPC3 was more expressed in HCC than S100A4 when both were
compared to control (79% and 21%), (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.001)
respectively. S100A4 was more significantly expressed in cases showing
metastasis, vascular emboli, necrosis and grade III tumors (p = 0.005,
p = 0.039, p = 0.025 and p = 0.014) respectively while no significant
association with GPC3 expression with all these parameters (p &gt; 0.05).
GPC3 expression was associated with time of HCC recurrence (p = 0.02) while
not with S100A4 (p &gt; 0.05). The mean value of AFP was higher in both
positive cases for S100A4 (p = 0.004) and GPC3 (p = 0.04). But in both
S100A4 and GPC3 positive cases the overall survival time was not affected
(p &gt; 0.05). There was no relation between overall survival and both
S100A4 and GPC3 (p &gt; 0.05). The median overall survival was shorter in
decompensated patients and in higher grade tumors (p = 0.012 and p = 0.046
respectively). After univariate regression analysis, the only significant
independent predictor for recurrence was decompansation (OR 3.037) and the
following independent predictors for metastasis were significant; S100A4
positive staining (OR 9.63) and necrosis (OR 8.33). After multivariate
regression analysis, the most significant predictor for metastasis was
S100A4 positive staining (OR 8.4).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> S100A4 could be used as a prognostic marker for HCC
progression as it is related to tumor metastasis, grading and vascular
invasion while GPC3 is a reliable marker of HCC diagnosis.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Ablation of liver tumours is currently the main
treatment for patients whose cirrhosis precludes liver resection. It is
worth mentioning that liver transplantation is not available in Egypt due to
legal issues. Therefore, it is important to research into safe and practical
approaches in management of these patients. In a study performed in our
centre, the combined percutaneous injection of ethanol and mitoxantrone
(cytotoxic drug with very high affinity to liver cells), has been found to
be superior to the injection of ethanol alone in the treatment of
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Our work is aimed at comparing percutaneous
combined local injection of ethanol and mitoxantrone and percutaneous
radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. This
study excluded patients with more than 1 focal lesion and lesions larger
than 4cm. There were 124 patients in total, 64 were randomised into Group I
who were treated with ethanol plus mitoxantrone, while 60 were randomised
into Group II who were treated with radiofrequency ablation. Clinical
assessment, laboratory evaluation and CT studies were performed to all
patients at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post treatment. The
primary endpoint was complete ablation of the focal lesion. Data were
checked, entered and analysed using SPSS 14 for Windows.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Complete ablation has been achieved in 81.3%, 81.3%,
76.6% and 71.9% of patients in group I at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months
respectively, whereas in group II, the incidence of complete ablation was
88.3%, 88.3%, 85% and 81.7% at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months with no statistical
significant difference between the two groups. Percentage of complete
ablation in small tumours (&lt;2.5cm) is higher than large tumours in both
groups. Side effects and complications are significantly higher in group
II.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Combined injection of ethanol and mitoxantrone is
comparable to radiofrequency ablation with less frequent complications.
Ethanol when combined with mitoxantrone, can provide a safe, effective and
cheaper option for the treatment of HCC especially for small tumours.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Opioids are increasingly prescribed in the West, and
have deleterious gastrointestinal consequences. Pharmacological therapies to
treat opioid-induced constipation (OIC) are available, but their relative
efficacy is unclear. We performed a systematic review and network
meta-analysis to address this deficit in current knowledge.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMBASE Classic, and
the Cochrane central register of controlled trials through to December 2017
to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological therapies
in the treatment of adults with OIC. Trials had to report a dichotomous
assessment of overall response to therapy, and data were pooled using a
random effects model. Efficacy and safety of pharmacological therapies was
reported as a pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
to summarise the effect of each comparison tested, and ranked treatments
according to their p-score.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 27 eligible RCTs of pharmacological therapies, containing
9149 patients, were identified. In our primary analysis, using failure to
achieve an average of ≥3 bowel movements (BMs) per week with an increase of
≥1 BM per week over baseline, or an average of ≥3 BMs per week, to define
non-response the network meta-analysis ranked naloxone first in terms of
efficacy (RR = 0.65; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.80, p = 0.84), and it was also the
safest drug. When non-response to therapy was defined using failure to
achieve an average of ≥3 bowel movements (BMs) per week, with an increase of
≥1 BM per week over baseline, naldemidine was ranked first (RR = 0.66; 95%
CI 0.56 to 0.77, p = 0.91).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In network meta-analysis, naloxone and naldemidine
appear to be the most efficacious treatments for OIC. Naloxone was the
safest of these agents.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Diverticulosis of the colon is the most frequent
anatomical alteration detected during colonoscopy. The endoscopic
classification called “DICA” (Diverticular Inflammation and Complication
Assessment) has been recently developed in order to have an objective
endoscopic description of the colon harbouring diverticula. Retrospective
study found a significant relationship between severity of DICA score and
clinical and demographic characteristics of people having
diverticulosis/diverticular disease.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Aim of this study was to assess the clinical
characteristic of the patients according to DICA classification and enrolled
in a multicentre, international, prospective study.</p>
<p>2215 prospective patients at the first diagnosis of diverticular disease were
enrolled after exclusion of radiological signs of acute diverticulitis;
inflammatory bowel diseases; ischemic colitis; prior colonic resection;
patients with severe liver failure (Child-Pugh C) or severe kidney failure;
pregnant women; patients who are currently using or who have received any
laxative agents or mesalazine or probiotics or antibiotics &lt; 2 weeks
prior to the enrollment; inability to comply with study protocol and to give
informed consensus to the procedure; patients with or history of cancer, of
any origin, within 5 years before enrollment; history of alcohol, drug, or
chemical abuse. All patients were classified according to DICA
classification.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 1377 (62.15%) patients were classified as DICA 1, 599
(27.04%) as DICA 2, and 239 (10.80%) as DICA 3. Table 1 described clinical
and demographic characteristics of the enrolled population. We found that
the DICA 3 patients, were older, were more frequently females and smokers,
had more frequently appendectomy and showed more than 1 co-morbidity than
DICA 1 and DICA 2 patients. Abdominal pain and meteorism were the most
frequent symptoms in those people, but DICA 3 patients were more symptomatic
and with more severe expression of symptoms than DICA 1 and DICA 2 people.
Moreover, fecal calprotectin showed higher levels in DICA 3 than in DICA 1
and DICA 2 patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</p>
<p>No scheduled therapy was generally adopted for DICA 1 patients (53.7%), while
it was adopted in only 26.4% and 10.9% of DICA 2 and DICA 3 patients
respectively. Finally, rifaximin, alone or in combination with mesalazine,
was the most frequent scheduled therapy prescribed in DICA 1 (31.5%), DICA 2
(35.8%) and DICA 3 (41.4%) patients.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This prospective study seems to confirm that DICA
endoscopic classification has a significant relationship with demographic,
clinical and laboratory parameters in people having colonic diverticulosis
detected at colonoscopy.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Bloating and abdominal distension are bothersome
symptoms frequently complained about by patients with functional
gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). Etiology is unclear in many cases.
However, recent studies provided evidence of impaired handling of gas as
mechanism potentialy relevant to the symptom (1). Few data are available on
defecation behavior in these patients (1).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Our aim was to study the relationship between
the defecation pattern, the severity of bloating and the abdominal girth
changes in FGID patients consulting for bloating as prevalent complain
poorly responsive to controlled diet advise. We performed a prospective,
multi-center study of patients with severe abdominal bloating (VAS score ≥
24 on a 100-mm scale) as prevalent complain with/without visible abdominal
distension. Patients were recruited at 4 gastroenterology outpatient clinics
in Italy. Comorbid FGID were grouped according to Rome III criteria. All
patients were prescribed a lactose-free diet augmented by NICE dietary
advice for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) for 2 weeks. A belt around the
abdomen at standardized sites provided assessment of abdominal girth
measurements. During the 2-week run-in period patients completed a daily
diary log including abdominal bloating score (100-mm VAS), Bristol Stool
Form and stool frequency. At randomization visit, all patients filled in a
questionnaire on subjective improvement of bloating on a 5-point Likert
scale (worse to major improvement) and a further abdominal bloating 100-mm
VAS. A belt around the abdomen at standardized sites provided assessment of
abdominal girth 2 hours after a meal. All patients reporting inadequate
relief of bloating at the end of the run-in underwent a standardized balloon
expulsion test (<bold>BET)</bold> scored as either successful or failed if
the balloon could not be evacuated within 2 minutes (2). A straining
questionnaire was also administered.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 134 patients (112 female, 39.8 ± 11.9 mean age, 10 IBS-D,
14 IBS-M, 45 IBS-C, 13 IBS-U, 7 Functional Constipation, 36 Functional
Bloating, 7 Functional Dyspepsia) completed the 2-week run-in period. A
significant negative correlation was found between subjective adequate
relief and both bloating and abdominal girth changes (r = -.56 and -.40,
p &lt; 0.001, respectively). 53 patients were non responder to modified NICE
diet advise (70.9%) and proceeded to BET evaluation, with the vast majority
(62%) failing the test.</p>
<p>Multiple regression analysis showed that BET (successful or failed), as
dependent variable, was significantly related to bloating severity (adjusted
B 0.011 (95% CI 0.006–0.15), p &lt; 0.0001) independently of abdominal girth
changes, FGID diagnosis and straining questionnaire.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this prospective, multicenter trial modified NICE
diet advise was of clinical benefit in approximately 30% of FGID patients
consulting for severe abdominal bloating. Disordered defecation was
prevalent in the non-responders and correlated with subjective bloating
perception. A biofeedback trial to improve defecation effort is ongoing to
investigate the relevance of outlet dysfunction as contributing etiology to
functional bloating.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Fecal incontinence (FI) is a very prevalent health
condition<sup>1,2</sup>. While pathophysiological aspects of pelvic
biomechanics associated with FI have been extensively studied<sup>3</sup>,
neurophysiology of motor pathways and especially the role of afferent
pathways involved in anorectal perception and its possible dysfunction are
quite unknown.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To explore the integrity of neural motor
(efferent) and sensory (afferent) anorectal pathways and the sensory
cortical activation in patients with FI and sphincteric impairment.</p>
<p>A cohort of 80 patients with FI and sphincteric impairment were studied.
Sphincter function and structure were evaluated with anorectal manometry
(ARM) and endoanal ultrasound (EUS); neurophysiology was assessed by means
of pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (PNTML) (efferent pathways) in a
subgroup of 42 patients; in another subgroup of 38, cortical activation with
sensory evoked potentials (SEP) after anal (ASEP) and rectal (RSEP) mucosa
stimulation (afferent pathways) was studied. Parameters evaluated were
right/left PNTML, amplitude/duration of the action potential; SEP: latency
peaks p1, n1, p2, n2, and amplitudes of p1-n1, n1-p2 and p2-n2 segments
(ASEP and RSEP). Neurophysiology (both efferent and afferent pathways) was
also studied on a group of 19 healthy volunteers (HV) to set reference
values.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: <bold><italic>a) Structure and function</italic></bold>. ARM: 83.8% of patients had impairment of EAS, 44.5% of the IAS, and
34.7% of both. EUS: 37.1% had injuries in the right anterior quadrant of the
puborectalis, 60.57% showed tears on the EAE and 34.8% IAS disruptions. <bold><italic>b) Neurophysiology</italic></bold>. Efferent motor pathways: mean left PNTML of the patients was
2.52 ± 0.70; for HV was 2.13 ± 0.39 (p &lt; 0.05). Right PNTML was
2.11 ± 0.34 and 2,14 ± 0.41 for patients and HV, respectively (ns). Amongst
the patients, 27.78% showed motor neuropathy in at least 1 branch of the
pudendal nerve. Sensory pathways (SEP): Patients showed longer RSEP (n1, p2
and n2) and ASEP (p1, p2, n2) compared to HV (p &lt; 0.05). Overall, we
found that 63.16% of patients showed ASEP parameters beyond the reference
values, and 50% of them for the RSEP.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The prevalence of afferent sensory pathways impairment
in patients with FI is significantly higher than that of the terminal motor
pathways, probably having a determining role in the pathophysiology of FI.
Future treatment strategies based on the stimulation of anal and rectal
sensory innervation may be key in the rehabilitation of these patients.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Despite recommendations from national guidelines,
many clinicians do not perform 23-seleno-25-homo-tauro-cholic acid (SeHCAT)
scanning to rule out bile acid diarrhoea (BAD) in patients with chronic
diarrhoea [1]. Our previous study auditing the use of SeHCAT scan in our
centre showed a yield of 51% in this patient group and identified that
patients with terminal ileal (TI) Crohn's disease or TI resection were
highly likely to have an abnormal SeHCAT scan [2]. As a result, we asked
clinicians to use a therapeutic trial of a bile acid sequestrant in these
patient groups instead of referring them for scanning, hence conserving
nuclear medicine resources.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> In light of changes to the referral criteria, we
re-evaluated the yield of SeHCAT scanning in chronic diarrhoea patients, and
examined factors predicting an abnormal retention. We retrospectively
identified consecutive patients with chronic diarrhoea undergoing SeHCAT
scanning at Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust over a 5-year period from 2012 to
2016. We reviewed electronic patient records to obtain information on
presenting gastrointestinal symptoms and any proposed risk factors for BAD.
Patients were classified as having irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea
(IBS-D) if they also reported abdominal pain or discomfort. BAD was
categorized into 3 different subtypes (types I, II, and III), and severity
(mild: 10-14.9% retention, moderate: 5-9.9%, severe: &lt; 5%). We used a
Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> test to assess the association between a positive
SeHCAT scan and proposed risk factors for BAD.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Between 2012 and 2016, 1071 patients were referred for
SeHCAT scanning. As expected, indications for scanning changed between 2012
and 2016, with a significant reduction in referral of patients with TI
Crohn's disease or TI resection year on year (χ<sup>2</sup> for trend,
p &lt; 0.001). Despite this, 457 (42.7%) patients had BAD and there was no
downward trend in yield of SeHCAT scanning during the 5-year study period
(χ<sup>2</sup> for trend from 2012-2016, p = 0.39). This remained the
case when data were compared with the previous 7-year study period from 2005
to 2011 (χ<sup>2</sup> for trend from 2005-2016, p = 0.28). The proportion
of patients with type II and III BAD increased from 2012 to 2016
(χ<sup>2</sup> for trend, p &lt; 0.001). Overall, 51.6% had type II
BAD, 36.1% type III, and 12.3% type I. BAD was mild in 31.7%, moderate in
34.4%, and severe in 33.9%. Of the 453 patients with IBS-D symptoms, 154
(33.7%) had a positive SeHCAT (Table 1), indicating type II (idiopathic)

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The prevalence of Bile Acid Diarrhoea (BAD) is 1% in
the general population and up to 32% in patients with diarrhoea-predominant
irritable bowel syndrome (1). Availability of the diagnostic scintigraphic
SeHCAT retention test is limited. 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) is a
proposed diagnostic alternative to SeHCAT (2, 3). Compared with SeHCAT,
fasting Fibroblast Growth Factor-19 (FGF19) has an average diagnostic
strength (4) but our pilot study suggested that the FGF19 response to a meal
plus chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) stimulation may have diagnostic strength
comparable with that of C4 (5).</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> We aimed to validate the biochemical tests C4
and the response in FGF19 to a meal plus CDCA with the SeHCAT test
(NCT03059537). We prospectively recruited patients referred for SeHCAT at
four Danish centres to compare SeHCAT, C4, and stimulated FGF19. Exclusion
criteria included cirrhosis, ileal resection, active IBD, and use of
laxatives or anti-diarrhoeal drugs 1 week before SeHCAT visit 1 and during
the study. At SeHCAT visit 1 patients started a 6-day Bristol Stool Form
(BSF) diary. At SeHCAT visit 2 we sampled fasting blood, subjects ingested
1250 mg CDCA and a solid meal (2 boiled eggs, 2 slices of toast bread, and
500 mL water). Plasma was sampled after 90, 120, and 150 minutes. We
analysed FGF19 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and C4 by
high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. SeHCAT ≤
10% defined BAD and SeHCAT &gt; 10% defined idiopathic diarrhoea. Data are
presented as median and interquartile ranges. Continuous variables are
compared with the Mann-Whitney U-test.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 71 subjects, 26 (9 male) had BAD and 45 (27 male) had
idiopathic diarrhoea. Median age was 45 years (34-49) vs. 55 years (45-64);
p &lt; 0.01. Average stools per day was 3.9 (3.0–5.3) vs. 3.0 (2.0–4.0);
p = 0.01. Average BSF was 5.9 (5.5–6.3) vs. 5.6 (5.0–6.2); p = 0.17. After
the CDCA ingestion, the plasma CDCA values peaked at 90 minutes and FGF19
peaked at 150 minutes, with no significant difference in values between
patients with BAD or idiopathic diarrhoea except for FGF19 at fasting;
p &lt; 0.01. Table 1 shows biochemical results and the receiver operating
characteristics (ROC) analysis with predefined and proposed cut-off values.

diagnostic algorithm left 19 of 71 subjects with an inconclusive C4-test, of
which 10 had SeHCAT ≤ 10%. A similar algorithm for fasting FGF19 with the
cut-off values shown in Table 1 left 33 subjects with an inconclusive FGF19
test.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Stimulation with a meal plus CDCA does not increase
the diagnostic yield of FGF19 for diagnosing BAD. In our population, C4 is

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)
remains complex. Increasing evidence supports the view that perturbation of
the immune system early in life imprints the intestine with an increased
susceptibility to IBD in adulthood. However, how perturbations in
host-microbial symbiosis and immunity in childhood impact the intestinal
immunity later during adulthood remains enigmatic.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> In this study, we explored the early time
window, and the underlying mechanisms, during which microbiota impacts the
IBD susceptibility later in life. Germ-free mice were colonized with
microbiota before or after weaning and their susceptibility to develop
colitis induced experimentally by dextran sulfate sodium was assessed at
adult age. Immune responses, microbial metabolites and microbiota
composition were determined during weaning and/or before colitis induction
at adult age.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> We identified the weaning as a window of opportunity
during which exposure to microbiota determines the severity of experimental
colitis in adult mice. We showed that exposure to microbiota during weaning,
but not later, induces an immune response that contributes to regulate the
severity of colitis in adult mice. RNAseq analysis in the colon before
colitis induction of GF mice exposed to microbiota before or after weaning
revealed immune abnormalities associated with different type of cells. The
underlying mechanisms involve microbial metabolites, such as short chain
fatty acids (SCFAs), the administration of which, during weaning,
ameliorates colitis severity at adult age. This protective effect of SCFAs
early in life is dependent on the cross-talk between intestinal epithelial
cells and regulatory T cells expressing the transcription factor RORγt
(Retinoid-Acid Receptor-related Orphan Receptor gamma t).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our study reveals how host-microbial symbiosis during
a specific time window of opportunity early in life determines long-term
susceptibility to inflammatory pathology.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are
inflammatory bowel diseases characterized by an aggressive immune response
thought to be provoked by intestinal microbes. There are fewer and less
consistent microbiota data for patients with UC than those with CD, but
studies have found that diversity is reduced in the microbiota of UC
patients, with lower levels of <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic>
and <italic>Roseburia hominis</italic>, and that these findings may
correlate with the severity of inflammation. A reduction in
<italic>Akkermansia</italic> spp has also been found in these
patients. Presence of <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> spp, and
Enterobacteriaceae has also been associated with UC. The dysbiosis in UC can
persist in periods of remission but there is no data in UC patients in long
periods of stable remission.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To evaluate the microbiota in UC patients in
long-term remission. A cross-sectional study was performed in 4 groups of
subjects: 1) UC-L: UC patients in long-term remission (≥5 years of
flare-free disease, with clinical, endoscopic and histological remission at
time of study); 2) UC-S: UC patients in short-term remission and high
relapse rate (3 months in clinical remission at time of study and previously
more than 1 relapse per year); 3) UC-F: UC patients with active disease
(SCCAI &gt; 4 at time of study) and 4) HC: healthy un-related controls. We
obtained 2 frozen stool samples from all subjects, except from the UC-F
group from which we obtained 1 frozen stool sample at the beginning of the
flare. Total bacteria, <italic>F. prausnitzii, A. muciniphila, E. coli and
F. nucleatum</italic> were measured by quantitative Real Time PCR
(qPCR, copies/gr stool).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 112 subjects were included, 29 in UC-L group, 20 in UC-S,
39 in UC-F and 24 HC. Median age of UC patients was 39 years and in HC was
34 years, women comprised 52% of all UC and 58% of HC. <italic>F.
prausnitzii</italic> abundance was significantly lower in the UC-S and
UC-F groups compared to the UC-L group (median 7.67E+8 copies/g, 5.06E+8
copies/g vs. 4.37E+9 copies/g, respectively p &lt; 0.05). <italic>A.
muciniphila</italic> abundance was depleted in both UC-S and UC-F in
contrast with UC-L and HC (median 0.00E+0 copies/g in UC-S and UC-F vs.
3.89E+6 copies/g in UC-L and 5.01E+9 copies/g in HC, p &lt; 0.01).
<italic>E. coli and F. nucleatum</italic> abundance was similar in all
subjects studied.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> UC patients in long-term, stable remission present an
abundance of <italic>A. muciniphila</italic> and <italic>F.
prausnitzii</italic> that is similar to healthy controls. UC patients
may be able to recover some eubiotic characteristics of their microbiota and
this could become an important therapeutic end-point in UC.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The gut microbiota composition differs at the
inter-individual level and depends on many factors as food, geographical
conditions of human living, genetic factors, age, etc. It is probably the
change in the composition of the intestinal microbiota which may cause
activation of immune inflammation in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease
patients.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The aim of the study was to reveal the influence
of the place of residence (urban/rural) on the composition of intestinal
microbiota in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients.</p>
<p><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> The study included 91 patients with
ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (22 living in rural, and 69 – in the
urban area). The control group consisted of 96 healthy subjects (27 from
rural and 69 from urban area). Total DNA was extracted from stool samples
followed by whole genome sequencing (SOLiD 5500 W platform).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The following bacteria were predominant in the samples of
healthy subjects living in a rural area: <italic>Clostridium</italic>
(3.20 ± 5.64)%, <italic>Eubacterium</italic> (16.86 ± 8.19)%,
<italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> (1.46 ± 6.71)%,

genus was significantly higher in groups of both rural and urban IBD
patients: (14.45 ± 18.02)% and (21.81 ± 19.11)% compared to the control
group of healthy subjects living in rural and urban areas (2.73 ± 1.75)%,
(9.81 ± 12.08)%, respectively, p &lt; 0.05. The abundance of

the control group of subjects form rural (0.43 ± 0.52)% and urban areas
(2.09 ± 3.46)%, p &lt; 0.05. Comparative analysis of microbiota of IBD
patients living in rural and urban areas revealed differences in the
representation of only 2 genera of bacteria: the abundance of
<italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> (2.30 ± 6.19)% and
<italic>Catenibacterium</italic> (1.18 ± 1.93)% was higher in rural

<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Only 2 genus of bacteria –
<italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> and
<italic>Catenibacterium</italic> – differed significantly between
urban and rural IBD patients. The abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria
with anti-inflammatory properties (<italic>Subdoligranulum, Eubacterium,
Faecalibacterium, Coprococcus, Ruminococcus</italic>, etc.) was
significantly decreased in IBD patients comparing to healthy subjects. The
abundance of <italic>B. fragilis</italic>, which is the cause of diarrhea of
different etiology, was not statistically different between the groups, but
there was an increase in its relative representation in the group of urban
IBD patients.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an
experimental approach for the treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis.
Although there is growing evidence that FMT is effective in this disease,
factors affecting its response are unknown.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> To investigate which patient or donor factors
are responsible for the treatment success of FMT in UC patients. This is an
open labeled trial of repeated FMT for steroid resistant or dependent
ulcerative colitis patients (n = 50). Demographic and laboratory findings of
donor and recipient were recorded. Fecal samples of donors and patients were
analysed by 16SrRNA gene-based microbiota analysis in only 10 patients (and
related donors).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 16/50 (32%) of patients showed complete response and 4/50
(8%) had a partial remission to FMT. Response was mainly influenced by the
taxonomic composition of the donor’s microbiota. Stool of donors with a high
bacterial richness (observed species remission 811 ± 74 vs no response
644 ± 168 at 15996 rps) and a high relative abundance of <italic>Akkermansia
muciniphila</italic> (4.2 ± 2.1% vs 0.3 ± 0.1%),
<italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic> (11.9 ± 3.0% vs
6.2 ± 2.9%), and <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> spp. (5.2 ± 3.2% vs
1.1 ± 0.8%) were more likely to induce remission. Demographic data were also
analysed. Multivariate analysis showed the duration of illness longer than 1
year was a negative predictive factor (0.72 (0.57–0.92) p &lt; 0.01).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The taxonomic composition of the donor’s intestinal
microbiota is a major factor influencing factor for response in UC. Further
artificial microbial preparations for ideal microbial match should be
investigated. Duration of illness is a significant factor for success of FMT
and early application of FMT in UC should be studied in further
well-designed trials.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Mucosal ATP depletion as the consequence of reduced
mitochondrial respiratory chain activity has been attributed to ulcerative
colitis (UC) pathogenesis more than 30 years ago. Mucus producing goblet
cells, which are highly dependent on energy supply via the oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, are supposingly highly affected by reduced
OXPHOS activity. Furthermore, reduced numbers of goblet cells and intestinal
mucus depletion have been suggested as histological hallmarks of UC.
Finally, mucus composition and glycosylation is able to shape the intestinal
microbiota, which is frequently altered in UC patients. Nevertheless,
experimental evidence linking mitochondrial dysfunction with intestinal
mucus depletion and microbiome alterations are still missing.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> Mucus producing HT29MTX cells as well as murine
intestinal organoids are employed as <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>ex
vivo</italic> model systems, respectively, in order to study mucin
transcription, production, secretion and glycosylation upon energy
metabolism modifying stimuli. <italic>In vivo</italic>, conplastic mice,
carrying well-characterized single nucleotide polymorphisms in their
mitochondrial genome, are studied on their susceptibility to various
experimental colitis models. Furthermore, seahorse analyzer is used to
control for mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, while microbiome
composition is analysed via 16srRNA next generation sequencing.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold>
<italic>In vitro</italic> stimulation of HT29MTX cells showed that mucus
transcription and secretion is highly dependent on mitochondrial OXPHOS
capacity. In line with this, mice with reduced mucosal ATP levels and OXPHOS
activity depicted goblet cell reduction and increased susceptibility to DSS
colitis, characterized by elevated DAI, MEICS and histologic scores. On the
other hand, mice with increased mucosal ATP levels were protected against
experimental colitis. Finally, gut microbial composition was highly
dependent on mitochondrial genetics.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Taken together, we here describe a new pathway linking
major hallmarks of UC. Mitochondrial OXPHOS activity and mucosal ATP levels
in intestinal epithelial cells might be strongly underestimated factors in
UC pathogenesis and therapeutic potentialities.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Changes in gut bacterial community structure are
associated with Crohn's Disease (CD) development and response to therapy
including reduced diversity, temporal instability, and shifts in abundances
of many bacterial species. Bile acid (BAs) play a central role in modulating
the immune response, and changes in the BA pool are also associated with gut
bacterial activity. The liver synthesizes and conjugates the primary BAs
while bacteria deconjugate, epimerize and dehydroxylate in the production of
the secondary BAs. The predominant primary BAs are cholic acid (CA) and
chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), and the predominant secondary BAs are
lithocholic acid (LCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA). Because the gut microbial
community impacts the BA pool, it is possible that community changes could
affect the BA-receptor mediated immune response.</p>
<p><bold>Aims and Methods:</bold> The relationship between the gut microbiome and
the BA pool, both obtained from stool samples collected at baseline, during
exclusive enteral nutrition therapy (up to week 12) and then at 12-week
intervals to 48 weeks follow-up, was investigated in 16 pediatric CD
patients. Patient outcomes were classified as: sustained remission for
&gt;24 weeks (SR), non-sustained remission (NSR) or non-remission (NR).
Taxonomic marker (16S) and metagenomic sequencing was performed on the stool
samples. Taxonomic and functional assignments were made using QIIME and
HUMAnN2, with diversity statistics computed using QIIME. Bile acid profiles
were obtained from stool by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.
Standard statistical tests were performed using R, and the relationship
between microbial community structure and BA composition was inferred using
a hierarchical Bayesian model (BioMiCo).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 2 groups of patients were identified that differed in
both BA profile and gut microbiome. The first group was associated with high
amounts of the secondary bile acids LCA and DCA, and was comprised of SR,
NSR and NR patients. These patients had relatively high levels of microbial
alpha diversity, with <italic>Ruminococcus obeum, R. torques, Bacteroides
uniformis, B. vulgatus</italic>, several species of
<italic>Alistipes</italic> and <italic>Subdoligranulum</italic> being
predominant lineages. The second group was associated with high amounts of
unconjugated primary bile acids and 2 other secondary bile acids,
ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA). This group was
comprised exclusively of NSR patients. Alpha diversity was lower in these
patients, with <italic>R. gnavus, B. plebeius, B. eggerthii, Clostridium
boteae</italic>, and <italic>C. innocuum</italic> being predominant
lineages. A survey of bacterial BA genes within the metagenome revealed that
most samples contained the bile salt hydrolase gene responsible for
deconjugation. The bacterial genes responsible for conversion to secondary
bile acids were much more restricted.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Primary BAs levels differed significantly between the
SR and NSR patients. Moreover, high primary BAs were seen only in NSR
patients. The presence of HDCA in the second group of patients (all NSR) is
noteworthy, as HDCA has a detergent like effect leading to membrane
disruption, and is suggested to induce strong cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and
IL-8 synthesis. Based on these findings, we speculate that there may be a
microbial community that leads to increased HDCA and impacts the ability to
sustain remission.</p>
