<title>Lay Abstract</title>
<p id="P1">Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are predominantly characterized by impairments in social communication, as well as by restricted and repetitive behaviors. Among these are atypical responses to sensory stimuli, which are commonly observed in ASD. While some children with ASD are easily overwhelmed by sensory stimuli, others may seem unaware of their environment. Vision and audition are two of the main sensory modalities involved in social interactions and language. To examine how basic perceptual processes that may form the foundation for these cognitive abilities are affected in ASD, 16 children and adolescents with ASD and 16 matched typically developing (TD) participants were tested using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants were presented with auditory (high or low pitch) and visual stimuli (dot located high or low in a display), and were asked to indicate for each stimulus whether it was “high” or “low”. During the auditory condition, the TD group showed decreased neural activity in visual processing regions. By contrast, the ASD group showed increased neural activity in these regions. This unusual activity in visual regions was associated with autism symptomatology. Overall, these findings suggest that simple nonverbal perceptual discrimination may be impaired for auditory (but not visual) stimuli in ASD, and that individuals with ASD atypically recruit visual brain regions during processing of simple auditory stimuli.</p>

<title>Scientific Abstract</title>
<p id="P2">Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are pervasive developmental disorders characterized by impairments in language development and social interaction, along with restricted and stereotyped behaviors. These behaviors often include atypical responses to sensory stimuli; some children with ASD are easily overwhelmed by sensory stimuli, while others may seem unaware of their environment. Vision and audition are two sensory modalities important for social interactions and language, and are differentially affected in ASD. In the present study, 16 children and adolescents with ASD and 16 typically developing (TD) participants matched for age, gender, nonverbal IQ, and handedness were tested using a mixed event-related/blocked functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm to examine basic perceptual processes that may form the foundation for later-developing cognitive abilities. Auditory (high or low pitch) and visual conditions (dot located high or low in the display) were presented, and participants indicated whether the stimuli were “high” or “low”. Results for the auditory condition showed downregulated activity of the visual cortex in the TD group, but upregulation in the ASD group. This atypical activity in visual cortex was associated with autism symptomatology. These findings suggest atypical crossmodal (auditory-visual) modulation linked to sociocommunicative deficits in ASD, in agreement with the general hypothesis of low-level sensorimotor impairments affecting core symptomatology.</p>
