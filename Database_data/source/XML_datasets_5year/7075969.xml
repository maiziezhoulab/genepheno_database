<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a prevailing genetic disorder of intellectual disability and autism. There is no efficacious medication for FXS. Through in silico screening with a public database, computational analysis of transcriptome profile in FXS mouse neurons predicts therapeutic value of an FDA-approved drug trifluoperazine. Systemic administration of low-dose trifluoperazine at 0.05 mg/kg attenuates multiple FXS- and autism-related behavioral symptoms. Moreover, computational analysis of transcriptome alteration caused by trifluoperazine suggests a new mechanism of action against PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase) activity. Consistently, trifluoperazine suppresses PI3K activity and its down-stream targets Akt (protein kinase B) and S6K1 (S6 kinase 1) in neurons. Further, trifluoperazine normalizes the aberrantly elevated activity of Akt and S6K1 and enhanced protein synthesis in FXS mouse. Together, our data demonstrate a promising value of transcriptome-based computation in identification of therapeutic strategy and repurposing drugs for neurological disorders, and suggest trifluoperazine as a potential treatment for FXS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by mutations in the <italic>FMR1</italic> (fragile X mental retardation 1) gene, is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and a leading cause of autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. As the most prevailing form of mutation, expansion of CGG repeats in the 5′ un-translated region of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene inhibits its transcription and thereby preventing the expression of its gene product FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein). FXS patients exhibit numerous neurological abnormalities including intellectual disability, social impairment, perseveration, and hyperactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Despite recent advances in the understanding of FMRP function, FXS pathophysiology, and identification of potential therapeutic targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, development of practical therapy has had limited success. As there is no efficacious medication to treat FXS, identification of practical therapeutic intervention is of urgent demand.</p>
<p id="Par4">Recent studies with transcriptome landscapes in distinct neuronal populations suggest that gene signature may represent a holistic molecular outcome and an indicator for cell type classification and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. As a molecular phenotype and pathological endpoint, transcriptome alteration has been observed in patient samples from major psychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, using transcriptome landscape as a holistic outcome may offer an unbiased approach to reveal disease mechanism as well as neuropathology and etiology that are unique or overlapping among psychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Recent studies also suggest that analysis of disease-associated transcriptome profile may also predict potential therapy or aid treatment development. For example, antipsychotics-induced transcriptome changes are negatively correlated with those identified in schizophrenia samples. In contrast, psychotomimetic phencyclidine triggers transcriptome changes that overlap with the disease profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Regarding its potential application in drug discovery, comparison of psychiatric disease-associated transcriptomes with drug-induced transcript alterations in public database can computationally reveal the previously validated drug-disease pairs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, whether the transcriptome-based computational approach can help identify new therapeutic or repurposing drugs for new application is of great interest but remains to be examined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">In this study, we identified significant transcriptome changes in <italic>Fmr1</italic> deficient neurons. We compared the transcriptome signature in <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) neuron with those in the connectivity Map (CMAP) database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, which contains over 7000 reference gene expression profiles representing transcriptome changes affected by 1309 compounds/drugs. Computational analysis outcome predicts therapeutic value of an FDA-approved drug trifluoperazine. Using the FXS mouse model, we found significant effects of trifluoperazine on correcting FXS-associated and autism-associated symptoms. Further analysis with drug-induced transcriptome changes revealed a new pharmacologically inhibitory activity of trifluoperazine against PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase). Administration of trifluoperazine normalizes the aberrantly elevated PI3K/Akt (protein kinase B)-S6K1 (S6 kinase 1) signaling in FXS. Our data support the value of computational transcriptome analysis in therapeutic development, and suggest trifluoperazine as a potential practical medication for FXS treatment.</p>

<title>Screening of CMAP database with FXS transcriptome signature</title>
<p id="Par6">Transcriptome alteration represents an emerging molecular phenotype and pathological signature of chronic diseases including psychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Here, we used next generation sequencing (NGS) to determine genome-wide changes of gene transcript in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO hippocampal neurons. Compared to wild type (WT) neurons, 587 gene transcripts were upregulated and 724 were downregulated in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">1</xref>). Enrichment analysis identified significant changes in 138 GO processes (complete list in Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM4">2</xref>; top 15 pathways in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">3</xref>) and 11 KEGG pathways (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">4</xref>). Some enrichment groups are related to neural development, calcium homeostasis and signaling, p53 signaling, Rap1 signaling, and MAPK signaling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b, c</xref>), the alterations of which are implicated in FXS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. As alterations of numerous transcripts occur in multiple pathways (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM5">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM6">4</xref>), it is challenging to pinpoint which specific DEG (differentially expressed gene) plays a causal role in FXS pathology.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>RNA-seq and connectivity Map (CMAP) analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEG) in Fmr1 knockout (KO) hippocampal neuron.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Gene expression differences between wild type (WT) and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO samples.

<p id="Par7">Recent computational analysis with transcriptomes imputed from GWAS data and CMAP drug-induced gene signature suggests an intriguing strategy to identify potential treatment for psychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The strategy, which identifies therapeutic compounds inducing gene signature oppositional to disease signature (indicated by negative similarity mean), was supported by known medications used for psychiatric conditions. For example, predicted therapeutic compounds for schizophrenia are enriched for antipsychotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. To examine the value of this unbiased approach, we compared transcriptome signature of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neurons with drug-induced signatures in CMAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. We identified negative and positive correlations between the FXS-drug pair. Among the top ten hits ranked by <italic>p</italic> value and enrichment, nine compounds/drugs induce oppositional transcriptome changes (as indicated by negative similarity mean) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM7">5</xref>), predicating potential therapeutic value. From the four FDA-approved drugs, we chose trifluoperazine, which can effectively cross the blood brain barrier (BBB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and has been used to treat central nervous system disorders, for experimental validation of therapeutic efficacy.

<title>Trifluoperazine corrects FXS-associated behaviors in mice</title>
<p id="Par8">Previous studies demonstrate that efficacy doses of trifluoperazine used for schizophrenia and anxiety show extrapyramidal side effects in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, but low dose trifluoperazine is well tolerated in both human and animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. We examined the key FXS-associated behavioral symptoms following low dose i.p. injection (at 0.05 mg/kg).</p>
<p id="Par9">We first examined the effects of trifluoperazine on sociability, reduction of which prevalently occurs in FXS and autism. We used two different 3-chamber social interaction paradigms, both of which have been applied in previous studies and detected social impairment in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The first paradigm measures social interaction without presenting an un-animated object (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>); the second paradigm involves both social (i.e., a stranger mouse) and un-animated objects (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). We confirmed that, in both paradigms, <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice showed less social interaction than WT mice (genotype effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,35</sub> = 14.851, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>; genotype effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,44</sub> = 38.690, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). Trifluoperazine did not affect WT mice but significantly improved sociability in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>; treatment effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,35</sub> = 3.475, <italic>p</italic> = 0.071; genotype × treatment interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,35</sub> = 14.704, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>; treatment effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,44</sub> = 9.364, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004; genotype × treatment interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,44</sub> = 5.119, <italic>p</italic> = 0.029).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Trifluoperazine corrects FXS- and autism-associated behavioral symptoms in Fmr1 KO mice.</title><p>Trifluoperazine (TFP, at 0.05 mg/kg) or vehicle (Veh) was administered into wild type (WT) and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<italic>Fmr1</italic>) 1 h before testing (<bold>a</bold>–<bold>d</bold>). <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> TFP improves sociability in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO and does not affect WT mice. <bold>c</bold> The percentage of fully buried marbles and marbles on the surface (as indicated) was determined for WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice following TFP or vehicle administration. <bold>d</bold> TFP corrects the increased locomotive transition between the lit and dark chamber in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice.

There is no difference in crossover latency among the four groups during training (genotype effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,36</sub> = 3.218, <italic>p</italic> = 0.081; drug effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,36</sub> = 0.309, <italic>p</italic> = 0.581; genotype × drug interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,36</sub> = 1.256, <italic>p</italic> = 0.270). <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice showed impaired memory and not corrected by trifluoperazine. <bold>g</bold> Mice received three mild electric foot shocks during passive avoidance training.

<p id="Par10"><italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice show significant repetitive/stereotypic behavior, recapitulating perseverative symptoms in FXS and autism patients. We examined animal behavior in marble-burying test, which has been considered to measure repetitive behavior and barely involves novelty-induced anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. We found that trifluoperazine had no effect on WT but normalized the excessive marble burying behavior in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (for fully buried marbles in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>; genotype effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,53</sub> = 3.726, <italic>p</italic> = 0.059; treatment effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,53</sub> = 3.808, <italic>p</italic> = 0.056; genotype × treatment interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,53</sub> = 5.758, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02; post-hoc Holm-Sidak test detected significant difference between vehicle-treated WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice) (for marbles on the surface in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref>; genotype effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,53</sub> = 6.255, <italic>p</italic> = 0.016; treatment effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,53</sub> = 14.217, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000; genotype × treatment interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,53</sub> = 5.383, <italic>p</italic> = 0.024; post-hoc Holm-Sidak test detected significant difference between vehicle-treated WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice). The number of marbles partially buried by WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice was similar (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>; genotype effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,53</sub> = 2.01, <italic>p</italic> = 0.162).

<p id="Par12">FXS is the leading cause of inherited intellectual disability. To determine certain aspect of cognitive deficits, we examined passive avoidance memory. Trifluoperazine or vehicle was administered before training, during which animals received an electric foot shock once entering the dark chamber. Twenty-four hours after training, animals were tested for memory formation, which is implicated by increased latency to cross over and enter the dark chamber. All groups of animals showed similar crossover latency during training (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>, genotype effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,47</sub> = 2.069, <italic>p</italic> = 0.157; drug effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,47</sub> = 2.424, <italic>p</italic> = 0.126; genotype–drug interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,47</sub> = 0.248, <italic>p</italic> = 0.569).

This confirms the impaired passive avoidance memory in the FXS mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Although trifluoperazine did not have an effect on WT animals, crossover latency in trifluoperazine-treated <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice significantly increased to the WT level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01, Fisher’s exact test). We expect that the improved memory in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice is not due to trifluoperazine effect on locomotion. This is because the memory test was performed 24 h after trifluoperazine administration. When tested in a similar context (i.e., movement in the light-dark box test), the effect of trifluoperazine on locomotion is evident 1 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>) but not 24 h after drug administration (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>; genotype effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,22</sub> = 18.631, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000; drug effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,22</sub> = 0.325, <italic>p</italic> = 0.574; genotype × drug interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,22</sub> = 0.166, <italic>p</italic> = 0.688 for the number of transition between the lit and dark chambers). Interestingly, when trifluoperazine was administered after training, it had no significant effect on correcting the defective passive avoidance memory in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f</xref>). This suggests an intriguing possibility that lack of FMRP causes impaired learning but not memory consolidation.

<title>No effect of D1 and D2 antagonists on behavioral symptoms</title>
<p id="Par23">To directly test the possibility that therapeutic effect of trifluoperazine is mediated through its activity against dopamine receptors, we used other known D1 and D2 receptor (D1R and D2R) antagonists. At concentrations that affect dopamine receptor function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, neither the D1R antagonist SCH23390 nor the D2R antagonist raclopride inhibited pAkt in neurons (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10a</xref>,<xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1"> b</xref>). Intriguingly, we found that the D1R antagonist SCH23390 bi-directionally affects pS6K1. SCH23390 at 1 and 2 μM enhanced pS6K1. At 10 μM, SCH23390 suppressed pS6K1 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10c</xref>). The D2R antagonist raclopride significantly suppressed pS6K1 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">10d</xref>), but the degree of suppression was milder than the effect of trifluoperazine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5f</xref>). It is known that, besides PI3K-Akt, pS6K1 may also be affected by other signaling molecules such as mTOR. We found that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin had no effect on pAkt but eliminated the pS6K1 signal (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). These data implicate that the D1R/D2R antagonists have different pharmacological activity from trifluoperazine and mTOR inhibitor.</p>
<p id="Par24">We further tested the in vivo effects of D1R/D2R antagonists on behavior. In the social interaction test, SCH23390 and raclopride both increased social interaction in WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8a</xref>; genotype effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,58</sub> = 121.132, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000; treatment effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>2,58</sub> = 3.447, <italic>p</italic> = 0.039; genotype × treatment interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>2,58</sub> = 2.592, <italic>p</italic> = 0.084) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.029 for SCH23390; <italic>p</italic> = 0.001 for raclopride; post hoc Holm-Sidak test).

In the marble bury test, vehicle-treated and drug-treated <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice displayed excessive marble burying activity compared to their corresponding WT groups (for the fully buried marbles in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8b</xref>; genotype effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,83</sub> = 18.66, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000; drug effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>2,83</sub> = 5.637, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005; genotype–drug interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>2,83</sub> = 0.107, <italic>p</italic> = 0.899) (for the surface marbles in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8c</xref>; genotype effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,83</sub> = 47.509, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000; drug effect: <italic>F</italic><sub>2,83</sub> = 11.150, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000; genotype–drug interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>2,83</sub> = 2.660, <italic>p</italic> = 0.076). SCH23390 non-specifically decreased the % of fully buried marbles in both WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8b</xref>). For % of surface marbles, SCH23390 had effect on WT but not <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8c</xref>). The D2R antagonist raclopride affected neither WT nor <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8b, c</xref>). These data show that the D1R/D2R antagonists have different in vivo effects comparing to trifluoperazine, suggesting that the therapeutic effect of trifluoperazine is unlikely due to its inhibitory activity against dopamine receptors.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><title>Effects of D1R and D2R antagonists on sociability and repetitive behavior.</title><p>Wild type (WT) and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (Fmr1) were i.p. injected with vehicle (Veh), or the D1R antagonist SCH23390 (SCH, 0.05 mg/kg), or the D2R antagonist raclopride (RCP, 0.3 mg/kg).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par25">Compared to de novo therapeutic development, repurposing FDA-approved drugs offers several benefits including reduction of cost and potentially sooner clinical application. Regarding examination of FDA-approved drugs for FXS treatment, recent studies mainly focused on the known disease mechanism and used hypothesis-driven approaches. For instance, therapeutic testing with metformin and lovastatin, which show promising efficacy in both FXS mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> and small scale open-label human studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, is theoretically based on their pharmacological actions against mTORC1 and ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2), the activity of which is abnormally elevated in FXS mouse model and patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In this study, we used whole transcriptome analysis as an unbiased approach to identify potential therapeutics. Gene signature analysis with normal neurons and psychiatric disorder-affected specimens suggests an intriguing possibility that transcriptome landscape and cell function are associated and may mutually affect each other. Related to disease mechanism, genomic alteration is considered as an emerging molecular phenotype and pathological endpoint. Intriguingly, recent computational comparison of gene signatures associated with psychiatric disorders and drug treatment suggests an attractive but yet to-be-validated approach for therapy development and drug repurposing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Here, we compared transcriptome alterations caused by <italic>Fmr1</italic> deficiency and CMAP drugs. The computational analysis identified trifluoperazine as a potential therapeutic. It is important to note that transcriptome data in the CMAP database were collected from cancer cell lines rather than neurons. Interestingly, we were able to validate the CMAP-predicted effect of trifluoperazine in neurons and FXS mouse model. Two recent computational studies also found that the CMAP data from cancer cells may be effectively used to predict therapy or mechanism for neurological disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par26">Trifluoperazine, belonging to the phenothiazine group, is a well-known antipsychotic. Interestingly, some antipsychotics such as haloperidol, risperidone, and aripiprazole have been noted to alleviate irritability and aggression in autism and FXS patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The main side effects include extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and sedation. In particular for trifluoperazine, long-term use in the 6–40 mg/day range exerts EPS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, in theory, side effects depend on drug dose, and human studies demonstrate that EPS can be successfully managed through dose adjustment. Here, we observed robust efficacy of low dose trifluoperazine at 0.05 mg/kg, which, according to the well-accepted FDA formula<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, is equivalent to 0.004 mg/kg for human (or 0.24 mg for a person with 60 kg body weight). This dose is highly applicable and tolerated, as it is significantly lower than 5 mg/day, which, judged by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, does not cause adverse side effects in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Notably, low dose trifluoperazine (i.e., 1 mg, which is about 4× higher than 0.24 mg) is also used in combination with antidepressant in human patients, and sold under the brand names of Parmodalin and Jatrosom N.</p>
<p id="Par27">The primary application of trifluoperazine in schizophrenia patients shows strong effects on correcting the positive symptoms possibly through its inhibition on dopamine receptors. It is known that the anti-dopamine effects of trifluoperazine decrease locomotor activity but does not improve cognitive function. We found that trifluoperazine at 0.05 mg/kg does not affect locomotor activity in WT mice in the light-dark and open field test. In <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, trifluoperazine normalizes the excessive locomotor transition in the light-dark test but not in the open field paradigm. Notably, 0.05 mg/kg trifluoperazine rescued the cognitive impairment in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. Interestingly, certain aspects of FXS-associated abnormality are caused by decreased dopamine function and dopamine agonist corrects certain phenotypes in FXS mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. We further examined the effect of other known D1R and D2R antagonists, and found no therapeutic efficacy in correcting FXS-associated abnormalities. These lines of evidence suggest that the therapeutic effects of low dose trifluoperazine are unlikely due to its anti-dopamine activity.</p>
<p id="Par28">Our study further used computational screening with CMAP to identify a potential pharmacological mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of trifluoperazine. Intriguingly, although gene signature induced by trifluoperazine shows similarity to those induced by the known HDAC and PI3K inhibitors, we found trifluoperazine effect on PI3K activity but not histone acetylation. However, as our assay only examined acetylation of H3 and H4 at specific lysine residuals (i.e., K9 of H3 and K8 of H4), more exhaustive investigation may be needed to totally exclude potential trifluoperazine activity against HDAC. Since all available small molecule drugs have promiscuous pharmacological targets, we do not exclude the possibility that the therapeutic effects of trifluoperazine are mediated by regulating other signaling pathways in addition to the inhibition of the PI3K-Akt-S6K1 cascade. Nevertheless, our results do suggest that drugs with similar effects on transcriptome signature may have similar MOA (mechanism of action) and warrant experimental validation.</p>
<p id="Par29">Notably, some of the top-ranked trifluoperazine similarity compounds also induce transcriptome alterations that are oppositional to that caused by <italic>Fmr1</italic> deficiency. For example, gene signatures of trichostatin A (in PC3 cell, ranked at #6) and thioridazine (in PC3 cell, ranked at #2) show positive similarity to trifluoperazine signature (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref>). They show negative similarity to <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neuron signature, and are ranked at #1 and #9, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>). Although these compounds are either not approved by FDA or withdrawn from clinical use, it would be interesting to test whether they can correct certain pathological aspects of FXS in animal models. Along the same line, our results advocate future studies to repurpose other CMAP-identified trifluoperazine similarity drugs (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM9">7</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par30">Intriguingly, our unbiased computational prediction of trifluoperazine efficacy and its action against PI3K activity are strikingly coincident with a previously suggested disease mechanism. Recent studies have found that, in the absence of FMRP, expression levels of PI3K activator PIKE and p110ß subunit are elevated in <italic>Fmr1</italic> deficient cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, leading to elevated PI3K activity and over-activation of the Akt-S6K1 signaling cascade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Therapeutic value of correcting the altered PI3K-Akt-S6K1 signaling in FXS is strongly suggested by that genetic removal/reduction of S6K1, PIKE, and p110ß subunit of PI3K can rescue the elevated overall protein synthesis and multiple behavioral abnormalities in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. A more recent study showed that systemic injection of a novel p110β-specific inhibitor GSK2702926A, a similarly structured compound of which is under investigation in a cancer clinical trial, rescues cellular and behavioral abnormalities in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. To realize therapeutic value of targeting the PI3K-Akt-S6K1 signaling cascade, a significant advancement is to find a clinically suitable approach to effectively dampen PI3K-Akt-S6K1 activity in FXS. By using the FDA-approved trifluoperazine, we demonstrate that acute administration of a drug with PI3K inhibiting activity is sufficient to rescue multiple aspects of FXS-associated pathology, supporting the practical value of targeting PI3K-Akt-S6K1 signaling. Considering that human FXS samples also display elevated PI3K-Akt-S6K1 signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, our data encourage future investigation to determine the efficacy of trifluoperazine in human patients.</p>
<p id="Par31">We acknowledge that trifluoperazine does not correct all FXS-associated symptoms that were examined in this study. Lack of absolute efficacy is common for drugs used for complex neurological disorders. It is noticed that targeting ERK1/2 or PI3K by lovastatin, metformin, and GSK2702926A rescues some but not all symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Such limitation may be due to multiple pathological alterations in FXS; combinatorial targeting multiple disease factors represents an emerging idea to achieve more robust therapeutic outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Alternatively, adjustment of dose and treatment duration may also be considered for future studies. Furthermore, although FXS is a main cause for autism and intellectually disability (ID), we do not expect that trifluoperazine would show general therapeutic effects in other autism and ID models.</p>
<p id="Par32">We acknowledge that FDA has just approved the first PI3K inhibitor idelalisib in July 2014 for the treatment of leukemia. Idelalisib (not included in CMAP database) shows high specificity against the p110δ isoform of PI3K, which is expressed mainly in hemocyte and marginally in limited brain regions (according to Allen Brain Atlas). Considering that the dysfunction in FXS involves numerous brain structures, the therapeutic efficacy of idelalisib may be limited. Another complication is that its pharmacokinetic profile has only been examined for blood absorption and excretion. Whether idelalisib can cross the blood brain barrier has not been determined and not known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par33">In summary, our study supports the value of holistic transcriptome analysis in therapeutic discovery and repurposing FDA-approved drugs for FXS treatment. Experimental validation of trifluoperazine efficacy in FXS mouse model suggests a practical treatment strategy. Our results along with a recent computational study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> also encourage broader application of transcriptome screening with public databases in guiding drug discovery for other neurological disorders.</p>

Ambulatory movement distance in the whole arena and in the center area of the open field were determined every 10-min during the 1-h testing period by the TruScan Photo Beam Activity System (Coulbourn Instruments, Whitehall, PA).</p>
<p id="Par47">To examine passive avoidance learning, 2.5-month to 3.5-month-old mice were introduced into the lit half of the passive avoidance chamber (Coulbourn Instruments, Whitehall, PA) and allowed to explore for 1 min before the trap door was opened. The trap door was closed as soon as the mouse entered the dark chamber. A mild foot shock (0.7 mA for 2 s) was immediately delivered. The mouse was removed from the dark chamber and returned to its home cage 30 s after the delivery of foot shock. The mice were tested 24 h after training. During testing, the mouse was put in the lit chamber and crossover latency to the dark chamber was recorded. If mice stayed in the lit chamber for more than 600 s, they were manually removed from the chamber, and 600 s was used as their crossover latency. In a stronger training paradigm, three electric foot shocks (0.7 mA for 2 s per shock with 10 s interval) were delivered during training when animal entered the dark chamber.</p>
<p id="Par48">To measure audiogenic seizures (AGS), 21-days to 24-days-old mice were placed in a box (30 cm L by 17 cm W by 12 cm H) with a flat plastic lid. A personal alarm (from Streetwise, item # SWPDAL) was taped to the lid of the box and wired to a DC power supply to keep the sound amplitude constant. The mouse was allowed to acclimatize to the box for 5 min, following which a 120-dB sound was emitted from the alarm for 2 min. The number of mice undergoing seizure within the 2-min period was counted. Audiogenic seizures were considered when wild running and/or clonic/tonic seizures occur.</p>
<p id="Par49">Some of the animals were re-used in different behavioral tests (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>). Mice used for open field test were later used for social interaction. Some mice used for marble-burying test were later used for light-dark test. Mice used for stereotypic digging were used later for passive avoidance. The interval between the two behavioral tests was at least 10 days.</p>

<title>Neuronal culture and measurements of protein synthesis</title>
<p id="Par50">Primary hippocampal neurons were cultured with samples obtained from postnatal day 0 WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. Protein synthesis was determined by the SUnSET method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. DIV 14 hippocampal neurons were pre-treated with trifluoperazine at various concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, 10, and 20 μM as indicated) for 30 min followed by 5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma, Cat #P8833) treatment for 30 min. Cells were lysed in Buffer H (50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM DTT). The samples were sonicated and centrifuged. An aliquot of the supernatant was used to determine protein concentration, and the rest was denatured in Laemmli buffer. Twenty microgram protein was separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with anti-puromycin antibody (KeraFAST, Cat # EQ0001, 1:1000). The relative amount of loading was determined by β-actin. ImageJ was used to measure the combined signal intensity of proteins with molecular weights ranging from 15 to 250 kDa.</p>

<sec id="Sec18">
<title>Examination of drug effects by Western blot</title>
<p id="Par51">To examine the in vitro effects, DIV 14 hippocampal neurons (WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO as indicated) were treated with vehicle, vorinostat (20 μM), trichostatin A (20 μM), LY-294002 (20 µM), trifluoperazine (at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 10, and 20 μM as indicated), SCH23390 (at 1, 2, and 10 μM as indicated), raclopride (at 1, 2, and 10 μM as indicated), and rapamycin (20 nM) for 1 h. Immediately after treatment, neurons were lysed in Laemmli buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCL, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromophenol blue). To examine the in vivo effect, 2-month to-3-month old wild type (WT) and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice were injected with 0.05 mg/kg trifluoperazine or vehicle. Hippocampus was rapidly dissected 1 h after injection and homogenized in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% NP-40). Protein content in hippocampal homogenates was determined using Bradford’s assay. Same amount of cell extract/lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transferring to nitrocellulose membranes. The following antibodies were used to detect the corresponding targets. Anti-S6K1 (Cat #2708, 1:1000 dilution), anti-phospho-S6K1 (at Thr389) (Cat #9234, 1:1000 dilution), anti-phospho-Akt (at Ser473) (Cat #4060, 1:1000 dilution), anti-Akt (Cat #9272, 1:1000 dilution), anti-acetylated histone H3 at K9 (Cat #9649P, 1:1000 dilution), anti-acetylated histone H4 at K8 (Cat #2594P, 1:1000 dilution), anti-histone H3 (Cat #4499 P, 1:1000 dilution), and anti-histone H4 (Cat #13919 P, 1:1000 dilution) were from Cell Signaling. β-actin antibody was from Sigma (Cat #A5441, 1:10,000 dilution). Anti-FMRP (mouse monoclonal antibody 2F5, 1:1000) was a generous gift from Dr. Jennifer Darnell at the Rockefeller University. For quantification purpose, level of phospho-S6K1, phospho-Akt, acetylated-H3, and acetylated-H4 was normalized to the level of total S6K1, Akt, H3, and H4, respectively. The membrane was normally first blotted for the phosphorylated and acetylated proteins. Then, the same membrane was stripped; the effectiveness of stripping/removing the phospho-specific or acetylation-specific antibodies was checked by blotting with secondary antibody alone. The successfully stripped membrane was then washed and re-probed with antibodies against the corresponding total protein. The Western blot signal was detected by the Odyssey digital imaging system. Relative intensity of the Western blot signal in the no treatment control group, which was quantified using ImageJ (NIH, MD, USA), was defined as 1. Signal in the treatment samples was compared to the control group.</p>

<title>PI3 kinase assay</title>
<p id="Par52">Hippocampal neurons (cultured from WT mice) on DIV 14 were treated with trifluoperazine (20 μM) or vehicle for 30 min. Neurons were then washed once with PBS and lysed in 100 μl lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 40 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton, 1.5 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate) with proteinase inhibitor (Roche) on ice for 10 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and protein concentration was determined by Bradford method. PI3 kinase activity was measured using PI3 kinase activity ELISA kit from Echelon Biosciences according to the manufacture’s protocol. Briefly, 30 μl of lysate was incubated with 30 μl of 10 μM PIP2 and 20 μM trifluoperazine or vehicle at 37 °C for 3 h. The reaction buffer contained 2 mM DTT and 100 μM ATP. The amount of PIP3 produced by PI3 kinase was determined by ELISA. The relative amounts of PIP3 in the samples were used to determine the activity of PI3 kinase.</p>

<title>Examination of neuron viability</title>
<p id="Par53">DIV 14 hippocampal neurons were treated with vehicle or 10 or 20 μM trifluoperazine for 1 h. As a positive control, NMDA treatment (50 μM for 30 min) was used to trigger neuronal cell death. Immediately after treatment, drugs were removed by replacement with conditioned medium. Twenty hours after treatment, neurons were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with DAPI. As described in our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, neuron survival (i.e., viability) was quantified by the ratio of neurons showing diffused nuclear DAPI staining to neurons showing condensed nuclear DAPI staining.</p>

<sec id="Sec21">
<title>Statistics and reproducibility</title>
<p id="Par54">Animals subjected to different treatment were randomly assigned. Sample size was estimated by power analysis (80% power and probability level of 0.05 along with the anticipated effect size) or based on previous reports. Data were collected from two (for biochemical analyses with primary neurons) or more than two litters (for behavioral analyses and in vivo biochemical analysis) and combined. Experimenters were blind to the treatments and genotypes, which were decoded before data analyses. Data with normal distribution were analyzed by Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test or ANOVA. Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test (two-sided) was used to compare data collected from two groups. One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc tests were used to analyze data involving different treatments. Two-way ANOVA and Holm-Sidak post hoc tests were to analyze data involving genotype effect and treatment effect. Three-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyze the open field data at different time points during the 60-min test. When normal distribution and equal variance were not detected (i.e., crossover latency during testing for passive avoidance), the numerical values were first converted to categorical data (latency of 600 s or less than 600 s was assigned to different category) and then analyzed by Fisher’s exact test. Data reporting AGS were analyzed by Chi-square and/or Fisher’s exact test. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Differences with <italic>p</italic> value less than 0.05 were considered significant. SPSS 11.5 for Windows (IBM) was used for all data analysis with consideration of adjustment for multiple conparisons.</p>
<p id="Par55">The statistical method for CMAP analysis was described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In brief, the <italic>p</italic> value was computed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics. It is estimated empirically by computing the enrichment of 100,000 sets of instances randomly selected from all instances in the result.</p>
