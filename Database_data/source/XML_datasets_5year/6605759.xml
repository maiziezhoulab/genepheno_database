<p>An antibiotic cocktail leads to reductions in brain amyloidosis, altered morphology, and gene expression in microglia of male but not female transgenic mice that exhibit Aβ deposits. The microbiome plays a causal role in modulating Aβ burden and microglia phenotypes.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>We demonstrated that an antibiotic cocktail (ABX)-perturbed gut microbiome is associated with reduced amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque pathology and astrogliosis in the male amyloid precursor protein (<italic>APP)<sub>SWE</sub></italic>/presenilin 1 <italic>(PS1)<sub>ΔE9</sub></italic> transgenic model of Aβ amyloidosis. We now show that in an independent, aggressive <italic>APP<sub>SWE</sub>/PS1<sub>L166P</sub></italic> (APPPS1-21) mouse model of Aβ amyloidosis, an ABX-perturbed gut microbiome is associated with a reduction in Aβ pathology and alterations in microglial morphology, thus establishing the generality of the phenomenon. Most importantly, these latter alterations occur only in brains of male mice, not in the brains of female mice. Furthermore, ABX treatment lead to alterations in levels of selected microglial expressed transcripts indicative of the “M0” homeostatic state in male but not in female mice. Finally, we found that transplants of fecal microbiota from age-matched APPPS1-21 male mice into ABX-treated APPPS1-21 male restores the gut microbiome and partially restores Aβ pathology and microglial morphology, thus demonstrating a causal role of the microbiome in the modulation of Aβ amyloidosis and microglial physiology in mouse models of Aβ amyloidosis.</p>

<body><sec id="s01" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common age-associated chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is pathologically characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides in senile plaques and the intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, positron emission tomography studies showed that activated microglia and neuroinflammation are highly correlated with cognitive decline in AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cagnin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamelin et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, genome-wide association studies have identified numerous polymorphisms within genes critical for innate immune responses (i.e., CD33 and TREM-2) that confer an elevated risk of late-onset AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griciuc et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guerreiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Naj et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Efthymiou and Goate, 2017</xref>). It is now well established that neuroinflammation, instead of being simply a bystander that is activated by central stimuli (such as senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heneka et al., 2015</xref>) and peripheral stimuli (such as endotoxins; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wendeln et al., 2018</xref>), plays an important role in AD pathogenesis.</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that intestinal microbiota could play a major role in peripheral as well as central immune activation and inflammation in various neurological conditions including autism spectrum disorders, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, and AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cryan and O’Mahony, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sherwin et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, patients with cognitive impairment and brain amyloidosis exhibit altered gut microbiota, which in turn was significantly associated with pro-inflammatory cytokine gene profiles in the blood of these subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cattaneo et al., 2017</xref>). In this regard, other studies have reported decreased Firmicutes, increased Bacteroidetes, and decreased <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> in AD subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vogt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhuang et al., 2018</xref>). Besides these human studies, microbiome changes have also been reported in transgenic (Tg) mouse models of Aβ amyloidogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandscheid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bäuerl et al., 2018</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harach et al. (2017)</xref> demonstrated that germ-free (GF) APPPS1-21 Tg mice that express familial AD–linked <italic>APP<sub>SWE</sub></italic> and <italic>PS1<sub>L166P</sub></italic> transgenes driven by the neuron-specific Thy1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Radde et al., 2006</xref>) exhibit reduced Aβ deposition in the brain compared with their specific pathogen-free counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harach et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, we have documented that in the APP<sub>SWE</sub>/PS1<sub>ΔE9</sub> mouse model of Aβ amyloidosis, postnatal and long-term antibiotic cocktail (ABX) administration in male mice leads to reduced Aβ deposition and associated gliosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Minter et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2017</xref>) and that long-term ABX treatment leads to reductions in Aβ deposition selectively in males but not in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Minter et al., 2016</xref>). While these studies collectively establish a strong link between the gut microbiome and AD pathogenesis, the mechanism(s) by which microbial alterations impact on pathogenesis remain silent.</p><p>Several investigations of the microbiome-gut-brain axis have shown that the microbiome plays a critical role in the development of brain circuitry, neurophysiology, behavior, and most importantly, the physiology of brain microglial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braniste et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sharon et al., 2016</xref>). Microglia, also known as “the resident macrophages of the brain,” constitute the first line of defense against injury and infection. Microglia also contribute to brain development throughout embryonic and adult life by regulating aspects of synaptic transmission, synapse formation and pruning, cell death, cell survival, and embryonic brain wiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schafer and Stevens, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ransohoff and El Khoury, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reemst et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tay et al., 2017</xref>). The gut microbiome is an important environmental cue for microglial function in immune and neuronal responses throughout the host’s life span. In this regard, microglia respond to environmental challenges in a sex- and time-dependent manner beginning at prenatal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thion et al., 2018</xref>), and significant differences in the transcriptomes of microglia obtained from adult male versus female mice have been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Villa et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, microglial maturation and function are impaired both in the absence of the microbiome in GF or ABX-treated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erny et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016</xref>). For example, microglial cells in GF and ABX-treated mice display significantly altered inflammatory gene expression profiles that influence their surveillance function that is accompanied by altered cellular morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erny et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To these aforementioned aspects of microbiome-mediated effects on microglial homeostasis, clinical and preclinical studies have revealed that sex has a major impact on a wide range of autoimmune disorders (i.e., females are 2–10 times more susceptible than males; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zandman-Goddard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fish, 2008</xref>). In this regard, while sex-specific differences in Aβ burden and tauopathy are not apparent in the brains of aged individuals and AD patients, sex differences in the clinical phenotype and progression of AD have been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scheinin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gottesman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jack et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vemuri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavedo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>While compelling, our published studies on the role of the gut microbiome on Aβ amyloidosis in male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Minter et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2017</xref>) was limited to assessments in a single strain of mice, namely, the amyloid precursor protein (APP)<sub>SWE</sub>/presenilin 1 (PS1)<sub>ΔE9</sub> mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jankowsky et al., 2002</xref>) in which expression of cDNA encoding familial AD–linked human APP<sub>SWE</sub> and PS1<sub>ΔE9</sub> variants are transcriptionally driven by the ubiquitously expressed mouse prion protein promoter. In view of potential caveats associated with transgene insertion and mis- and/or overexpression of the prion protein promoter-driven transgenes, we examined the impact of long-term ABX treatment in male and female APPPS1-21 mice that exhibit Aβ amyloidosis by the age of 6–7 wk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Radde et al., 2006</xref>). Confirming our earlier findings, we now report that long-term ABX treatment resulted in reductions of Aβ deposition and microglial morphological alterations in male but not female APPPS1-21 mice. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that males exhibited profound changes in microglial gene expression compared with ABX-treated female mice. Finally, transplants of fecal microbiota from age-matched APPPS1-21 male mice into ABX-treated male mice partially restored Aβ amyloidosis and microglial phenotypes that are observed in vehicle-treated APPPS1-21 mice. Collectively, our studies reveal that in two independent Tg mouse models of Aβ amyloidosis ABX-mediated microbiome perturbations influence brain Aβ amyloidosis and microglial homeostasis in a sex-specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="s02" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>Thy1 promoter-driven APP<sub>SWE</sub>/PS1<sub>L166P</sub> transgenes are selectively expressed in the brain</title><p>To assess the tissue-level expression of human APPswe in the Tg mouse line, we performed Western blot analysis of detergent-soluble extracts using the human APP-specific 6E10 antibody. These studies revealed that in 4- to 5-mo-old APPPS1-21 mice, human APPswe is expressed selectively in the brain (Fig. S1, lanes 3 and 4), while in 8-mo-old <italic>APP<sub>SWE</sub>/PS1<sub>ΔE9</sub></italic> Tg mice, APPswe is expressed both in the brain and in a variety of sampled peripheral tissues (Fig. S1), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jankowsky et al., 2002</xref>). Importantly, Aβ peptides are only detectable in extracts prepared from the brains of either mouse line (Fig. S1, lanes 1–4).</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>Postnatal antibiotic treatment results in similar microbiome changes in male and female APPPS1-21 mice at postnatal day (P) 22</title><p>The fecal microbiota at P22 was evaluated by using Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing. The β diversity differences between bacterial communities found in the vehicle- and ABX-treated groups were calculated with the weighted UniFrac metric and visualized by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Microbial β diversity was significantly different between vehicle- and ABX-treated groups and showed clear clustering by using PCoA (Fig. S2 A). There was no significant difference in β diversity between male and female samples, but there was significantly reduced richness and evenness in ABX-treated males and ABX-treated females compared with their vehicle-treated counterparts (Fig. S2, B and C).</p><p>Analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) analyses of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing data at the DADA2 inferred exact sequence variant (ESV) level (taxonomy assigned via GreenGenes) and clustered species levels were performed to determine the taxa that described the most variance between groups. Vehicle-treated male and female mice showed no differences at P22. Likewise, ABX-treated mice did not differ significantly in ESVs or species by sex. However, as expected, ABX treatment showed significant changes in microbial composition in both sexes (Table S1) compared with their respective vehicle controls.</p><p>Similarly, as anticipated, predicted metagenome analysis through Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) showed significant differences in many pathways between ABX-treated male and female mice compared with their vehicle-treated counterparts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), and there were no significant differences between male and female mice irrespective of the vehicle or ABX treatments. Taken together, these data indicate that the microbiome changes in both male and female mice after P14–P21 ABX gavage are highly comparable.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait"

ABX-treated male mice exhibited elevated levels of anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective factors, including insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, Interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-10, and decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, including Eotaxin1, IL-1B, IL-2, IL-3, IL-17A, and RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed, and Secreted; also known as Chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 5 [CCL5]), relative to vehicle-treated controls. In contrast, ABX-treated female mice showed up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, including IL-1B, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-17A. Importantly, ABX-treated female mice exhibited elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as CCL11 (Eotaxin1; 7.11-fold), IL-1B (6.92-fold), IL-2 (6.35-fold), IL-3 (7.01-fold), IL-5 (7.32-fold), IL-9 (8.51-fold), and IL-17A (7.44-fold), relative to ABX-treated male mice. Moreover, ABX-treated female mice also exhibited decreased levels of IL-12 (11.16-fold), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1; also known as KC; 13.02-fold), and P-selectin (11.94-fold) cytokines/chemokines compared with ABX-treated male mice. These findings suggest that the long-term ABX-altered microbiome has distinct effects on the circulating chemokines and cytokines in a sex-specific manner with female mice exhibiting higher levels of pro-inflammatory mediators.</p></sec><sec id="s07"><title>Long-term ABX treatment results in reduced Aβ deposition only in male APPPS1-21 mice</title><p>To investigate the effect of long-term ABX treatment on Aβ amyloidosis in APPPS1-21 mice, we sacrificed animals at 7 wk of age.

We have explored the impact of the microbiome in Tg mouse models of Aβ amyloidosis. Extending our earlier findings using the APP<sub>SWE</sub>/PS1<sub>ΔE9</sub> mouse model showing a significant impact of ABX-mediated alterations of the microbiome on Aβ pathology and microglial phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Minter et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2017</xref>), we have examined these parameters in another well-established APPPS1-21 mouse model and now offer several important insights. First, we demonstrated that long-term ABX treatment of male APPPS1-21 mice results in distinct alterations in peripheral cytokines/chemokines, changes in the composition of the fecal microbiome, and a significant reduction in Aβ deposits. In contrast, ABX-treated female mice exhibited a greater abundance of bacteria and predicted metabolic pathways that are considered pro-inflammatory, higher levels of plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and no apparent effects on the levels of Aβ deposits compared with vehicle-treated animals. Second, we show that ABX-treated male mice exhibited alterations in microglial morphologies similar to those observed in GF wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erny et al., 2015</xref>) and transcriptional signatures that are consistent with activation of the TGFβ signaling pathway that is a hallmark of M0 (homeostatic) microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butovsky et al., 2014</xref>). In sharp contrast, the microglia in ABX-treated female mice exhibited retracted processes and larger cell bodies that closely mimicked that observed in MGnD microglia, findings supported by transcriptional readouts. Finally, transplants of feces from age-matched APPPS1-21 male donor mice into long-term ABX-treated male mice resulted in the restoration of microbiota profiles, elevated MGnD-type microglia, and partial restoration in Aβ deposition, thus confirming a causal relationship between the gut microbiome and AD-associated inflammation and Aβ pathology in this model.</p><p>While it has been reported that the microbiome can modulate disease phenotypes in a sex-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Markle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yurkovetskiy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sampson et al., 2016</xref>), our current studies are the first to report sex-specific alterations in AD-related phenotypes by the gut microbiome using a mouse model of Aβ amyloidosis. Our results are consistent with published studies that included GF and ABX-treated wild-type mice, wherein the microbiome exerts sex-specific effects on microglial maturation leading to altered immune responses to environmental stimuli such as the bacterial endotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erny et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanamsagar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thion et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together with our current findings, it is highly probable that the microbiome can have a significant impact on the maturation and function of brain immune cells and in a sex-specific manner.</p><p>The mechanism(s) underlying “clearance” of Aβ aggregates/oligomers/plaques are largely silent. In this regard, our microglial transcriptome studies indicate that microglia in vehicle-treated mice exhibit an MGnD signature and that ABX-treated male mice exhibit an M0 homeostatic signature, leading to the suggestion that ABX alters the cellular response of microglia to Aβ plaques (or oligomeric Aβ species). Alternatively, and a model that we favor, is that at the time of culling, microglia exhibit an M0 signature because these cells have been clearing plaques/oligomers throughout the lifetime of the animal and there is very little left to be cleared. Future studies using real-time, simultaneous two-photon confocal imaging of GFP-labeled microglia and plaque intercalating dyes during the mouse lifetime will be essential to resolving this important lacuna in our understanding of the role and mechanism(s) by which microglia in ABX-treated animals mediate clearance of Aβ in the mouse models.</p><p>Peripheral inflammation plays a major role in central inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wendeln et al., 2018</xref>). We observed relatively lower expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, including cluster of differentiation 30 (CD30), CD40, CCL11 (Eotaxin1), IL-1B, IL-2, IL-3, IL-17A, LIX (CXC5), RANTES (CCL5), and SCF, and higher anti-inflammatories, such as IL10 in ABX-treated male mice. In contrast, ABX-treated female mice showed relatively higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (CCL11, IL-1B, IL-2, IL-3, IL-5, IL-9, IL-17, LIX, and SCF) compared with ABX-treated male mice. In this regard, microbiome-derived metabolites can influence peripheral cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wikoff et al., 2009</xref>). Microbiota can also influence the relative populations and function of subsets of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ivanov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorrestein et al., 2014</xref>) modulating mucosal immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mazmanian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kamada et al., 2013</xref>) and systemic immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belkaid and Naik, 2013</xref>). It is possible that altered peripheral inflammation due to microbiome perturbations in our model could impact brain inflammation that ultimately affects microglia. Future investigations of the effect of plasma samples on microglial Aβ phagocytosis from our mice will allow us to address the role of peripheral inflammation.</p><p>Our microbiome data reveal no significant differences comparing sexes in vehicle and ABX treatment at P22, but the microbiome profiles at the time of culling (7 wk of age) represented a significant effect of sex in ABX-treated mice. Importantly, we observed ABX-treated female mice showed a greater abundance of <italic>Allobaculum (s_unknown)</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia (s_muciniphila)</italic>, as well as higher levels of peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines and phagocytic microglia and no changes in Aβ amyloidosis. Certain <italic>Allobaculum</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> species are known mucin degraders, a greater proportion of which could lead to a decrease the mucin-layer thickness, which may not only result in greater inflammatory activation but also could increase the likelihood of translocation of bacteria or bacterial metabolites from the gut to circulation. We are not able to prove this with the current data, but it remains a compelling hypothesis to test. Increased microbial or metabolite translocation can increase endotoxin levels in the systemic circulation, affecting peripheral and central inflammation as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Punder and Pruimboom, 2015</xref>). <italic>Akkermansia</italic> has previously been associated with various neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keshavarzian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jangi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engen et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Allobaculum</italic> has been negatively correlated with anti-inflammatory genes Forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3), IL-10, and intestinal barrier proteins ZO-1 and occludin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). In the FMT study, a large number of organisms of order Bacteroidales were found to be higher in ABX+FMT–treated mice, possibly driving a restoration in pathology. Significant changes in <italic>Akkermansia</italic> and <italic>Allobaculum</italic> were not observed via ANCOM in this cohort. Other taxa that were increased in ABX+FMT–treated mice also may have contributed to pathology; in particular <italic>Mucispirillum schaedleri</italic>, a possible pathobiont (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>), was in a higher abundance in the FMT treatment group. It thus remains unclear if changes in diversity, changes in overall bacterial communities, or changes in mentioned individual genera result in observed sex-specific immune and pathological outcomes in our model. Future transplantation studies involving full FMT or selected bacteria in GF mice will help resolve these issues.</p><p>Finally, we acknowledge several limitations of our studies. First, we used long-term ABX treatment to evaluate microbiome perturbations and effects on amyloidosis and microglial activity and our FMT protocol to prove causation was performed simultaneously with diluted ABX. It is plausible that diluted ABX in drinking water could have an impact on FMT efficiency that affects our final outcomes of amyloidosis and microglia morphology measures. Future work using established short-term (P14–P21) ABX gavage will allow us to address this concern in our model. Second, our NanoString studies were aimed at investigating microglial inflammatory gene profiles, but because the RNA was prepared from the entire cerebral cortex our data could certainly be influenced by the expression of the identified genes in other cell types represented in the cortex. Future transcriptomic studies of purified microglia and other cortical cell types in our experimental paradigm will be essential to clarify the underlying cellular and physiological basis underlying the observations reported herein.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings are fully consistent with the conclusion that ABX-mediated perturbations of the microbiome have selective, sex-specific influences on brain Aβ amyloidosis and microglial homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s14" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s15"><title>Animal housing and handling</title><p>APPPS1-21 mice were maintained on a C57BL6Cj background and obtained from M.

Fresh fecal pellets from individual donor mice were collected and immediately mixed in sterile water (5 mg fecal content dissolved in 1 ml sterile water). The fecal slurry supernatant was collected after allowing the suspension to settle down by using gravity for 5 min. Each postnatally treated high-dose ABX-recipient mouse in the ABX+FMT–treated group received 200 µl of freshly prepared fecal slurry from the age-matched donor mouse by gastric gavage daily starting at on P25 until the time of sacrifice simultaneously with low-dose ABX in the water (original experimental design). The ABX+Vehicle–treated group received 200 µl of sterile water in a similar fashion to nullify the everyday gavage effect.</p></sec><sec id="s25"><title>RNA isolation and NanoString analysis</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from the cortex of 7-wk-old mice by using TRIzol reagent (Ambion) followed by RNeasy Micro clean-up (QIAGEN) procedure according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All RNAs were analyzed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer for quality assessment. 100 ng of total RNA was used in NanoString analysis by using MG550 Chip, which contains 400 unique and enriched microglial genes and 150 inflammation- and phagocytosis-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butovsky et al., 2014</xref>). NanoString data were analyzed by using nSolver software. RNA counts for target genes were normalized to the mean of housekeeping genes (Cltc, Gapdh, Gusb, Hprt, Pgk1, and Tubb5) to account for differences in the RNA content. The value of the highest negative control on the chip was used to set the cutoff, and the fold changes were calculated by comparing the ABX-treated group to the respective vehicle-treated group.</p></sec><sec id="s26"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed by using GraphPad Prism software. Multiple-group comparisons were performed by using two-way ANOVA, and group differences were evaluated by using the post hoc Bonferroni multiple-comparison test. For three-group comparisons (Tg_donor versus ABX+Vehicle versus ABX+FMT), one-way ANOVA was performed followed by Bonferroni multiple-comparison post hoc analysis. Two-group comparisons (ABX+Vehicle and ABX+FMT) were performed by using the two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test. Significance was accepted at values of P &lt; 0.05. NanoString data (RNA counts) were normalized by the geometric mean of six housekeeping genes: <italic>Cltc</italic>, <italic>Gapdh</italic>, <italic>Gusb</italic>, <italic>Hprt</italic>, <italic>Pgk1</italic>, and <italic>Tubb5</italic>. A cutoff was introduced at the value of the highest negative control present on the chip. A two-way ANOVA was used to identify significantly affected genes (P &lt; 0.05) among four treatment/sex groups and Student’s <italic>t</italic> tests were used to identify ABX treatment effects. Heatmaps and clustering were generated in R by using heatmap.2 from the gplots package and the prcomp from the stats package. For clustering, z-scores were calculated by using the mean expression of biological replicates per treatment group and sex and then subsequently clustered by using K-means. A scree plot was used to assess the number of clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s27"><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 presents Western blot results by using human APP)-specific 6E10 antibody to detect steady-state levels of full-length human APP (APP-FL), β-carboxyl-terminal fragment (β-CTF), and Aβ peptides comparing both APPPS1-21 and APP<sub>SWE</sub>/PS1<sub>ΔE9</sub> mice.
