<abstract>
<p>Obesity increases the risk for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in the disease process remain unclear. Recently, we have developed a transgenic obese mouse model (Mito-Ob) by prohibitin mediated mitochondrial remodeling in adipocytes. The Mito-Ob mice develop obesity in a sex-neutral manner, but obesity-associated adipose inflammation and metabolic dysregulation in a male sex-specific manner. Here we report that with aging, the male Mito-Ob mice spontaneously develop obesity-linked NASH and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In contrast, the female Mito-Ob mice maintained normal glucose and insulin levels and did not develop NASH and HCC. The anti-inflammatory peptide ghrelin was significantly upregulated in the female mice and down regulated in the male mice compared with respective control mice. In addition, a reduction in the markers of mitochondrial content and function was found in the liver of male Mito-Ob mice with NASH/HCC development. We found that ERK1/2 signaling was significantly upregulated whereas STAT3 signaling was significantly down regulated in the tumors from Mito-Ob mice. These data provide a proof-of-concept that the metabolic and inflammatory status of the adipose tissue and their interplay at the systemic and hepatic level play a central role in the pathogenesis of obesity-linked NASH and HCC.</p>

<body>
<p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which starts in the hepatocytes, is the fifth most common cancer and a leading cause of cancer related death worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The pathogenesis of HCC has been mostly associated with cirrhosis due to chronic infection by hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, as well as toxic injury from alcoholism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. While a substantial number of cases cannot be explained by these etiologies, HCC is increasingly diagnosed among obese individuals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Obesity and obesity-related disorders such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes exhibit an increased risk for developing HCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. For instance, in a large prospective cohort of the Cancer Prevention Study in North American subjects, the relative risk of dying from liver cancer among men with a BMI ≥35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> was 4.5 times higher compared to a reference group with normal body weight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Similarly, in a Swedish cohort study of men, the relative risk of HCC in individuals with a BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> was 3.1 times higher than in normal weight controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Similar findings have been reported from other parts of the world<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Obesity increases male HCC risk by 4–8 fold<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and also increases HCC risk in viral hepatitis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Furthermore, obesity associated tumors appear to be more aggressive, have an increased risk of recurrence, and result in higher mortality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p>
<p>Hepatic manifestations of obesity and metabolic syndrome are collectively termed NAFLD, which is commonly associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Emerging evidence suggests that hepatic mitochondrial dysregulation has a role in the development of NAFLD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. For example, lipotoxicity-related hepatocyte apoptosis has been shown to involve mitochondrial permeability transition opening<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Similarly, oxysterols induced hepatocellular toxicity and NAFLD also involve mitochondrial impairment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In contrast, enhancing mitochondrial function has been reported to reduce hepatic steatosis caused by diet-induced obesity (DIO)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In general, NAFLD is apparently benign, but approximately 20% of all cases present as NASH showing hepatocellular injury and inflammation, with a risk of progression to cirrhosis and HCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The overall public health impact of an association between NAFLD, NASH and HCC remains substantial considering the high prevalence of obesity and related metabolic conditions worldwide. Emerging evidence suggests that NAFLD is associated with the development of non-cirrhotic HCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. For example, an analysis of the SEER-Medicare database identified a total of 17,895 cases of HCC, of which 2,863 cases (16%) were due to biopsy-proven NAFLD without evidence for other etiologies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Remarkably, a total of 1,031 cases (36%) of these NAFLD-associated HCC were diagnosed in non-cirrhotic livers and 18% of these cases developed in isolated fatty livers without steatohepatitis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. These evidences suggest that cirrhosis is not necessary for the development of HCC in obesity. Because of the epidemic proportions of obesity, there is an increasing probability that adverse metabolic conditions coexist with chronic liver disease, and obesity-associated abnormalities may enhance the effect of other established risk factors of HCC. Several studies support this notion such as alcoholic liver disease and chronic viral hepatitis associated HCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. While NASH arising from fatty liver disease seems to be an underlying lesion for some HCC cases, the extent to which the presence or the severity of NASH explains obesity-related HCC remains unclear.</p>
<p>A number of molecular mechanisms have been linked to obesity and its associated abnormalities that may facilitate the development of HCC, such as adipose tissue inflammation, hepatic lipotoxicity, and insulin resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. These and other pathological events in obesity have complex interactions while their relative contribution to the development of HCC in various stages of NAFLD progression remains to be determined. Because of the continuous increase in obesity associated hepatic steatosis worldwide, there is an urgent need to better understand the underlying mechanisms involved in obesity-linked HCC development. However, one major obstacle for the mechanistic study is the lack of suitable animal models that spontaneously develop obesity associated NAFLD, NASH and HCC in a progressive manner. For example, the majority of the studies investigating the impact of obesity on transgene or carcinogen-induced HCC development or progression have been done using DIO rodent models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. A major disadvantage of the DIO model is that it is very difficult to distinguish the effects of the diet from overweight/obesity, and obesity from insulin resistance, which often coexist. For instance, Tsumura Suziki Obese Diabetes (TSOD) mice have been reported to spontaneously develop obesity, diabetes, fatty liver and HCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. However, TSOD mice develop obesity due to hyperphagia that persist throughout the disease course from the development of diabetes to HCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In addition, TSOD mice develop diabetes by ~3 months of age and HCC much later in life (i.e. by 12 months), making it difficult to discern the effect of obesity from coexisting diabetes. Moreover, a number of liver specific transgenic mice have been reported that spontaneously develop HCC, with or without NASH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>; however, they do not develop obesity prior to NASH and HCC. Also, the mechanism involved in the development and progression of carcinogen-induced HCC (an agent-specific HCC due to direct insult of liver) may not apply to obesity-linked HCC in humans, which develop progressively due to systemic changes in the body. Thus, suitable preclinical models that incorporate natural history estimates of disease progression are needed for a better understanding of the mechanisms of obesity-linked NASH and HCC. In addition, a suitable animal model is required for appropriate and meaningful intervention and preclinical studies.</p>
<p>Recently, we have developed a novel transgenic obese mouse model (Mito-Ob) by prohibitin (PHB, also known as PHB1) mediated mitochondrial remodeling in adipocytes, independent of diet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The Mito-Ob mice develop obesity in a sex-neutral manner; however, they develop obesity associated low-grade inflammation, impaired glucose homeostasis, insulin resistance, and consequently NAFLD in a male sex-specific manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. In considering the prevailing notion through which obesity may promote NASH and HCC development, we followed the consequence of NAFLD along with insulin resistance and chronic low-grade inflammation on hepatic phenotype in aging Mito-Ob mice. Here we report that the male Mito-Ob mice spontaneously develop obesity-linked NASH and HCC progressively, independent of diet.</p>

<title>Mito-Ob mice display sex differences in adipose tissue structure and function, and in metabolic dysregulation</title>
<p>Visceral adipose tissue inflammation plays a critical role in obesity associated systemic metabolic dysregulation in both humans and mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The sexually dimorphic metabolic phenotype of Mito-Ob mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> prompted us to investigate the inflammatory status of their adipose tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis using macrophage specific marker anti-CD68 antibody (Abcam) revealed a significant increase in inflammatory macrophages in male Mito-Ob mice compared with wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This difference was not observed between female Mito-Ob mice and control mice, despite comparable obesity and adipocyte hypertrophy in both the male and female Mito-Ob mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Subsequent, data analysis by two-way ANOVA showed statistically significant interaction between sex and genotype (P &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Consistent with the histological phenotype of adipose tissue, a sex-dimorphic change in adiponectin, leptin and resistin was also found. The adiponectin level was significantly upregulated in female Mito-Ob mice but not in male Mito-Ob mice in comparison with respective control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). For adiponectin, no significant interaction was found between sex and genotype by two-way ANOVA (P &lt; 0.27). Leptin and resistin levels were upregulated in male Mito-Ob but remained unchanged in female Mito-Ob mice in comparison with their respective control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Two-way ANOVA showed significant interaction between sex and genotype for leptin but not for resistin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Fasting serum insulin level was significantly upregulated in male Mito-Ob mice compared with control mice, whereas female Mito-Ob mice had insulin levels similar to wild type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Interestingly, Mito-Ob mice showed inverse alteration in the anti-inflammatory peptide ghrelin levels between males and females. Serum ghrelin level was significantly increased in female mice compared with wild type control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). In contrast, male Mito-Ob had a significantly reduced ghrelin level compared with wild type control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Two-way ANOVA showed significant interaction between sex and genotype for insulin and ghrelin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). This would imply that ghrelin might have a role in sexually dimorphic metabolic phenotypes in Mito-Ob mice. Taken together, these data suggest that Mito-Ob mice exhibit sex differences in visceral adipose tissue structure and function, and opposite changes in serum ghrelin levels that correlate with sexually dimorphic metabolic and inflammatory phenotypes of Mito-Ob mice.</p>
<p>In our previous study, we have shown that Mito-Ob mice overexpress PHB in adipose tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and in histiocytes/macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. To confirm that there is no leaky overexpression of PHB from <italic>aP2</italic> promoter in the liver of Mito-Ob mice, we measured PHB protein levels by western immunoblotting. No significant difference in PHB protein level was found in the liver from wild type and transgenic mice suggesting that PHB is not overexpressed in the liver of Mito-Ob mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>NAFLD in male Mito-Ob mice progresses to NASH with aging</title>
<p>The sex specific hyperinsulinemia and ectopic fat accumulation in the liver of male Mito-Ob at 6 months of age, as found in our previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> led us to investigate the hepatic phenotype with aging. Histological examination of the liver at 9 months of age showed signs of NAFLD progression to NASH in male Mito-Ob mice as revealed by the characteristic ballooning of hepatocytes and lymphocyte infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Increased inflammatory macrophages and lymphocytic infiltration in the liver was further confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis using macrophage and lymphocyte specific marker antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Infiltrated cells were predominantly positive for CD20 and CD68, and only few were CD3 positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that obesity associated NAFLD in male Mito-Ob mice spontaneously progress to NASH with aging.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Male Mito-Ob mice spontaneously develop HCC with aging</title>
<p>Interestingly, in our follow-up study we found that male Mito-Ob mice start to develop pale to whitish nodular tumors (2–4 mm) on their liver surfaces around 10–12 months of age, which progressively grew into multifocal larger tumors (6–8 mm) by 12–14 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>), with a prevalence of ~25%. Histological analysis confirmed tissue structure characteristic of HCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Apoptotic cell death as determined by TUNEL staining was significantly increased in the livers of male Mito-Ob mice compared with control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). A parallel increase in Ki67-positive proliferating cells was also observed in the liver of male Mito-Ob mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Tissue necrosis and anisocytosis of hepatic nuclei were also apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Thus, male Mito-Ob mice showed continuous hepatocyte death and compensatory proliferation, a critical process in hepatocarcinogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Mito-Ob mice with NASH/HCC exhibit mitochondrial dysregulation</title>
<p>Glucose and lipid toxicity as well as chronic low-grade inflammation are known to cause mitochondrial dysregulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, and emerging evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysregulation in hepatocytes precedes the onset of NASH and HCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Because the male Mito-Ob mice display all these causative signs, therefore, we sought to know the mitochondrial status in NASH and tumor bearing livers. An immunohistochemical analysis using a mitochondrial marker-specific antibody showed a differential staining pattern in the liver tissue with hepatic lesions, which was significantly diminished in the hepatic lesions compared with the area having normal histological architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>), suggesting a relationship between the hepatic lesions and mitochondrial dysregulation. Livers from the wild-type mice showed a homogenous staining pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) level was significantly decreased in the liver from male Mito-Ob compared with wild type mice as determined by western immunoblotting, which was further reduced in the liver from tumor bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This difference was not observed in the expression level of the nuclear transcription factor-1 (Nrf-2), which is required for nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The expression level of PPARγ-coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), showed a trend similar to Tfam protein level, however, it was not statistically different between different groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The mitochondrial DNA copy number was significantly reduced in Mito-Ob mice with NASH development compared with the control liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). However in tumor samples, the mitochondrial DNA copy number was up regulated in comparison with control and NASH samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these data suggest that the hepatic phenotype in male Mito-Ob mice mimics obesity-associated mitochondrial dysregulation in steatohepatitis and HCC in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Mito-Ob mice with HCC showed increased hepatic oxidative DNA damage</title>
<p>To further explore the link between mitochondrial dysregulation and HCC development in male Mito-Ob mice, we measured oxidative DNA damage using the ROS antibody. Hepatic oxidative DNA damage was significantly increased in the liver of tumor bearing Mito-Ob mice compared with Mito-Ob mice without tumors and wild type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). An increase in in oxidative DNA damage was also found in Mito-Ob mice without tumors compared to wild type mice; however, it was significantly less than Mito-Ob mice with tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). Collectively, these data point towards a role of oxidative stress in the obesity-linked pathogenesis of NASH and HCC.</p>
<p>In this context, it is important to note that mitochondrial impairment and hepatic cell deaths are common features of NASH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, whereas progression from NASH to HCC also involves mark increase in compensatory cell proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. This may be the reason for a negative correlation that was observed between mtDNA copy number and oxidative stress during NASH and HCC development in Mito-Ob mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c–e</xref>). Moreover, this data suggests that an increase in mtDNA may not necessarily mean fully adapted mitochondria.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Mito-Ob mice with HCC showed reduced liver ghrelin level</title>
<p>The pathogenesis of NASH and HCC often associated with increased hepatic inflammation. Because male Mito-Ob mice showed reduced serum ghrelin level and increased hepatic inflammation, therefore, we determined the expression level of ghrelin in the liver from Mito-Ob mice by western immunoblotting. Similar to serum ghrelin levels, tumor bearing liver from male Mito-Ob mice showed significantly reduced ghrelin level in comparison with liver from Mito-Ob mice without tumor and wild type control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Whereas liver from female Mito-Ob showed significantly increased ghrelin level compared with their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), suggesting a potential role of anti-inflammatory peptide ghrelin in in the development of NASH and HCC in male Mito-Ob mice.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>ERK1/2 and STAT3 signaling are inversely altered in the liver tumors from Mito-Ob mice</title>
<p>To get insight into the cell signaling pathways involved in HCC development in Mito-Ob mice, we determined the activation level of PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK and STAT3 signaling pathways because they have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, and have been shown to be modulated by PHB in other cell/tissue types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. The phopsho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) level was significantly increased in the liver from male Mito-Ob mice compared with wild type mice, and further increased in the tumor bearing livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). In contrast, the phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3) level showed significant reduction in Mito-Ob mice, and further reduced in tumor bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). No significant change in p-Akt levels was found in the liver from Mito-Ob mice with and without tumor in comparison with the wild type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest a role for increased oncogenic mediator p-ERK and decreased p-STAT3 in the liver tumor development in male Mito-Ob mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study reports a role of obesity related hyperinsulinemia and chronic low-grade inflammation in the development of NASH and HCC, independent of diet and carcinogen respectively. This pathological progression is marked by adipose inflammation, an inverse alteration of serum insulin and ghrelin levels, an increase in hepatic lipid accumulation, macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration, and a reduction in hepatic mitochondrial content and function, with a parallel increase in hepatic DNA damage, cell death and compensatory proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Of note, both female and male Mito-Ob mice have a comparable degree of obesity however, only the males displayed pathological features of NASH and HCC. This would suggest that obesity alone is not sufficient for the development of NASH and HCC but rather require additional effects of adipose inflammation, hyperinsulinemia and the degree of hepatic inflammation.</p>
<p>In this context, it is important to note that there are a number of obese rodent models available that display obesity-associated metabolic dysregulation and NAFLD. However, the majority of them do not develop obesity-linked HCC spontaneously like male Mito-Ob mice, except TSOD mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. However, TSOD mice also develop diabetes along with obesity and it remains unclear whether TSOD mice develop HCC due to obesity or diabetes. This raises an important question: <italic>how</italic> and <italic>why</italic> do obesity-associated abnormalities lead to HCC development in male Mito-Ob mice? This may in part be due to a significant reduction in ghrelin levels in male Mito-Ob mice because emerging evidences suggest that ghrelin is an important anti-inflammatory peptide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Since obesity-associated chronic low-grade inflammation in major metabolic tissues is considered an important driver for obesity related disorders, it is possible that the anti-inflammatory function of ghrelin has a role in the sexually dimorphic metabolic phenotype in Mito-Ob mice. A reduced ghrelin level in male Mito-Ob mice may be permissive in the development of obesity-associated chronic low-grade inflammation, which in turn promotes insulin resistance, NASH and HCC. By the same token, an increased ghrelin level in female Mito-Ob mice may have a protective role against obesity-associated low-grade inflammation, and subsequently against insulin resistance and NAFLD.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a parallel decrease in liver ghrelin level in Mito-Ob mice during disease progression as observed in this study may be due to a sex-dimorphic effect of PHB on ghrelin production from macrophages, as macrophages are known to produce ghrelin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, which in turn contribute to the development of NASH and HCC in male Mito-Ob mice and confer a protection in female mice. We propose that PHB overexpressing adipocytes and macrophages respond differently in males and females, especially in obesity, and may have a role in sex differences in metabolic dysregulation and adipose inflammation, with as a consequence sex-dimorphic NASH and HCC development in male Mito-Ob mice. It would be interesting to know whether normalization of insulin and/or ghrelin levels would reduce or prevent NASH and HCC occurrence in the male Mito-Ob mice. Of note, insulin sensitizers such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors have been studied as therapeutic approaches for NAFLD in recent years and have been shown to have some beneficial effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. In addition, treatment with anti-inflammatory peptide ghrelin has been reported to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, NAFLD and NASH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Thus, a combination therapy of insulin sensitizers with anti-inflammatory agents, especially ghrelin, may provide a better outcome that warrants further investigation. The male Mito-Ob mouse would be a fitting model for such preclinical studies because they display both pathological features: insulin resistance and significantly reduced serum ghrelin levels.</p>
<p>Our data suggest an important role of the oncogenic determinant p-ERK in combination with p-STAT3 down regulation and mitochondrial dysregulation in the development of HCC in male Mito-Ob mice. Whether these changes are related to each other or work independently in HCC development remains to be determined. Glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, and chronic low-grade inflammation are known to cause mitochondrial dysregulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. A number of studies have reported mitochondrial dysregulation in the liver in the pathogenesis of fatty liver and HCC both in humans and rodents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. In addition, recently p-STAT3 has been shown to play an important role in the maintenance of mitochondrial function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. A parallel change in mitochondrial dysregulation and the p-STAT3 level during HCC development in male Mito-Ob mice are consistent with the emerging evidence in the literature. However, it is not known whether they coordinate in the development of HCC, which warrants further investigation. In this context, it is important to note that the liver specific Phb knockout (<italic>Phb</italic>−/−) mice have been reported earlier, which also develop HCC by 35–46 weeks of age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. HCC development in the <italic>Phb</italic>−/− mice has been attributed to the tumor suppressor function of PHB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. However, because PHB is a critical protein for the structural and the functional integrity of mitochondria, and hepatic mitochondrial dysregulation has been associated with HCC development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, it is possible that HCC development in the <italic>Phb</italic>−/− mice may in part be due to compromised mitochondrial function. Nevertheless, because PHB has a role as transcriptional co-regulator as well as in membrane signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, down regulation of liver PHB expression during HCC development in male Mito-Ob mice, as observed in our data, may also affect its extra-mitochondrial functions along with mitochondrial dysregulation. It is possible that such extra-mitochondrial changes may contribute to HCC development in male Mito-Ob mice.</p>
<p>In summary, our data suggest an extensive interplay between the metabolic and inflammatory status at the adipose tissue and systemic levels, as well as at the hepatic tissue level in the progression of obesity-linked NAFLD to NASH and HCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Thus, this study provides a proof-of-concept that obesity-associated metabolic and immune dysregulation indeed have a central role in the pathogenesis of NASH and HCC. In addition, the Mito-Ob mouse revealed a sex-dimorphic role of prohibitin in adipose and immune functions.</p>
