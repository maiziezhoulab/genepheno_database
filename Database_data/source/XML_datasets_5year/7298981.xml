<title>Abstract</title>
<sec id="cns13286-sec-0001">
<title>Background and Purpose</title>
<p>Cerebral organoids (COs) have been used for studying brain development, neural disorders, and species‐specific drug pharmacology and toxicology, but the potential of COs transplantation therapy for brain injury remains to be answered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="cns13286-sec-0002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>With preparation of traumatic brain injury (TBI) model of motor dysfunction, COs at 55 and 85 days (55 and 85 d‐CO) were transplanted into damaged motor cortex separately to identify better transplantation donor for brain injury. Further, the feasibility, effectiveness, and underlying mechanism of COs transplantation therapy for brain injury were explored.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="cns13286-sec-0003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>55 d‐CO was demonstrated as better transplantation donor than 85 d‐CO, evidenced by more neurogenesis and higher cell survival rate without aggravating apoptosis and inflammation after transplantation into damaged motor cortex. Cells from transplanted COs had the potential of multilinage differentiation to mimic in‐vivo brain cortical development, support region‐specific reconstruction of damaged motor cortex, form neurotransmitter‐related neurons, and migrate into different brain regions along corpus callosum. Moreover, COs transplantation upregulated hippocampal neural connection proteins and neurotrophic factors. Notably, COs transplantation improved neurological motor function and reduced brain damage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="cns13286-sec-0004">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study revealed 55 d‐CO as better transplantation donor and demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of COs transplantation in TBI, hoping to provide first‐hand preclinical evidence of COs transplantation for brain injury.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>With the evolution of stem cell technologies, increasing studies focus on the development of three‐dimensional (3D) organ‐like tissues, also known as organoids, from human‐induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or isolated organ progenitor cells in vitro.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0001">1</xref> The generated organoids can mimic cytoarchitecture, cell‐cell interactions and development of in‐vivo organs, including organoids of gut, kidney, intestine, retina, and others.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0001">1</xref> Thus, the successful generation of cerebral organoids (COs) is a breakthrough in the field of brain research.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0002">2</xref> Unlike conventional cell culture with pure populations of particular stem cell‐derived cell types,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0001">1</xref> the 3D COs generated from human PSCs contain diverse cell types, including neural progenitor cells (NPCs), neural stem cells (NSCs), mature and immature neurons, glial cells, etc They can form tissue morphology (up to 4 mm in diameter of single CO).<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0003">3</xref> The COs also show robust neural connectivity and functionality to mimic in‐vivo brain development and capture features of in‐vivo brain regions.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0006">6</xref>
</p>
<p>Cerebral organoids and brain‐region‐specific organoids have been used for studying brain development, neural disorders, and species‐specific drug pharmacology and toxicology. For example, COs have been used for modeling human microcephaly induced by zika virus infection,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0002">2</xref> autism spectrum disorders induced by CRISPR/Cas9‐mediated gene mutation,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0007">7</xref> neurodegenerative microenvironment by using Alzheimer's patient‐derived hiPSCs,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0008">8</xref> and developmental neurotoxicity with the exposure of rotenone,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0009">9</xref> alcohol,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0010">10</xref> vincristine,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0011">11</xref> and tranylcypromine.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0012">12</xref> There is no report of COs transplantation until the first study that establishes an in‐vivo model of vascularized human brain organoids.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0013">13</xref> Transplantation of COs into retrosplenial cortex of immunodeficient mice shows progressive neural differentiation and maturation, and forms functional neuronal networks with host brain, but with no benefit on spatial learning ability.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0013">13</xref> A further study demonstrates that transplanted COs have higher cell survival rate, better multilineage neurodifferentiation and robust vascularization than NSCs transplantation in the mice brain.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0014">14</xref> Therefore, COs are an alternative source of NSCs as a tissue‐based transplantation donor for neural repair.</p>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in children and young adults worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, TBI will continue to be a major health problem and leading cause for disability by the year 2020.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0015">15</xref> Although extensive researches have been done, there is still no effective therapy for TBI. In the recent decades, cell transplantation has been proved to be an effective therapy for TBI, providing a promising regenerative medical strategy.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0018">18</xref> However, conventional cell‐based transplantation faces the hurdles of poor cell survival and inadequate neural differentiation after transplantation. Transplantation of tissue has a higher cell survival rate as compared to transplantation of cell suspension grafts,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0019">19</xref> and COs transplantation has more advantages than NSCs transplantation.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0014">14</xref> We wonder whether transplanted COs could repair damaged brain tissue and improve dysfunction caused by brain injury. Meanwhile, as COs at different culture stage contain diverse mixture of NPCs/NSCs and neural cells, it is still unknown which culture stage of COs is the better donor for brain injury transplantation.</p>
<p>Our group previously performed several studies on brain injury and NSCs.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0023">23</xref> Here, with preparation of rat TBI model of motor dysfunction, we transplanted COs at different culture stage separately into damaged motor cortex to identify which is the better transplantation donor and explored the feasibility, effectiveness, and underlying mechanism of COs transplantation therapy for brain injury.</p>

<label>2.1</label>
<title>Animals</title>
<p>All Sprague‐Dawley rats (male, 250 ± 30 g) were purchased from Sino‐British SIPPR/BK Lab Animal Ltd. All rats received humane care and were kept in a 12‐hour light/dark cycle with free access to food and water throughout the study. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Second Military Medical University, China, and in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0024">24</xref>

<title>Human embryonic stem cell culture</title>
<p>H1 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were obtained from WiCell and cultured with minor modifications.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0025">25</xref> In the Matrigel‐coated plates (Corning, hESC‐Qualified), hESCs were cultured with mTesR™1 maintenance medium (STEMCELL, Canadian) and passaged every 4‐6 days by using TrypLE (Gibco). The use of hESCs obeys Ethical Guiding Principles for the Research of Human Embryonic Stem Cell.</p>

<title>Culture of cerebral organoids</title>
<p>Cerebral organoids were cultured from hESCs.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0003">3</xref> hESCs were dissociated into single cells by Accutase (Gibco, MA, USA). 1.35 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per 150 µL were plated into each well of ultra‐attachment 96‐well plate (Corning) to generate embryonic bodies (EBs) with low‐bFGF hESC medium. The low‐bFGF medium contained DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen), 20% KOSR (Invitrogen), 3% hES‐quality FBS (Gibco), 1% GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 1% MEM‐NEAA (Invitrogen), 55 μmol/L 2‐Mercaptoethanol (Merck), 4 ng/mL bFGF (Peprotech), and 50 μmol/L ROCK inhibitor Y‐27632 (Merck). After 4‐5 days, hES medium (low‐bFGF medium without bFGF and Y‐27632) was used to culture EBs. When the diameter of EBs was up to 500 μm, EBs were transferred into ultra‐attachment 24‐well plate with neural induction medium to form neuroepithelial tissue. The neural induction medium contained DMEM‐F12 with 1% N2 supplement, 1% GlutaMAX supplement, 1% MEM‐NEAA, and 1 μg/mL heparin. After 4‐5 days, neuroepithelial tissues were formed with radial organization of pseudostratified epithelium in the brighter outside of EBs‐derived tissues. Then, neuroepithelial tissues were transferred into Matrigel droplets one by one and further cultured in the 60‐mm dish with COs differentiation medium. The COs differentiation medium contained 50% DMEM/F12, 50% Neurobasal medium, 0.5% N2 supplement, 1% GlutaMAX supplement, 0.5% MEM‐NEAA, 2.8 ng/mL human insulin solution (Sigma‐Aldrich), 55 μmol/L 2‐Mercaptoethanol and 1% B27 supplement (without vitamin A). After 4‐5 days, expanded neuroepithelial tissues were transferred into spinning bioreactor in the Micro‐Stir Slow Speed Magnetic Stirrers (Wheaton) at the speed of 85 rpm for long‐term culture. The culture medium was changed with COs differentiation medium that contained 1% B27 supplement (with vitamin A).</p>

<title>Cryo‐sectioning and immunofluorescence staining of cerebral organoids</title>
<p>Cerebral organoids were washed with 0.1 M phosphate‐buffered saline (1× PBS) and fixed with 4% (wt/vol) PFA for 15 minutes. Then, 30% (wt/vol) sucrose solution was added to make tissue dehydration at 4°C overnight. Twelve hours later, COs were embedded in warm gelatin/sucrose solution and stored at −80°C. As for cryo‐sectioning, COs were further embedded in OCT compound (Tissue‐plus, Fisher Healthcare) and sectioned into frozen coronal slices (8 μm thickness) in the cryostat (CM3050S; Leica Microsystems). Further immunofluorescence staining of embedded COs was performed under standard procedures. Antibodies used in this study were listed in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="cns13286-sup-0001">S1</xref>.</p>

<title>Traumatic brain injury model</title>
<p>Traumatic brain injury model was prepared as previous report.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0026">26</xref> All rats were given Cyclosporin A (10 mg/kg, i.p.) on the day before surgery. A combination of ketamine (50 mg/kg), xylazine (2.6 mg/kg), and acepromazine (0.50 mg/kg) was used to anesthetize rats (i.p.). As for craniotomy, a longitudinal incision (approximately 4 cm) was made along brain midline. A skull window (1.5 cm length, 0.6 cm breadth) in the right skull was made without damaging brain parenchyma. Under the stereotaxic apparatus, mechanical injury was made by biopsy punch to form a cavity of 3 mm diameter and 2 mm depth in the right motor cortex of rat brain. The center of a cavity in the TBI model for biological research located at 1.5 mm lateral to the midline and 0.5 mm posterior to bregma. The centers of two connected cavities in the TBI model for studying motor functional recovery located at 1.5 mm lateral to the midline, 1 mm anterior to bregma, and 2 mm posterior to bregma respectively.</p>
<p>All rats were randomly grouped. The rats in the Sham group underwent craniotomy without brain injury. The rats in the TBI group were performed as aforementioned without COs transplantation. In the transplantation groups, COs at 55 and 85 days (namely 55 d‐CO and 85 d‐CO, respectively) were separately transplanted into the cavity of damaged motor cortex immediately after TBI surgery, namely 55 d‐CO transplantation and 85 d‐CO transplantation groups. The number of transplanted COs was as the same as the number of cavities that made in the motor cortex by biopsy punch. After surgery, skull window was sealed with piece of skull and bone wax. The incision was sutured and covered with erythromycin ointment to prevent infection. All operations were performed under aseptic conditions. Cyclosporine A was intraperitoneally injected every other day until rats were sacrificed. There was no animal death in the rat TBI model with or without transplantation.</p>

<title>Brain collection and immunofluorescence staining</title>
<p>Rat brains were harvested at the indicated day post implantation (dpi). Transcardial perfusion was performed with 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4), and brains were collected carefully without disrupting lesioned site and transplanted COs and stored at –80°C. With 4% paraformaldehyde fixation at 4°C for 24 hours and tissue dehydration with 15%‐30% sucrose/paraformaldehyde, brains were embedded in OCT compound (Tissue‐plus, Fisher Healthcare) and sectioned into frozen coronal slices (8 μm thickness) in the cryostat (CM3050S; Leica Microsystems).

Subsequently, neuroepithelium‐like structures in Matrigel droplets were transferred to spinning bioreactor for further growth of cerebral tissues. As expected, the expression of neurons (Tuj‐1) was gradually upregulated and the expression of NPCs (SOX2) was gradually downregulated during the culture of COs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0001">1</xref>B). COs at 75 DAI showed positive expression of forebrain (Foxg1) and choroid plexus (TTR), indicating the successful formation of cerebral cortical morphology and brain regional identities (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0001">1</xref>C).</p>

<p>Considering different culture stages of COs contain diverse neural cell types, we characterized and compared cell number and composition of COs at 55 and 85 DAI (namely 55 d‐CO and 85 d‐CO) that were used for transplantation in our study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0001">1</xref>D,E). The cell number in 85 d‐CO was twice in 55 d‐CO (2.09 ± 0.13 vs 1.01 ± 0.07 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per CO, n = 8) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0001">1</xref>D). 55 d‐CO showed higher expression of NPCs (SOX2) and NSCs (Nestin), but lower expression of neurons (NeuN, Tuj‐1), astrocytes (GFAP), preplate/deep‐layer neurons (TBR1), late‐born superficial neurons (SATB2), and glutamatergic neurons (vGlut1) than 85 d‐CO (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0001">1</xref>E). These results indicate 85 d‐CO is more mature than 55 d‐CO, in accordance with development process of in‐vitro cultivation of COs.

<p>To determine which culture stage of COs has better proproliferation and prodifferentiation effects, we compared neurogenesis between 55 d‐CO and 85 d‐CO transplantation groups. Compared to 85 d‐CO transplantation group, 55 d‐CO transplantation group had more BrdU<sup>+</sup>/Nestin<sup>+</sup> and BrdU<sup>+</sup>/DCX<sup>+</sup> cells at 7, 14 dpi and more BrdU<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells at 28, 56 dpi in transplantation periphery of ipsilateral cortex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0002">2</xref>B‐E). BrdU<sup>+</sup>/Nestin<sup>+</sup> and BrdU<sup>+</sup>/DCX<sup>+</sup> cells in ipsilateral SGZ and SVZ of 55 d‐CO transplantation group were also more than those in 85 d‐CO transplantation group (Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="cns13286-sup-0001">S1‐S2</xref>). Although COs transplantation enhanced neurogenesis in contralateral SGZ and SVZ, neurogenesis between 55 d‐CO and 85 d‐CO transplantation groups had no obvious difference (Data not shown). These effects indicate that both 55 d‐CO and 85 d‐CO transplantation donors enhance neurogenesis with proproliferation and prodifferentiation effects in the rat TBI model, and 55 d‐CO has better effect in promoting neurogenesis than 85 d‐CO after transplantation into damaged motor cortex.</p>
<p>We further compared cell survival between 55 d‐CO and 85 d‐CO transplantation groups by immunostaining STEM121, which can be used as human cytoplastic marker of transplanted COs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0003">3</xref>A). Although cell number was more in 85 d‐CO than 55 d‐CO and the morphological volume was larger in 85 d‐CO than 55 d‐CO before transplantation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0001">1</xref>D), 55 d‐CO transplantation had more cell survival number than 85 d‐CO transplantation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0003">3</xref>B).

<p>Meanwhile, we detected neural apoptosis and neuroinflammation in transplantation periphery of ipsilateral cortex among Sham, TBI, 55 d‐CO, and 85 d‐CO transplantation groups. With immunostaining of apoptotic cells (cleaved‐caspase‐3) and pro‐inflammatory cytokines [intercellular cell adhesion molecule‐1 (ICAM‐1), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF‐α), and interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β)], there was no difference in the number of apoptotic cells and pro‐inflammatory cytokines among TBI, 55 d‐CO, and 85 d‐CO transplantation groups (Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="cns13286-sup-0001">S3‐S4</xref>). There was also no difference in rat serum ICAM‐1 concentration among Sham, TBI, and 55 d‐CO transplantation groups (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="cns13286-sup-0001">S4</xref>C). Therefore, both 55 d‐CO and 85 d‐CO transplantation did not aggravate neural apoptosis and neuroinflammation after brain injury.</p>
<p>Taken together, 55 d‐CO is a better transplantation donor for brain injury, which has more neurogenesis and more cell survival number than 85 d‐CO after transplantation into damaged motor cortex. 55 d‐CO was used for the following in‐depth transplantation study.</p>

<p>As the brain injury site was made in motor cortex, we further explored whether transplanted COs differentiated into cortical‐specific neurons and even motor neural cell linages. Cortical differentiation of transplanted COs was confirmed by TBR1 (preplate/deep‐layer neurons marker) and SATB2 (late‐born surface‐layer neurons marker) immunostaining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0004">4</xref>C). TBR1 is involved in cortical lamination and affects the processes of cell migration and neural differentiation,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0036">36</xref> and SATB2 is necessary for establishment of cortical neuronal connections.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0037">37</xref> The positive expression of TBR1 and SATB2 suggests the formation of cortical layer neurons in transplanted COs. The presence of Olig2 in the early and later stages of COs differentiation reveals the cell fates of motor progenitors in the brain injury site of host brain. Immunostaining for motor progenitor cells (Olig2) proved positive expression of motor cell linage in transplanted COs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0004">4</xref>C). Due to extensive neuronal expression in transplanted COs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0004">4</xref>A), we wondered whether there were neurons involving the regulation of neurotransmitter release.

Immunostaining for human cytoplastic marker STEM121 demonstrated cells from transplanted COs distributed throughout the lesioned cavity at 7, 14, 28, and 56 dpi in ipsilateral cortex of host brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0005">5</xref>). Cells from transplanted COs migrated into extensive regions of host brain along corpus callosum at 56 dpi and showed positive expression in ipsilateral cortical region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0005">5</xref>B1‐B3,B1′‐B3′), ipsilateral and contralateral thalamus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0005">5</xref>B4, 5B4′), and hippocampus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0005">5</xref>B3, B5‐B7, 5B3′, 5B5′‐B7′). Immunostaining for hNuclei, a human nuclear marker (another human cell marker different from human cytoplastic marker STEM121), proved the same cell migration of transplanted COs in the host brain (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="cns13286-sup-0001">S6</xref>). Moreover, cells from transplanted COs existed in ipsilateral and contralateral SVZ of host brain (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="cns13286-sup-0001">S7</xref>). Therefore, cells from transplanted COs have ability to migrate into extensive regions of host brain, suggesting potential integration and connection between transplanted COs and host brain.</p>

<title>COs transplantation upregulates hippocampal neural connection proteins and neurotrophic factors in rat brain injury</title>
<p>We further explored possible mechanism by detecting hippocampal protein expression of neural connection proteins and neurotrophic factors, which are tightly associated with neurogenesis and neural function. COs transplantation significantly upregulated neural connection proteins and neurotrophic factors as compared to TBI group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0006">6</xref>A‐F). Compared to Sham and TBI groups, COs transplantation significantly upregulated postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD‐95, postsynaptic marker) and synaptophysin (SYN, presynaptic marker), suggesting enhanced neural connection by COs transplantation after brain injury (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0006">6</xref>A‐C). The expression of neurotrophic factors brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) at 14 dpi in transplantation group was higher than that in TBI group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0006">6</xref>A,D‐F). Compared to Sham group, COs transplantation upregulated BDNF and NGF from 28 and 56 dpi, respectively, and recovered EGF to normal level at 28 dpi (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0006">6</xref>A,D‐F), proving more neurotrophic factors in the hippocampal of COs transplantation group. The upregulated neural connection proteins and neurotrophic factors mediated by COs transplantation may contribute to the enhanced neurogenesis and exogenous neural repair after brain injury.</p>

<title>COs transplantation improves neurological motor function and reduces brain damage in rat brain injury</title>
<p>We next explored whether transplantation of 55 d‐CO into damaged motor cortex could improve motor functional recovery and rescue brain damage. mNSS method was introduced to evaluate rat neurological function after TBI. Improved mNSS score was found from 5 dpi in transplantation group as compared to TBI group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0006">6</xref>H). Notably, COs transplantation recovered neurological function to normal level from 21 dpi, wherein no difference was found between Sham and transplantation groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0006">6</xref>H). Beam walking test confirmed the improvement of motor function in COs transplantation group as compared to TBI group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0006">6</xref>I). At 42 dpi, we observed obvious brain atrophy in the damaged ipsilateral hemisphere of TBI group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0006">6</xref>G). Brain parenchyma in ipsilateral hemisphere of COs transplantation group showed relatively smooth and plump morphology with smaller cavity, proving the amelioration of brain damage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0006">6</xref>G). These results provide positive preclinical evidence for functional and morphological improvement of COs transplantation in brain injury therapy.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>The present study demonstrates the feasibility, effectiveness, and mechanism of COs transplantation for brain injury therapy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0006">6</xref>J). COs transplantation can enhance neurogenesis without aggravating cell apoptosis and neuroinflammation, and 55 d‐CO is demonstrated as a better transplantation donor than 85 d‐CO, evidenced by more neurogenesis and more cell survival after transplantation into damaged cortex of rat TBI model. Cells from transplanted COs have the potential of multilinage differentiation to mimic in‐vivo brain cortical development, support region‐specific reconstruction of damaged motor cortex, form neurotransmitter release‐related neurons, and meanwhile migrate into different brain regions. Moreover, COs transplantation upregulates neural connection proteins and neurotrophic factors in ipsilateral hippocampus and improves neurological motor function and reduces brain damage after TBI.</p>

<title>The selection of research model for COs transplantation</title>
<p>Transplanted NSCs can reduce brain damage, enhance neural repair, provide trophic support, and improve functional recovery after brain injury.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0031">31</xref> As COs transplantation has higher cell survival rate, better multilineage neurodifferentiation, and robust vascularization than NSCs transplantation in the mouse brain,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0014">14</xref> we wondered the effect of COs transplantation on the repair of brain injury. So far, only two studies report COs transplantation and demonstrate the survival, differentiation, and vascularization of transplanted COs in retrosplenial cortex or frontoparietal cortex of mouse brain.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0014">14</xref> Considering the high disability and mortality of TBI and high incidence of TBI‐induced motor dysfunction worldwide, here we made a direct mechanical cavity in the rat motor cortex to prepare TBI model of motor dysfunction and further explore the feasibility and potential mechanism of COs transplantation. In our study, the rat TBI model of motor dysfunction has advantages that: the cavity used for accommodating transplanted COs has abundant blood supply, contributing to the survival of transplanted COs; the model has no obvious change of neuroinflammation, providing a pure and simple model to mainly study the change of transplanted COs in the host brain; the simple model has performance of motor dysfunction, supporting the study of COs transplantation on neurological motor function recovery; the rats used for TBI model have no immunodeficiency to approach clinical practice.</p>

<title>The identification of better COs transplantation donor for brain injury</title>
<p>Transplantation donor is an important parameter for preclinical transplantation study.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0017">17</xref> Current cell transplantation studies mainly use single type of NSCs or neural cells to repair brain injury.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0017">17</xref> However, the damaged tissues after brain injury contain diverse cell types rather than single cell types. COs consist of abundant neural cell types, representing an alternative transplantation donor for brain injury. As COs at different developmental stages are diverse in neural cell types, regional identities, and cell number (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0001">1</xref>A‐E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cns13286-fig-0006">6</xref>J), choosing 55 d‐CO or 85 d‐CO for intracerebral transplantation is a question to be answered. With comparison of neurogenesis and cell survival number after transplantation into damaged cortex, 55 d‐CO is demonstrated as a better transplantation donor for brain injury. Notably, the effectiveness of cell transplantation is related to cell transplantation dose, and it might be invalid if the cell transplantation dose is lower than 10<sup>6</sup>.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0039">39</xref> Thus, we did not attempt to transplant COs with shorter culture time in this study, as we found the cell number of 55 d‐CO is about 1.01 × 10<sup>6</sup>. Besides, both 55 d‐CO and 85 d‐CO transplantation do not aggravate neural apoptosis and neuroinflammation in transplantation periphery of ipsilateral cortex after brain injury, demonstrating the compatibility between transplanted COs and host brain. The unchanged neuroinflammation by COs transplantation may be due to the use of immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A throughout the study. Cyclosporin A has been widely used in clinical transplantation and reported to inhibit neuroinflammation after brain injury.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0040">40</xref>

<title>The potential mechanism of COs transplantation for brain injury</title>
<p>In addition to above mentioned neurogenesis, cell apoptosis, and neuroinflammation mediated by COs transplantation, we further explored the potential mechanism of transplanted COs in brain injury. As expected, there is vascular connection between transplanted COs and host brain, which is important for promoting the survival of transplanted COs. According to recently reported article, the source of blood vessels was from the host brain.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0013">13</xref> The in‐vivo survival and differentiation of transplanted stem cells are important elements for functional repairment. As the transplantation site is in the motor cortex, we successively detected the trend of in‐vivo differentiation and identification of cortical layer neurons and motor neural cell lineage in transplanted COs. Transplanted COs mimic in‐vivo differentiation of brain cortical development and show positive expression of cortical layer neurons (preplate/deep‐layer and surface‐layer neurons), motor progenitor cells, and further form glutamatergic and cholinergic neurons that are related to neurotransmitter release. It is worth mentioning that the differentiation trend of transplanted COs within host brain may need to be further explored. For example, whether the differentiation proportion of neuron/gliocyte and cholinergic neuron/noncholinergic neuron is close to brain physiology needs to be further clarified. Besides, cells from transplanted COs show extensive migration into cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus along corpus callosum after brain injury. The neuronal activity and functional connectivity between transplanted COs and host brain have been proved by electrophysiological recording and optogenetics.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0013">13</xref> Thus, the vascularization, differentiation, and migration of transplanted COs in the host brain support motor cortex region‐specific reconstruction after brain injury.</p>
<p>Both central nervous system and peripheral circulatory system have a series of physiological reactions, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and so on, during chronic TBI.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0041">41</xref> All these processes exacerbate the survival environment of endogenous NSCs and transplanted cells, which limit neurogenesis of endogenous NSCs.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0042">42</xref> Several studies have demonstrated transplanted cells in the host brain can improve brain microenvironment, promote neurogenesis, and restore neural connectivity through paracrine role, which in turn contribute to suitable living environment for the survival of endogenous and exogenous NSCs.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0044">44</xref> In our study, we found COs transplantation upregulates expression of neural connection proteins and neurotrophic factors in ipsilateral hippocampus. The upregulation of neural connection proteins and neurotrophic factors in transplantation group may partly result from paracrine functions of transplanted COs. Thus, COs transplantation mediates dual function in promoting endogenous and exogenous neural repair. Remarkably, COs transplantation significantly recovers neurological function to normal level, improves motor function, and reduces brain damage after brain injury, providing direct evidence for functional and morphological improvement of brain injury.</p>
<p>In the future study, many questions remain to be answered to explore the specific action mechanisms, optimal dose and delivery routes, therapeutic time window, and safety concerns of transplanted COs for brain injury therapy. Transplantation of modified cells with overexpression of growth or trophic factors is one way to improve the survival of grafts.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0046">46</xref> By introducing genetic manipulation or providing a scaffold environment for transplanted cells,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0048">48</xref> enhancing responsiveness and sensitivity of transplanted cells to endogenous signaling is another way to increase effectiveness. It is noteworthy that the culture of COs is based on the self‐organization of hiPSCs, leading to the heterogeneity of each COs in cell composition, cell number, and so on.<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0003">3</xref> The heterogeneity of COs may increase uncontrollability for transplantation therapy. As the recently cultured brain‐region‐specific COs has lower heterogeneity,<xref ref-type="ref" rid="cns13286-bib-0004">4</xref> whether it is the better transplantation donor for brain‐region‐specific injury needs to be explored in the further study. In addition, the proliferation of NPCs/NSCs within transplanted COs needs to be controlled because of the possibility of tumorigenesis after transplantation, though we did not observe the phenomenon in our study.</p>
