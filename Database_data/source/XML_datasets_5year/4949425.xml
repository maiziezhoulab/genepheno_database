<p>The small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (<italic>SNRPN</italic>) gene, encoding the RNA-associated SmN protein, duplications or deletions of which are strongly associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities. <italic>SNRPN</italic>-coding protein is highly expressed in the brain. However, the role of SNRPN protein in neural development remains largely unknown. Here we showed that the expression of SNRPN increased markedly during postnatal brain development. Overexpression or knockdown of SNRPN in cortical neurons impaired neurite outgrowth, neuron migration, and the distribution of dendritic spines. We found that SNRPN regulated the expression level of Nr4a1, a critical nuclear receptor during neural development, in cultured primary cortical neurons. The abnormal spine development caused by SNRPN overexpression could be fully rescued by Nr4a1 co-expression. Importantly, we found that either knockdown of Nr4a1 or 3, 3′- Diindolylmethane (DIM), an Nr4a1 antagonist, were able to rescue the effects of SNRPN knockdown on neurite outgrowth of embryonic cortical neurons, providing the potential therapeutic methods for SNRPN deletion disorders. We thus concluded that maintaining the proper level of SNRPN is critical in cortical neurodevelopment. Finally, Nr4a1 may serve as a potential drug target for SNRPN-related neurodevelopmental disabilities, including Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).</p>

<body>
<p>The small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (<italic>SNRPN</italic>) gene, encoding the RNA-binding SmN protein, is located within chromosome 15q11-q13 in the region associated with various neurodevelopmental disabilities such as Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Angelman syndrome (AS) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. These neurodevelopmental disorders are often associated with various degrees of autistic behavior and learning disabilities. The <italic>SNRPN</italic> gene is imprinted with preferential expression from the paternal chromosome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> and usually transcribed as the downstream gene of the bicistronic SNURF-SNRPN mRNA. The SmN protein is a member of the small nuclear ribonucleic particle SMB/SMN family, which is involved in pre-mRNA splicing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The SMB/SMN family proteins were originally defined on the basis of autoantibodies present in sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Differential methylation patterns of the <italic>SNRPN</italic> gene have been reported to reflect multiple types of cancer, indicating that SNRPN may be critical in tumorigenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, SNRPN is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with the highest expression levels in the adult brain and heart<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Many distinct alternative splicing events take place in neuronal tissue, suggesting the critical role of SmN in regulating alternative splicing. Previous studies proposed that SmN was involved in catalyzing CGRP-specific splicing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. However, certain discrepancies showed that SmN was involved in other neuron specific splicing events and that neither required or sufficient for regulating alternative splicing of the calcitonin/CGRP transcript<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. According to the study by Huntriss and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, there are no significant changes in select brain-specific alternative splicing events in SNRPN knockout mice. Thus, the function of SNRPN in neural development remains to be further addressed.</p>
<p>A recent study by Lee and coworkers found that ectopic expression of SmN was associated with increased expression of 4 genes and decreased expression of 23 genes, as detected by massive parallel sequencing in the HeLa cell line with an inducible expression system for SmN, suggesting that the important role of SmN in regulating gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1 (Nr4a1) (also known as NGFI-B/NUR77), an activity-dependent gene encoding a nuclear receptor, was included in the 23 SmN-mediated downregulated genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Nr4a1 belongs to a family of orphan nuclear receptors (Nr4a1, Nr4a2 and Nr4a3) that play an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. These factors have been suggested to be potential drug targets for treating multiple diseases, including cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p>
<p>Nr4a1 was recently found to have crucial effects on neural development and plasticity, in addition to affecting metabolic, and immune functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In the central nervous system, Nr4a1 expression is induced by learning tasks, such as contextual fear conditioning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, and has been linked to synaptic remodeling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Chen and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> reported that Nr4a1 overexpression resulted in elimination of the majority of spines via transcriptional regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, Nr4a1 knockdown increased the density of spines specifically at the distal ends of dendrites, suggesting that endogenous Nr4a1 prevents abnormal spine clustering. Spine density is usually correlated with the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission, which is crucial for brain development and cognitive functions, such as learning and memory.</p>
<p>Copy number variation on human chromosome 15q11–q13 is one of the most frequent chromosomal aberrations in ASDs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. A paternally inherited duplication of 15q11–q13 with an extra copy of <italic>SNRPN</italic> gene is associated with development/speech delays, mental retardation, and ASDs features<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. A mouse model with paternal duplication of this region also showed abnormal phenotypes compared with wild-type mice, such as impaired social interaction, abnormal development of ultrasonic vocalization, and resistance to change behavior and anxiety<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The neural mechanisms underlying behavioral abnormalities remain largely unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the function of SNRPN in cortical neurodevelopment. The results demonstrate that abnormal expression of SNRPN impairs neurological function through regulating Nr4a1 and thus Nr4a1 represents a potential therapeutic target for SNRPN-associated diseases.</p>

<title>Expression of SNRPN in the developing brain</title>
<p>To examine the expression of SNPRN in the developing brain, we carried out western blotting experiments with brain samples at different developmental stages (embryonic day 15 (E15), postnatal day 0 (P0), P7, and P14). A 28 kDa band and 29 kDa band were detected. According to previous work, the 28 kDa band represented SmB, which is also highly expressed in lung. SmB exhibits 92.5% homology at the amino acid level to SmN and therefore is detectable with the SmN antibody<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. SmB is a ubiquitous splicing protein, which is almost entirely replaced by SmN in neurons. The 29 kDa band represented SmN. SmN expressed at a low level in the embryonic cerebral cortex and increased approximately 5-fold during brain development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,d</xref>). In the hippocampus, the expression profile of SNRPN was similar to that seen in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). However, there was a gradual decrease in expression of SmN in the cerebellum from the embryonic stage to the neonatal stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,d</xref>).</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Impact of SNRPN on the development of neurites and radial migration</title>
<p>We next investigated the role of SNRPN in the development of cortical neurons. First, we found that transfection of cultured cortical neurons with a plasmid encoding HA-tagged SNRPN for 72 h resulted in a reduction in the total length of neurites and axons compared with cultures transfected with control (pCAG-IRES-GFP) vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). The effect of SNRPN to neuritic growth persisted at day <italic>in vitro</italic> 7 (DIV7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c,d</xref>). The identity of the longest neurite as an axon was determined by staining with the axonal marker SMI-312. However, overexpression of SNRPN had no effect on neuronal polarity as we found that most neurons with SNRPN overexpression contained one single axon (Data not shown).</p>
<p>Second, we applied <italic>IUE</italic> to deliver SNRPN with EYFP into cortical progenitor cells at E14.5 and examined the role of SNRPN in cortical migration. We compared the percentage of cell number in the ventricular zone to intermediate zone (VZ-IZ), lower cortical plate (LoCP), and upper cortical plate (UpCP) between neurons carrying an empty vector and overexpressing SNRPN at P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e,f</xref>). We found that the VZ-IZ and LoCP contained more neurons electroporated with the SNRPN sequence in SNRPN expressing neurons, comparing to control neurons. Percentage of cell number in UpCP of SNRPN expressing neurons was significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e,f</xref>). These data suggest that overexpression of SNRPN delays radial migration of cerebral cortex neurons.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>SNRPN modulates the expression level of Nr4a1</title>
<p>A recent study found that ectopic expression of SmN decreased Nr4a1 expression in Hela cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. To determine whether SNRPN modulates the expression of Nr4a1 in neurons, cultured cortical neurons transfected with vector and HA-tagged SNRPN plasmid at DIV3 were processed for qPCR and western blot. Molecular mass of HA-tagged SmN is 29 kD (SmN) plus around 1 kD (HA). We found a higher band about 30 kDa (slightly bigger molecular weight comparing to untagged SmN) was detected in HA-SNRPN expressing neurons, representing exogenous HA-tagged SmN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Whereas, protein levels of endogenous SmN and SmB were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). We found that the mRNA and protein levels of Nr4a1 were significantly down-regulated upon SNRPN expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a–c</xref>). In addition, we designed a shRNA against mouse SNRPN, and it was shown to be effective in suppressing SNRPN expression in cultured primary cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>). We measured the protein level of Nr4a1 and found that it was significantly increased in neurons with SNRPN knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>). Of note, SNRPN knockdown had no effects on the protein level of SmB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>SNRPN regulates the density and distribution of dendritic spines via Nr4a1</title>
<p>Because Nr4a1 is a key component of the regulation of the density and distribution of dendritic spines, we next examined whether SNRPN may regulate spine development. We first used <italic>IUE</italic> with plasmids coding for HA-tagged SNRPN and empty vector as control, together with EYFP in cortical progenitor cells in the ventricular zone (VZ) of mouse cortex at E14.5. The longest dendrites were designated as apical dendrites. We counted spine number of the total length of apical dendrite completely showed from soma to distal tips, and the distal ends of apical dendrite (0–60 μm from dendrite tip, binned in 20 μm segments from the tip), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). At P21, spine density was mildly increased in total apical dendrites of cortical neurons overexpressing SNRPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b,d</xref>). Remarkably, the density of spines increased significantly at the distal ends of apical dendrites in neurons transfected with SNRPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,e</xref>).</p>
<p>We then tested whether the increased number of distal dendritic spines was mediated by Nr4a1. We transfected SNRPN with Nr4a1 into neurons by <italic>IUE</italic> and measured dendritic spine density in apical dendrites. We found that in neurons co-transfected with SNRPN and Nr4a1 plasmids (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>), spine density was similar to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b,d</xref>). Notably, the abnormal increase in spine density at the distal ends of dendrites was fully rescued by co-expression of an Nr4a1 cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,e</xref>). Our findings are in line with a previous report stating that Nr4a1 knockdown results in clustered spines at the distal ends of dendrites and further indicates that SNRPN regulates spine development through controlling Nr4a1 expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p>
<p>We also measured the spine length of the distal ends of apical dendrite, which were not statistically different upon SNRPN expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>). The expression of SNRPN also did not impact the diameter of distal apical dendrites notably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>). There evidences showed that SNRPN specifically regulated the distal spine development, rather than general aspects of spine morphology.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Abnormalities caused by <italic>loss-of-function</italic> of SNRPN was rescued by Nr4a1 knockdown or antagonist</title>
<p>Consistently, we found that neurites and axons significantly increased upon SNRPN knockdown by RNAi in embryonic cortical neurons cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a–c</xref>). Finally, we asked whether inhibition of Nr4a1 may be able to rescue the effect of SNRPN knockdown. Interestingly, we found that co-transfected with Nr4a1 RNAi completely rescued the increased length of neurites and axons of embryonic cortical neurons transfected with SNRPN RNAi and did not impact neurotic length in the control group, confirming that SNRPN regulates neuritic growth via Nr4a1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a–c</xref>).</p>
<p>Because 3, 3′-Diindolylmethane (DIM) is a well-established Nr4a1 antagonist and one of the major bioactive components of crucifers, we further examined whether DIM may have effects on defects caused by SNRPN knockdown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. DIM analogs bind Nr4a1 at the ligand binding pocket and function as Nr4a1 antagonists in cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Strikingly, we found that DIM treatment was able to fully rescue the outgrowth caused by SNRPN knockdown, similar with Nr4a1 RNAi, thus further providing a pharmacological way to rescue defects of SNRPN <italic>loss-of-function</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d–f</xref>). This evidence indicates that Nr4a1 is responsible for defects caused by SNRPN knockdown and that pharmacological inhibition of Nr4a1 is a potential therapeutic target for SNRPN-related brain disorders.</p>

<sec disp-level="1">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The expression of SNRPN in the embryonic cerebral cortex and hippocampus gradually increases during brain development, consistent with previous work by Grimaldi K. <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> that revealed that during rodent brain development, the levels of SmN rise such that SmN replaces SmB as the predominant protein in the adult brain. SmN exhibits 92.5% homology to SmB at the amino acid level but is encoded by a distinct gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. At present, it is unclear why such homologous small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) proteins exist and why SmN replaces SmB in neurons. However, the balance between SmN and SmB must be involved in brain development. Abnormal expression of SmN in the embryonic stage results in abnormal development of neuron morphology and function.</p>
<p>In our study, we found that SNRPN overexpression shortened the length of neurites and delayed radial migration in the cerebral cortex. SNRPN knockdown increased the length of neurites. The change in neuronal morphology was subtle. These results perhaps explain why the paternal inherited 15q11-13 duplication can give rise to developmental delays and autistic behavior, whereas maternal duplications exhibit reduced penetrance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The neuropsychological symptoms of PWS (paternal inherited 15q11-13 deletion) are less severe than those of AS (maternal inherited 15q11-13 deletion).</p>
<p>To further examine the potential mechanisms of SNRPN, we focused on SNRPN modulation of Nr4a1 expression. Our idea resulted from the massive parallel sequence data from a HeLa cell line with an inducible expression system for SNRPN<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In the 27 genes affected by ectopic expression of SNRPN, Nr4a1 is known as a synaptic regulator, and Nr4a1 mRNA levels decreased in the pilot test of neurons transfected with SNRPN cDNA. There were no significant changes in SLC2A3 or SYDE1 (data not show), which were also critical for neuron development. Western blotting was used to determine that SNRPN downregulated expression of Nr4a1.</p>
<p>The function of Nr4a1 was regarded as homeostatic to prevent distal accumulation of spines on dendrites, thereby maintaining a normal distribution pattern of spines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. SNRPN overexpression resulted in a significant increase in spine density at the distal ends of dendrites. The phenotype of cortical neurons with SNRPN overexpression by <italic>IUE</italic> was similar to that seen in Nr4a1 knockdown <italic>in vivo</italic> and was rescued by expression of Nr4a1. Spines in cortical pyramidal neurons ordinarily exhibit a nonuniform distribution pattern along primary and secondary dendrites. Spine density is lowest near the soma and increases gradually to a maximum level at 40–100 mm from the soma but then decreases slightly at the most distal ends of secondary dendrites in both human and rodent brains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Morphological characteristics of dendritic spines contribute to cognitive ability. The density of the spine is thought to indicate the number of excitatory synaptic inputs received by that dendrite<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. However, the functions of spine density and distribution during development are not fully understood. Animals exhibit increased spine density after being housed in enriched environments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and trained in a radial arm maze, which is proposed to improve cognition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. However, an abnormal increase in the number of spines and the distal accumulation of spines on dendrites were assumed to contribute to defects in the potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission, which is associated with intellectual disabilities and ASDs.</p>
<p>In addition, <italic>loss-of-function</italic> of SNRPN leading to increased neurite length was rescued by Nr4a1 knockdown. These results confirm that SNRPN regulates neuronal morphology via Nr4a1. Furthermore, DIM has the same effects like Nr4a1 RNAi on neurite length. DIM is a Nr4a1 antagonist with a favorable safety profile and can be used for SNRPN deletion diseases, such as PWS. Nr4a1 may also be a potential drug target in diseases characterized by SNRPN.</p>
<p>In summary, our results reveal a novel function of SNRPN and the underlying mechanisms of SNRPN in brain development. The abnormal expression of SNRPN at embryonic stages impairs neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration. Overexpression of SNRPN disrupted the normal density and distribution of spines in apical dendrites via negative modulation of Nr4a1. We speculate that maintaining the proper level of SNRPN at different developmental stages is important in cortical neurodevelopment and that a disruption in SNRPN is linked to developmental brain disorders. Nr4a1 is a potential drug target for diseases in which SNRPN expression is abnormal, such as PWS and ASDs.</p>

<title>Constructs, antibodies and mice</title>
<p>Rat SNRPN (not including SNURP) was generated by PCR amplification and subcloned into the pCAG-IRES-EGFP vector with an HA tag. The Flag-Nr4a1 plasmid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> was provided by Dr. Yelin Chen (Interdisciplinary Research Center on Biology and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences), which was subcloned into the pCAG-IRES-EGFP vector, as well. The siRNA sequence was cloned into a pSuper vector. The sequences of SNRPN siRNAs are 5′-CAGTCGCGTTTGCGACTGG-3′ (scrambled) and 5′-GGATCGCTTACACTTGAGA-3′ (SNRPN RNAi). The sequences of Nr4a1 siRNA are refer to previously reported study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, 5′-CCAAGTACATCTGCCTGGCAAACAA-3′ (Nr4a1 RNAi). The efficiency of the above plasmids was verified by western blot in a primary culture of cortical neurons.</p>
<p>The antibodies for western blotting or immunostaining were SNRPN (rabbit, 1:500; Millipore, Billerica, MA), Nr4a1 (rabbit, 1:500; Novus, San Francisco, CA), SMI-312 (mouse, 1:1000; Covance, Princeton, NJ), green fluorescent protein (GFP) (rabbit, 1:1000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), HA (mouse, 1:1000; Covance, Princeton, NJ), and α-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; mouse, 1:10000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK).</p>
<p>C57 Mice used in the present study were provided by SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines and under the approval of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Shanghai Institute for Biological Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>

<title>In utero electroporation (IUE)</title>
<p><italic>IUE</italic> was performed according to previously reported methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. E14.5 pregnant mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 0.7% sodium pentobarbital (10 mL/kg). A mixture of plasmids for SNRPN cDNA (3 μg/μL) and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP, 1 μg/μL) was injected by trans-uterus pressure microinjection into the lateral ventricle of embryos using Fast Green (2 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as an indicator. For rescue experiments, Nr4a1 cDNA was mixed and injected with the SNRPN cDNA plasmid at a molar ratio of 1:3. Electric pulses were generated by an electroporator T830 (BTX Molecular Delivery Systems, Holliston, MA) and applied to the cerebral wall at five repeats of 30 V for 50 ms, with an interval of 1 s. In each pregnant mouse, embryos in the uterus were randomly selected to be injected with either control or test plasmids, followed by the application of electrical pulses of either the left or right direction, respectively. After internalization of the uterus, the abdominal wall was sutured in two layers. Mice were returned to their cages, given food and water ad libitum, and monitored for signs of pain or distress. After delivery, pups of the same litter were kept with their mother and euthanized at P1 and P21.</p>

<title>Cell culture and transfection</title>
<p>Cortical tissues of E15 mice were dissected and digested by papain. Dissociated neurons were transfected with 3 μg/well of different plasmids using the Amaxa Nucleofector kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) and plated into 6-well plates coated with 100 μg/mL poly-D-lysine. Cells were fed with Neurobasal medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% B27. In some experiments, cells were cultured for 24 h, followed by exposure to DIM (40 μM, solved in DMSO, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 48 h. For western blot, qPCR and immunostaining, cells were collected at DIV3 (72 h) and DIV7.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Tissue preparation, immunostaining and imaging</title>
<p>Mice were transcardially perfused with 0.1 M cold PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixation. The brains were post-fixed for 12 h in 4% PFA and dehydrated in 15% and 30% sugar solution for 48 h at 4 °C. Coronal sections of 20 μm (for pasted sections) or 40 μm (for free-floating sections) were cut on a freezing microtome (LEICA CM1950) in six parallel sets and immediately processed for immunostaining. For cultured cells, the fixation process was 30 minutes with 4% PFA at room temperature (RT). Brain sections or cultured cells were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h at RT, followed by incubation overnight at 4 degree centigrade with primary antibodies. Antibody specificity was verified by omitting the primary antibody. Fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies were added at RT for 1.5 h. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma).</p>
<p>Images were acquired on a Nikon Neurolucida system for comparison of neuron distribution. The numbers of GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons were counted to calculate the percentage of neurons in VZ-IZ, LoCP, and UpCP using Fuji software. For neurite length analysis, images were acquired on an Olympus FV1000 confocal system. GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons were selected randomly from each condition in primary cultured cortical neurons, and the total length of all protrusions was analyzed using Fuji software. For spine density analysis, confocal z stacks of neurons in slices were acquired with the Nikon TiE-A1 plus Laser Scanning Confocal microscope, using an oil-immersion 60 × 3 objective lens. Images were analyzed with Fiji software. Protrusions in direct contact with dendrites were counted as spines, and the average spine density was calculated as the number of spines per 10 μm of dendritic length.</p>

<title>RNA extraction, reverse transcription and quantitative PCR (qPCR)</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was carried out using the PrimeScript RT Master Mix (Takara). qPCRs were performed on a Rotor-Gene Q machine (QIAGEN) with SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO). The primers were designed according to previously reported methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and obtained as amplimer sets from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). The sequences of the primers were as follows: GAPDH forward: 5′-TGACCACAGTCCATGCCATC-3′, GAPDH reverse: 5′-GACGGACACATTGGGGGTAG-3′; Nr4a1 forward: 5′-CGTTATCCGAAAGTGGGCAG-3′, Nr4a1 reverse: 5′-CGGGTTTAGATCGGTATGCCAGC-3′; and SNRPN forward: 5′-GCAAAACAGCCAGAACGTGAA-3′, SNRPN reverse: 5′-GCACACGAGCAATGCCAGTAT-3′. Data analysis was conducted by using the comparative Ct method in software by QIAGEN, and the results were normalized to GAPDH.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Cortical neurons transfected with different plasmids <italic>in vitro</italic> and brain and lung tissues <italic>in vivo</italic> were prepared for western blotting. Cells or tissues were lysed in lysis buffer (RIPA, Beyotime biotechnology, Shanghai, China) with 1% Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set I (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,800 g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and denatured. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1–2 h at room temperature, followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. The membrane was rinsed and then incubated for 1.5 h with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Chemiluminescent detection was performed with the ECL kit from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Densitometric analysis was conducted using ImageJ software.</p>
