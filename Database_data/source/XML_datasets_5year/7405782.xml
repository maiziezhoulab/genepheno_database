<title>Purpose</title>
<p>To identify the pathogenic gene of infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) in three Chinese families and explore the potential pathogenic mechanism of FERM domain-containing 7 (<italic>FRMD7</italic>) mutations.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Genetic testing was performed via Sanger sequencing. Western blotting was used to analyze protein expression of FRMD7. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down and immunoprecipitation were conducted to investigate the proteins interacting with FRMD7. Rescue assays were performed in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to explore the potential role of FRMD7 in vivo.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>We recruited three Chinese families with X-linked INS and identified a duplication and two missense mutations in <italic>FRMD7</italic>: c.998dupA/p.His333Glnfs*2, c.580G&gt;A/p.Ala194Thr, and c.973A&gt;G/p.Arg325Gly (one in each family). Expression levels of three mutants were similar to that of wild-type FRMD7 in vitro. Interestingly, the mutant p.His333Glnfs*2 exhibited a predominantly nuclear location, whereas wild-type FRMD7 localized to the cytoplasm. In addition, we found FRMD7 to directly interact with the loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 of GABRA2, a type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) subunit critical for receptor transport and localization, whereas the mutants p.Ala194Thr and p.Arg325Gly exhibited decreased binding to GABRA2. In <italic>frm-3</italic> (a nematode homologue of <italic>FRMD7</italic>) null <italic>C</italic><italic>.</italic>
<italic>elegans</italic>, we found that FRMD7 mutants exhibited a poor rescue effect on the defects of locomotion and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our findings identified three <italic>FRMD7</italic> mutants in three Chinese families with X-linked INS and confirmed GABRA2 as a novel binding partner of FRMD7. These findings suggest that FRMD7 plays an important role by targeting GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.</p>

<body>
<p>Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is an eye movement disorder characterized by involuntary, periodic, and predominantly horizontal oscillations of both eyes. Although visual function can be significantly reduced in INS patients, the degree of impairment varies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1"><sup>1</sup></xref> To date, three inheritance patterns of INS, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked forms, have been reported, with X-linked INS being the most common. FERM domain-containing 7 (<italic>FRMD7</italic>) is identified as the pathogenic gene in approximately 50% of X-linked INS pedigrees and 5% of sporadic patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>–</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7"><sup>7</sup></xref> However, the role of FRMD7 in the pathogenesis of INS remains unclear.</p>
<p>Recently, FRMD7 was found to interact with calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase and promote the outgrowth of mouse neuroblastoma 2A (N2A) cell neurites in vitro,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8"><sup>8</sup></xref> and foveal and optic nerve head hypoplasia were observed in <italic>FRMD7</italic> mutant individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9"><sup>9</sup></xref> Those evidences suggest that FRMD7 may participate in neural and retinal development. In addition, loss of horizontal optokinetic reflex (OKR) was observed in <italic>Frmd7</italic> mutant (<italic>Frmd7<sup>tm</sup></italic>) mice, but no nystagmus was observed, which may be because of the absence of microsaccades in mice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"><sup>10</sup></xref> Consistently, loss of OKR associated with <italic>FRMD7</italic> mutations has been characterized in patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"><sup>11</sup></xref> OKR and vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VOR) are the two gaze stabilization systems in vertebrates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13"><sup>13</sup></xref> OKR responds to slow-motion stimuli on the retina, whereas VOR responds to head movement stimuli.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15"><sup>15</sup></xref> The two systems are coordinated to control eye movement and stabilize the image on the retina during surrounding-motion or self-motion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"><sup>16</sup></xref> Disruption of each system might impair coordination and disturb eye movement, such as nystagmus and bilateral vestibular failure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18"><sup>18</sup></xref> Furthermore, <italic>Frmd7</italic> is specifically expressed in starburst amacrine cells (SACs), and the directional selective (DS) inhibitory input from SACs to DS ganglion cells (DSGCs) is lost in <italic>Frmd7<sup>tm</sup></italic> mice,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"><sup>10</sup></xref> suggesting an important role for FRMD7 in DS signaling and the generation of OKR.</p>
<p>Inhibitory signals from SACs to DSGCs and from SACs to SACs are dependent on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission and critical for the generation of the DS response in DSGCs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19"><sup>19</sup></xref> Accordingly, the DS response of DSGCs is absent in <italic>Frmd7<sup>tm</sup></italic> mice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20"><sup>20</sup></xref> Interestingly, a similar phenotype was found in <italic>Gabra2</italic> knockout mice,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21"><sup>21</sup></xref> which led us to investigate whether FRMD7 associates with GABRA2 to contribute to DS signaling. GABRA2 has a common structure similar to other type A GABA receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) subunits, which contain four transmembrane domains (TMs) and a large intracellular loop between TM3 and TM4. The TM3-TM4 loop of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R α subunit interacts with other proteins to localize GABA<sub>A</sub>R to postsynaptic membranes or the actin cytoskeleton.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22"><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>–</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26"><sup>26</sup></xref></p>
<p>Coincidentally, a similar observation was found for the FERM domain-containing protein FRM-3 (nematode homologue of FRMD7) in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, which interacts with UNC-49B (a nematode GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs subunit) and stabilizes GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs on the postsynaptic membrane.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27"><sup>27</sup></xref> GABA acts primarily at the neuromuscular synapses of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to relax body muscles during locomotion and foraging.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28"><sup>28</sup></xref></p>
<p>In this study, we identified three <italic>FRMD7</italic> mutations (c.998dupA/p.His333Glnfs*2, c.580G&gt;A/p.Ala194Thr, and c.973A&gt;G/p.Arg325Gly) in three Chinese families with X-linked INS, among which c.998dupA and c.580G&gt;A are novel. Furthermore, we identified GABRA2 as a novel FRMD7-interacting protein. The FRMD7 mutants exhibited decreased binding affinity or incorrect location in vitro and impaired abilities to rescue the defects of <italic>frm-3</italic> null <italic>C. elegans</italic> in vivo<italic>.</italic> Our results proposed a novel mechanism of FRMD7 in the pathogenesis of INS.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1">
<title>Study Subjects and Isolation of Genomic DNA</title>
<p>The participants of family 1 were identified and enrolled at the Affiliated Hospital of Yanbian University. Family 2 cases were collected in Nanyang City of Henan Province. Family 3 cases were collected in Jingmen City of Hubei Province. The members of three families participating in this study received ophthalmology examinations by professional ophthalmologists. Informed consent was obtained from all participants in the three families in accordance with the study protocols approved by the ethics committee of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The research complied with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>
<p>Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples using Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-2">
<title>Mutation Analysis</title>
<p>Mutation analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing. Once the mutations were confirmed, cosegregation analysis was performed for the entire family, and mutation screening for healthy control subjects was subsequently carried out.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-3">
<title>Cell Culture and Treatment</title>
<p>Kidney fibroblast cell line (COS7) cells and N2A cells were routinely cultured in antibiotic-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco). Plasmids were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).</p>

<sec id="sec2-4">
<title>Plasmid Construction</title>
<p>The full-length <italic>FRMD7</italic> and <italic>GABRA2</italic> cDNA sequences were amplified from a cDNA template of SH-SY5Y cells. The full-length <italic>FRMD7</italic> and <italic>GABRA2</italic> cDNAs and the sequence of the TM3-TM4 loop of <italic>GABRA2</italic> were cloned into the pEGFP-N1, pcDNA3.1, and pGEX-6P expression vectors, respectively. The mutant <italic>FRMD7</italic> sequences were constructed based on the wild-type <italic>FRMD7</italic> sequence and cloned into pEGFP-N1. The PCR primers used for FRMD7 mutant amplification are as follows:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>c.580G&gt;A forward primer: TCAGGCCTCACCCCACCAGTGATGGTGAA</p></list-item><list-item><p>c.580G&gt;A reverse primer: TTCACCATCACTGGTGGGGTGAGGCCTGA</p></list-item><list-item><p>c.973A&gt;G forward primer: CTTGCCATTTGAAGGGAAACATTACCC</p></list-item><list-item><p>c.973A&gt;G reverse primer: GGGTAATGTTTCCCTTCAAATGGCAAG</p></list-item><list-item><p>c.998dupA forward primer: ATCTCAGTACCATAGAACGACAGTGCAG</p></list-item><list-item><p>c.998dupA reverse primer: CTGCACTGTCGTTCTATGGTACTGAGAT</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>The expression vectors injected into <italic>C. elegans</italic> were based on the pPD49.26 and pPD95.67 backbone. A 3 kb <italic>frm-3</italic> promoter was used to drive green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged FRMD7 <italic>or</italic> FRM<italic>-</italic>3 protein expression in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons and body muscles, which was constructed into the pPD95.67 vector. Additionally, 1.5 kb of the <italic>unc-49</italic> promoter was used for expressing UNC-49B-A2loop-fused red fluorescent protein (RFP) in <italic>C. elegans</italic> body muscles, which was constructed into the pPD49.26 vector.</p>

<sec id="sec2-5">
<title>Western Blot, Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-Down Assays, and Immunoprecipitation (IP) Assays</title>
<p>COS7 cells were transfected with expression plasmids and lysed with cell lysis buffer (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Nanjing, China) after 24 hours in culture at 37°C.</p>
<p>The GST pull-down assay was performed as previously described.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29"><sup>29</sup></xref> In brief, expression plasmids were transformed into <italic>Escherichia</italic>
<italic>coli</italic> Rosetta cells, and expression of GST-fused protein was induced with isopropyl thiogalactoside at 37°C for 8 hours. The cells were harvested, ultrasound-lysed, and centrifuged at 16000 g to obtain the supernatant. The supernatant containing GST-fused proteins was incubated with glutathione agarose beads at 4°C for 4 hours and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The FRMD7 containing lysate was added to the supernatant to be pulled down by the GST-loop.</p>
<p>The IP assay was performed as follows. Protein extracts were obtained from the transfected COS7 cells or C57BL/6 wild-type mouse retinal tissue, and incubated with a primary antibody or IgG at 4°C for 12 hours followed by mixing with protein A agarose beads, and Fast Flow (16-156; Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) for 4 hours. The immunoprecipitated proteins were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000<italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes and denaturation by boiling for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Primary antibodies used are as follows: FRMD7 (1:500, rabbit polyclonal antibody; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), GABRA2 (1:500, mouse monoclonal antibody; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), GFP (1:3000, mouse monoclonal antibody; ABclonal, Cambridge, MA, USA), and GST (1:5000, mouse monoclonal antibody; ABclonal).</p>

<p>To assess the rate of locomotion, young adult worms were transferred to fresh nematode growth medium (NGM) plates with OP50 and adapted for 5 minutes before filming. The locomotion of worms on NGM plates was screened under a Zeiss Discovery V8 stereomicroscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Gmbh, Göttingen, Germany), and a 1-minute video recording was captured by the Andor iXon<sup>EM</sup> + DV885K EMCCD camera (Andor, Belfast, UK). The films were converted to an AVI format and analyzed by Multi-Worm Tracker 1.3.0 software (Kerr Lab, Ashburn, Virginia, USA) to calculate the locomotion rate. In the thrashing assay, young adult worms were transferred to a 200 µL centrifuge tube with agar on the bottom and filled with 100 µL M9 buffer. The worms were adapted for 2 minutes before counting thrashing frequency. Thrashing was defined and counted as reported previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32"><sup>32</sup></xref></p>

<p>As <italic>FRMD7</italic> mutations are the primary cause of INS, Sanger sequencing was performed directly to screen all exons and exon-intron boundaries of <italic>FRMD7</italic> in the three families.

<p>The p.His333Glnfs*2 mutation may lead to a truncated protein with an incomplete FERM-adjacent (FA) domain and deletion of the full C-terminal domain. The p.Ala194Thr and p.Arg325Gly mutations are located in the highly conserved FERM and FA domains. Sequence blast revealed the Ala194 and Arg325 residues of FRMD7 are highly conserved from humans (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) to nematodes (<italic>C. elegans</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>G). The p.Ala194Thr and p.Arg325Gly mutations are predicted to be deleterious by Polyphen-2 (p.Ala194Thr, score = 0.998; p.Arg325Gly, score = 0.575) and SIFT (p.Ala194Thr, score = 0; p.Arg325Gly, score = 0).</p>

<title>Expression and Localization Analysis of FRMD7 Mutants</title>
<p>To explore whether the three mutations alter the expression of FRMD7, we transfected FRMD7 expressing plasmids into cultured cells. In COS7 cells, we found that the expression levels of the three mutants were similar to the wild-type FRMD7 protein by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>B). The p.His333Glnfs*2 mutant was substantially present in the nuclear extracts and weakly detected in cytoplasmic extracts, whereas the wild-type FRMD7 and two missense mutants (p.Ala194Thr and p.Arg325Gly) were detected only in the cytoplasmic extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>B). Moreover, we expressed GFP-tagged FRMD7 proteins in N2A cells and found that the p.His333Glnfs*2 mutant was predominantly located in the nucleus, whereas the wild-type FRMD7, as well as the mutants p.Ala194Thr and p.Arg325Gly, were primarily located in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>C). These results showed that the p.His333Glnfs*2 mutant was restricted in the nucleus, which may be because the truncated protein cannot be transported to the cytoplasm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8"><sup>8</sup></xref> Therefore the p.His333Glnfs*2 mutant could lead to loss of FRMD7 function in the cytoplasm.

<title>Identification of a Novel Interaction Between FRMD7 and GABRA2</title>
<p>Recently, inhibitory GABAergic signals from SACs to DSGCs were found to be lost in <italic>Frmd7<sup>tm</sup></italic> mice,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"><sup>10</sup></xref> whereas <italic>Gabra2</italic> knockout mice exhibited a similar phenotype (i.e., loss of DS response) as <italic>Frmd7<sup>tm</sup></italic> mice,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21"><sup>21</sup></xref> which raises the possibility that FRMD7 and GABRA2 may function in the same pathway to maintain GABAergic signaling in the retina. To explore the association between FRMD7 and GABRA2, we tested whether FRMD7 interacts with GABRA2 using IP assays. We found that exogenous FRMD7 (expressed in cultured cells) coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous GABRA2 (mouse retina protein extracts) and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>B). FRMD7 is located in the cytoplasm, and GABRA2 has only one functional cytoplasmic loop between TM3 and TM4. Therefore a GST pull-down assay was performed to detect interaction between FRMD7 and the loop of GABRA2. As expected, we found that FRMD7 binds directly to the cytoplasmic loop of GABRA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>C). To further confirm this interaction, we performed an immunofluorescent experiment and found colocalization of FRMD7 and GABRA2 in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), as well as the inner nuclear layer (INL) of the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>E). We analyzed retina images and calculated the average fluorescent level of FRMD7 in different layers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="iovs-61-5-41_s001">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>) and found that the average level of FRMD7 in INL, IPL, and ganglion cell layers is higher than other layers.</p>

<title>FRMD7 Mutants Exhibit a Decreased Rescue Effect in Vivo</title>
<p>FRM-3 is a homologue of human FRMD7 (hFRMD7) in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and was reported to interact with the TM3-TM4 loop of the nematode GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit UNC-49B.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27"><sup>27</sup></xref> The protein sequence identity between the FERM domains of FRMD7 and FRM-3 is 46.98% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="iovs-61-5-41_s001">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). To verify whether hFRMD7 has function similar to that of FRM-3, <italic>hFRMD7</italic> was expressed in <italic>frm-3</italic> null <italic>C. elegans</italic> by injecting plasmids encoding hFRMD7-GFP or FRM-3-GFP into <italic>frm-3</italic> null <italic>(gk585)</italic> worms. The <italic>frm-3</italic> null worms exhibited decreased locomotion compared with wild-type worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="iovs-61-5-41_s002">Supplementary Video S1</xref>), and expression of FRM-3-GFP fully rescued these locomotion defects, whereas expression of wild-type hFRMD7-GFP alone did not rescue the locomotion defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="iovs-61-5-41_s002">Supplementary Videos S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="iovs-61-5-41_s010">S9</xref>, related to nine pictures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>A). To address this failure to rescue by hFRMD7, we tested for interaction between hFRMD7 and UNC-49B by GST pull-down assays, and no interaction was detected (data not shown). For further investigation, we generated an artificial UNC-49B protein named UNC-49B-A2loop, which contains an extra human GABRA2 TM3-TM4 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>B). Expression of the UNC-49B-A2loop protein alone in <italic>frm-3</italic> null worms exhibited no rescue effect on locomotion defect.

<p>In this study, we identified three mutations (a duplicate mutation c.998dupA/p.H333Qfs*2, and two missense mutations c.580G&gt;A/p.Ala194Thr and c.973A&gt;G/p. Arg325Gly) in <italic>FRMD7</italic> in three Chinese families with INS. Our results identified GABRA2 as a novel binding partner of FRMD7 and demonstrated that pathogenic mutations of FRMD7 lead to decreased binding affinity or loss of colocalization with GABRA2. Furthermore, the pathogenic mutations exhibit a reduced ability to rescue the defects of locomotion and FARP of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in <italic>frm-3</italic> null <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>
<p>The common feature in <italic>FRMD7/Frmd7</italic> defective humans and mice is loss of OKR,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"><sup>11</sup></xref> which suggests that FRMD7 plays an important role in the genesis of OKR. However, no nystagmus was found in <italic>Frmd7<sup>tm</sup></italic> mice. In humans, horizontal microsaccades may become larger and uncontrolled when the horizontal OKR is lost, appearing as horizontal nystagmus. Mice have not been shown to have microsaccades, which could explain the absence of nystagmus in <italic>Frmd7<sup>tm</sup></italic> mice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"><sup>10</sup></xref> Yonehara et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"><sup>10</sup></xref> proposed that the loss of horizontal OKR in <italic>Frmd7<sup>tm</sup></italic> mice is because of the lack of horizontal direction selectivity in the retina, which is caused by defective asymmetric connectivity between SACs and horizontal DSGSs. The defective asymmetric connectivity is manifested as the loss of asymmetry of GABA inhibitory inputs to horizontal DSGCs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"><sup>10</sup></xref> We propose that the loss of GABA inhibitory inputs is likely because of the decreased number of immobile GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at the synapse. The following evidence supports this hypothesis. First, it has been reported that <italic>Gabra2</italic> knockout mice lost the DS response in DSGC,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21"><sup>21</sup></xref> and Gabra2 is a subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24"><sup>24</sup></xref> Second, we found that FRMD7 interacts directly with the loop between TM3 and TM4 of GABRA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>C), and colocalization of FRMD7 and GABRA2 was found in the IPL and INL of the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>D). Third, FRM-3 (an hFRMD7 homologue) interacts with the loop between TM3 and TM4 of UNC-49B in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> and synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, as well as miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitude, are decreased in <italic>frm-3</italic> null worms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27"><sup>27</sup></xref> Here we show that FRMD7 together with the loop of GABRA2 could partially rescue the locomotion defects in <italic>frm-3</italic> null worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) and increases the proportion of immobile UNC-49B-A2loop in the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). Fourth, the INS-associated FRMD7 mutations perturb the interaction between FRMD7 and GABRA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>) and weaken the rescue effects in <italic>frm-3</italic> null worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>D). Taken together, these results suggest that FRMD7 interacts with GABRA2 to stabilize immobile GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at synapses where SACs connect to DSGCs and that disruptions of this interaction may result in decreased number of immobile GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at synapses and further impair GABA inhibitory inputs to DSGCs, eventually leading to the loss of OKR, which is believed to participate in INS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33"><sup>33</sup></xref><sup>–</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35"><sup>35</sup></xref> Thus we speculate that FRMD7 mutations disrupt the interaction with GABRA2, and further lead to the loss of OKR that may result in INS.</p>
<p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the 19 D-type GABAergic motor neurons inhibit contraction of the ventral and dorsal body wall muscles during locomotion. A bend in the body is made by contracting muscles via acetylcholine (ACh) innervation on one side of the body while relaxing muscles via GABA innervation on the opposite side, which gives the worm its distinctive sinusoidal body posture,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28"><sup>28</sup></xref> and we found a decreased locomotion phenotype in <italic>frm-3</italic> null <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which may be because of the uncoordinated ACh and GABA signaling to the body muscles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27"><sup>27</sup></xref> In humans, a mixed ACh/GABA transmission from the SACs to the DSGCs are believed to play a central role in direction coding in the retina.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19"><sup>19</sup></xref> The loss of OKR in mice and human is likely because of the uncoordinated ACh and GABA signals in retina cells,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"><sup>10</sup></xref> which may be responsible for the ocular-motor phenotype in FRMD7 patients. Taken together, in both worm and human, the balance of ACh and GABA signaling is critical for physiological function.</p>
<p>Pedigree analysis showed that the inheritance pattern of family 1 (p.H333Qfs*2) is X-linked recessive, whereas both family 2 (p.Ala194Thr) and family 3 (p.Arg325Gly) are X-linked dominant, with incomplete penetrance observed in family 3.
