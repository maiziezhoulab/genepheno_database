<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is characterized by epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autistic features, and CDKL5-deficient mice exhibit a constellation of behavioral phenotypes reminiscent of the human disorder. We previously found that CDKL5 dysfunction in forebrain glutamatergic neurons results in deficits in learning and memory. However, the pathogenic origin of the autistic features of CDD remains unknown. Here, we find that selective loss of CDKL5 in GABAergic neurons leads to autistic-like phenotypes in mice accompanied by excessive glutamatergic transmission, hyperexcitability, and increased levels of postsynaptic NMDA receptors. Acute, low-dose inhibition of NMDAR signaling ameliorates autistic-like behaviors in GABAergic knockout mice, as well as a novel mouse model bearing a CDD-associated nonsense mutation, CDKL5 R59X, implicating the translational potential of this mechanism. Together, our findings suggest that enhanced NMDAR signaling and circuit hyperexcitability underlie autistic-like features in mouse models of CDD and provide a new therapeutic avenue to treat CDD-related symptoms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Mutations in cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (<italic>CDKL5</italic>) cause a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by early-onset seizures, intellectual disability, and autistic features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Mouse models of CDD have recapitulated numerous aspects of the human disorder and, despite a subtle overall degree of impairment, they show behavioral deficits such as impaired learning, reduced sociability, motor dysfunction, and altered anxiety-related behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The extent to which these behavioral deficits arise from common or distinct mechanisms, however, remains unclear.</p>
<p id="Par4">CDKL5 protein expression is enriched in the forebrain, primarily in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In glutamatergic neurons, CDKL5 has been found at the postsynaptic density, where it interacts with PSD-95 and NGL-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In addition, loss of CDKL5 both in vitro and in vivo is associated with changes in dendritic morphology, spine density, excitatory synaptic transmission, and synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Mice lacking CDKL5 selectively in forebrain glutamatergic neurons (Nex-cKO) show impaired learning and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, reminiscent of the intellectual disability found in CDD. Interestingly, Nex-cKO mice did not show other behavioral deficits found in <italic>Cdkl5</italic> constitutive knockout mice, such as alterations in sociability, stereotypic behavior, locomotion, motor coordination, and anxiety-related behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These findings imply that distinct, cell type-specific etiologies underlie CDD-related behavioral phenotypes in mice.</p>
<p id="Par5">Mice lacking CDKL5 show numerous functional changes at the synaptic and circuit levels. A recent study found that <italic>Cdkl5</italic> constitutive knockout mice demonstrated increased NMDA-dependent synaptic transmission and enhanced long-term potentiation at hippocampal synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In contrast, long-term potentiation is decreased in the somatosensory cortex of <italic>Cdkl5</italic> knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, selectively ablating CDKL5 from glutamatergic neurons leads to increased glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission, disrupted microcircuit dynamics, and learning and memory impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. While some of these differences are potentially attributable to different genetic backgrounds of mouse models of CDD, the differences between <italic>Cdkl5</italic> constitutive knockout mice and Nex-cKO mice suggest the existence of additional, non-glutamatergic mechanisms that may mediate CDD-related behavioral deficits. Notably, the function of CDKL5 in forebrain GABAergic neurons, where CDKL5 is also highly expressed, has yet to be elucidated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par6">Here, we selectively ablate CDKL5 expression in forebrain GABAergic neurons (Dlx-cKO). We found that these mice exhibit an autistic-like phenotype, but, in contrast to Nex-cKO mice, show preserved learning and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In addition, Dlx-cKO mice show an enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission and circuit-level hyperexcitability, coupled with elevated levels of NMDA receptors. Reducing NMDAR activity using an uncompetitive antagonist, memantine, significantly mitigated the behavioral deficits found in Dlx-cKO mice. To examine the translational potential of these findings, we generated a novel CDD model bearing a patient mutation, CDKL5 R59X, and found that these mice, similarly to Dlx-cKO mice, show an elevation of NMDA receptors. Importantly, acute, low-dose NMDAR blockade selectively ameliorates autistic-like features in this CDD model. Taken together, our findings support a novel mechanism by which CDKL5 loss in GABAergic neurons leads to excessive NMDAR signaling and contribute to the etiology of autistic-like behaviors in mouse models of CDD.</p>

<title>CDKL5 GABAergic deletion results in autistic-like features</title>
<p id="Par7">Our previous findings showed that CDD-related learning and memory impairment has origins in forebrain glutamatergic neurons in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Given that CDKL5 is also highly expressed in forebrain GABAergic neurons, we generated conditional knockout mice selectively lacking CDKL5 in this cell population (Dlx-cKO) using the Dlx-5/6 Cre driver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1A, B</xref>). Dlx-cKO mice showed normal growth and body weight through adulthood and no obvious physical abnormalities (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2A</xref>). We then performed a battery of behavioral assays, similar to those in previous studies of <italic>Cdkl5</italic> constitutive KO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and Nex-cKO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Compared to WT controls, Dlx-cKO showed no changes in locomotor activity, anxiety-related behaviors, and motor coordination (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2B–D</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par8">In contrast, Dlx-cKO mice demonstrated significantly reduced social interaction on the three-chamber social approach assay, showing diminished preference for investigating a social stimulus as compared to an object (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a, b</xref>). When allowed the opportunity for direct interaction with a novel stimulus mouse, Dlx-cKO mice also spent significantly less time initiating contact in comparison to wild-type controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). To rule out the involvement of an olfactory deficit underlying reduced social preference, we conducted the olfactory habituation–dishabituation test. Dlx-cKO mice showed an intact ability to discriminate between different scents but spent reduced time sniffing a social scent, a feature consistent with a reduced interest in social stimuli (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Dlx-cKO mice exhibit an autistic-like phenotype. <bold>a</bold> Dlx-cKO mice showed similar times spent interacting with empty cylinders during the habituation phase of the three-chambered social assay. Cyl1/Cyl2: empty cylinders 1 and 2. Soc: social cylinder containing a stimulus mouse. Non-soc: nonsocial cylinder containing an object. (WT, <italic>n</italic> = 28; Dlx-cKO, <italic>n</italic> = 26; paired <italic>t</italic>-test). <bold>b</bold> Wild-type mice showed a significant preference for interacting with the cylinder containing a social stimulus, but Dlx-cKO mice did not show a significant difference in time spent sniffing the social and nonsocial cylinders (paired <italic>t</italic>-test). <bold>c</bold> Dlx-cKO mice also spent significantly reduced time initiating social contact during the direct interaction phase (unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). <bold>d</bold> Dlx-cKO mice showed unaltered ability to discriminate between odors and habituation to the same odor upon repeated presentation. However, Dlx-cKO mice show a reduced time sniffing a social scent compared to WT (WT, <italic>n</italic> = 20; Dlx-cKO, <italic>n</italic> = 14; two-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak’s multiple comparisons test; error bars demonstrate s.e.m.). <bold>e</bold> Dlx-cKO mice spent significantly more time engaging in repetitive behaviors, including grooming and digging, within a 10-min period in a home-cage like environment (WT, <italic>n</italic> = 18; Dlx-cKO, <italic>n</italic> = 16; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). <bold>f</bold> Dlx-cKO mice show significantly reduced nesting scores on the nesting assay (WT, <italic>n</italic> = 9; Dlx-cKO, <italic>n</italic> = 8; Mann–Whitney test). <bold>g</bold> Dlx-cKO mice show unaltered spontaneous alternation percentage in comparison to WT mice (WT, <italic>n</italic> = 20; Dlx-cKO: <italic>n</italic> = 12; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). <bold>h</bold> The total number of entries made were not significantly different between Dlx-cKO and WT mice (unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). <bold>i</bold> Dlx-cKO mice did not show a significant difference in the total number of errors made on forward probe trials of the Barnes maze (WT, <italic>n</italic> = 18; Dlx-cKO: <italic>n</italic> = 14; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). <bold>j</bold> Dlx-cKO mice made significantly more errors on the reversal probe trials of the Barnes maze (unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). <bold>k</bold> On the reversal probe trials, Dlx-cKO mice also made significantly more perseverations, or visits to the original target hole location (Mann–Whitney test). *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, and ****<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001. Source data are provided as a Source Data file</p></caption><graphic id="d29e566" xlink:href="41467_2019_10689_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par9">In addition to social deficits, another defining feature of human autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is the presence of repetitive or stereotypic behaviors. We next assessed repetitive behaviors in Dlx-cKO mice. In a home-cage like environment, Dlx-cKO mice showed significantly increased time engaging in stereotypic behaviors such as grooming and digging (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>), and also exhibited a nesting deficit (considered by some to be a home-cage social behavior) compared to littermate controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par10">We next assessed learning and memory, a behavioral domain significantly impaired in both <italic>Cdkl5</italic> constitutive knockout mice and Nex-cKO mice. Interestingly, Dlx-cKO showed no impairment in spontaneous alternation behavior on the Y-maze, suggesting intact working memory (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g, h</xref>). On the Barnes maze, an assay of spatial learning and memory, Dlx-cKO did not show a significant difference from wild-type controls in the number of errors made on probe trials (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1i</xref>). However, when the target hole location was altered to the opposite side of the maze after acquisition (reversal probe trials), Dlx-cKO mice demonstrated a significant impairment in adjusting to this new target hole (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1j</xref>). In addition, Dlx-cKO mice show an increased number of perseverations on reversal probe trials, or visits to the previous target hole location (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1k</xref>). These results suggest that Dlx-cKO mice have intact learning and memory, but impaired cognitive flexibility, another feature reminiscent of autism spectrum disorders.</p>
<p id="Par11">Taken together, Dlx-cKO mice show a set of autistic-like features with relatively preserved learning and memory that stand in contrast to previous findings in Nex-cKO mice, which exclusively show impaired learning and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These results demonstrate a segregation of behavioral deficits in <italic>Cdkl5</italic> conditional knockout mice, suggesting that impaired learning and autistic-like features have distinct cellular origins in CDD.</p>

<title>Dlx-cKO mice show aberrant circuit activation</title>
<p id="Par12">In previously established mouse models of ASD, the finding of excitation-inhibition (<italic>E</italic>/<italic>I</italic>) imbalance has emerged as a prominent theme underlying patterns of circuit and network dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Specifically, hyperexcitability at the circuit and network levels has been found to be associated with many of the autistic-like features reported in these models. Importantly, reversal of hyperexcitability in these models is often sufficient to ameliorate disease phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, demonstrating a causal role for <italic>E</italic>/<italic>I</italic> imbalance in generating the features of social impairment and stereotypy.</p>
<p id="Par13">The exhibition of autistic-like features in Dlx-cKO mice, coupled to the previous findings of <italic>E</italic>/<italic>I</italic> imbalance in other models of ASD, prompted us to investigate any circuit irregularities in CDD mouse models. We first used voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI), a technique that has been consistently used in mouse models of neurologic disease to assess circuit function with high spatiotemporal resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. We conducted our experiments with WT, Dlx-cKO, and Nex-cKO mice, to facilitate a side-by-side comparison of circuit function in the context of the distinct behavioral profiles of Dlx-cKO and Nex-cKO mice.</p>
<p id="Par14">We began by interrogating the function of the perforant path-dentate gyrus pathway, a hippocampal microcircuit often perturbated in disease states that critically relies on both excitation and inhibition for proper function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Using VSDI responses as a readout, we assessed the layer-specific responses of the molecular layer, granule cell layer, as well as the downstream hilar region in response to perforant path stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). We used a paired-pulse paradigm, which assesses both the baseline excitability of the circuit and its short-term plasticity. We first focused our analysis on the response of the granule cell layer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b–e</xref>), which contains the cell bodies of the principal neurons of the dentate gyrus. WT mice showed comparable responses in the granule cell layer to the first and second stimuli without significant facilitation or depression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b–d</xref>), showing a paired-pulse ratio that was not significantly different from one (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e</xref>). Neither Nex-cKO or Dlx-cKO mice showed a significant difference from WT in their peak responses to the first stimulation, suggesting similar baseline excitability of the dentate gyrus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b, c</xref>). Interestingly, Nex-cKO mice showed a diminished peak response to the second stimulus, with a paired-pulse ratio significantly less than one (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b, d, e</xref>). In contrast to Nex-cKO mice, Dlx-cKO mice exhibited paired-pulse facilitation, evident by an increase in depolarization upon a second successive stimulus and a peak ratio significantly greater than one (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d, e</xref>). Importantly, this aberrant paired-pulse facilitation in Dlx-cKO was also observed in an upstream input region (molecular layer) and downstream output region (hilus) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2f–k</xref>). Furthermore, we repeated this experiment at a second stimulation intensity and observed similar results (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Taken together, our findings reveal that the distinct behavioral phenotypes of <italic>Cdkl5</italic> conditional knockout mice are accompanied by contrasting patterns of circuit dysfunction. Specifically, Dlx-cKO mice show circuit hyperexcitability in the form of aberrant paired-pulse facilitation, whereas Nex-cKO mice show circuit hypo-excitability in the form of aberrant paired-pulse depression.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Dlx-cKO mice show aberrant paired-pulse facilitation. <bold>a</bold> Schematic of voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) showing the site of stimulation at the perforant path and regions of interest used for quantitative analysis (GCL, granule cell layer; ML, molecular layer; HIL, hilus).

<title>Dlx-cKO mice show enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission</title>
<p id="Par15">Given the finding of circuit hyperexcitability in Dlx-cKO mice, we next investigated the synaptic origins of this <italic>E</italic>/<italic>I</italic> imbalance. Previous studies have found enhanced synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region of <italic>Cdkl5</italic> constitutive knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Interestingly, these changes were not fully recapitulated in the glutamatergic conditional knockout mice, suggesting that CDKL5 function in other neuronal populations, such as GABAergic neurons, may contribute to synaptic hyperexcitability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we assessed both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampal CA1 region in Dlx-cKO mice. We found that Dlx-cKO mice exhibited significantly enhanced frequency of miniature spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), but no changes in amplitude or kinetics of these events (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a–e</xref> and Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4A, B</xref>). In contrast, miniature spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were not significantly different in either amplitude, frequency, or kinetics between Dlx-cKO and WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3f–j</xref> and Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4C, D</xref>). This suggests that despite CDKL5 loss in GABAergic neurons, adult Dlx-cKO mice do not show a significant alteration of inhibitory signaling at CA1 pyramidal neurons. In turn, synaptic transmission between excitatory neurons is enhanced upon selective loss of CDKL5 in GABAergic neurons.

<title>Dlx-cKO mice have an increase in postsynaptic NMDA receptors</title>
<p id="Par16">The finding of excess glutamatergic synaptic transmission in Dlx-cKO mice suggests a potential alteration in the molecular composition of postsynaptic receptors. Indeed, previous studies have suggested a role for CDKL5 in regulating synaptic receptor composition and homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. For example, excessive glutamatergic synaptic transmission can result from an enhancement of postsynaptic AMPA receptors (AMPAR), NMDA receptors (NMDAR), or both. We therefore examined the composition of major ionotropic glutamate receptors in postsynaptic density membrane preparations from Dlx-cKO and WT mice, including GluA1, GluA2, GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B. Interestingly, we found a selective increase in the protein level of NMDARs, but not AMPARs in Dlx-cKO mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>).

<title>NMDAR blockade ameliorates autistic-like features in Dlx-cKO</title>
<p id="Par17">Our findings in Dlx-cKO mice raised the possibility that enhanced NMDAR signaling may underlie the autistic-like phenotype exhibited by these mice. We first investigated the extent to which NMDAR signaling is responsible for the repetitive behavior phenotype in Dlx-cKO mice. We used low doses of memantine, a non-competitive NMDA receptor blocker that has been previously found to rescue behavioral deficits in numerous mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

Next, we employed a modified dyadic interaction assay to quantitatively assess social interactions in drug- and vehicle-treated Dlx-cKO mice. Whereas vehicle-administered Dlx-cKO mice showed significantly reduced social interaction, memantine ameliorated this deficit, significantly increasing the time spent by Dlx-cKO mice in social interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>). This effect was specific to Dlx-cKO mice, as memantine normalized the ratio of time spent in social interaction in pairs of Dlx-cKO and WT control mice co-tested side-by-side in identical cages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that enhanced NMDAR signaling underlies, at least in part, the autistic-like features of Dlx-cKO mice, and that an acute reduction of NMDAR activity can ameliorate these phenotypes.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Acute NMDAR blockade ameliorates autistic-like features in Dlx-cKO mice. <bold>a</bold> Total grooming in a home-cage like environment is significantly increased in saline-treated Dlx-cKO mice in comparison to WT, and memantine at 5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> significantly rescued the increased grooming phenotype in Dlx-cKO mice (<italic>n</italic> = 8 for saline groups; <italic>n</italic> = 7 for memantine groups; one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak’s multiple comparisons test). <bold>b</bold> Memantine significantly reduces the duration of the longest grooming bout in Dlx-cKO mice. <bold>c</bold> On the dyadic social assay, saline-treated Dlx-cKO mice spend significantly less time initiating social interaction with a novel stimulus mouse in comparison to WT.

<p id="Par19">We next investigated the extent to which enhanced NMDAR signaling is also present in R59X mice. Using a similar approach as for Dlx-cKO mice, we examined the protein levels of NMDAR and AMPAR subunits in postsynaptic density fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b–g</xref>). In R59X mice, we found an upregulation of NMDAR subunit levels, with a selective increase in GluN2B, mirroring previous findings in <italic>Cdkl5</italic> constitutive knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6g</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par20">Using R59X mice as a model of CDD, we next examined the extent to which enhanced NMDA signaling is responsible for CDD-related behavioral deficits. We first tested the possibility that enhanced NMDAR signaling may underlie impaired learning and memory in CDKL5-deficient mice.

Notably, acute memantine administration at a range of doses (1.25–10 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, intraperitoneal) did not ameliorate this behavioral deficit, suggesting that excess NMDAR signaling is unlikely to be the major mechanism underlying learning and memory deficits in R59X mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par21">In contrast, we observed that acute memantine administration (5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, intraperitoneal) rescued excessive stereotypic behaviors in R59X mice, significantly reducing both total time spent grooming and the duration of the longest grooming bout to a level similar to that of WT mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b, c</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par22">Our behavioral studies in Dlx-cKO mice revealed an autistic-like phenotype characterized by reduced social preference and increased stereotypic behaviors, but relative preservation of other behaviors such as learning and memory, motor coordination, and anxiety-related behaviors. This behavioral profile stands in contrast to our previous findings in Nex-cKO mice, which exhibit selectively impaired learning and memory. Our results delineate the distinct cellular origins of CDD-related behavioral phenotypes: whereas impaired learning primarily originates from the loss of CDKL5 in forebrain glutamatergic neurons, autistic-like features primarily originate from the loss of CDKL5 in forebrain GABAergic neurons. Interestingly, anxiety-related behavior, locomotion, and motor coordination were not altered in either Nex-cKO or Dlx-cKO mice. These additional phenotypes may be mediated by 1) CDKL5 function in other cell populations and brain regions and/or 2) the synergistic functions of CDKL5 in forebrain glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons.</p>
<p id="Par23">Our findings in <italic>Cdkl5</italic> conditional knockout mice support a model whereby CDKL5 loss in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons lead to divergent changes in <italic>E</italic>/<italic>I</italic> balance that generate distinct behavioral deficits. We show that in Dlx-cKO mice, hippocampal circuit hyperexcitability is coupled with autistic-like features, a finding corroborated in numerous other mouse models of autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In specific cases, autistic-like behaviors have been linked to a dysfunction of inhibitory neuronal transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In contrast, we show that in Nex-cKO mice, hippocampal circuit hypo-excitability is linked to learning and memory deficits. Interestingly, reduced <italic>E</italic>/<italic>I</italic> ratio has been demonstrated in numerous mouse models of intellectual disability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, our studies reveal a novel avenue toward treating specific CDD-related symptoms, but also suggest that modulation of <italic>E</italic>/<italic>I</italic> balance in CDD may be a double-edged sword. To date, the majority of reported CDD patients have been predicted to carry loss-of-function mutations, such as nonsense, indels, or missense mutations abolishing CDKL5 kinase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, suggesting that our knockout and R59X knockin mouse models may carry a high translational relevance. In order to develop targeted therapies for CDD, additional studies are needed to elucidate the specific signaling pathways and neural circuits responsible for each of the behavioral symptoms.</p>
<p id="Par24">In our VSDI studies of Nex- and Dlx-cKO mice, we employed a paired-pulse stimulation paradigm, which assesses the integration of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the dentate gyrus. Interestingly, previous work has shown that NMDA signaling is a necessary component for the paired-pulse facilitation response in the dentate gyrus, suggesting a potential mechanism for circuit excitability in Dlx-cKO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the aberrant paired-pulse depression in Nex-cKO mice may result from enhanced inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, given that feedforward and feedback inhibition play key roles in regulating the activity of the dentate gyrus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In our electrophysiologic studies of Dlx-cKO mice, the most prominent change was, surprisingly, an enhancement in glutamatergic synaptic transmission. This change likely arises from a non-cell autonomous mechanism, especially in the absence of a concomitant change in GABAergic-glutamatergic inhibitory synaptic transmission. For example, the loss of CDKL5 in GABAergic interneurons may lead to a modulation of presynaptic release probability at glutamatergic synapses. Alternatively, enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission may be a homeostatic response to a transient alteration of GABAergic signaling during early development. Supporting this notion, a previous study has found that GABAergic transmission cooperates with NMDA receptor activation during development for excitatory synapse formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the loss of CDKL5 may lead to different disruptions in distinct populations of forebrain interneurons that as of yet we are unable to dissect from our Dlx5/6-Cre-driven dissection. Future studies looking into the role of CDKL5 at specific sub-populations of interneurons will provide clarity on its non-cell autonomous roles.</p>
<p id="Par25">Interestingly, despite the findings of synaptic and circuit-level hyperexcitability, we did not observe spontaneous seizure-like behaviors in Dlx-cKO mice during our routine assays, at least in male mice and at the ages examined. This is similar to what has been observed in constitutive loss-of-function models of CDD where EEG recordings have not revealed spontaneous seizures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, this does not exclude the possibility that seizure susceptibility is altered in the absence of CDKL5 under certain environmental conditions and during specific periods in development and aging. Thus far, the lack of a robust seizure phenotype in CDD mouse models suggests that neural network differences between human and mouse brains may prevent the development of overt seizures in CDKL5-deficient mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. In addition, given the contrasting profiles of hypo- and hyperexcitability in Nex-cKO and Dlx-cKO mice, respectively, the state of circuit excitability in constitutive loss-of-function models of CDD remains to be further characterized. Indeed, previous studies have revealed changes in synapse density, distribution, and plasticity of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is possible that both pro- and anti-epileptogenic changes occur in the CDKL5-deficient brain, each playing a distinct role in mediating the various behavioral deficits of CDD.</p>
<p id="Par26">The finding of enhanced NMDAR signaling reveals a novel synaptic mechanism that may potentially underlie the behavioral deficits of mouse models of CDD. Our results in Dlx-cKO mice suggest that GABAergic dysfunction leads to an enhancement of NMDAR signaling, which in turn is responsible for autistic-like features. We validate this mechanism in R59X mice, demonstrating that the acute reduction of NMDAR signaling ameliorates select CDD-related behavioral deficits. Whereas acute memantine administration specifically rescued repetitive behavior and significantly improved social interaction in R59X mice, it did not positively affect the learning and memory deficit in R59X mice. Altogether with our previous findings in Nex-cKO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, our studies suggest that distinct subsets of CDD-related phenotypes are mediated by distinct synaptic and circuit mechanisms. Future studies are expected to refine these mechanisms by testing brain region- and circuit-specific mechanisms for specific CDD-related phenotypes. For example, given that we found enhanced NMDAR subunit levels in our postsynaptic density membrane fractions, we cannot rule out the possibility that extra-synaptic NMDAR levels are also altered in Dlx-cKO and R59X mice. Indeed, memantine is known to act at both synaptic and extra-synaptic receptors in a dose-dependent manner, and its effects on behavior may be mediated by both mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Although it may be difficult to distinguish between these two populations of NMDARs in vivo, further work in this direction can elucidate the mechanism that underlies the enhancement of synaptic NMDAR signaling in mouse models of CDD.</p>
<p id="Par27">Taken together, our studies delineate the forebrain GABAergic origins of autistic-like features in CDKL5-deficient mice, showing for the first time that CDKL5 is required in this diverse population of neurons for proper neural development and function. At the synaptic level, we reveal an enhancement of NMDAR signaling that contributes to circuit hyperexcitability. Finally, in a novel disease model of CDD, we show that acute reduction of NMDAR signaling can ameliorate behavioral deficits, highlighting a potentially important mechanism for CDD-related phenotypes in mice and supporting a novel therapeutic avenue for the treatment of these symptoms in CDD patients.</p>

<title>Elevated zero maze</title>
<p id="Par32">The elevated zero maze (Stoelting, Illinois, USA) consists of a circular-shaped platform elevated above the floor. Two opposite quadrants of the maze are enclosed (wall height, 12 inches), whereas the other two are open (wall height, 0.5 inches). Mice were placed in one of the closed quadrants and their movement traced over the course of 5 min. Analysis, including the quantification of percent of time spent in open arms and the number of entries, was performed manually using a stopwatch. An entry was defined as a transition from a closed to open arm, or vice versa, that involves all four paws.</p>

<title>Three-chambered social approach assay</title>
<p id="Par33">The social choice test was carried out in a three-chambered apparatus that consisted of a center chamber and two end chambers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Before the start of the test and in a counter-balanced sequence, one end chamber was designated the social chamber, into which a stimulus mouse would be introduced, and the other end chamber was designed the nonsocial chamber. Two identical, clear Plexiglas cylinders with multiple holes to allow for air exchange were placed in each end chamber. In the habituation phase of the test, the test mouse was placed in the center chamber and allowed to explore all three chambers for 10 min. During this acclimation period, baseline measurements of how much time the mouse spent in each of the three chambers and the distance traveled by the test mouse were collected.</p>
<p id="Par34">In the social choice phase of the test, a stimulus mouse (adult gonadectomized A/J mice; The Jackson Laboratory) was placed in the cylinder in the social chamber while a novel object was simultaneously placed into the other cylinder in the nonsocial chamber. During the 5-min social choice period, chamber times and numbers of transitions among chambers were again recorded.</p>
<p id="Par35">In the direct social interaction test, the cylinders were removed simultaneously following the social choice test, and the amount of time test and stimulus mice spent in direct contact (sniffing, allogrooming) was measured. If fighting persisted for more than several seconds, the mice were removed from the apparatus and excluded from the study.</p>

<title>Y-maze</title>
<p id="Par36">Spontaneous alternation behavior was measured on a Y-maze apparatus (San Diego Instruments, California, USA), composed of three arms (Arm A: 8in. x 5in. x 3in.; Arms B and C: 6in. x 5in. x 3in.). For habituation, the test mouse was placed in each of the three arms, facing the center, and allowed to make one choice to enter another arm. For testing, the mouse was placed in Arm C, facing the center, and allowed to freely explore the maze for 5 min. A spontaneous alternation was defined an entry into the arm less recently explored. Percent spontaneous alternation was calculated as the number of spontaneous alternations over the total number of entries. For example, the sequence C,B,A,B,C,B,A,C (starting in arm C) resulted in a percent spontaneous alternation of 4/6 = 67%.</p>

<title>Barnes maze</title>
<p id="Par37">Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed on a Barnes Maze apparatus (San Diego Instruments, California, USA), a circular platform with 36-inch diameter and 20 equally spaced escape holes along the perimeter, one of which leads to a “target” escape box. Bright lighting was used as stimulus to complete the task. The assay consisted of five phases: adaptation, forward acquisition training, forward probe trials, reversal training, and reversal probe trials. For adaptation, each mouse was placed in a dark start chamber in the middle of the maze for 10 s, then uncovered and guided gently to the escape box. Forward acquisition training consisted of two trials per day for 4 days, with each mouse starting in the dark start chamber in the middle of the maze and subsequently allowed to explore the maze for 3 min. The trial ends when the mouse enters the target escape hole or after 3 min have elapsed, after which the mouse is guided gently to the escape hole. After reaching the escape hole, the mouse is allowed to remain there for 1 min. Forward probe trials were conducted on day 5, 24 h after the last training day. During the probe trial, the maze is in the same position as the training days, and the target hole is closed. Each trial lasted 90 s, during which the number of errors (pokes into non-target holes) made prior to reaching the target hole is quantified. Days 6–10 consisted of reversal training, conducted using a similar protocol as forward acquisition training, except that the target was a stable escape hole moved 180° from its location during forward acquisition training. Reversal probe trials were conducted on day 11 and identically to forward probe trials. In addition to quantifying the number of total errors, the number of perseverations, defined as pokes into the previous target hole during forward acquisition training, was counted.</p>

<title>Olfaction</title>
<p id="Par40">Mice were tested for whether they could detect and differentiate odors in a habituation–dishabituation protocol modified from Yang and Crawley. Mice were presented with cotton-tipped wooden applicators dipped in water, vanilla, or swiped across the bottom of an unfamiliar social cage.

<title>Dyadic interaction</title>
<p id="Par43">The dyadic interaction test is an abbreviated version of the three-chambered assay to quantitatively assess the duration of direct social interaction in two freely behaving mice. One week prior to the assay, male R59X and wild-type control mice were singly housed to increase the motivation for social interaction and reduce aggression. Age-matched, novel, wild-type male stimulus mice were group-housed. On the day of the test, test and stimulus mice were acclimated to the room for 1 h prior to the start of the assay. Following this period, each test mouse is placed individually in a clear, round Plexiglass cage (Pinnacle Technology, Lawrence, Kansas, USA) measuring 8 inches tall and 9.5 inches in diameter, with a thin layer of bedding. Following 30 min of habituation in the cage, a novel, age-matched stimulus mouse was placed into the cage, and the mice were allowed to freely interact under video monitoring for 10 min. The total duration of social interaction initiated by the test mouse in the first 2 min was scored, and this included oro-genital sniffing, oro-facial sniffing, close following, placing one or both paws on the stimulus mouse, or allogrooming of the stimulus mouse. “Co-tested pairs” refer to side-by-side tests involving two littermate R59X and wild-type control mice, each interacting with a novel stimulus mouse in a separate cage.</p>

<title>Drug administration</title>
<p id="Par44">Mice were acclimated to daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of vehicle (saline) for 3 days prior to each set of behavioral assays. For each behavioral cohort, the entire cohort was administered either vehicle or drug, with the experimenter blinded to the genotypes of mice throughout. All animal behaviors were performed on adult male mice at 9–12 weeks of age, and the analysis of behavioral data was carried out by a researcher blinded to genotype. Vehicle and drug (memantine hydrochloride, Tocris Biosciences, United Kingdom) were diluted in saline at 10 μL per gram mouse body weight for administration. Vehicle or drug was administered 1 h prior to the start of each behavioral assay, and during this period, mice were allowed to habituate in the room where the assay would be carried out. Notably, we used doses of memantine similar to those from studies in other mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, which are expected to result in reversible blockade of a relatively small fraction of synaptic NMDA receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p>

<p id="Par60">For the analysis of cumulative distributions (mEPSC and mIPSC inter-event intervals and amplitudes), all samples from each individual cell was sorted, binned, and averaged at percent intervals, effectively generating a binned cumulative distribution curve for each cell. Data from all cells of a given genotype were plotted at these distinct binned percent intervals with the mean and error bars indicating s.e.m. The results were analyzed using linear mixed effect models, incorporating a third term, cumulative frequency bin.</p>
