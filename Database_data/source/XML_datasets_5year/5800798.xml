<abstract>
<p>Neuronal stimulation leads to immediate early gene (IEG) expression through calcium-dependent mechanisms. In recent years, considerable attention has been devoted to the transcriptional responses after neuronal stimulation, but relatively little is known about the changes in chromatin dynamics that follow neuronal activation. Here, we use fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, biochemical fractionations, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to show that KCl-induced depolarization in primary cultured cortical neurons causes a rapid release of the linker histone H1 from chromatin, concomitant with IEG expression. H1 release is repressed by PARP inhibition, PARP1 deletion, a non-PARylatable H1, as well as phosphorylation inhibitions and a nonphosphorylatable H1, leading to hindered IEG expression. Further, H1 is replaced by PARP1 on IEG promoters after neuronal stimulation, and PARP inhibition blocks this reciprocal binding response. Our results demonstrate the relationship between neuronal excitation and chromatin plasticity by identifying the roles of polyadenosine diphosphate ribosylation and phosphorylation of H1 in regulating H1 chromatin eviction and IEG expression in stimulated neurons.</p>

<body><sec id="s01" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the nervous system, hundreds of genes are induced in response to sensory experience–dependent neuronal activation. Depolarization is a change in the cell’s membrane potential, and exposure of primary neuronal cultures to an elevated level of KCl leads to membrane depolarization and an influx of calcium through L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Greer and Greenberg, 2008</xref>). The resulting increase in intracellular calcium level then triggers several calcium-dependent signaling pathways that ultimately lead to changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">West et al., 2002</xref>). Although considerable attention has been devoted to the transcriptional responses after neuronal stimulation, and a growing body of literature links chromatin to neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dulac, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zocchi and Sassone-Corsi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ronan et al., 2013</xref>), relatively little is known about the changes in chromatin dynamics that follow neuronal activation.</p><p>Previously, we found that the dynamic exchange of the linker histone H1 on chromatin is a hallmark of pluripotent cells and is diminished during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Meshorer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Melcer et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we examine the dynamic exchange of H1 on chromatin before and after neuronal stimulation in primary neurons and test the potential relationships among neuronal depolarization, chromatin protein dynamics, and gene activation. Because H1 is regulated by PARP1-mediated poly-ADP ribosylation (PAR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kim et al., 2004</xref>), especially during memory consolidation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cohen-Armon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fontán-Lozano et al., 2010</xref>), and because H1 and PARP1 were shown to display reciprocal binding patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krishnakumar et al., 2008</xref>), we tested the potential involvement of PARP1 in mediating the dynamic exchange of H1 on chromatin.</p><p>Using primary cultures of cortical neurons, we show here that KCl-induced depolarization causes a rapid release of H1 from chromatin. This hyperdynamic association was blocked by PARPs inhibition, which also largely prevented the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs). Using knockout (KO) cell lines, we identified PARP1 as the main PARP protein involved in this process. Interestingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) demonstrated that H1 is replaced by PARP1 on IEG promoters after neuronal stimulation, the reciprocal binding of which is abolished by PARP1 inhibition or depletion. Collectively, our results demonstrate the relationship between neuronal excitation and H1 chromatin association and identify a PARP1-mediated linker histone mechanism regulating IEG expression in stimulated neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s02" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s03"><title>Depolarization induces large-scale chromatin reorganization in postmitotic neurons (PMNs)</title><p>Neuronal depolarization induces global changes in chromatin organization and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Su et al., 2017</xref>). To study the link between neuronal excitation and chromatin regulation, we used cultured mouse primary postmitotic cortical neurons at day 6 or 10 after derivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Martinowich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ebert et al., 2013</xref>; Fig. S1 A). Differentiation to PMNs was validated by staining with neuron-specific NESTIN and MAP2 antibodies (Fig. S1 B). PMNs are readily excitable by KCl-induced depolarization in a regulated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Martinowich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). We validated this using live-cell calcium imaging with Fluo-4 (Fig. S1 C). We then wished to recapitulate in our PMN system the previously observed reorganization of heterochromatin-associated proteins after KCl stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Martinowich et al., 2003</xref>). We performed time-course immunofluorescence staining for MeCP2 15 min and 1 and 7 h after KCl stimulation. We found, as expected, that MeCP2 is redistributed from a diffused staining in resting neurons to distinct heterochromatin foci by 15 min and onwards (Fig. S2, A and B). To extend these observations, we also performed immunofluorescence staining for the heterochromatin protein HP1γ and the heterochromatin-associated histone modification H3K9me3 before and after stimulation. Akin to MeCP2, we found that HP1γ reorganized from a diffused staining pattern in resting neurons to distinct heterochromatin foci organization after 15 min of neuronal stimulation with KCl (Fig. S2 A). A similar trend was observed for H3K9me3, although in the resting neurons, it assumed both diffuse and heterochromatic staining, whereas after stimulation, it was concentrated almost exclusively in heterochromatin foci (Fig. S2, C and D). In contrast, HP1α did not show any change in its nuclear organization after KCl-induced depolarization (Fig. S2 E). These data demonstrate that chromatin undergoes selective global rearrangement after depolarization.</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>Depolarization induces H1 mobility in PMNs</title><p>Heterochromatin domains are maintained by dynamic association of structural proteins, including heterochromatin protein HP1 and linker histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Misteli, 2001</xref>). Because neuronal depolarization leads to IEG expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">West et al., 2002</xref>), and because we observed a relatively rapid reorganization of chromatin after neuronal stimulation, we wished to determine the effects of neuronal stimulation on the association between chromatin and chromatin proteins. To this end, we used FRAP of H1-GFP (either H1.0 or H1e) and analyzed its dynamic association with chromatin before (NaCl controls) and after (KCl, 15 min) neuronal stimulation in PMNs. Exogenous H1-GFP constituted less than ∼30% of total H1 (Fig. S3 A). Strikingly, the dynamic association of H1 with chromatin was significantly increased in excited neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), with a significantly reduced immobile fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Mathematical fitting demonstrated a two-exponential fit, suggesting two distinct H1 populations. H1e tagged with GFP at its N-terminal region (GFP-H1) displayed a similar dynamic response to KCl stimulation (Fig. S3 B).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Depolarization induces H1 PARylation and relaxation in PMNs.

PARP1 is known to play various roles in genomic processes, including the regulation of chromatin structure and transcription, and it was previously reported that depolarization of rat brain cortical neurons activates PARP1 in the absence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cohen-Armon et al., 2004</xref>). This suggested to us that H1 might be poly-ADP ribosylated after KCl stimulation. To test the potential involvement of PAR after neuronal excitation in our system, we first performed immunofluorescence using PAR-specific antibodies before and after KCl stimulation and found increased PAR levels after KCl stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). We next used PARP1 inhibitors to study the significance of H1 PAR on its chromatin-binding dynamics. To ensure that PARP inhibitors prevented KCl-induced PAR increase, we first treated the depolarized PMNs with PARP inhibitors for 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>) and, as expected, the elevated PAR levels in KCl-stimulated neurons were restored after treatment. Immunofluorescence data were quantified using ImageJ analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). We also repeated the H1-GFP FRAP experiments in the presence or absence of PARP inhibitors, followed by neuronal excitation, and found that PARP inhibitors largely prevented the KCl-stimulated H1 mobility on chromatin (Fig. S3, C and D). For the most part, PAR does not colocalize with DAPI-dense heterochromatin foci (Fig. S3 E), suggesting a largely euchromatic environment. Together, these data suggest that the increased dynamic association of H1 with chromatin after neuronal stimulation can be largely prevented by PARP inhibition.</p><p>We next performed immunoprecipitation with PAR antibodies before and after neuronal excitation as well as in excited cells treated with PARP inhibitors, and we analyzed PARP1 levels using Western blotting with PARP1 antibodies. Our data demonstrate that enhanced PAR of PARP1 itself in depolarized PMNs is largely prevented by PARP1 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Furthermore, we performed immunoprecipitation with H1 antibodies before and after neuronal excitation, and analyzed PAR levels by Western blots with PAR antibody.

To test this in our system, we performed ChIP assays using specific antibodies for H1 and PARP1 on cross-linked chromatin from PMNs before and after depolarization/1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoline (DHIQ) treatment for 1 h. After depolarization, we detected a significant decrease of histone H1’s association with the <italic>c-Fos</italic>, <italic>c-Jun</italic>, and <italic>Egr-1</italic> promoters compared with nondepolarized neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). In parallel, depolarization induced PARP1 accumulation at these CREB-related promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Remarkably, KCl-induced H1 release and PARP1 accumulation on IEG promoters was completely restored to normal levels when treating the PMNs with PARPs inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). As a control, we also examined H1 release from several silent genomic loci. In these nonexpressed genomic regions, no differences were observed in H1 binding before and after stimulation (Fig. S3 F), suggesting that H1 release occurs primarily at IEGs. This is in line with our FRAP data, which show a global response of H1, but H1 mobility is partial, and a large fraction of H1 is still retained on chromatin after KCl stimulation. Collectively, these results suggest that there is competition between H1 and PARP1 on IEG promoters and that PARP1 activation induces local alterations in chromatin structure through histone H1 release.</p></sec><sec id="s07"><title>PAPR1, but not PARP2, mediates H1 release from chromatin</title><p>We next wished to test which of the PARP proteins expressed in our system mediates the hyperdynamic response of H1 to KCl stimulation.

We further validated this in our PMN system and found that PARP1 is the most highly abundant PARP, followed by PARP2, whereas PARP3 was barely detected in our system (Fig. S3 H). We therefore concentrated on PARP1 and PARP2. Although KO of either protein alone is viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yélamos et al., 2006</xref>), together they are essential, and <italic>Parp1</italic>/<italic>Parp2</italic> double knockout (DKO) mice die around the onset of gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ménissier de Murcia et al., 2003</xref>).

Next, we differentiated all cells into cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gaspard et al., 2009</xref>) and subjected the neurons to KCl stimulation (or NaCl as a control). We first tested the dynamic association of H1 with chromatin in the different mutants using FRAP.

The non-PARylatable H1-GFP mutant failed to exhibit the typical KCl-induced hyperdynamic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>), suggesting that PARylation of H1 itself is responsible for its release from chromatin after neuronal excitation. Because PARylated H1 was shown to be heavily phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wong et al., 1983</xref>), and because phosphorylation of linker histones affects their dynamic association with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Contreras et al., 2003</xref>), we also tested the dynamic response of a nonphosphorylatable H1-GFP mutant to KCl stimulation. Once again, we found that the phospho-H1 mutant failed to respond to KCl stimulation (Fig. S3 L). To validate this further, we repeated the experiments with a WT copy of H1-GFP in the presence (or absence) of the phosphorylation inhibitor roscovitine (50 µM). Once again, we found a significant reduction in the dynamic association of H1 with chromatin (Fig. S3 M), suggesting that H1 phosphorylation also plays a key role in mediating its dynamic response to KCl excitation. Altogether, our results demonstrate that H1 PARylation, as well as H1 phosphorylation, both play a role in the hyperdynamic response of H1 to neuronal stimulation.</p><p>The photobleaching experiments measured the dynamic association between chromatin proteins and chromatin in single living cells. To extend and validate these observations biochemically in cell populations, we next checked the chromatin binding of H1 in PMNs using salt extraction assays. We increased salt concentrations (300–450 mM NaCl) to release chromatin proteins from chromatin isolated from PMNs before and after neuronal excitation from WT and <italic>Parp1</italic>-KO cells. Our results showed that in the <italic>Parp1</italic>-KO cells, H1 was largely retained on chromatin after neuronal stimulation compared with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that KCl-induced H1 association with chromatin is regulated, at least in part, by PARP1-mediated PAR.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>PARP1 mediates H1 release from chromatin in stimulated PMNs.</bold> Nuclei were isolated from WT (top) and <italic>Parp1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> (bottom) in both NaCl-treated (left lanes) and KCl-stimulated (right lanes) PMNs and biochemically extracted with increasing salt concentrations (300–450 mM NaCl), as indicated above each lane.

Disruption of neuronal excitatory/inhibitory balance has been associated with several developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, and Rett syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levitt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dani et al., 2005</xref>), but the precise epigenetic molecular mechanisms involved in these cognitive disorders remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we implicate the release of the linker histone H1 as a bridge between neuronal depolarization and chromatin-mediated changes in neuronal gene expression. In particular, we show that PARP1 at least partially regulates depolarization-dependent H1 release and transcription of IEGs. H1 PAR is obviously not the sole mechanism that plays a role in this phenomenon. We also found, for example, that H1 phosphorylation is important for its mobility, and other undiscovered mechanisms likely play additional roles as well.</p></sec><sec id="s09"><title>Depolarization induces linker histone hyperdynamic binding to chromatin</title><p>Previous studies demonstrated that depolarization by KCl induces changes in heterochromatin organization and histone modifications, including acetylation, phosphorylation, PAR, and DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Martinowich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cohen-Armon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Michod et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, MeCP2 undergoes global nuclear reorganization in PMNs after KCl-induced neuronal excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Martinowich et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we extend these observations and show that HP1γ and the heterochromatin-associated histone modification H3K9me3 are also reorganized after depolarization. Based on quantitative imaging and biochemical analysis of endogenous proteins, we found that H1 dynamics on chromatin is exaggerated in depolarized neurons and that this hyperdynamic behavior is prevented when neurons are treated with PARP inhibitors or in <italic>Parp1</italic>-deficient cells. The hyperdynamic nature of H1 binding to chromatin may also contribute to maintaining a more plastic chromatin state in excited neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>PAPR1 mediates KCl-induced H1 dynamic binding to chromatin</title><p>PARP1 is an abundant nuclear protein functioning as a DNA nick-sensor enzyme. Upon binding to DNA breaks, activated PARP1 cleaves NAD<sup>+</sup> into nicotinamide and ADP-ribose and polymerizes the latter onto histones, transcription factors, and PARP1 itself. PARP1 activity can also be induced under physiological conditions in the absence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Quénet et al., 2009</xref>), and PARP1 activation has been shown to be required for long-term memory formation in both <italic>Aplysia</italic> and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cohen-Armon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goldberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hernández et al., 2009</xref>), although the molecular mechanisms involved have not been fully described. Here we show that depolarization provokes an increase in the PAR polymer, and particularly in PAR of histone H1 and of PARP1 itself in depolarized PMNs. Importantly, PARP1 accumulated at IEG promoters after depolarization induced H1 release, a phenomenon which is dependent on PARP1 activity. These results suggest that there is competition between H1 and PARP1 on IEG promoters and that PARP1 activation induces local alterations in chromatin structure through histone H1 PAR and subsequent H1 release. These results explain (and suggest a mechanism for) previous observations showing changes in gene expression in IEGs after depolarization. More broadly, our work raises the prospect that dynamic replacement of histone H1 by PARP1 could play an important role in genome remodeling and transcriptional regulation in the nervous system. Finally, it is also possible that H1 release could have more long-lasting effects on transcriptional regulation. In this respect, H1 release has also been implicated in controlling epigenetic memory and maintenance of active transcriptional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fontán-Lozano et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our results depict a model in which depolarization induces PARP1-mediated H1 PARylation, which in turn facilitates transcription of IEG expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>).
