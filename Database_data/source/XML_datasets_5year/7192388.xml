<abstract>
<p>P5 ATPases are eukaryotic pumps important for cellular metal ion, lipid and protein homeostasis; however, their transported substrate, if any, remains to be identified. Ca<sup>2+</sup> was proposed to act as a ligand of P5 ATPases because it decreases the level of phosphoenzyme of the Spf1p P5A ATPase from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Repeating previous purification protocols, we obtained a purified preparation of Spf1p that was close to homogeneity and exhibited ATP hydrolytic activity that was stimulated by the addition of CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Strikingly, a preparation of a catalytically dead mutant Spf1p (D<sup>487</sup>N) also exhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ATP hydrolytic activity. These results indicated that the Spf1p preparation contained a co-purifying protein capable of hydrolyzing ATP at a high rate. The activity was likely due to a phosphatase, since the protein i) was highly active when pNPP was used as substrate, ii) required Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> for activity, and iii) was strongly inhibited by molybdate, beryllium and other phosphatase substrates. Mass spectrometry identified the phosphatase Pho8p as a contaminant of the Spf1p preparation. Modification of the purification procedure led to a contaminant-free Spf1p preparation that was neither stimulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> nor inhibited by EGTA or molybdate. The phosphoenzyme levels of a contaminant-free Spf1p preparation were not affected by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. These results indicate that the reported effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on Spf1p do not reflect the intrinsic properties of Spf1p but are mediated by the activity of the accompanying phosphatase.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>P5 ATPases are the most intriguing members of the large family of P-type ATPase membrane proteins, which couple ATP hydrolysis with the active transport of ligands across biological membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref001">1</xref>]. The primary sequence of P5 ATPases suggests that they have a molecular architecture similar to that of other P-type ATPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref002">2</xref>]. However, the molecular function and putative transport activity of P5 ATPases remain unknown.</p>
<p>P5 ATPases are ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells and are important for cellular functions associated with the ER, Golgi, vacuolar-endo-lysosomal system, and mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref004">4</xref>]. P5-ATPases have been classified into subgroups P5A and P5B on the basis of differences in their amino acid sequence, in particular that of the transmembrane segment 4, which in other P-ATPases is part of the transport site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref005">5</xref>]. The human genome contains genes encoding one P5A ATPase (ATP13A1) and four P5B ATPases (ATP13A2–A5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref007">7</xref>]. Mutations in the ATP13A2 P5ATPases have been associated with a form of juvenile-onset parkinsonism known as Kufor-Rakeb syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref008">8</xref>], neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref009">9</xref>], and a hereditary form of spastic paraplegia (SPG78) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref010">10</xref>]. Mutations in ATP13A4 have been implicated in language delay and autism spectrum disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref012">12</xref>], and more recently alterations in ATP13A3 have been linked to pulmonary arterial hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref013">13</xref>]. The unicellular eukaryote <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> contains only two P5 ATPases: Spf1p (<underline>S</underline>ensitivity to <underline><italic toggle="yes">P</italic></underline><italic>icchia</italic>
<underline><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></underline><italic>arinosa</italic> killer toxin), a P5A ATPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref014">14</xref>] homologous to human ATP13A1, and Ypk9p, a P5B ATPase. Spf1p is localized in ER membranes and its knockout causes a pleiotropic phenotype characterized by ER stress, glycoprotein processing defects, abnormal protein targeting, alterations in lipid and sterol content and distribution, and the loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref021">21</xref>]. Spf1p is required for virulence of human and plant fungi pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>A distinctive characteristic of P-type ATPases is the coupling of the transport process with the formation and decomposition of an aspartyl-phosphoenzyme (EP) during each transport cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref025">25</xref>]. In agreement with predictions based on the primary amino acid sequences, all P5A ATPases characterized so far have been shown to hydrolyze ATP and to form an EP phosphoenzyme intermediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref028">28</xref>]. While EP formation seems to proceed with Mg<sup>2+</sup> as the only required ion, lower levels of EP were detected in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, an observation that was taken to indicate that Spf1p is possibly regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref027">27</xref>]. Intriguingly, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent EP dephosphorylation did not require the endogenous phosphatase activity of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref026">26</xref>] and the ATPase activity of Spf1p was only marginally affected by Ca<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we investigated the properties of purified recombinant Spf1p and the basis of the reported effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We found that purified preparations of recombinant His-tagged Spf1p contained trace amounts of a phosphatase that possessed highly active metal ion-dependent ATPase and phosphatase activities. The activity of the accompanying phosphatase readily reduced the levels of Spf1p EP. Optimization of the purification procedure caused the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated phosphatase activity to vanish, demonstrating that this activity is not an intrinsic property of the Spf1p enzyme.</p>

<p>The initial expression experiments were performed using <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> strain BY4742 (MATα; his3Δ1; leu2 Δ0; lys2 Δ0; ura3Δ0). We subsequently used the BY4742 knockout strain (MATα; his3Δ1; leu2 Δ0; lys2 Δ0; ura3 Δ0; YEL031w::kanMX4), because the expression levels of Spf1p seemed higher in this strain. Both strains were obtained from Euroscarf. Yeast strains were transformed using the LiAc (lithium acetate) method with plasmids described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref019">19</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref028">28</xref>].</p>

<title>Standard purification of Spf1p</title>
<p>The His-Spf1p and His-Spf1p (D<sup>487</sup>N) proteins were constitutively expressed in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cells as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref028">28</xref>]. Yeast cells were transformed with the pMP625 vector containing a Leu<sup>+</sup> marker, the PMAI promoter, and the cDNA encoding either wild-type His-Spf1p or the His-Spf1p (D<sup>487</sup>N) mutant, both containing a 9XHis tag at the N-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref016">16</xref>]. The growth medium contained 6.7% (w/v) yeast-nitrogen base without amino acids (YNB), 0.67% (w/v) complete supplemented medium minus Leu (Leu−), and 2.2% (w/v) dextrose.</p>
<p>Cells collected from 4 L of culture of yeast expressing Spf1p were lysed in a lysis solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7 at 4°C), 130 mM KCl, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The cell pellet was resuspended in 3 volumes of lysis solution and 4 g of glass beads per gram of yeast. Cells were lysed for 1 minute using a bead beater and then cooled on ice for another minute. This procedure was repeated 30 times. Then, the mixture was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4,080×g at 4°C to remove unbroken cells and the supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100000×g at 4°C to allow membrane precipitation. Total membrane was resuspended in 15 mL of purification buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7 at 4°C), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 130 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, homogenized in a glass homogenizer, and kept at –80°C until purification.</p>
<p>To purify Spf1p, the microsomes were thawed and resuspended in a total volume of 50 mL of purification buffer containing 20 mM MOPS-K (pH 7.4 at 4°C), 20% glycerol, 130 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and solubilized at 4°C for 30 min by adding Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. Insoluble membranes and proteins were removed by ultracentrifugation for 40 min at 100,000×g at 4°C. Then, 10 mM imidazole was added to the supernatant and it was loaded onto a 1 ml Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen) and washed with 90 column volumes of purification buffer containing 0.05% C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>10</sub> and 50 mM imidazole. Finally, the protein was eluted in purification buffer containing 0.005% C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>10</sub> and 150 mM imidazole.</p>

<title>Production of pure Spf1p</title>
<p>Spf1p-His and Spf1p (D<sup>487</sup>N)-His containing 10XHis tags at the C-terminus were obtained using an inducible expression system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref019">19</xref>]. Briefly, yeast cells were transformed with the vector pMP4075 containing a His<sup>+</sup> marker and the cDNA encoding Spf1p under the control of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. The growth medium contained 1.7% (w/v) YNB, 0.67% (w/v) complete supplemented medium minus His (His−), and 2.2% (w/v) dextrose. To induce Spf1p expression, 2 L of cells growing in selective media were pelleted, washed with sterile water, and resuspended in 2 L of induction media containing 2% (w/v) galactose, 1% (w/v) yeast extract, and 2% (w/v) tryptone. Cells were allowed to grow for 20 h at 28°C and then pelleted and stored at –80°C.</p>
<p>The purification started with 2 L of induced yeast culture expressing Spf1p that had been lysed as described above but using lysis solution supplemented with 1 mM EDTA. Microsomes containing Spf1p were washed with this lysis solution and pelleted twice before resuspension in the purification buffer.</p>
<p>The frozen microsomes were solubilized as described above, supplemented with 10 mM imidazole, and loaded onto a 0.5 ml Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen). The column was washed with 50 column volumes of purification buffer containing 0.05% (w/v) C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>10</sub> and 50 mM imidazole plus 50 column volumes of the same solution but with 100 mM imidazole. The protein was eluted in two steps. The first elution with a solution containing 150 mM imidazole contained some Spf1p protein, but still exhibited a low level of contaminant activity. The second elution with 300 mM imidazole contained pure Spf1p and was pooled, aliquoted, and kept in liquid N<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>Protein assay</title>
<p>The Bradford method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref029">29</xref>] was used to estimate the protein concentration during the purification procedure. The final concentration was measured by running aliquots of the purified preparations on a 9% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel according to Laemmli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref030">30</xref>]. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard and the intensity of the Spf1p was compared with the standard after band staining with Coomassie blue.</p>
<p><italic>Western blotting</italic>. Proteins were electrophoresed on a 9% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel according to Laemmli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref030">30</xref>] and subsequently electrotransferred onto Millipore Immobilon P membranes. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the membranes for 2 h in a solution of 1% nonfat milk, 0.05% Teen-20 and 160mM NaCl. The membranes were incubated for 1 h with monoclonal antibody antiPho8p 1D3A10 (Abcam) and for staining biotinylated anti-mouse IgG and avidin-peroxidase conjugate were used.</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>Phosphoenzyme formation</title>
<p>The phosphorylation reaction was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref027">27</xref>]. Briefly, 1.5 μg of purified Spf1p was phosphorylated at 4°C in 0.25 mL reaction buffer containing 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 μM ATP, MgCl<sub>2</sub> to give a concentration of 2 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and CaCl<sub>2</sub> to give a final concentration of 10 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Before phosphorylation, 1.5 μg of Spf1p protein was supplemented with 20 μg of C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>10</sub> and 20 μg of phosphatidylcholine (PC). This suspension was mixed and preincubated for at least 5 min on ice before it was added to the reaction medium. The phosphorylation reaction started with the addition of [γ<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP and was stopped after 15 s with 10% (v/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. The denatured proteins were collected by centrifugation at 20,000×g for 10 min at 4°C and washed once with distilled water. Then, the precipitated protein was suspended in sample buffer and separated by acidic SDS-PAGE. For quantitation, slices of the gel containing the Spf1p EP were cut and the radioactivity measured in a scintillation counter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec009">
<title>ATPase activity</title>
<p>The ATPase activity was estimated at 28°C based on the release of Pi from ATP using the de Baginski method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref031">31</xref>] in a final volume of 0.25 mL of reaction medium containing 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.2 at 28°C), 0.5 mM EGTA, 5 mM N<sub>3</sub>Na, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> to give a final concentration of 2 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 3 mM ATP, and 1 μg of Spf1p in 40 μL of elution buffer. When indicated in the text, ZnCl<sub>2</sub> or CaCl<sub>2</sub> was added to the reaction media to give a final concentration of 1 μM or 10 μM of the free ions, respectively. Prior to the addition to the reaction medium, Spf1p was supplemented with 40 μg of C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>10</sub> and 40 μg of PC, and this mixture was preincubated for 5 min on ice. Then, 50 μL of this mixture was transferred to the reaction medium and the sample was incubated for 5 minutes at 28°C prior to the addition of ATP. The enzymatic reaction was stopped after 30 minutes (or the time point indicated in the figure) by the addition of 250 μL of reagent A (0.5% [w/v] ammonium heptamolybdate and 3% [w/v] ascorbic acid in 0.5 N HCl at 4°C). The resulting mixture was incubated on ice for 20 minutes, after which 500 μL of reagent B (2% [w/v] sodium citrate, 2% [w/v] sodium arsenite, and 2% [v/v] acetic acid) were added and the tubes were incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes. After approximately 20 minutes at room temperature, absorbance was recorded at 850 nm.</p>
<p>The inhibitory effect of phosphatase substrates on the contaminant ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232476.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) was examined at a lower concentration of ATP of 30 μM ATP, closer to that used for the formation of phosphoenzyme. In this case the ATP hydrolysis was estimated as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref027">27</xref>] from the release of <sup>32</sup>P from [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP at 28 °C in a final volume of 0.25 ml of reaction media containing 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.2 at 28°C), 5 mM N<sub>3</sub>Na, 0.5 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 30μM ATP, 1 μg of Spf1p (D<sup>487</sup>N) in 40 μL of elution buffer, and 0.5 mM of CaCl<sub>2</sub> to give a final concentration of 10 μM of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the indicated phosphatase substrates. The enzyme was supplemented with 40 μg of C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>10</sub> and 40 μg of PC and this mixture was then transferred to the reaction media, incubated for 5 minutes at 28°C prior to the addition of ATP to start the reaction. Then, the reaction was stopped after 2 minutes incubation by acid denaturation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>pNPPase activity</title>
<p>The pNPP hydrolysis was measured at 28°C by following the release of p-nitrophenol from p-nitrophenylphosphate as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref032">32</xref>]. The standard mixture used in the pNPP hydrolysis assay was 50 mM Tris-HCl 7.2 at 28°C, 5 mM N<sub>3</sub>Na, and MgCl<sub>2</sub> and EGTA added to give a final concentration of 5 mM and 0.5 mM, respectively. Prior to the addition of the pNPP to the standard mixture, Spf1p was supplemented with C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>10</sub> and PC as indicated to quantify ATPase activity. The reaction was carried out for 20 min and stopped by the addition of 1 mL of 1 M NaOH. The tubes were centrifuged at 19,000×g for 5 min at 4°C and the optical density of the supernatants was determined at 410 nm. Blanks obtained without protein were subtracted from each data point. A molar extinction coefficient of 1.78 × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>− 1</sup>cm<sup>− 1</sup> was used to convert optical density to micromoles of p-nitrophenol released.</p>

<sec id="sec011">
<title>Mass spectrometry</title>
<p>The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue and the colored bands corresponding to Mr 25–116 kDa were cut, destained, and treated with 10 mM DTT for 30 min at room temperature and with 55 mM iodoacetamide in darkness at room temperature. The proteins were digested “in gel” with 25 ng/μL trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) overnight. The sample was loaded in a μZipTip C18 and eluted with a minimal volume of acetonitrile/matrix 10% mg/mL (α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) onto the MALDI target plate. The extracted tryptic peptides were subjected to concerted MALDI TOF TOF in an ABI4800 mass spectrometer and subsequent MS/MS of the fragments. Peptides were identified by searching the mass profiles of Swiss-Prot using the engine MASCOT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.matrixscience.com">http://www.matrixscience.com</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Standard preparations of Spf1p exhibit ATPase activity not related to Spf1p</title>
<p>Recombinant wild-type Spf1p protein and the inactive mutant Spf1p(D<sup>487</sup>N) containing a substitution of the catalytic Asp by Asn were expressed from a constitutive overexpression plasmid in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cells, and purified by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC) as described in “Materials and Methods” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref028">28</xref>]. Both eluates contained mostly a 135-kDa protein on a Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel, which is the expected size for Spf1p, and some bands of higher molecular weight, most likely from partially solubilized Spf1p protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232476.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Faint bands with faster migration were also observed when high amounts of protein were loaded. The functional state of the Spf1p purified by the standard protocol was examined by measuring its ATPase activity in a reaction medium containing 0.5 mM EGTA with or without CaCl<sub>2</sub> to give 10 μM of free Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In the presence of EGTA and the absence of added CaCl<sub>2</sub>, ATP was hydrolyzed at a rate of 0.65 μmol/mg/min <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232476.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The addition of CaCl<sub>2</sub> to the reaction medium increased the ATPase activity near 3.5 fold. The purified preparation of inactive Spf1p (D<sup>487</sup>N) did not show significant ATP hydrolytic activity in the media with EGTA, but unexpectedly in the presence of CaCl<sub>2</sub> it hydrolyzed ATP at a rate of 0.90 μmol/mg/min. Thus, the purified preparation of Spf1p contained a contaminating activity stimulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p>

<title>The standard preparation of Spf1p is contaminated by an alkaline phosphatase</title>
<p>The contaminant present in the standard Spf1p (D<sup>487</sup>N) preparation had maximal ATPase activity in a reaction medium containing only added Mg<sup>2+</sup> and was inhibited by EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232476.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> prevented the inhibition produced by EGTA. Beryllium sulfate and ammonium molybdate, commonly used phosphatase inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref034">34</xref>], were highly effective at inhibiting the ATPase of the Spf1p (D<sup>487</sup>N) preparation. Increasing concentrations of molybdate inhibited the ATPase activity of the Spf1p (D<sup>487</sup>N) preparation following a decreasing hyperbola with K<sub>0.5</sub> ~ 70 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232476.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In agreement with the notion that the contaminant could be a phosphatase rather than an ATPase, the contaminant was highly active when pNPP was used as substrate and this activity was also inhibited by EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232476.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Furthermore, various phosphorylated compounds which have previously shown to be phosphatase substrates appear to inhibit the contaminant ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232476.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).</p>

<p>As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref027">27</xref>], in the standard preparation the level of Spf1p intermediate EP was high when the medium contained EGTA and decreased in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232476.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The decrease in the level of EP in “contaminated” preparations of Spf1p persisted even when the concentration of ATP in the phosphorylation media was increased to 100 μM (not shown), suggesting that the lower level of EP was not the simple consequence of ATP consumption. We next examined EP formation in the presence of molybdate, a phosphatase inhibitor. In this condition, the level of EP in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> increased up to the level observed with EGTA. This result suggested that the EP of Spf1p was dependent on the activity of a contaminating phosphatase.</p>

<title>Mass spectrometry reveals the presence of contaminating proteins</title>
<p>To determine the identity of the proteins co-purifying with Spf1p in the standard preparation, an aliquot of the Spf1p preparation was resolved by SDS-PAGE and portions of the gel corresponding to a molecular weight of between 25 and 116 kDa were cut and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Peptides from eleven different proteins were identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0232476.t001">Table 1</xref>), most of them from membrane-associated proteins with different intracellular localizations. At least five of the identified proteins can hydrolyze ATP. The most abundant protein was Ssa1p, an ATPase involved in protein folding but not reported to be activated by metal ions. Three of them were protein kinases that phosphorylate proteins but do not release Pi (Ck2p, Rtk1p, and Snf1p). The last candidate was Pho8p, a well-characterized alkaline phosphatase that has been reported to dephosphorylate phosphoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref035">35</xref>]. This result suggests that the contaminating activity in standard Spf1p preparations was due to the presence of trace amounts of Pho8p.</p>

<title>Pure Spf1p only exhibits ATPase activity related to Spf1p</title>
<p>To improve the purification procedure, we switched from a constitutive to an inducible expression system, which allowed a higher expression level and a more stringent purification protocol. In addition, we used a variant of Spf1p containing the His tag at its C-terminal end, which was reported to be more efficiently retained by the Ni-NTA column [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref019">19</xref>]. Moreover, in this purification protocol EDTA was added to the lysis buffer, and microsomes were subjected to more extensive washing before detergent extraction. In addition, a pre-elution step with 50–100 mM imidazole was included to remove contaminant proteins, which may bind weakly to the column before eluting Spf1p with 300 mM imidazole. We named the Spf1p obtained by this protocol “pure” Spf1p.</p>
<p>In a reaction medium containing EGTA, the ATPase activities of pure Spf1p and Spf1p (D<sup>487</sup>N) were similar to those observed in the Spf1p preparations obtained using the standard protocol. However, in contrast with the standard Spf1p preparations, Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not increase the activity of pure Spf1p, while the pure Spf1p (D<sup>487</sup>N) showed a marginal ATPase activity in the presence of EGTA, and was not stimulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232476.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Moreover, the ATPase activity of pure Spf1p was unaffected by low concentrations of molybdate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232476.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Notably, the level of EP attained in the pure Spf1p preparation was neither significantly changed by EGTA or Ca<sup>2+</sup>, nor by the addition of molybdate to the phosphorylation media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232476.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Together, these observations indicate that the optimized expression and purification protocol successfully removed the contaminant activity from the Spf1p preparation. In line with this idea, we assessed the Pho8p content of the standard and the pure Spf1p preparations by western blot using a specific anti Pho8p antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232476.g007">Fig 7</xref>, the Pho8p band was only clearly visible in the standard preparation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>On the basis of indirect evidences, previous studies suggested that Ca<sup>2+</sup> may be the substrate transported by yeast Spf1p P5A-ATPase. First, a characteristic phenotype of the <italic>SPF1</italic> knockout mutant is the disruption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and hypersensitivity to external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, reminiscent of the phenotype of a knockout of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> pump <italic>PMR1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref016">16</xref>]. Second, the levels of Spf1p EP were lower when Ca<sup>2+</sup> was added to the phosphorylation media, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> either inhibited the formation of EP or induced Spf1p dephosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref027">27</xref>]. A similar effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was observed on the homologous plant enzyme HvP5A1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref026">26</xref>]. However, at variance with this hypothesis, in some experiments Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not seem to produce a significant stimulation of the Spf1p ATPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref028">28</xref>]. This apparent inconsistency led us to investigate in more detail the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the Spf1p ATPase.</p>
<p>To characterize Spf1p, we overexpressed recombinant Spf1p and then solubilized the protein with detergents and purified it. Other P-type ATPases have been studied using preparations of isolated membrane or even whole cells. The use of these crude preparations was possible either because specific inhibitors were available (i.e., ouabain for the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase or thapsigargin for the SERCA pump), or the transported ion could be easily removed from the reaction medium (using metal chelators). None of these conditions are available for any P5 ATPase and hence it is challenging to distinguish its specific activity from the background activity of other cellular ATP hydrolyzing enzymes.</p>
<p>Previously, we used a standard IMAC purification protocol to obtain a preparation of His-tagged Spf1p that, judging by Coomasie blue staining of SDS-PAGE, was more than 95% pure. Using this preparation, we observed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibited the formation of Spf1p EP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref027">27</xref>]. Here, we report that the standard preparation of Spf1p contains low amounts of a phosphatase that can hydrolyze ATP as well as the EP intermediate of Spf1p. This activity requires divalent cations and is inhibited by EGTA. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the reported effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on Spf1p originate from a contaminating phosphatase activity and not from Spf1p itself. The presence of this contaminant may explain the reported apparent spontaneous dephosphorylation of the plant Spf1p analog HvP5A1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref026">26</xref>]. In contrast the contaminant may not have been detected in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref016">16</xref>] since Spf1p was purified from sucrose fractionated-ER membranes rather than from total yeast microsomes.</p>
<p>Because the contaminant hydrolyzed not only ATP but also non-nucleotide phosphates such as pNPP, and was inhibited by beryllium and molybdate, we tentatively identified the co-purifying contaminant protein as a phosphatase that is also capable of ATP hydrolysis. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that three protein kinases, a chaperone, and the phosphatase Pho8p co-purified with Spf1p. The catalytic properties of the contaminating phosphatase fit with that of the well-characterized Pho8p. Pho8p is a repressible non-specific alkaline phosphatase that can act on a variety of phosphorylated compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref036">36</xref>]. Most strikingly, Pho8p has been reported to dephosphorylate phosphoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref032">32</xref>] and is likely that also acts on protein aspartyl phosphates. It therefore seems that Pho8p is the contaminant we have identified in the standard Spf1p preparation. While, other alkaline phosphatases have been shown to exhibit a Ca-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref037">37</xref>], detailed studies of the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the Pho8p activity are not available at present.</p>
<p>Pho8p is a single transmembrane protein that is initially synthesized in the ER and is glycosylated as it moves from the ER to the Golgi. Finally, Pho8p localizes in the vacuolar membrane where it becomes activated by the removal of a C-terminal inhibitory peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref038">38</xref>]. Pho8p and Spf1p possibly interact during the detergent treatment used to solubilize membrane proteins and co-purify during the Spf1p purification procedure. However, an active soluble Pho8Δ62 truncated form has been described in yeast extracts and hence it may interact with the Spf1p in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>Our results suggest that a small amount of this highly active Pho8p phosphatase is capable of dephosphorylate Spf1 EP. Although at this stage we have no clues about the molecular mechanism involved, it seems interesting to note that a similar effect of acylphosphatase on the EP of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, the plasma membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps has been described, leading to a higher EP turnover and a lower coupling between transport activity and ATP hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0232476.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, the results presented in this paper indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not directly stimulate the activity of Spf1p and the previously reported effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on Spf1p EP reflects the action of an exogenous phosphatase, which may be involved in the regulation of Spf1p.</p>
