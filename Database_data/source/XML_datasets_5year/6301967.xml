<p id="Par1">The availability of genomic data from extinct homini such as Neanderthals has caused a revolution in palaeontology allowing the identification of modern human-specific protein substitutions. Currently, little is known as to how these substitutions alter the proteins on a molecular level. Here, we investigate adenylosuccinate lyase, a conserved enzyme involved in purine metabolism for which several substitutions in the modern human protein (hADSL) have been described to affect intelligence and behaviour. During evolution, modern humans acquired a specific substitution (Ala429Val) in ADSL distinguishing it from the ancestral variant present in Neanderthals (nADSL). We show here that despite this conservative substitution being solvent exposed and located distant from the active site, there is a difference in thermal stability, but not enzymology or ligand binding between nADSL and hADSL. Substitutions near residue 429 which do not profoundly affect enzymology were previously reported to cause neurological symptoms in humans. This study also reveals that ADSL undergoes conformational changes during catalysis which, together with the crystal structure of a hitherto undetermined product bound conformation, explains the molecular origin of disease for several modern human ADSL mutants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par2">Genomic comparisons between modern humans and extinct homini such as Neanderthals recently became possible due to improved methods to extract and sequence ancient DNA samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. These comparisons allow the identification of genetic changes which are specific to modern humans, hence providing insights into the differences distinguishing modern humans from our closest relatives on the tree of Life. Currently, genetic changes in around 90 protein coding regions have been identified as resulting in a stable amino acid substitution in the corresponding protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Despite growing interest in the scientific community, it remains largely unknown which of these modern human specific substitutions are functionally significant and contribute to phenotypical differences between modern humans and Neanderthals. While cellular assays using cells carrying Neanderthal genes are currently being performed and expected to yield exciting results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, studies at the molecular level are missing. Such biophysical and biochemical evaluation could reveal how modern human-specific substitutions affect protein structure and function and would serve as a bridge between the ongoing genetic and cellular studies.</p>
<p id="Par3">This work aims at providing a first step in filling this gap in knowledge by reporting a structural, biochemical and biophysical comparison of modern human and Neanderthal adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL), an enzyme which acquired a single specific substitution (Ala429Val) during modern human evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. While the published genomes from three Neanderthals and one Denisovan all possess the ancestral Ala429 ADSL variant, all available genetic information from present-day humans exhibit exclusively a Val in this position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Of the proteins reported to carry modern human-specific substitutions we selected ADSL because of its medical relevance and its association with intelligence and behaviour. Several missense mutations in the <italic>adsl</italic> gene cause ADSL deficiency, a disease characterised by serious neurological and physiological symptoms such as autism, increased aggression, seizures, microcephaly and muscle wasting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. ADSL is involved in the <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis and recycling pathways in which it catalyses the conversion of 5-aminoimidazole-(N-succinylocarboxamide) (SAICAR) to 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) and the conversion of succinyladenosine monophosphate (SAMP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, respectively. Both reactions are β-eliminations in which fumarate is released. Despite extensive research, the molecular basis on how mutations of the protein cause ADSL deficiency is not always well understood.</p>
<p id="Par4">Here we describe the first crystal structure of a protein from an extinct hominin species and reveal that, similar to the effect of the ADSL deficiency-causing Arg426His substitution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, hADSL has a decreased thermal stability compared to nADSL. This difference is not translated into a measurable alteration in the enzymology of the purified protein, but we propose that the Ala429Val substitution, similar to the Arg426His substitution, affects protein-protein interactions in purinosomes. In addition, this study shows that ADSL domain 3 is conformationally flexible and we present the high resolution molecular structure of a previously unknown product-bound conformation of ADSL. This conformational flexibility is associated with the catalytic cycle and results in the insertion of Arg396 into the active site, thus explaining how the Arg396His and Arg396Cys substitutions cause ADSL deficiency in present-day humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="Sec3">
<title>nADSL has an increased thermal stability as compared to hADSL</title>
<p id="Par5">Inspection of the crystal structure of hADSL shows that residue 429 is solvent-exposed and located distant from the active site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Although one would naturally expect such a substitution not to have large impact on the protein function, some ADSL deficiency-causing substitutions have been reported for solvent exposed residues distant from the ADSL active site. Interestingly, these disease-causing substitutions often affect the protein’s stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In light of this, a comparison of the melting temperatures of modern human and Neanderthal ADSL was carried out. This showed that hADSL has a reduced thermal stability compared to nADSL with melting temperatures of 58 °C and 61 °C for hADSL and nADSL, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>). Although this difference in thermal stability is small, it was consistently measured for different preparations of the two proteins and also observed, notwithstanding the clear effect the buffer composition had on the absolute values of the melting temperature (ranging between 50–66 °C for nADSL and 46–63 °C for hADSL), upon varying the ionic strength (between 0 M and 1 M NaCl) and pH (between pH 5 and 10) of the buffer system. Hence, the data reveal that hADSL has a reduced thermal stability in comparison to its Neanderthal homologue.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Melting curves of nADSL (red) and hADSL (blue) as determined by a thermal shift assay. The melting curves in three different buffer conditions are shown: in the purification buffer (squares), in water (triangles) and in Bicine buffer at pH 9 (circles). In all three buffers hADSL has a reduced thermal stability compared to nADSL.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e344" xlink:href="41598_2018_36195_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>

<title>Structural comparison of nADSL and hADSL</title>
<p id="Par6">To investigate possible structural differences between the two proteins, we determined the crystal structures of nADSL in its apo state and bound with the products AMP and fumarate (AMP/fumarate) at resolutions of 1.7 and 2.3 Å, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>) and compared these with the available hADSL structures deposited in the PDB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par7">The apo structure of nADSL shows an identical tertiary and quaternary structure to that of hADSL, consisting of an all α-helical homotetramer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>) that differs between the two variants with a RMSD (root mean square deviation) between Cα atoms of 0.5 Å. Each protomer within the nADSL and hADSL tetramer can be subdivided into three domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. A central domain 2 (residues 113–364) contains the tetramerisation surface and contributes the catalytic C3-loop (residues 280–300) to the active site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The active site itself is formed by residues from all three domains with each domain originating from a different protomer of the tetramer. Domain 1 (residues 22–112) and domain 2 form the base and one side of the active site thus creating a binding cleft for the substrate, while domain 3 (residues 365–450) resembles a lid which sits on top of the active site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>). It is within this lid domain where the Ala429Val substitution distinguishing nADSL from hADSL is located. This residue is positioned near the end of a first α-helix of a helix-turn-helix motif on the tip of domain 3 and has its side chain solvent exposed. Structurally, domain 3 is the region which displays most of the structural differences between the apo forms of nADSL and hADSL when overlaying the tetrameric structures. However, this difference originates from small rigid body movements (of less than 1 Å) of the complete domain which can also be seen when overlaying the different protomers of nADSL (or hADSL) separately. A superposition of the separate domains 3 of nADSL and hADSL shows that the Ala429Val substitution has no effect on the local structure nor does it influence the local hydrogen bond networks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Structural evaluation of nADSL by X-ray crystallography.

<p id="Par8">Comparison of the apo structures of nADSL and hADSL with their respective AMP/fumarate bound ternary complexes reveals few structural changes upon product binding. The most prominent difference can be found in the active sites with some residues involved in product binding being reoriented. Additionally, a small movement of domain 1 and domain 3 towards the active site is observed. Nonetheless, the overall structures are very similar with an RMSD between Cα atoms of 1.0 Å for the hADSL structures and 1.2 Å for the nADSL structures, and, as also seen for the apo structures, no significant structural differences could be detected between the two AMP/fumarate bound structures.</p>

<sec id="Sec5">
<title>A new conformation of ADSL</title>
<p id="Par9">Co-crystallisation of nADSL with its other products AICAR and fumarate (AICAR/fumarate) yielded a different crystal form than seen for the apo and AMP/fumarate bound crystals (Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). In this new crystal form, two nADSL tetramers are present in the asymmetric unit (tetramer ABCD and tetramer EFGH) in contrast to the single tetramer present in the apo and AMP/fumarate bound structures. Overlay of the different tetramers shows a clear difference in the position of domain 3 between the apo crystal structure and some, but not all, of the protomers of the AICAR/fumarate bound structure (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). More specifically, domain 3 is tilted by around 20–25° towards the active site in two protomers of tetramer EFGH (chains G and F) and in one protomer of tetramer ABCD (chain D). As such, it appears that this domain has closed over the active site in these protomers. A closer inspection reveals a small difference in the position of domain 3 between chains G and F with one of them being tilted slightly further towards the active site (chain G). As such, the conformation of domain 3 in the G chain will be referred to as the ‘closed conformation’ in the remainder of the text while the conformation in chain F will be referred to as the ‘semi-closed conformation’. In tetramer ABCD, domain 3 is shifted towards the active site in only one of the protomers (chain D) which, notwithstanding the fact that not all of the electron density is well defined for this domain, mostly resembles the fully closed conformation.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Conformational change of domain 3 in the AICAR/fumarate bound nADSL structure. (<bold>a</bold>) Detail of domain 3 in the open (cyan) and closed (dark blue) conformation. (<bold>b</bold>,<bold>c</bold>) Electron density maps (2F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub>) contoured at 1σ level showing domain 3 in the open (<bold>b</bold>) and closed (<bold>c</bold>) conformation. The location of Ala429 and the hinge points for the domain movement (Leu377 and Phe449) are indicated.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e444" xlink:href="41598_2018_36195_Fig3_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par10">The closed and semi-closed domain 3 conformations have not been previously reported for ADSL and therefore no structure of hADSL in these conformations (nor bound to AICAR/fumarate) is available for comparison. However, since domain 3 closure occurs through a rigid body movement involving two hinge points near its N- and C-terminus (Leu377 and Phe449), the central region of the domain (including residue 429) is structurally identical in all three conformations (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>). Thus, in case hADSL also adopts the closed and semi-closed conformation no structural difference would be expected between nADSL and hADSL in these conformations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec6">
<title>ADSL undergoes conformational changes during catalysis</title>
<p id="Par11">To evaluate whether this conformational change is specific for nADSL or also shared by hADSL, we collected Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) data from both nADSL and hADSL in their apo and product bound states (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). Here, the SAXS curves of the apo state of both proteins clearly deviates from those of the AMP/fumarate and AICAR/fumarate bound proteins indicating that both variants undergo a conformational change upon binding of the products (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b,c</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Structural comparison of nADSL and hADSL by small angle X-ray scattering. (<bold>a</bold>) Comparison of the Guinier region and pair distance distribution function (inlet) of apo nADSL (red) and apo hADSL (blue) SAXS data. The residuals to the linear fit of the Guinier function are shown below. (<bold>b</bold>,<bold>c</bold>) Overlay of the SAXS curves from apo (grey), AMP bound (green), AMP/fumarate bound (red) and AICAR/fumarate bound (blue) nADSL (<bold>b</bold>) and hADSL (<bold>c</bold>).

(<bold>e</bold>) Overlay of the experimental SAXS curve of AICAR/fumarate bound nADSL (grey) with the calculated SAXS curve from tetramer EFGH of the AICAR/fumarate bound nADSL crystal structure (green). For comparison, the calculated SAXS curve from the apo nADSL crystal structure is shown in orange. (<bold>f</bold>) Detail of the overlaid 0.8 nm<sup>−1</sup> &lt; q &lt; 1.7 nm<sup>−1</sup> region of the scatter curves of AMP/fumarate bound nADSL (red) and hADSL (blue). The residuals to the fit of panel d-f are shown below.</p></caption><graphic id="d29e506" xlink:href="41598_2018_36195_Fig4_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par12">The SAXS curves from apo nADSL and hADSL are identical and fit well the theoretically calculated curves from the corresponding apo crystal structures (for q-values between 0.07 nm<sup>−1</sup> and 4 nm<sup>−1</sup>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a–d</xref>). Hence, consistent with the results obtained by the structural comparison, nADSL and hADSL have an identical in-solution molecular structure in their apo state which is well described by their respective crystal structures. Also the presence of products AMP or AICAR alone does not alter the scattering curves for either nADSL or hADSL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b,c</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par13">In contrast, addition of both AMP/fumarate or AICAR/fumarate to the protein results in a similar altered scattering curve compared to that of the apo proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b,c</xref>). Hence, both hADSL and nADSL adopt an identical in-solution conformation in the presence of AMP/fumarate and AICAR/fumarate despite the clear difference in the domain 3 orientation between the AMP/fumarate bound and AICAR/fumarate bound nADSL crystal structures. This product bound conformation most closely resembles the conformation of tetramer EFGH of the AICAR/fumarate bound nADSL structure (<italic>i.e</italic>. with two domains 3 in the tetramer closed over their corresponding active sites). This is evident from the theoretically calculated SAXS curve from the nADSL tetramer EFGH structure which better fits (for q-values between 0.07 nm<sup>−1</sup> and 4 nm<sup>−1</sup>) the experimental SAXS curve than calculated SAXS curves derived from either tetramer ABCD or apo nADSL structures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>). Our SAXS analyses thus show that product binding to ADSL results in the closure of domain 3 as seen in the AICAR/fumarate bound nADSL structure and that the open domain 3 conformation of the AMP/fumarate bound hADSL and nADSL structures reflects a crystallisation artefact (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par14">The observation that domain 3 is conformationally flexible raises the question whether this conformational change is related to catalysis (and already occurs upon substrate binding) or is associated with product release only. To evaluate this, SAXS data were collected for the inactive nADSL mutant His159Asn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> in presence of substrate SAMP. The observed scattering curve is identical to that obtained from the AMP/fumarate bound protein showing that domain 3 closes upon substrate binding and remains closed during catalysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par15">Comparison of the scattering curves of nADSL and hADSL reveals a small but reproducible difference (in the 1 to 1.5 nm<sup>−1</sup> q-range) in the AMP/fumarate (and AICAR/fumarate) bound states (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4f</xref>). Interestingly, this difference is absent in the apo, AMP and AICAR bound SAXS curves. Thus, SAXS analysis reveals a structural difference between nADSL and hADSL that manifests itself only in the product bound state (<italic>i.e</italic>. in the closed and/or semi-closed conformation). Given that the crystal structures of nADSL and hADSL do not reveal any overall structural difference, we propose this difference to be attributed to a change in the dynamics of domain 3 closure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec7">
<title>Enzyme kinetics and product binding of hADSL and nADSL</title>
<p id="Par16">To determine whether the Ala429Val substitution has an effect on the enzyme kinetics of ADSL, both the forward (breakdown of SAMP into AMP/fumarate) and reverse (production of SAMP from AMP/fumarate) catalytic reactions of nADSL and hADSL were analysed by monitoring the change in absorbance at λ = 282 nm caused by the conversion of SAMP into AMP. Both proteins display positive cooperativity for the forward reaction with similar kinetic parameters (K<sub>0.5</sub> of 1.1 µM for both proteins, Hill coefficients of 1.6 and 1.8, and V<sub>max</sub> of 11.5 and 11.3 µmol min<sup>−1</sup> mg<sup>−1</sup> for hADSL and nADSL, respectively; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). These values are in agreement with previously reported kinetic data for hADSL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. For the reverse catalytic reaction no data on the hADSL enzyme have been reported to date.

<title>Molecular effect of disease-causing substitutions on domain 3</title>
<p id="Par18">As described above, the Ala429Val substitution is located on domain 3 with its side chain solvent exposed. As such, one would not expect the protein’s enzymology to be affected by the substitution. However, several other substitutions on domain 3 have been reported to cause ADSL deficiency showing that substitutions on this domain can alter the human phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. To further evaluate this, a comparative analysis of the Ala429Val substitution with three described hADSL deficiency-causing substitutions on domain 3 (Arg396Cys, Asp422Tyr and Arg426His) was performed. Of these substitutions, two (Asp422 and Arg426) are located on the same α-helix as Val429 and also have their side chains solvent exposed. The Arg396 residue on the other hand is located on the opposite side of domain 3 and protrudes into the active site upon domain 3 closure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>).</p>
<p id="Par19">In agreement with previous studies, substitution of the Arg396 residue causes a drastic decrease in the enzymatic activity and abolishes the enzyme’s cooperativity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The loss in activity is not caused by structural instability of the protein as thermal shift assays show that the Arg396His mutant is as stable as native hADSL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>). This residue was previously proposed to be implicated in substrate channelling based on its location<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, given that Arg396 is inserted in the active site upon domain 3 closure it is more likely that this residue has a direct role in catalysis.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Enzyme kinetics and thermal stability of hADSL disease-causing variants with substitutions in domain 3.

<p id="Par20">The Asp422Tyr substitution has a large impact on both the enzymatic activity and thermal stability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>). With this residue located far from the active site and not participating in substrate/product binding nor the catalytic reaction itself, the decrease in enzymatic activity of this mutant can be directly related to its reduced stability.</p>
<p id="Par21">Finally, the Arg426His substitution shows a decreased thermal stability of 5 °C, which is comparable to the effect of the Asp422Tyr substitution. However, the Arg426His substitution retains almost 80% of the native hADSL activity, more than twice that of the Asp422Tyr variant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>). This is reminiscent of the behaviour observed for the Ala429Val substitution: a decreased thermal stability without a large impact on the enzymatic activity. Since the Arg426His substitution causes the severe form of ADSL deficiency despite its limited effect on activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> this implies both that the impact of an ADSL substitution on the human phenotype cannot be directly assumed from its effect on the enzyme’s activity and that surface exposed residues on domain 3 can have a functional role which is not directly related to enzymatic activity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par22">Human adenylosuccinate lyase is a well-studied protein for which several mutations have been described to cause ADSL deficiency, a disease characterised by profound psychomotor retardation and currently without an effective therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Even though crystal structures of hADSL are available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, questions related to its molecular mechanism and how certain mutations cause disease have remained open. Based on the high structural similarity between the apo and product bound hADSL structures, no large structural movements were expected during catalysis. However, our work now shows that hADSL does undergo conformational changes upon substrate (SAMP or SACAR) binding in the form of a closure of domain 3 over the active site. Following catalysis and release of the product fumarate, ADSL returns to its open conformation allowing the dissociation of the products AMP or AICAR and thus freeing the active site for another round of catalysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7a</xref>). This organized opening of domain 3 only after dissociation of fumarate explains the preferential sequential product release observed in ADSL, which releases fumarate prior to AMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In this scheme, AMP is only able to exit the active site after domain 3 has returned to its open conformation. The linkage between product binding and domain 3 movement implies communication between the active site and domain 3. However, a comparison of the crystal structures presented here does not show a readily identifiable network between the two regions. In fact, the conformation of all residues linking them, apart from those interacting directly with the ligands, remain unaltered in the open, semi-closed and closed conformations. A dynamic equilibrium between the different domain 3 conformations in solution can however be expected based on the high atomic B-factors of the domain. Here, the open conformation would be favoured in absence of products (or substrates), while the closed conformation is favoured in the product bound state. Product binding causes domain 1 to move closer towards the active site due to direct interactions with both AMP and fumarate. In this orientation, the enthalpy gain of interacting with domain 3 could overcome the entropy cost associated with locking domain 3 in the semi-closed or closed conformation. Correspondingly, dissociation of fumarate from the active site and consequential loss of its interactions with domain 1 would push the equilibrium back to the entropically preferred open domain 3 conformation.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the conformational changes ADSL undergoes during catalysis (<bold>a</bold>). The domain 2 of the ADSL tetramer is represented as a yellow box while domain 1 and 3 are shown as green and blue boxes, respectively.

<p id="Par23">The AICAR/fumarate bound nADSL structure detailed here represents the first high-resolution model of a hominin ADSL protein with domain 3 in a semi-closed or closed conformation. This structure clearly explains why the Arg396His and Arg396Cys mutations abolish enzymatic cooperativity and cause disease in humans. In the hADSL crystal structures, with all domains 3 in the open conformation, Arg396 is located on the tip of domain 3 distant from the active site and was therefore reported to be involved in substrate channelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, in the AICAR/fumarate bound nADSL structure, Arg396 is inserted into the active site and forms part of a hydrogen bond network involving residues from domain 1 in the semi-closed conformation and the catalytic C3-loop (belonging to domain 2) in the fully closed conformation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7b–d</xref>). We propose that these interactions are at the origin of the communication between the different active sites in the ADSL tetramer, thus permitting cooperativity. The formation of the H-bond networks would be impaired by the ADSL deficiency-causing Arg396His and Arg396Cys substitutions, thus explaining why these substitutions destroy cooperativity. In addition, domain 3 closure directly contributes to the enzymatic reaction by structuring the catalytic C3-loop though an H-bond network involving domain 3 residues Arg396, His400 and Arg404. Indeed, electron density for the C3-loop is only clearly defined in the protomers of the AICAR/fumarate bound nADSL structure where domain 3 adopts the closed or semi-closed conformation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8a</xref>). In contrast, hADSL and nADSL crystal structures in which domain 3 is in the open conformation show ill-defined electron density caused by a highly flexible C3-loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. It is interesting to note that in the AICAR/ fumarate bound crystal structure, the products AICAR and fumarate are only found in the active sites in which domain 3 is locked in its closed conformation. In those active sites in which the domain adopts the semi-closed or open conformation, the reverse enzymatic reaction appeared to have occurred in the crystals since they all have substrate SAICAR bound (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>). Taken together, these results show that domain 3 movement is closely associated with the ADSL enzymology and likely the main actor in regulating the enzymatic cooperativity. Therefore, the human disease-causing substitutions Arg374Trp, Ser447Pro, Thr450Ser and Arg452Pro, which are all located near the hinge points (Leu377 and Phe449), can be explained by affecting domain 3 movement.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Detail of active site of ADSL.

<p id="Par24">The presence of a structured catalytic C3-loop in the crystal structure of AICAR/fumarate bound nADSL allows for the evaluation of the active site in a conformation primed for catalysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8a</xref>). ADSL was proposed to utilise a general acid-base mechanism for catalysis based on structural data and kinetic studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Ser289 was identified as the catalytic base which initiates the reaction by abstracting a proton from the succinyl moiety of the substrate. His159 would then act as catalytic acid which protonates the substrate at either the N1 or N6 position facilitating bond cleavage. In contrast to His159, which is optimally positioned to function as the catalytic acid, the location of Ser289 in the AICAR/fumarate bound nADSL structure raises questions on its role as catalytic base. Not only has the residue no direct interaction with the fumarate moiety, its sidechain is orientated away for the carboxyl groups of fumarate at a distance of more than 3.5 Å. In contrast, the adjacent Ser290 residue directly H-bonds with the carboxyl group of fumarate thus being more favourable situated to act as catalytic base. The Ser290 residue would nonetheless need to be primed to be able to abstract a proton from the substrate. This role could be performed by Arg396 and/or His400 since in the closed domain 3 conformation these domain 3 residues H-bonds with the carboxyl backbones of Ser290 and Ser289 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8a</xref>). As such these H-bonds would not only serve to structure the catalytic C3-loop but also lower the pKa of Ser290 (or Ser289) allowing it to act as catalytic base.</p>
<p id="Par25">ADSL was shown to be more efficient in the binding and catalytic breakdown of SAICAR than SAMP. An overlay of SAMP and SAICAR bound active sites of nADSL shows that the location of both substrates in the active site is largely identical (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8b</xref>). Ray <italic>et al</italic>. suggested, based on isothermal titration calorimetry assays, this difference in affinity to originate from an addition H-bond between SAICAR and the protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The structures however show no additional H-bonds between the protein and SAICAR. The difference in affinity between both substrates can be caused by the less stressed binding of SAICAR. Indeed the position of the bond between the succinyl and AMP/AICAR moieties is different between SAICAR and SAMP due to the planarity of the adenine ring of SAMP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8b</xref>). The difference in catalytic activity for both substrates was previously suggested to originate from a difference in utilised reaction mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. SAICAR, in contrast to SAMP, can delocalise the negative charged originating from the deprotonation of the succinyl moiety to its carbonyl O6 atom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Here, Arg329 would be well positioned to stabilise the negative charge, hence lowering the activation energy for the reaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8b</xref>). Since SAMP does not possess a carbonyl group at this position, a similar stabilisation of the transition state by Arg329 is impossible. Interestingly, the disease-causing Arg303Cys substitution disproportionately disturbs the breakdown of SAMP compared to SAICAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This residue interacts with the phosphate group of the substrates and is located distant from the site distinguishing SAICAR from SAMP. Together with the identical interaction of this arginine residue with SAMP and SAICAR a direct influence on catalysis seems unlikely (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8b</xref>). This observation thus supports the hypothesis that the difference in catalytic efficiency is caused by the combined effect of a lower binding affinity for the substrates with a more efficient SAICAR catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Here, most substrates would rapidly dissociate from the active site of the Arg303Cys variant after binding due to the loss of interaction of the arginine residue with the phosphate group of the substrates. Since the breakdown of SAICAR is more efficient than that of SAMP, this rapid binding equilibrium would disproportionately impact the catalysis of SAMP compared to SAICAR.</p>
<p id="Par26">Adenylosuccinate lyase is one of few proteins known to have acquired a fixed substitution in modern humans during homini evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The study presented here was initially aimed at determining whether this Ala429Val substitution functionally affects ADSL. Even though we show that enzyme kinetics and product binding are unchanged, this does not exclude that the Ala429Val substitution affects purine metabolism in a cellular environment. In human cells grown under purine limited conditions, ADSL forms part of a transient protein complex called the purinosome which includes all six enzymes of the <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis pathway and whose formation is suggested to increase the purine biosynthesis rate by improved substrate channelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In this tightly organized arrangement, even subtle variations in individual proteins could affect the purine biosynthesis as a whole. Indeed, ADSL deficiency-causing mutations which decrease hADSL stability, like Arg426His, were shown to negatively impact the purinosome assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. This impaired purinosome assembly is likely the main contributor to the severe phenotypical effect the Arg426His substitution has on humans considering its rather limited effect on the enzymatic activity of the purified protein alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>). The latter also clearly indicates that the impact of an ADSL substitution on the human phenotype cannot be directly correlated from its effect on the enzymatic activity. Considering the Arg426His substitution affects purinosome assembly it can be speculated that this region of ADSL is involved in protein-protein interactions in the purinosome and that other substitutions in the region, like Ala429Val, can similarly affect purinosome assembly. Unfortunately however, our current knowledge on the purinosome is limited and both the exact nature of ADSL binding partners as well as their binding surface on the ADSL tetramer remain to be determined. It is however noteworthy that certain <italic>Archaea</italic> lack both the helix-turn-helix motif on which Arg426 and Val429 is located in their ADSL homologue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and the downstream protein in the <italic>de novo</italic> purine biosynthesis pathway, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (ATIC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, suggesting that the former helix-turn-helix motif is the binding site for ATIC. A role for this helix-turn-helix motif as recognition element for binding partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and a direct interaction between ADSL and ATIC has already previously been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Thus, taking together with previous work, our data hints towards an effect of the Ala429Val substitution on purinosome assembly and suggests the substitution could affect the human phenotype. Additional studies, in particular cellular or mice assays, are required to validate this hypothesis.</p>
<p id="Par27">Although the Arg426His and Ala429Val substitution both affect ADSL stability, the molecular origin of this effect is different. The side chain of Arg426His forms H-bonds with residues from the second helix of the helix-turn-helix motif, thus directly stabilising the motif. The molecular origin of the reduced thermal stability of the Ala429Val substitution is less obvious, but can be caused by differences in the hydration shell around domain 3 or by an altered entropy of unfolding. Recently, a difference in the thermal stability of adenylate kinase by glycine substitutions of surface exposed alanine and valine residues located distant from the active site was observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. These substitutions were suggested to entropically affect the dynamics of local unfolding of the domain they are located on and were shown to impact the enzymatic parameters. Therefore, glycine substitutions of surface exposed residues distant from the active site were suggested to be used to fine-tune the enzymatic parameters of protein homologues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Interestingly, these substitutions are commonly found in regions or domains whose mobility is necessary for catalysis. In this, it reflects the ADSL Ala429Val substitution. An effect of the Ala429Val substitution on the dynamics of domain 3 would also be consistent with the observed difference in SAXS curve between the product (AMP/fumarate) bound proteins.</p>
<p id="Par28">The biophysical and biochemical analysis presented here of an enzyme that differ between modern humans and extinct homini fits well in a synergetic approach, in combination with genetic data and <italic>in vivo/in cellulo</italic> studies, to study the impact of these proteins on the human evolution. The current study shows that genetic data and predictions alone are not always sufficient to evaluate the effect of a substitution. Here, a conservative Ala/Val substitution of a solvent exposed residue distant from the active site was investigated. No large effect would be expected from such a substitution, yet our experimental results reveal an altered thermal stability. The hypothesis that this substitution, like the nearby disease-causing Arg426His substitution, can affect the human phenotype through its involvement in purinosome assembly can act as a starting point to design cellular studies. Hence, a multi-disciplinary approach can aid in evaluating the effect protein substitutions have on the human phenotype and hominin evolution.</p>

The expression and purification protocol was adapted from the protocol described in Lee &amp; Colman, 2006<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In short, the ADSL gene containing pET-14b vector was transformed in <italic>E. coli</italic> Rosetta2 (DE3) cells which were grown at 37 °C in Luria Broth media till an optical density at λ = 600 nm of 0.6 was reached. At this point the temperature was reduced to 20 °C and protein overexpression was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Following overnight overexpression, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mM imidazole, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM ß-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with protease inhibitors, DNase I and lysozyme. The bacterial cells were lysed by sonication and the lysate cleared by centrifugation. Subsequently, the histidine tagged ADSL protein was purified from the lysate by immobilised metal affinity chromatography using a 5 ml GE Healthcare HisTrap HP column. Following a wash step using buffer A supplemented with 50 mM imidazole, elution of the ADSL protein from the column was accomplished by running a gradient towards buffer A supplemented with 500 mM imidazole. Fractions containing pure ADSL (as determined by SDS-PAGE) were pooled and thrombin at 10 units/mg ADSL was added to the mixture in order to remove the N-terminal Histidine tag. The sample was dialysed overnight against 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. After overnight thrombine cleavage, the thrombin and uncleaved ADSL proteins were removed by Histrap HP and benzamidine-sepharose (GE Healthcare) affinity columns. The flow-through of these columns was concentrated and applied on a Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) size exclusion chromatography column run in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT. ADSL eluted as a single peak at an elution volume corresponding to the molecular weight of an ADSL tetramer. Fractions corresponding to this peak were pooled, concentrated and stored at −20 °C.</p>

<title>Small angle X-ray scattering data analysis</title>
<p id="Par36">All SAXS data were collected in batch at 20 °C on beam line BM29 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) using the sample changer robot and PILATUS 1 M detector (Dectris) at a distance of 2.864 m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The X-ray beam energy was 12.5 keV and the beam size 700 × 700 <italic>μ</italic>m<sup>2</sup>. Ten frames with an exposure time of each one second were collected, normalized to absolute values and averaged starting from a 50 µL sample at 5 mg/mL. Initial data quality assessment, data reduction and buffer subtraction was performed by BioSAXS EDNA and monitored using BsxCuBE and ISPyB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. In this set-up no signs of radiation damage were detected. Varying the ADSL concentration (between 10 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL) did not result in shifts in the low q-range indicating no interparticle interference or other concentration dependent effects occurred during data collection. For the product bound scatter curves of nADLS and hADSL, a final concentration of 1 mM product(s) was added to the sample. To confirm the difference seen between the scatter curves of AMP/fumarate bound nADSL and hADSL (and increase the signal/noise ratio), SAXS data collection on these samples was repeated in triplicate, collecting each time 15 frames on a sample of 50 µL. The data of all collected SAXS curves was of sufficient quality for further data analysis as determined by Guinier analysis and the pairwise distribution function calculated using the PRIMUS and GNOME programs available within the ATSAS software package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. The calculation and fitting of the theoretical SAXS curve from the different crystal structures with the experimentally collected SAXS curves (between a q-range of 0.07 nm<sup>−1</sup> and 4 nm<sup>−1</sup>) was performed by the CRYSOL program and included a constant subtraction to remove systematic errors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. The obtained Chi2 values were 9.4 for the fit of the calculated SAXS curve from the apo nADSL structure with the experimental SAXS curve of apo nADSL, and 3.2 for the fit of the calculated SAXS curve from tetramer EFGH of the AICAR/fumarate bound nADSL structure with its experimental SAXS curve. For comparison, the fit of the calculated SAXS curve from the apo nADSL structure with the experimental AICAR/fumarate nADSL curve yielded a Chi<sup>2</sup> value of 44.9.</p>

<title>Enzymatic activity assay</title>
<p id="Par37">The enzymatic assay was performed as described in Ray <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In short, the conversion of SAMP into AMP and fumarate was monitored at room temperature by following the decrease in absorbance at λ = 282 nm in a 500 µL quartz cuvette on a UV-2401PC UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). The experiment was repeated in triplicate for each ADSL variant. The final protein concentration in the cuvette was 0.01 mg/mL for all ADSL variants except for the hADSL R396C mutant where a concentration of 0.02 mg/mL was used. The SAMP concentrations were varied between 11.25 and 0.35 µM. Each reaction was followed for 60 seconds and the difference in extinction coefficient (of 10,000 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup>) between SAMP and AMP at λ = 282 nm was used to calculate the specific ADSL activity at each SAMP concentration. Kinetic parameters of the forward reaction were calculated by fitting the initial velocity data to a cooperative enzymatic model (v = V<sub>max</sub>* S<sup>h</sup>/(K<sub>0.5</sub><sup>h</sup> + S<sup>h</sup>)) in which v is the initial catalytic velocity, V<sub>max</sub> is the maximal catalytic velocity, S is the substrate (SAMP) concentration, K<sub>0.5</sub> is the substrate concentration yielding half the V<sub>max</sub> and h the Hill coefficient. The overall set up for the assay monitoring the reverse enzymatic reaction was identical as for the forward reaction with the exception that 1 mM AMP was added to the protein solution prior to performing the assay. The reverse enzymatic reaction was followed by varying the fumarate concentration between 375 and 6.6 µM and the kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting the initial velocity data to the Michaelis-Menten equation.</p>

<title>Isothermal titration calorimetry</title>
<p id="Par38">ITC experiments were performed in triplicate with a MicroCal ITC200 Instrument (GE Healthcare). The product AMP at a concentration of 1 mM (solubilised in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) was titrated into the cell containing 90 µM hADSL or nADSL at 20 °C. For each experiment a preliminary 1 μL injection (not included in data analysis) was followed by 20 injections of 2 μL each at a stirring speed of 800 rpm and in intervals of 180 seconds. The data were fitted using MicroCal Origin version 7.0. A blank measurement in which AMP was titrated into the cell containing only buffer displayed a very low heat of dilution for AMP and no apparent binding signal (Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>).</p>
