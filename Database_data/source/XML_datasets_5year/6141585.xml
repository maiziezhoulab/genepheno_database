<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="Par1">Emerging evidence indicates that microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are implicated in synaptic function; in particular, mice deficient for MAP6 exhibit striking deficits in plasticity and cognition. How MAP6 connects to plasticity mechanisms is unclear. Here, we address the possible role of this protein in dendritic spines. We find that in MAP6-deficient cortical and hippocampal neurons, maintenance of mature spines is impaired, and can be restored by expressing a stretch of the MAP6 sequence called Mc modules. Mc modules directly bind actin filaments and mediate activity-dependent stabilisation of F-actin in dendritic spines, a key event of synaptic plasticity. In vitro, Mc modules enhance actin filament nucleation and promote the formation of stable, highly ordered filament bundles. Activity-induced phosphorylation of MAP6 likely controls its transfer to the spine cytoskeleton. These results provide a molecular explanation for the role of MAP6 in cognition, enlightening the connection between cytoskeletal dysfunction, synaptic impairment and neuropsychiatric illnesses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="Par3">Dendritic spines, the neuronal membrane protrusions that form the post-synaptic part of most excitatory synapses in the adult mammalian brain, can display both striking structural flexibility and remarkable persistence. These features have long been known to depend on the spine actin cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Dendritic spines are rich in actin, and remodelling of spine actin networks is known to drive structural modifications associated with synaptic plasticity, such as the expansion of spine volume that accompanies activity-induced increases in synaptic efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Spines contain different pools of actin filaments, displaying distinct dynamics, with sub-membrane foci of dynamic filaments likely providing the mechanical force needed for spine expansion, whereas the much more stable polymeric actin accumulated in the spine core seems to be required for stabilising large mature “memory” spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The molecular mechanisms that drive these dynamics remain incompletely defined. In addition to actin, the role of dendritic microtubules in plasticity events was also highlighted with the discovery of their transient entrance in spines during synaptic activity, in tight correlation with an increase in actin polymerisation and spine enlargement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Proteins associated with microtubule ends, such as EB3, interact with elements of the post-synaptic machinery, several of which are known to regulate actin dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>; how such interactions contribute to spine plasticity remains unclear. The question arises whether other microtubule-associated factors might control aspects of the spine actin cytoskeleton.</p>
<p id="Par4">The neuronal MAPs (microtubule associated proteins) including MAP1B, MAP2, Tau and MAP6 are attractive candidates in this regard. Long overlooked as mono-functional proteins controlling microtubule properties, MAPs have been recently shown to interact with actin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. MAPs exist at synapses and MAP-deficient animals exhibit various synaptic defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In particular, MAP6 KO (also known as STOP KO) mice display severe behavioural and cognitive deficits, associated with strong impairments in both short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. MAP6 is known to bind and stabilise microtubules (MTs) through two types of MT-binding sequence elements: the so-called Mc modules (1 to 6 modules depending on species) that confer protection against MT disassembly at low temperature, and the Mn modules (3 modules) that convey resistance to both cold-induced and nocodazole-induced disassembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Importantly, it was shown that CaMKII phosphorylation of MAP6 induced its relocalization from MTs toward actin-rich domains in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. MAP6 has been detected by immunostaining in synaptic compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and also found in several analyses of the post-synaptic proteome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Here, we investigate the possible participation of MAP6 in the regulation of the dendritic spine cytoskeleton. Using MAP6 KO mice, we show that MAP6 is involved in the formation and the maintenance of mature post-synaptic spines, and that this novel aspect of MAP6 function relies on the Mc modules. While at physiological temperature Mc modules are unable to bind microtubules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, we find that they can bind actin filaments. Further, we show that, in dendritic spines, Mc modules mediate actin stabilisation in response to neuronal activation, a key event of synaptic plasticity. Finally, we study the interaction of Mc modules with actin, using purified proteins in a range of in vitro assays. We show that Mc modules do not affect the actin polymerisation rate but enhance filament nucleation, protect existing filaments against depolymerisation, act on filament conformation, and organise stable filament bundles in an ordered fashion. Altogether our findings indicate that MAP6 and the specific type of actin rearrangements it promotes are needed for proper maturation and plasticity-related modifications of excitatory synapses. These results also provide a molecular explanation for the crucial role of MAP6 in cognitive abilities.</p>

<title>A role for MAP6 in spine maturation and maintenance</title>
<p id="Par5">To visualise dendritic spines in MAP6-deficient neurons in vivo, MAP6 KO mice were cross-bred with <italic>Thy1-</italic>eYFP-H transgenic mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Transgenic MAP6 KO offspring animals expressed yellow fluorescent protein in layer 5 cortical neurons, as did transgenic MAP6<sup>+/+</sup> controls. Dendritic spine density and morphology were analysed in brain sections from these mice, using confocal microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1a</xref>). MAP6 KO neurons displayed significantly fewer dendritic spines than WT neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1b</xref>; 1.18 ± 0.04 and 0.91 ± 0.04 spines/µm for WT and MAP6 KO neurons, respectively). Similar results were obtained in cultured hippocampal MAP6 KO or WT neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1d</xref>), and in WT neurons transfected with MAP6-targeting siRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> or scrambled control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1g</xref>). MAP6 KO neurons exhibited a reduced density of dendritic spines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1e</xref>; 1.15 ± 0.05 and 0.92 ± 0.05 spines/µm, for WT and MAP6 KO neurons, respectively). MAP6 depletion by siRNA similarly resulted in a reduction of spines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1h</xref>; 1.25 ± 0.04 and 0.91 ± 0.08 spines/µm for control and MAP6 siRNAs, respectively).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>MAP6 inhibition reduces dendritic spine density. <bold>a</bold> Confocal image showing representative examples of dendritic segments of layer 5 cortical neurons of WT and MAP6 KO <italic>Thy1</italic>-eYFP-H mice.

For each experiment of cultured neurons, analysed neurons were pooled from at least three independent cultures</p></caption><graphic id="d29e654" xlink:href="41467_2018_5869_Fig1_HTML"></graphic></fig></p>
<p id="Par6">Dendritic spines are often classified in three morphological types, corresponding to successive developmental stages: thin, stubby and mushroom-like spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. We quantified the density of spines subtypes, in WT and MAP6 KO neurons in vivo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>). While no difference was found between genotypes in the number of thin spines, mushroom spines were significantly reduced in MAP6 KO neurons as compared to WT neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>; 0.38 ± 0.02 and 0.26 ± 0.02 spines/µm for mushroom spines, in WT and MAP6 KO neurons, respectively). We performed the same quantitative analysis in cultured neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1f–i</xref>). Similar to the in vivo data, the lack of MAP6 led to a decreased density of mushroom-like spines. We also observed a significant loss of stubby spines in MAP6 KO neurons in vivo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1c</xref>; 0.31 ± 0.02 and 0.21 ± 0.01 spines/µm in WT and MAP6 KO neurons, respectively); this latter was not reproduced in cultured KO neurons, perhaps due to differences in spine maturation conditions.</p>
<p id="Par7">To determine whether the loss of spines correlated with changes in glutamatergic synaptic transmission, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of spontaneous miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) in cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1j</xref>). In KO neurons, the mean mEPSCs amplitude was not significantly changed compared to WT neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1k</xref>; 25.76 ± 0.79 and 23.84 ± 0.7 pA for WT and KO neurons, respectively). In contrast, the mean mEPSCs frequency recorded in KO neurons was strongly reduced compared to WT neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1l</xref>; 1.25 ± 0.25 and 0.52 ± 0.17 Hz for WT and KO neurons, respectively). The reduction of mEPSCs frequency in KO neurons corroborates the reduction of spine density and is indicative of a perturbed glutamatergic neurotransmission.</p>
<p id="Par8">Taken together, these results indicate that MAP6 has an important role in the formation and/or maintenance of mature dendritic spines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="Sec4">
<title>MAP6 Mc modules mediate effects on dendritic spine density</title>
<p id="Par9">We next sought to determine which part of the MAP6 sequence was involved in spine formation and maintenance. Rescue experiments were carried out in KO neurons in vitro, using GFP-labelled MAP6 isoforms or deletion mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>) in combination with unfused mCherry as an outline marker. Spine density was measured using the mCherry image (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>). Expression of either the MAP6-N-GFP or the MAP6-E-GFP isoform in MAP6 KO neurons resulted in an increase of spine density from 0.86 ± 0.06 to 1.07 ± 0.02 and 1.05 ± 0.03 spines/µm, respectively, values no longer significantly different from the density of 1.16 ± 0.06 spines/µm, observed for WT neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b, c</xref>). Analysis of spine morphology indicated that both MAP6-E-GFP and MAP6-N-GFP restored a normal density of mushroom-like spines in MAP6 KO neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2d</xref>). We then examined the ability of MAP6-E mutants devoid of microtubule-binding sequence modules to correct spine density defects. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref> depicts the two types of MAP6 microtubule-binding modules, the Mn modules (orange) and the Mc modules in the central domain (grey). When transfected in MAP6 KO neurons, MAP6-E lacking Mn modules (MAP6-E-ΔMn-GFP) was able to increase the spine density from 0.86 ± 0.06 to 1.11 ± 0.04 spines/µm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e, f</xref>). In contrast, transfection of MAP6-E lacking Mc modules (MAP6-E-ΔMc-GFP) failed to significantly change the spine density (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e, f</xref>). Conversely, expression of GFP fused to Mc modules alone (GFP-Mc) increased spine density up to values similar to those observed in WT neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2e, g</xref>; 1.11 ± 0.04 and 1.16 ± 0.06 spines/µm for rescued MAP6 KO neurons and WT neurons, respectively).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>MAP6 Mc modules are important for dendritic spine maturation and maintenance. <bold>a</bold> Schematic representation of MAP6 domain structure and cDNA constructs used in this paper. <bold>b</bold> Confocal image showing representative examples of dendritic segments of MAP6 KO 18 DIV cultured hippocampal neurons transfected with mCherry-expressing vector alone or co-transfected with a MAP6-E construct.

Neurons were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing GFP or Mc-GFP, fixed at DIV18, and stained for PSD-95/synaptophysin (a post-synaptic and a pre-synaptic marker, respectively). Fluorescent puncta containing both pre and post-synaptic markers were used to detect and count synapses formed on the dendrites of transduced cells, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2h</xref>. GFP-expressing WT neurons displayed 0.949 ± 0.020 synapses/µm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2i</xref>), whereas GFP-expressing MAP6 KO neurons had 0.76 ± 0.030 synapses/µm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2i</xref>), a value compatible with the presence of one synapse per dendritic spine. Thus, in MAP6 KO neurons, the reduced density of excitatory synapses is in tight correlation with the reduction of spine density. Expression of Mc modules (GFP-Mc) in MAP6 KO neurons rescued the number of synapses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2h, i</xref>, 0.967 ± 0.022 synapses/µm) to values similar to those observed in WT neurons.</p>

<title>MAP6 Mc modules directly interact with actin</title>
<p id="Par14">At physiological temperature, MAP6 interaction with microtubules relies on Mn domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>), and Mc modules are not involved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. We thus wondered whether an interaction of the Mc modules with actin might occur, possibly accounting for the observed spine stabilisation. We analysed the comparative distribution of endogenous MAP6 and cytoskeletal elements in cultured hippocampal neurons at different stages of maturation. Endogenous MAP6 co-localised with microtubules throughout the cell, was especially enriched in axons, but also co-localised with actin in filopodia and lamellipodia within the growth cone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3a, a′, a″</xref>). After 30 days in culture, endogenous MAP6 continued to be present in cell body, axon and dendrites but also accumulated within dendritic spines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3b, b′, b″</xref>). To determine whether Mc modules could target the protein to actin-rich regions of the cell, we studied the localisation of a transiently expressed GFP-Mc fusion protein. The GFP-Mc polypeptide was found to co-localise with actin filaments both in mouse embryo fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) and in the growth cone of young neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3c, c′, c″</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>The MAP6 Mc module directly interacts with the actin cytoskeleton. <bold>a</bold> Confocal image showing a representative cultured hippocampal neuron at 2 DIV, co-stained for actin filaments (phalloidin, magenta), endogenous MAP6 (green) and microtubules (grey).

<p id="Par15">To determine whether MAP6 directly interacted with actin filaments in neurons, we performed FRET (Förster Resonance Energy Transfer with Acceptor Bleaching) measurements using the acceptor photobleaching technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, with TRITC-phalloidin labelled actin filaments (as acceptor) and GFP or GFP-tagged MAP6 (as donor) (FRET-A; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d, d′</xref>; Supplementary movie <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM3">1</xref>). We chose to analyse growth cones, where actin filaments are clearly visible. The fluorescence intensity of the donor MAP6-E-GFP within growth cone regions increased significantly after bleaching of the acceptor, revealing a FRET efficiency of 52 ± 2% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>). Similar experiments were performed with GFP-Mc modules, yielding a FRET efficiency of 49.6 ± 2% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>). As a control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3d, d′</xref>), no transfer of fluorescence was observed between F-actin filaments and soluble GFP (1.4 ± 3% of FRET, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3e</xref>).

<title>MAP6 regulates actin dynamics in dendritic spines</title>
<p id="Par17">The above results raise the possibility that MAP6 might participate in the regulation of actin dynamics in spines, which is crucially involved in spine remodelling and in synaptic plasticity events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In particular, long-term potentiation (LTP) is known to be accompanied by a rise of actin filaments, increased actin stabilisation and spine enlargement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. To examine whether MAP6 contributes to plasticity-related actin filament accumulation and spine expansion, we used neurons transfected with plasmids encoding GFP as a volume marker, together with the filamentous actin probe LifeAct-mCherry (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). The transfected neurons were subjected to synaptic activation, using a chemical protocol mimicking LTP (cLTP, bicuculline and 4-Aminopyridine)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Individual mushroom-like spines of live neurons were imaged before and after induction of cLTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>). Consistent with previous publications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, in WT neurons, cLTP resulted in a strong expansion of spine volume (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). By contrast, no increase was detected in the spines of KO neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4b</xref>). Further, in agreement with the results of Bosch et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, in WT spines, the concentration of actin filaments (estimated as the ratio of LifeAct vs. GFP) was ~20% higher following cLTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>). Strikingly, no such change in actin concentration was detected in KO spines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4c</xref>). Thus, MAP6 is required for the growth of the actin cytoskeleton that underlies spine expansion during activity-induced synaptic change. To determine whether MAP6 could regulate the polymerisation of spine actin, we compared the turnover rate of actin monomers in spines of MAP6 KO neurons and WT controls, by using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of GFP-actin. Under our conditions, the mobile fraction of GFP-actin molecules calculated from the recovery kinetics corresponded to actin treadmilling in dynamic filaments, while the immobile fraction was composed of stable filaments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Hippocampal neurons cultured for 15 days in vitro were transfected with GFP-actin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>), 2 days later a specific spine was bleached and fluorescence recovery measured over time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4d</xref>). In WT neurons, FRAP measurements yielded a classical average recovery curve with a characteristic recovery time of 40 s and almost full recovery of fluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>, WT). Similar results were obtained for MAP6 KO neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>, KO) indicating similar actin dynamics in spines at resting state. Following cLTP, in WT neurons, FRAP measurements showed slower recovery of the mobile fraction and appearance of a significant immobile fraction, indicating as expected a diminished rate of actin turnover and an increased pool of stable actin filaments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>, WT + cLTP). In contrast, in MAP6 KO neurons, the cLTP protocol did not affect the recovery curve (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4e</xref>, KO + cLTP). Quantification, in WT neurons, of the dynamic GFP-actin in resting conditions or after cLTP clearly showed a reduction of the mobile fraction from 92.8 ± 3% to 57 ± 9% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4f</xref>, 43% of immobile actin), whereas the mobile fraction was unchanged in MAP6 KO neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4f</xref>, 95 ± 4% and 100.0 ± 5%, in resting and activated conditions, respectively).

<p id="Par20">To analyse in detail the interaction of Mc modules with actin filaments, we assayed in vitro the effect of purified Mc on a range of actin polymerisation parameters, including nucleation, elongation and bundling, known to be regulated by actin-binding proteins in spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Actin nucleation was first assayed by following the polymerisation of pyrene-labelled actin over time. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref>, the initial lag corresponding to actin nucleation was shortened when actin was polymerised in the presence of Mc modules. Next, we investigated actin assembly by directly visualising actin polymerisation using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5d</xref>). After a 5 min assembly period, we measured the number of actin filaments present in the microscope field of view, in the presence or absence of Mc. Quantification showed that the total filament number was increased in the presence of Mc modules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5e</xref>; total filament number: 66 ± 9.9 and 121.6 ± 15.5; for actin and actin + Mc modules, respectively). However, the elongation rate of polymerising filaments was not significantly changed by Mc (1.1 ± 0.02 and 1.1 ± 0.02 µm/min for actin and actin + Mc, respectively). In contrast, we observed a dose-dependent induction of actin bundling by Mc modules, as indicated by the higher density of filaments, visualised by the orange to yellow pseudo-colour in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5f</xref> (fluorescence intensity ≥ 200 arbitrary units). Quantification indicated a higher percentage of actin bundling in the presence of Mc modules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5g</xref>; 5.7 ± 0.6%, 14.2 ± 1.5% and 19 ± 2.5% for 300 nM of actin alone, +150 and +300 nM Mc, respectively). To monitor the kinetics of Mc-induced actin bundle formation, we performed light-scattering assays during the polymerisation of actin monomers with or without Mc (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5h</xref>). In the presence of Mc, light scattering increased much more rapidly, indicating that Mc quickly bound and bundled newly forming actin filaments. Furthermore, the ability of Mc to bundle actin filaments was examined in a co-sedimentation assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5i</xref>). Complete actin polymerisation was checked by high-speed (HS) sedimentation (100,000×<italic>g</italic>, actin filaments in the pellet). At low-speed (LS) centrifugation (15,000×<italic>g</italic>), in the control condition, actin filaments were mainly present in the supernatant whereas, in the presence of Mc, 4-time increase of actin was found in the pellet (13 ± 4.9% and 58.5 ± 3.9% for actin alone and actin + Mc in the LS pellet). Finally, we analysed the impact of Mc modules on actin organisation using negative-staining electron microscopy. As shown Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5j</xref>, in the presence of Mc modules, actin filaments formed bundles and appeared straightened as compared to control conditions. Moreover Mc modules caused filaments to organise in single layered arrays, showing periodic striations spaced by 35.9 ± 1.2 nm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5j</xref>, white arrowheads). These striations could also be seen in single filaments (spaced by 35.7 ± 1.1 nm) and were not observed in the absence of Mc. The period coincides with the helical pitch of actin (35.7 nm), suggesting repeated association of Mc with a specific aspect of the filaments.</p>

As previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, dilution of actin filaments led to depolymerisation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6b</xref>) with only 38.61 + 2.43% of filaments resisting dissociation.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par25">It is well established that the maturation and plasticity of dendritic spines are strongly dependent on the complex, dynamic remodelling of the spine actin cytoskeleton. We show here that part of this remodelling is mediated by MAP6, a protein known to be indispensable for synaptic plasticity and for the normal development of brain circuits underlying aspects of cognition and behaviour. MAP6 KO and heterozygous mice exhibit cognitive defects, associated with strong impairments affecting both short and long-term synaptic plasticity, including defective LTP and LTD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Moreover, MAP6 deficits have been linked to autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> in line with the involvement of spine pathology in human neuropsychiatric disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. MAP6 is known as a microtubule-associated protein that can also interact with actin depending on its phosphorylation state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In this work, using biochemical and microscopy approaches, we identify MAP6 as a novel regulator of actin filament dynamics and conformation, with implications for the mechanisms of synaptic homoeostasis and plasticity.</p>
<p id="Par26">MAP6 KO neurons, both in vivo as in vitro, displayed impairments in the morphological and functional maturation of post-synaptic compartments. The deficiency phenotype could be rescued by expressing different MAP6 isoforms. Remarkably, within the MAP6 sequence, the Mc modules were both necessary and sufficient to rescue dendritic spine density. This result cannot readily be explained by the known affinity of Mc modules for microtubules, as microtubule binding cannot occur at physiological temperature; instead, we find that Mc modules interact with actin filaments in a way consistent with direct regulation of the spine cytoskeleton.</p>
<p id="Par27">Several results strengthen the idea that MAP6 binding to spine actin is instrumental to spine maintenance. In addition to microtubular localisation, full-size MAP6 as well as the isolated Mc domain are present in actin-rich regions of neurons, such as growth cones of young neurons or dendritic spines in mature cells. FRET assays supported the notion that, via the Mc modules, MAP6 closely interacts with actin filaments in situ. Using MAP6 phosphorylation mutants, localisation of the protein in the spine was shown to correlate with spine restoration. Functionally, FRAP measurements of spine actin dynamics revealed that MAP6 had a necessary role in the kinetic stabilisation of actin filaments that accompanies activity-induced synaptic change. Rescue experiments again showed that MAP6 depended on its Mc modules for regulating spine actin turnover; furthermore, Mc modules expressed on their own were able to restore actin stabilisation following cLTP in MAP KO neurons.</p>
<p id="Par28">On the whole, these results indicate that MAP6 has an important part in the stabilisation of mature spine types (“mushroom-like” and “stubby” spines), i.e. those that transmit larger synaptic currents and encode long-lasting information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. As the fraction of thin spines was not affected, MAP6 deficiency does not seem to result in a simple reversal of spine maturation. One explanation could be that the cytoskeletal structure promoted by MAP6 binding to actin is specifically required for maintaining mature spines.</p>
<p id="Par29">The in vitro reconstitution of the Mc-actin interaction uncovered molecular properties that are consistent with the specific function of MAP6 in spine plasticity. We found, in our in vitro conditions, that purified Mc modules interact with actin filament with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> below the micromolar range and promote the formation of straight, stable, rigid actin bundles. Biophysical modelling indicates that morphogenesis of the spine head can be quantitatively accounted for by a balance of forces, involving a combination of actin bundles pushing outward along the axis of the spine neck, and filaments that emerge from Arp2/3-nucleated branches and that exert isotropic radial pressure in the head<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Indeed, spines have been shown to harbour both a sub-membrane pool of actively polymerising filaments and a core population of stable actin filaments; the increase and stabilisation of core actin is a feature of LTP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The action of MAP6 Mc modules on actin filament nucleation might be important during the initial reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton, whereas Mc-induced filament straightening and bundling could be necessary for the enlargement and maintenance of potentiated spines (mushroom-like forms).</p>
<p id="Par30">Several other proteins, such as drebrin, spinophilin/neurabin, or CaMKIIβ, have been described as crucial for dendritic spine morphogenesis in association with their ability to bundle actin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. However, the in vivo phenotype of MAP6 KO spines indicates that MAP6-induced actin arrangements carry specific properties, which are not conferred by other actin-binding proteins. The fact that the same MAP6 Mc module carries both nucleation-enhancing and bundling activities might allow MAP6 to promote the enlargement of the spine actin pool in a specific, uniquely efficient fashion. Furthermore, at the ultrastructural level, both single and bundled actin filaments were seen to be strikingly straightened in the presence of the MAP6 Mc modules. The straightened fibres displayed regularly spaced striations, with a period of 35–36 nm, potentially corresponding to the helical pitch of bare actin filaments. This suggests that filaments cross-linked by Mc modules were aligned without torsion and in a highly ordered, extended conformation. The periodic striations seemingly correspond to a specific feature of MAP6-decorated actin filaments. Other MAPs such as tau and MAP2C, or the key neuronal actin-binding protein drebrin, were shown to induce assembly of actin filaments into rope-like structures or loose bundles, with no visible striations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Within the large group of actin-binding proteins, several members, including fimbrin, coronin, FRG-1 and p135<sup>ABP</sup>, induce actin bundling without striations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. In contrast, periodic striations similar to those seen here have been observed for fascin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> and cortexillin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> or septins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. However, these latter proteins are either absent from dendritic spines or confined to their base and neck. Thus, MAP6 is the first MAP and the first protein present within dendritic spines able to induce actin bundling with periodic striations. One limitation of the present study is that the effect of Mc MAP6 on actin organisation could only be resolved in vitro, with isolated components, and we did not further test for interaction of Mc with other similar charge and mass; future work will need to further confirm the specificity of this interaction, and to address the challenge of imaging Mc-dependent actin ultrastructure in dendritic spines.</p>
<p id="Par31">The extended conformation of Mc-bound filaments suggests that they are under tension. Such tension has been shown to decrease binding of the filament-severing protein, cofilin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>; hence MAP6 may conceivably protect a pool of spine actin against cofilin activity. Straight filaments induced by MAP6 might also increase the efficacy of myosin-mediated vesicular transport of lipid membrane and AMPA receptors into spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Indeed, alteration of myosin isoforms resulted in impaired AMPAR trafficking, and, similar to MAP6 deficiency, in decreased frequency of miniature EPSCs and defective activity-induced synaptic change.</p>
<p id="Par32">Under physiological conditions, the two main MAP6 isoforms in neurons, MAP6-N and MAP6-E, contain Mc modules but also Mn modules, which have strong microtubule binding affinity. Release of MAP6 from the dendritic microtubules is necessary for translocation into spines, and might be triggered by phosphorylation events occurring upon neuronal activation. We have previously shown that MAP6 was phosphorylated by CamKII, the major kinase in spines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Phosphorylation by CamKII-rendered MAP6 unable to associate with microtubules, while leaving actin-binding unchanged (no change of binding following alkaline phosphate treatment)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Here, we correlated the translocation of MAP6 phosphorylation mutants from microtubules in the dendritic shaft to actin filaments in dendritic spines, with the ability of these mutants to restore spine density. The simplest explanation of our data is that the phosphorylation-defective MAP6 mutant (S to A) was retained on MTs and thus unable to translocate into spines and thereby to rescue the spine deficit in MAP6 KO neurons. Thus phosphorylation of MAP6 may mediate some of the effects of CamKII on structural plasticity.</p>
<p id="Par33">Finally, beside its direct effects on actin filament dynamics and organisation, we cannot exclude that MAP6 also indirectly control spine actin via signalling events, such as activation of small GTPases. Indeed, MAP6 has been shown to directly interact with Rac1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, a GTPase known to induce strong cytoskeletal rearrangements. When present in dendritic spines and bound to actin, MAP6 might also regulate plasticity pathways by interacting with SH3 domain-containing proteins such as Intersectin or PI3Kinase, through active PRD domains as reported in the case of Sema3E-dependant axonal guidance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par34">In summary, the present data provide evidence that MAP6 acts as a novel player in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton structure and dynamics, with important consequences for the maturation and maintenance of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons. Reduced expression of MAP6 affects the density of dendritic spines and mature synapses in vitro and in vivo, and prevents the stabilisation of the spine actin cytoskeleton during plasticity events. The ability of MAP6 to regulate actin dynamics relies on its Mc modules, which we show are able to enhance actin filament nucleation, promote filament stabilisation and bundling, and induce the appearance of a specific, straightened filament conformation. Thus, these data shed new light on the mechanisms that might contribute to the cognitive impairments associated with MAP6 deficiency.</p>

Diffusional entry of monomeric actin was not included in the model because in our hands it occurs with a time scale that is at least ≈40-fold faster than polymerisation; any effect of diffusion is thus included in the value of the first recovery time point.</p>

<title>Pyrene actin polymerisation</title>
<p id="Par48">2 µM of 10% pyrene-labelled G-actin (actin monomers) was polymerised alone or in the presence of 300 nM of Mc modules, in buffer AP (Actin Polymerisation) containing 2 mM Tris,10 mM imidazole pH 7.0, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA.</p>

<title>TIRF microscopy</title>
<p id="Par49">Perfusion chambers were prepared with functionalised silane-PEG (Creative PEGwork) glass slides, as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. For actin polymerisation assays, the flow cell was incubated with PLL-g-PEG (2 kDa, 0.1 mg/ml in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, Jenkem) and washed with 1% BSA in buffer AP. Actin growth was initiated by flowing 300 nM G-actin (containing 30% Alexa-488 labelled G-actin) alone or with 150–300 nM Mc modules in AP buffer containing 4 mM DTT, 1% BSA, 1 mg/ml glucose, 70 µg/ml catalase, 580 µg/ml glucose oxidase and 0.3% methylcellulose. Samples were visualised on an inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti, Nikon) equipped with an Ilas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> TIRF system (Roper Scientific), a cooled charge-coupled device camera (EMCCD Evolve 512, Photometrics), a warm stage controller (LINKAM MC60), and controlled by MetaMorph software (version 7.7.5, Molecular Devices). Samples were excited with 491 nm laser light and time-lapse imaging (at 488 nm) was performed at 26 °C for actin polymerisation, during 45 min at 1 frame per 5 s with a 100-ms exposure time.</p>
<p id="Par50">The elongation rate of actin filaments polymerisation with or without Mc modules was determined on kymographs using ImageJ software and a home-made plugin (KymoTool). Elongation of single actin filaments was derived from actin length measurements on image stacks. To analyse actin nucleation, 300 nM actin (labelled as above), alone or together with 300 nM Mc modules was incubated in AP buffer containing 4 mM DTT, 1% BSA, 1 mg/ml glucose, 70 µg/ml catalase, 580 µg/ml glucose oxidase and 0.3% methylcellulose in the perfusion chamber for 5 min at 26 °C and imaged. TIRF images were skeletonised and the number of filaments and the length of total actin network were measured. To analyse bundling activity, 300 nM actin alone or with 150 or 300 nM Mc modules was treated as before and images were taken after 45 min. TIRF images of actin filaments were enhanced using Feature detector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup> module of Icy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. Actin network and bundles were segmented with Fiji<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup> using Otsu or Yen thresholding algorithms, respectively. The thresholded images were skeletonised and the total length of actin network or bundles was measured. The percentage of actin bundling was calculated by dividing the length of bundled actin by the total length of filamentous actin in the same field.</p>

<sec id="Sec26">
<title>Light-scattering assay to measure bundling activity</title>
<p id="Par51">A kinetic light-scattering assay was performed to determine the ability of Mc modules to form actin bundles during polymerisation. Light scattering by unlabelled 2 µM G-actin was monitored at 400 nm at a scattering angle of 90°. The change of light scattering was recorded after addition of 1 µM Mc modules.</p>

<sec id="Sec27">
<title>High-speed and low-speed co-sedimentation assays</title>
<p id="Par52">High- and low-speed co-sedimentation assays were used to examine actin polymerisation and actin bundling, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. All proteins were pre-clarified at 140,000×<italic>g</italic> before each experiment. 2 µM G-actin (actin monomers) was polymerised for 1 h at room temperature (RT) in AP (Actin Polymerisation) buffer containing 2 µM Phalloidin. To confirm the complete polymerisation of actin, samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 100,000×<italic>g</italic> (high-speed co-sedimentation assay: HS).</p>
<p id="Par53">To analyse the binding of Mc modules to actin filaments, various concentrations of polymerised actin were incubated with Mc modules in AP buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After HS sedimentation, Mc modules and actin present in the pellet or in the supernatant were analysed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). For titration analysis, co-sedimented Mc domains were quantified by western immunoblotting using anti-MAP6 antibody 23C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> and chemiluminescent detection (Chemidoc<sup>TM</sup>MP Imaging System, BioRad). Absolute protein amounts were determined by calibration with an Mc-domain concentration range, using ImageJ for image analysis. <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> and <italic>B</italic><sub>max</sub> values and their confidence interval were calculated with <italic>R</italic> by non-linear fitting of the data to the single-site binding isotherm, <italic>B</italic>/<italic>B</italic><sub>max</sub> = (<italic>T</italic> − <italic>B</italic>)/(<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> + <italic>T</italic> − <italic>B</italic>), where <italic>T</italic> is the total (input) Mc concentration, <italic>B</italic> is the actin-bound Mc concentration, and <italic>B</italic><sub>max</sub> is the saturating concentration.</p>
<p id="Par54">To analyse bundling activity, 1 µM Mc modules was added (or not) in the mixture after actin polymerisation and samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000×<italic>g</italic> (low-speed co-sedimentation assay: LS). All supernatants and pellets were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Stain-Free technology in the gel (Mini-PROTEAN® TGX Stain-Free™, Biorad) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Protein bands were quantified from triplicate blots of independent experiments using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).</p>

<sec id="Sec28">
<title>Transmission electron microscopy</title>
<p id="Par55">To analyse the effect of Mc modules on actin organisation, we performed negative staining electron microscopy in two sets of samples: in actin + Mc modules co-polymerisation and adding Mc modules after complete actin polymerisation. In co-polymerisation assays: 2 µM G-actin was incubated with 2 µM Phalloidin and 1 to 5 µM Mc modules in AP (Actin Polymerisation) buffer for 1 h at room temperature (RT).</p>
<p id="Par56">In post-polymerisation assays: 2 µM G-actin was incubated with 2 µM Phalloidin in AP buffer for 1 h at RT. Then, Mc modules (1–5 µM) was added and incubated for 1 h at RT.</p>
<p id="Par57">For negative staining, 1 µl of protein solution was loaded onto a carbon-mica interface. The carbon layer was floated on 2% uranyl acetate, recovered with a 400-mesh copper grid (Agar Scientific), air dried, and observed with a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. Images were acquired with a digital camera (Veleta, Olympus) at ×100,000 magnification. Experiments were performed at the Electron Microscopy Facility of the Grenoble Institute of Neuroscience. To detect the periodic striations of Mc-decorated single and bundled filaments, a line was traced between the edges of each filament (outside or inside the bundle), staining intensity along the line was plotted, and the distances between successive intensity minima were measured. Each value corresponds to the mean distance between successive striations of the same filament. Images of independent experiments were analysed.</p>

<sec id="Sec29">
<title>Actin depolymerisation by buffer dilution</title>
<p id="Par58">To analyse actin depolymerisation, we first incubated 2 µM G-actin with 2 µM Phalloidin in AP buffer for 1 h at RT. Then, 0.5 to 1 µM of Mc modules was added and incubated for 1 h at RT. G-actin was diluted from 2 to 0.1 µM in AP buffer (alone or with 0.5 or 1 µM of Mc modules) for 20 min, centrifuged at 100,000×<italic>g</italic> and pellets were separated on SDS-PAGE and detected by Stain-Free technology in the gel (Mini-PROTEAN® TGX Stain-Free™, Biorad). Protein bands were quantified from triplicate blots of independent experiments using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The remaining actin filaments were calculated as a percentage of the input. Kinetic depolymerisation of 2 µM of 40% pyrene-labelled actin, alone or in the presence of 0.5 or 1 µM of Mc modules, was monitored after dilution to 0.1 µM actin in AP buffer (alone or with 0.5 or 1 µM of Mc modules).</p>
