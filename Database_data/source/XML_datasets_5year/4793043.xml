<abstract>
<p>Dysregulated expression of miR-219, a brain-specific microRNA, has been observed in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia (SCZ). However, its role in normal mammalian neural stem cells (NSCs) and in SCZ pathogenesis remains unknown. We show here that the nuclear receptor TLX, an essential regulator of NSC proliferation and self-renewal, inhibits miR-219 processing. miR-219 suppresses mouse NSC proliferation downstream of TLX. Moreover, we demonstrate upregulation of miR-219 and downregulation of TLX expression in NSCs derived from SCZ patient iPSCs and <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant isogenic iPSCs. SCZ NSCs exhibit reduced cell proliferation. Overexpression of TLX or inhibition of miR-219 action rescues the proliferative defect in SCZ NSCs. Therefore, this study uncovers an important role for TLX and miR-219 in both normal neurodevelopment and in SCZ patient iPSC-derived NSCs. Moreover, this study reveals an unexpected role for TLX in regulating microRNA processing, independent of its well-characterized role in transcriptional regulation.</p>

<p>TLX is a nuclear receptor that plays a critical role in vertebrate brain function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.

It also plays a role in neurodevelopment through regulation of cell cycle progression in embryonic NSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. TLX is a well-characterized transcriptional regulator. It controls target gene expression partly by recruiting transcriptional co-repressors, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). TLX represses the transcription of GFAP, p21, pten and microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-9 and miR-137, but activates Wnt signalling, SIRT1 and MASH1 in NSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. However, the function of TLX in regulating gene expression beyond transcriptional regulation has not been reported.</p>
<p>miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression through translational inhibition or RNA degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The biogenesis of miRNAs starts from primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs), which are processed by the nuclear RNase III Drosha into precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) that contain hairpin loop structures. The pre-miRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm and further processed into mature miRNAs by the cytoplasmic RNase III Dicer. Mature miRNAs are incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex to repress target mRNAs. The Drosha complex consists of Drosha, DiGeorge syndrome critical gene 8 (DGCR8), RNA helicase p68 (DDX5) and p72 (DDX17)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Recent studies reported that SMAD, p53 and BRCA1 bind to Drosha and promote the processing activity of Drosha<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. However, our knowledge about the physiological effect of miRNA processing is still limited.</p>
<p>miR-219 is a miRNA that is specifically expressed in the brain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. It promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation by repressing negative regulators of oligodendrocyte differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In a recent study, miR-219 was shown to promote neural precursor cell differentiation in zebrafish by inhibiting apical polarity proteins, par-3 family cell polarity regulator (PARD) and protein kinase C iota (PRKCI)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. However, whether miR-219 regulates the phenotypes of neural stem/progenitor cells (collectively referred to as NSCs) in mammalian brains remains unknown.</p>
<p>Several studies analysing miRNA levels in post-mortem brains from schizophrenia (SCZ) patients reported an increase in the expression of a set of miRNAs in SCZ patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. miR-219 is among the most highly upregulated miRNAs in brain regions of SCZ patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. However, the functional relevance of elevated miR-219 expression in SCZ brain cells remains unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate a role for miR-219 in the regulation of mammalian NSC proliferation and differentiation, and identify TLX as an upstream regulator of miR-219. Moreover, we identify p68, Drosha and DGCR8 as novel TLX-interacting molecules, and uncover an unexpected role for TLX in regulating miRNA processing at the post-transcriptional level. Furthermore, we show that miR-219 expression is upregulated, whereas TLX expression is downregulated in SCZ NSCs. Overexpression of TLX or a miR-219 inhibitor is able to rescue the proliferative defects in SCZ NSCs.</p>

<title>TLX represses miR-219 processing</title>
<p>When comparing gene expression in wild-type (WT) and <italic>TLX</italic> knockout (KO) mouse brains, we detected markedly elevated expression of miR-219 in <italic>TLX</italic> KO brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Because TLX is a transcription factor, we next examined the level of primary transcripts of <italic>miR-219</italic>. miR-219 is derived from two primary transcripts, pri-miR-219-1 and pri-miR-219-2. No expression of pri-miR-219-1 was detected in both WT and <italic>TLX</italic> KO brains, and not much change in the expression of pri-miR-219-2 was observed in WT and <italic>TLX</italic> KO brains either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). Because we only detected pri-miR-219-2 in the brain, pri-miR-219-2 is referred to as pri-miR-219 hereafter.</p>
<p>We next determined the expression levels of the precursor form of miR-219 (pre-miR-219) in <italic>TLX</italic> KO brains. The level of pre-miR-219 increased substantially in <italic>TLX</italic> KO brains, compared to WT brains, similar to the change in mature miR-219 level, whereas no marked change was observed in pri-miR-219 level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). We then examined the levels of all three forms of miR-219 in <italic>TLX</italic> knockdown NSCs. Knockdown of <italic>TLX</italic> by siRNA was confirmed by PCR with reverse transcription (RTâPCR; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Consistent with our observation in <italic>TLX</italic> KO brains, considerable increase in the levels of pre-miR-219 and mature miR-219 was seen in <italic>TLX</italic> knockdown NSCs, compared to control NSCs, whereas minimal change was detected in the level of pri-miR-219 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). The upregulation of pre-miR-219 and mature miR-219 by <italic>TLX</italic> knockdown was not affected by the treatment of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). These results suggest that TLX regulates the expression level of miR-219 at the post-transcriptional level, presumably through inhibiting the processing of miR-219 from the primary form to the precursor form.</p>
<p>To confirm that TLX plays a role in miR-219 processing, we performed a luciferase-based processing assay. HEK293T cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter construct containing pri-miR-219 sequences that include the Drosha/DGCR8-binding sites. The pri-miR-219 sequences were placed between the coding region of the luciferase gene and its polyadenylation signal. Cleavage of polyadenylation tails from the luciferase transcripts by Drosha/DGCR8 would induce degradation of the luciferase transcripts and reduce luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e</xref>). We found that ectopic expression of <italic>TLX</italic> in HEK293T cells reduced miR-219 processing, as revealed by increased luciferase activity of miR-219-Glo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Expression of <italic>TLX</italic> had no effect on luciferase activity of miR-1224-Glo, a reporter that contains part of miR-1224, a miRtron that is processed into pre-miRNA independent of Drosha cleavage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>). In contrast to overexpression of <italic>TLX</italic>, knockdown of <italic>TLX</italic> in NSCs promoted miR-219 processing, as shown by reduced luciferase activity of miR-219-Glo, compared to control RNA-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>), but had no effect on luciferase activity of miR-1224-Glo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>). These results indicate that TLX negatively regulates miR-219 processing from the primary form to the precursor form.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>TLX interacts with the miRNA processing machinery</title>
<p>In a parallel effort, we sought to identify novel TLX-interacting proteins. Nuclear extracts of HA-TLX-expressing HeLa cells were immunoprecipitated with an HA antibody. Proteins specifically pulled down in HA-TLX-expressing cells, but not in control cells, were subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to determine their identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). The RNA helicase p68 is among the proteins that were uniquely represented in the pull-downs of HA-TLX-expressing cells. Seventeen peptides of p68 were detected in the HA immunoprecipitates of HA-TLX-expressing cells, but not in that of control HA-expressing cells.</p>
<p>To confirm the interaction of TLX with p68, HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-TLX. p68 was detected in the HA-TLX immunocomplex and the interaction was not affected by the treatment with DNase and RNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Because p68 is a component of the Drosha complex that processes pri-miRNAs into pre-miRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, we hypothesized that TLX could interact with the miRNA processing machinery via its interaction with p68. To test whether TLX interacts with Drosha and DGCR8, HEK293T cells were transfected with Flag-Drosha or Flag-DGCR8 and HA-TLX. HA-TLX was detected in the immunocomplexes of both Flag-Drosha and Flag-DGCR8, independently of DNase and RNase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm the interaction of endogenous TLX with Drosha/DGCR8, we collected E13.5 mouse brains, where TLX is highly expressed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Brain lysates were immunoprecipitated with a TLX-specific antibody. Both Drosha and DGCR8 were detected in the TLX immunocomplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). These results indicate that TLX interacts with components of the miRNA processing machinery.</p>
<p>The interaction of TLX with Drosha and DGCR8 led us to hypothesize that TLX could inhibit miR-219 processing by preventing the miRNA processing machinery from binding to pri-miR-219. To test this hypothesis, we made cell lysates from NSCs transduced with lentivirus expressing TLX siRNA and performed RNA immunoprecipitation to determine if knockdown of TLX would affect the binding of Drosha and DGCR8 to pri-miR-219 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Weak binding of Drosha and DGCR8 to pri-miR-219 was detected in NSCs transduced with lentivirus expressing a control RNA, and no binding of TLX to pri-miR-219 was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Knockdown of TLX increased the binding of both Drosha and DGCR8 to pri-miR-219 substantially. These results indicated that TLX inhibits Drosha and DGCR8 from binding to pri-miR-219.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>miR-219 inhibits mammalian NSC proliferation</title>
<p>Because TLX plays an important role in regulating mammalian NSC proliferation and differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, our observation that TLX regulates miR-219 processing in mouse NSCs led us to hypothesize that miR-219 could be involved in regulating mammalian NSC phenotypes. To test whether miR-219 affects mammalian NSC proliferation, NSCs were isolated from E14.5 mouse brains and treated with the miR-219 RNA duplex. BrdU labelling was performed to monitor cell proliferation. Treatment with miR-219 reduced cell proliferation substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,c</xref>), but had minimal cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). These results indicate that miR-219 inhibits mammalian NSC proliferation. We next tested the effect of miR-219 on NSC differentiation. E14.5 mouse NSCs were treated with the miR-219 RNA duplex and cultured in differentiation medium. Treatment with miR-219 increased the percentage of Î²III tubulin (Tuj1)-positive neurons substantially, compared to treatment with a control RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,d</xref>). These results indicate that miR-219 promotes mammalian NSC differentiation into neurons.</p>
<p>To determine the effect of miR-219 on NSC regulation <italic>in vivo</italic>, miR-219 RNA duplex was electroporated together with an red fluorescent protein (RFP)-expressing vector into NSCs of E13.5 embryonic brains <italic>in uterus</italic>. The brains were dissected at E15.5 and analysed by immunohistochemistry. Immunostaining with Ki67, a proliferation marker, revealed that overexpression of miR-219 decreased cell proliferation in the ventricular zone and subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ) of mouse brains, where NSCs reside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e,f</xref>). To determine the effect of miR-219 overexpression on neuronal differentiation, immunostaining with doublecortin (DCX), a neuronal marker, was performed. Compared to control RNA-transfected cells, substantially more miR-219-electroporated (RFP+) cells migrated from VZ/SVZ to the cortical plate (CP), where neurons are located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g,h</xref>). Moreover, the RFP+ cells migrated to the CP were positive for DCX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3i</xref>), confirming their neuronal identity. Immunostaining with Tbr1, another neuronal marker, was also performed. Quantification of the RFP+ cells that expressed Tbr1 revealed a much higher percentage of Tbr1+RFP+ cells in miR-219-electroporated brains than that in control RNA-electroporated brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3j</xref>). miR-219 has been shown to induce oligodendrocyte differentiation in <italic>in utero</italic> electroporated mouse brains collected at E17.5 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). However, we did not detect the induction of either astrocyte marker GFAP or oligodendrocyte marker MBP expression in miR-219-electroporated brains collected at E15.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2b,c</xref>), presumably because we analysed brains at an earlier cortical developmental stage when neurogenesis is active but gliogenesis is not yet. These results indicate that miR-219 inhibits mammalian NSC proliferation and promotes their neuronal differentiation during early brain development.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>miR-219 acts downstream of TLX to regulate NSC phenotypes</title>
<p>To confirm that miR-219 acts downstream of TLX in NSCs, we tested whether the effect of <italic>TLX</italic> knockdown on NSC proliferation and differentiation could be rescued by a miRNA hairpin inhibitor that is designed specifically to inhibit miR-219 action by interfering with miR-219 binding to downstream targets. When TLX siRNA was electroporated into the VZ/SVZ of E13.5 mouse brains, the percentage of RFP+Ki67+ cells was decreased markedly, compared to that in control RNA-electroporated brains. However, when TLX siRNA and the miR-219 inhibitor RNA were co-electroporated, the percentage of RFP+Ki67+ cells was recovered substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). On the other hand, an increasing number of TLX siRNA-electroporated cells migrated to the CP, compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). This phenotype is similar to the effect induced by electroporation of miR-219 into the VZ/SVZ of mouse brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g,h</xref>). In brains co-electroporated with TLX siRNA and the miR-219 inhibitor, the percentage of transfected cells that migrated to the CP was also restored towards the control level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>).

<title>PDGFRÎ± is a target gene of miR-219 and TLX in NSCs</title>
<p>To uncover mechanisms underlying miR-219-mediated regulation of NSC phenotypes, we identified potential miR-219 target genes using TargetScan, which revealed a set of candidate miR-219 tartgets, the 3â²-untranslated region (3â²-UTR) of which can base pair with miR-219. Among the candidate targets, <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic> is a confirmed miR-219 target<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and is expressed in NSCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. RTâPCR showed that the expression of <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic> was markedly decreased in <italic>TLX</italic> KO brains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Moreover, miR-219 repressed the activity of the luciferase reporter with the WT <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic> 3â²-UTR, but not that with the mutant 3â²-UTR, in which the base pairing with miR-219 was destroyed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>), suggesting that miR-219 inhibits <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic> expression.</p>
<p>Moreover, the expression of <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic>, similar to <italic>TLX</italic>, was relatively high in NSCs but low in neurons, whereas the expression of <italic>miR-219</italic> was relatively low in NSCs but increased in neurons, inversely correlating to the expression of <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic> and <italic>TLX</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3câe</xref>), supporting the concept that TLX represses the expression of <italic>miR-219</italic>, while miR-219 inhibits the expression of <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic>.</p>
<p>Next we tested whether overexpressing <italic>miR-219</italic> or knockdown of <italic>TLX</italic> regulates <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic> expression. Repression of <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic> expression was detected in <italic>miR-219</italic>-transfected NSCs and TLX siRNA-transfected NSCs, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref>), indicating that PDGFRÎ± indeed acts downstream of miR-219 and TLX. To determine whether inhibition of <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic> by TLX is mediated by upregulating <italic>miR-219</italic>, we co-transduced NSCs with lentivirus expressing TLX siRNA and lentivirus expressing TuD-miR-219, a tough decoy inhibitor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> of miR-219. Co-expressing TuD-miR-219 with TLX siRNA rescued the inhibition of <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic> expression by TLX siRNA substantially (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3g</xref>), suggesting that TLX regulates <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic> expression through miR-219. Taken together, these results demonstrate that <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic> is a downstream target gene of the TLX-miR-219 regulatory cascade.</p>
<p>We then tested how PDGFRÎ± regulates NSC proliferation and differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>In utero</italic> electroporation of PDGFRÎ± siRNA into E13.5 mouse brains reduced NSC proliferation as shown by decreased Ki67+RFP+ cells in the VZ/SVZ, whereas the number of RFP+ cells migrated to the CP was increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4aâd</xref>). To determine whether PDGFRÎ± is a critical downstream target gene of miR-219 in NSC regulation, we tested whether the effect of miR-219 on NSC proliferation and differentiation could be reversed by overexpressing <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic>. When PDGFRÎ± and an RFP reporter were electroporated together with miR-219, the number of RFP+Ki67+ cells in the VZ/SVZ increased substantially (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5a,c</xref>), whereas the RFP+ cells that migrated to the CP reduced considerably, compared to that in brains electroporated with RFP and miR-219 only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b,d</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic> is an important downstream target of miR-219 in regulating NSC proliferation and differentiation.</p>
<p>Because the expression of <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic> was reduced in <italic>TLX</italic> knockdown NSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3f,g</xref>), we determined whether overexpression of <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic> could rescue TLX siRNA-induced inhibition of NSC proliferation. Co-electroporation of PDGFRÎ± with TLX siRNA to E13.5 mouse brains showed an increase in the number of Ki67+RFP+ cells in the VZ/SVZ and a decrease in the number of RFP+ cells migrated to the CP, compared to electroporation with TLX siRNA alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6aâd</xref>). These results indicate that PDGFRÎ± acts downstream of TLX to regulate NSC proliferation and differentiation in mammalian brains.</p>

<title>A TLX peptide promotes miR-219 processing</title>
<p>To determine the region in TLX that is critical for the interaction with the miRNA processing machinery, we mapped the minimal domain of TLX for p68 and Drosha interactions by serial deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the TLX residues 340â359 were critical for the TLX-p68 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Deletion of TLX residues 340â359 also reduced the interaction of TLX with Drosha markedly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a,c</xref>). We therefore termed the TLX region spanning residues 340â359 as the Drosha/p68-interacting (Dpi) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether the Dpi domain interferes with the TLX-Drosha interaction, an HA-tagged TLX peptide containing the Dpi domain (Dpi) was co-expressed with HA-tagged full-length TLX (HA-TLX) and Flag-Drosha in HEK293T cells. The interaction of TLX with Drosha, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation, was substantially reduced when Dpi was co-expressed, compared to that when an empty vector (â) or a control peptide (C) was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). To determine the specificity of Dpi on the interaction of TLX with its interacting partners, we expressed Dpi together with HA-TLX and Flag-HDAC5, a known transcriptional co-repressor of TLX<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. In contrast to the interaction of TLX with Drosha, the interaction of TLX with HDAC5 was not blocked by Dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). These results indicate that Dpi specifically interferes with the interaction of TLX with Drosha, but not the interaction of TLX with a transcriptional co-regulator.</p>
<p>To determine whether the interaction between TLX and the miRNA processing machinery is critical for regulation of miR-219 processing by TLX, we used Dpi to block the interaction of TLX with the miRNA processing machinery and miR-219-Glo, a luciferase reporter containing the pri-miR-219 sequence in its 3â²-UTR to monitor miR-219 processing. Co-transfection of TLX with Dpi reduced the luciferase activity substantially, compared to transfection with TLX alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>), suggesting that expression of Dpi promoted miR-219 processing from pri-miR-219. In contrast, a control peptide that contains TLX residues outside the Dpi domain failed to boost miR-219 processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>).</p>
<p>We next electroporated the Dpi peptide into NSCs and determined miR-219 processing by evaluating the levels of the three forms of miR-219, pri-miR-219, pre-miR-219 and mature miR-219. The levels of both pre-miR-219 and mature miR-219 forms increased considerably, whereas no significant change was detected in the level of pri-miR-219 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5gâi</xref>). These results further demonstrate that expressing the Dpi peptide promotes miR-219 processing but has no effect on the transcription of pri-miR-219.</p>
<p>Next we tested whether expressing Dpi could affect NSC proliferation and differentiation. NSCs from E14.5 mouse brains were transduced with lentivirus expressing Dpi or a control peptide and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter. Compared to the control peptide, expression of Dpi reduced cell proliferation substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). To determine whether inhibition of NSC proliferation by Dpi is mediated by modulating miR-219, we co-transduced NSCs with Dpi and the miR-219 decoy inhibitor, TuD-miR-219. Expressing TuD-miR-219 rescued the Dpi-mediated inhibition of NSC proliferation substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>), suggesting that Dpi regulates NSC proliferation by modulating miR-219. Treatment with Dpi also increased the percentage of Tuj1-positive neurons significantly, compared to treatment with the control peptide, and co-expressing TuD-miR-219 reversed this effect largely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). These results together indicate that the Dpi peptide inhibits NSC proliferation and promotes neuronal differentiation by modulating miR-219 expression.</p>
<p>To determine the effect of Dpi on NSC proliferation and differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we electroporated a vector expressing a control peptide or Dpi together with an RFP reporter into E13.5 mouse brains <italic>in uterus</italic>. Expression of Dpi decreased Ki67+RFP+ cells in the VZ/SVZ, compared to expression of the control peptide. Co-electroporating Dpi with TuD-miR-219 rescued the reduced cell proliferation induced by Dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d,e</xref>). These results indicate that Dpi inhibits NSC proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic>, presumably through regulating miR-219 expression. On the other hand, more RFP+ cells that had been electroporated with the Dpi-expressing vector migrated from the VZ/SVZ to the CP. Co-electroporating Dpi- with TuD-miR-219 reversed the precocious migration largely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6f,g</xref>). These results indicate that Dpi promotes neuronal differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic> through modulating miR-219 action. Together with the observation that Dpi promotes miR-219 processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5fâi</xref>), these results suggest that modulation of miR-219 processing by TLX regulates NSC proliferation and differentiation.</p>

<title>Elevated miR-219 expression inhibits SCZ NSC proliferation</title>
<p>Elevated expression of <italic>miR-219</italic> has been observed in various brain regions of SCZ patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. The expression of <italic>miR-219</italic> in mammalian NSCs prompted us to ask whether <italic>miR-219</italic> expression is altered in SCZ NSCs. To address this question, we obtained induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from SCZ patients (D1 and D2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>) of pedigree H<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> with a 4-bp deletion in the coding sequence of the <italic>DISC1</italic> gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. This deletion causes a frameshift and premature termination of translation in DISC1 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). We differentiated the SCZ iPSCs into NSCs. WT NSCs derived from iPSCs of unaffected individuals (C1, C2 and C3) were used as controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Both SCZ and WT iPSC-derived NSCs expressed human NSC markers SOX1 and NESTIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>).</p>
<p>RTâPCR revealed that the level of miR-219 increased substantially in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant SCZ NSCs, compared to WT control NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). To determine whether the <italic>DISC1</italic> mutation is sufficient to induce elevated miR-219 expression in NSCs, we took advantage of the isogenic iPSC lines C1M and C3M, in which the 4-bp deletion seen in the SCZ patients was introduced into the <italic>DISC1</italic> gene in the WT control iPSC lines C1 and C3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Similar to what was seen in the SCZ NSCs, we observed a considerable increase in miR-219 level in C1M and C3M NSCs, compared to that in their isogenic WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). These results together indicate that miR-219 expression is elevated in NSCs of <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant SCZ patients, and that a <italic>DISC1</italic> mutation is sufficient to induce miR-219 upregulation in NSCs. In contrast to elevated <italic>miR-219</italic> expression, we observed reduced expression of <italic>TLX</italic> in both the <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant SCZ NSCs (D1 and D2) and the genetically engineered C1M and C3M NSCs that contain the <italic>DISC1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d</xref>). The inverse correlation between TLX and miR-219 expression in SCZ NSCs further supports our hypothesis that TLX negatively regulates miR-219 level in NSCs.</p>
<p>Reduced NSC proliferation has been observed in post-mortem brain specimens from SCZ patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and DISC1 has been shown to regulate NSC proliferation in the developing mouse cortex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. However, whether DISC1 regulates cell proliferation in human NSCs and whether mutant DISC1 induces abnormal NSC proliferation remained unknown. Our results showing that mutant DISC1 induces elevated expression of miR-219 in SCZ NSCs led us to hypothesize that increased expression of miR-219 induced by mutant DISC1 could result in abnormal cell proliferation in SCZ NSCs. To test this hypothesis, we first compared cell proliferation in WT and <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant SCZ NSCs by BrdU and SOX1 double labelling. The percentage of BrdU+SOX1+ cells was significantly reduced in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant SCZ NSCs, compared to that in WT control NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>). To test whether the <italic>DISC1</italic> mutation is sufficient for the observed proliferative defects, we compared cell proliferation in NSCs derived from the isogenic iPSC lines C1, C1M and C3, C3M. The decrease in NSC proliferation observed in SCZ NSCs was recapitulated in C1M and C3M NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>). To determine whether abnormal expression of miR-219 in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant NSCs tips the balance between human NSC proliferation and differentiation, we compared neuronal differentiation in WT and <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant NSCs under a spontaneous differentiation condition. Quantification of Tuj1+ neuronal cells revealed increased neuronal differentiation in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant NSCs, compared to WT NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7f</xref>), consistent with our observation of reduced NSC proliferation in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether elevated miR-219 expression is sufficient to reduce cell proliferation in human NSCs, we overexpressed miR-219 in WT NSCs using a miR-219-expressing retroviral vector, and NSC proliferation was determined by BrdU and SOX1 double labelling. Reduced cell proliferation was observed in miR-219-overexpressing WT NSCs compared to control vector-expressing WT NSCs, in a manner similar to the reduced cell proliferation observed in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant NSCs when compared to WT NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8a</xref>). In parallel, the miR-219-overexpressing WT NSCs were induced for neuronal differentiation. The rate of neuronal differentiation was determined by the percentage of Tuj1+ cells. Overexpression of miR-219 in WT NSCs also increased neuronal differentiation rate, compared to that in control vector-treated WT NSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). These results indicate that elevated miR-219 expression is sufficient to inhibit cell proliferation in human NSCs. Together with our observation that miR-219 expression is abnormally upregulated in SCZ NSCs, these results suggest that the abnormally elevated miR-219 expression could be an underlying factor for reduced NSC proliferation observed in SCZ patients.</p>
<p>To determine whether the proliferative defect in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant NSCs indeed resulted from abnormally elevated miR-219 expression, we inhibited miR-219 in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant NSCs using TuD-miR-219. NSC proliferation was monitored by BrdU and SOX1 double labelling. Treating the <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant NSCs (D1, D2, C1M and C3M) with TuD-miR-219 increased the proliferative rate in these cells substantially, largely rescuing the proliferative defects of the <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>). Treatment with TuD-miR-219 also reversed the elevated differentiation in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant NSCs considerably, as revealed by the reduced percentage of Tuj1+ cells, compared to that in cells treated with a control vector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). These results indicate that miR-219 plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant SCZ NSCs and that a miR-219 inhibitor could rescue the proliferative defect in these cells.</p>
<p>In addition to elevated <italic>miR-219</italic> expression in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant SCZ NSCs, we also detected reduced expression of <italic>TLX</italic> in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant SCZ NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). To test whether <italic>TLX</italic> knockdown is able to reduce cell proliferation in human NSCs, we transduced WT NSCs with a TLX siRNA-expressing lentiviral vector. Reduced cell proliferation was observed in <italic>TLX</italic> knockdown WT NSCs, compared to control vector-transduced WT NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8c</xref>). To test whether increase of <italic>TLX</italic> expression could rescue the proliferative defect in SCZ NSCs, we overexpressed <italic>TLX</italic> in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant NSCs. Elevated expression of <italic>TLX</italic> in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant NSCs increased cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8d</xref>), consistent with the observation in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant NSCs treated with TuD-miR-219 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8b</xref>). These results together indicate that the TLX-miR-219 cascade is important in regulating cell proliferation in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant SCZ NSCs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have demonstrated that TLX regulates miRNA processing independent of its well-characterized role in transcriptional regulation, and that miR-219 acts downstream of TLX to regulate NSC proliferation and differentiation in mammalian brains. Moreover, we have shown that <italic>miR-219</italic> expression is elevated, whereas <italic>TLX</italic> expression is reduced, in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant SCZ patient iPSC-derived NSCs. Overexpression of TLX or inhibition of miR-219 could rescue the reduced cell proliferation in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant SCZ NSCs.</p>
<p>This study identified an unexpected role for TLX in miRNA maturation at the post-transcriptional level beyond transcriptional regulation. In an unbiased search for TLX-interacting proteins, we identified the RNA helicase p68, a component of the miRNA processing machinery, as a novel TLX-interacting protein. Further study revealed that TLX also interacts with p68-associated Drosha and DGCR8, the two main components of miRNA processing machinery. We show here that TLX inhibits miR-219 processing by interacting with the p68/Drosha/DGCR8 complex, which in turn prevents the miRNA processing machinery from binding to miR-219 primary form. Either knockdown of TLX or blocking the interaction between TLX and the miRNA processing machinery resulted in potent induction of pre-miR-219 and mature miR-219 expression, but had minimal effect on pri-miR-219 expression. The concept that a transcription factor like TLX can participate in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression may serve as a general paradigm for many of these classes of cellular factors to control cell-fate determination.</p>
<p>We detected robust inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of neuronal differentiation when miR-219 was overexpressed in NSCs. However, no obvious change in cell proliferation and differentiation was observed in NSCs treated with miR-219 inhibitor, presumably because the basal miR-219 expression level is low in NSCs. In TLX siRNA-treated NSCs, where miR-219 expression level was elevated, inhibition of miR-219 was able to rescue the proliferative defect and precocious differentiation. It is also possible that the action of other miRNAs, such as miR-9, miR-124, miR-137, miR-338 or let-7, could compensate for miR-219 inhibition in NSCs. miR-219 has been shown to induce oligodendrocyte differentiation in electroporated mouse brains that were collected at E17.5 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). However, we did not detect the induction of oligodendrocyte marker expression in miR-219-electroporated mouse brains collected at E15.5, presumably because we collected brains at an earlier stage that is active for neurogenesis but not for gliogenesis yet. It is possible that miR-219 could play distinct roles at different developmental stages.</p>
<p>miR-219 is dysregulated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including SCZ, bipolar disorder and depression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Understanding the regulation of <italic>miR-219</italic> expression in mammalian brains will not only broaden our knowledge about neurodevelopment, but also provide insights into the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. In this study, we show that TLX represses <italic>miR-219</italic> biogenesis in NSCs during mouse brain development. We also identified <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic> as a downstream target of the TLX-miR-219 cascade in NSCs. PDGFRÎ± has been shown to be expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> and play a role in oligodendrocyte differentiation downstream of miR-219 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). We show here that knockdown of <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic> expression induced NSC phenotypes similar to that induced by <italic>miR-219</italic> overexpression, whereas overexpression of <italic>PDGFRÎ±</italic> restored NSC phenotypes induced by miR-219 overexpression or TLX siRNA treatment.</p>
<p>DISC1 is required for mouse NSC proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. However, little is known about its function in human NSCs. In this study, we have found a role for DISC1 in regulating human NSC proliferation by studying NSCs derived from <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant SCZ patient iPSCs and genetically engineered isogenic iPSCs with an introduced <italic>DISC1</italic> mutation. Our observation that <italic>miR-219</italic> expression is upregulated, whereas <italic>TLX</italic> expression is downregulated, in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant NSCs provides a direct link between TLX and miR-219 expression and DISC1 function. Previous studies have shown that <italic>TLX</italic> KO mice exhibit neuroanatomical and behavioural abnormalities similar to that in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant mice and SCZ patients, including increased lateral ventricles, reduced cerebral cortex, reduced neurogenesis and memory, and increased anxiety and hyperactivity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Our result of altered expression of TLX in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant NSCs suggests that mutant DISC1 could regulate TLX expression, which in turn induces abnormal miR-219 expression and inhibition of NSC proliferation.</p>
<p>SCZ is a neurodevelopmental disorder for which the pathological mechanism remains elusive. Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs may play important roles in the aetiology of SCZ<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. miRNA-219 is highly upregulated in the prefrontal cortex of SCZ patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and mediates the behavioural effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. However, whether miR-219 plays a role in SCZ pathogenesis remained unknown. Our study has identified a novel role for miR-219 in SCZ NSCs; elevated miR-219 expression reduces SCZ NSC proliferation.</p>
<p>Multiple studies provide evidence that NSC proliferation and neurogenesis are tightly linked to SCZ pathogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. Recent studies using patient iPSCs have identified phenotypic differences in human iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref> and provided insights into how risk factors for SCZ regulate NSC phenotypes and neurodevelopment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. In this study, we have provided a direct link between <italic>DISC1</italic> mutation and altered <italic>TLX</italic> and <italic>miR-219</italic> expression, and a causative link between dysregulated <italic>TLX</italic> and <italic>miR-219</italic> expression and proliferative defects in <italic>DISC1</italic>-mutant SCZ NSCs. Our study provides a molecular mechanism underlying defective NSC proliferation in SCZ. Moreover, our study suggests that both TLX and miR-219 could be potential therapeutic targets for SCZ, and that TLX inducers or miR-219 inhibitors may serve as potential therapeutic tools to maintain normal NSC proliferation in SCZ patients.</p>
