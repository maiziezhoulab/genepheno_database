<abstract id="ABS1">
<sec id="S1">
<title>Background:</title>
<p id="P1">While there is strong evidence that genetic risk factors play an important role in the etiologies of structural birth defects, compared to other diseases, there have been relatively few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these conditions. We reviewed the current landscape of GWAS conducted for birth defects, noting novel insights, and future directions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p id="P2">This article reviews the literature with regard to GWAS of structural birth defects. Key defects included in this review include oral clefts, congenital heart defects (CHDs), biliary atresia, pyloric stenosis, hypospadias, craniosynostosis, and clubfoot. Additionally, other issues related to GWAS are considered, including the assessment of polygenic risk scores and issues related to genetic ancestry, as well as utilizing genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism array data to evaluate geneâ€“environment interactions and Mendelian randomization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S3">
<title>Results:</title>
<p id="P3">For some birth defects, including oral clefts and CHDs, several novel susceptibility loci have been identified and replicated through GWAS, including 8q24 for oral clefts, <italic>DGKK</italic> for hypospadias, and 4p16 for CHDs. Relatively common birth defects for which there are currently no published GWAS include neural tube defects, anotia/microtia, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, gastroschisis, and omphalocele.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p id="P4">Overall, GWAS have been successful in identifying several novel susceptibility genes and genomic regions for structural birth defects. These findings have provided new insights into the etiologies of these phenotypes. However, GWAS have been underutilized for understanding the genetic etiologies of several birth defects.</p>
