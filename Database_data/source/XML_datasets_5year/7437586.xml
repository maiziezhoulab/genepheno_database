<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is a serious neurological disease, often resulting in long-term neurodevelopmental disorders among surviving children. However, whether these neurodevelopmental issues can be passed to offspring remains unclear. The right common carotid artery of 7-day-old parental-generation rats was subjected to permanent ligation using a vessel electrocoagulator. Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic rat models were established by subjecting the rats to 8% O<sub>2</sub>–92% N<sub>2</sub> for 2 hours. The results showed that 24 hours after hypoxia and ischemia, pathological damage, cerebral atrophy, liquefaction, and impairment were found, and Zea-Longa scores were significantly increased. The parental-generation rats were propagated at 3 months old, and offspring were obtained. No changes in the overall brain structures of these offspring rats were identified by magnetic resonance imaging. However, the escape latency was longer and the number of platform crossings was reduced among these offspring compared with normal rats. These results indicated that the offspring of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy model rats displayed cognitive impairments in learning and memory. This study was approved by the Animal Care &amp; Welfare Committee of Kunming Medical University, China in 2018 (approval No. kmmu2019072).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), a clinical syndrome associated with neurological dysfunction, is characterized by difficulty initiating and maintaining respiration, disturbed consciousness, decreased muscular tension, pathological reflexes, and seizures. HIE often occurs during the first day of life in term-born and late preterm neonates, with an incidence as high as 1–3% (Graham et al., 2008; Kurinczuk et al., 2010; Selway, 2010; Wachtel and Hendricks-Munoz, 2011). Importantly, 15–20% of affected newborns (1–3 per 1000 full-term births) die during the postnatal period, and an additional 25% will experience severe and permanent neuropsychological sequelae (Vannucci and Perlman, 1997).</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that HIE could lead to secondary injuries, such as reperfusion injury, edema, increased intracranial pressure, impaired autoregulation, and hemorrhage (Galinsky et al., 2018; Kawarai et al., 2018; Davies et al., 2019), which are known to be pathological mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epilepsy, behavioral deficits, learning disorders, and cerebral palsy (Leviton and Nelson, 1992; Vannucci et al., 1999; Ferriero, 2004; Vannucci and Hagberg, 2004; Sasaoka et al., 2009). Although the underlying pathophysiology of neonatal HIE, including oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, inflammation, and apoptosis (Ferriero, 2004), has been intensively studied, few successful treatments for neonatal HIE have been identified. Hypoxia-ischemia (HI) conditions increase the risks of autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children (Driscoll et al., 2018). A previous study demonstrated that prenatal and perinatal complications that cause HI are also associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (Getahun et al., 2013). Most current studies examining the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of HIE have focused on term infants with moderate and severe HIE and have reported increases in the incidence of motor and cognitive neurological disabilities (Mwaniki et al., 2012). The existence of long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities in surviving babies has spontaneously drawn our attention to their offspring. In view of the above-mentioned devastating impacts of HIE on neonatal brain development, whether the offspring of patients with HIE suffer from similar neurological dysfunctions has not been well-examined, although these patients are able and likely to have and raise children. Thus, this question deserves further investigation. This study evaluated the neurobehavioral functions and brain morphologies of HI rat models and detected the neurobehavioral changes in their offspring.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="sec2-1">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Fifty healthy, 7-day-old, specific-pathogen-free, Sprague- Dawley rat pups of both sexes (male/female ratio 1:1), ranging from 12–15 g, were provided by the Department of Zoology of Kunming Medical University, China (license No. K2015-0002). Animal care and all experimental protocols were in strict accordance with the Chinese Experimental Animal Protection and Ethics Committee and the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The animal protocol was approved in 2018 by the Animal Care &amp; Welfare Committee of Kunming Medical University (approval No. kmmu2019072). All animals were raised with their mothers, in plastic cages, containing softwood, and free access to food and water, at 21–25°C, and humidity of 50–60%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-2">
<title>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain model establishment and experimental groups</title>
<p>Seven-day-old Sprague-Dawley parental-generation rats were equally and randomly divided into sham group and HI group. All animals were anesthetized by the inhalation of isoflurane (RWD Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) and placed in a supine position. Their cervical skin was incised to expose the right common carotid artery, which was subjected to permanent ligation with a vessel electrocoagulator (Spring Medical Beauty Equipment Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China). Sham animals underwent the same procedure, without artery ligation. The neonates were placed onto an electric blanket until awake and returned to their cages with their mothers for 1 hour. The pups were placed in a chamber under a hot lamp, to maintain the temperature at 37°C, and subjected to 8% O<sub>2</sub>–92% N<sub>2</sub> for 2 hours. The air temperature was continuously detected and maintained at 37°C, with humidity at 60–70%. Parental-generation (P) rats were divided into P-Sham and P-HI groups (<italic>n</italic> = 6/group). The P rats were propagated at 3 months old and were housed in standard animal house in a 12-hour light-dark cycle at 21–25°C and air humidity of 50–60% with food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The offspring were divided into Sham-F1 and HI-F1 groups, based on their parent status.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-3">
<title>2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining</title>
<p>To identify the establishment of the HI model, P rats were randomly selected for 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, 24 hours after HI (<italic>n</italic> = 5/group). After anesthesia, the brains were quickly removed and incubated at –20°C for approximately 20 minutes. A 2-mm thick brain tissue section was taken 1 mm behind the olfactory bulb and cut into 4 pieces of equal size and shape. The brain slices were incubated in 2% TTC (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), in the dark, at 37°C, for approximately 30 minutes. The slices were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, for approximately 24 hours, for observation and image acquisition. The infarct size was traced and analyzed using ImageJ Software (Version 1.43u; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The infarct percentage was calculated as (contralateral hemisphere volume – non-infarct ipsilateral hemisphere volume)/contralateral hemisphere volume × 100. Brain swelling was calculated as infarct hemisphere volume – non-infarct hemisphere volume.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-4">
<title>Zea-Longa score</title>
<p>The neurobehavioral scores of the P rats were evaluated at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after HI, according to the Zea-Longa neurological deficits score (Liu et al., 2019), to determine the establishment of the HI model (<italic>n</italic> = 20/group). The scoring criteria are as follows: 0 points: behavior is completely normal, without any symptoms of neurological deficit; 1 point: mild neurological deficit, dysfunction in stretching the left forelimb; 2 points: moderate neurological deficit, rats cannot go straight and walk forward because the body continues to turn to the side; 3 points: severe neurological deficit, rats cannot stand and fall to the left when standing; 4 points: Rats cannot walk spontaneously, loss of consciousness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-5">
<title>Hematoxylin-eosin staining</title>
<p>To investigate the morphological changes in cortical and hippocampal tissues from P rats, hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed. The extracted tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4), embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm. After transfer to glass slides, the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Wuxi Jiangyuan Industrial Technology and Trade Corporation, Wuxi, China). Subsequently, the morphological changes in both sham and HI groups were observed under a light microscope (CX40, Shunyu, Ningbo, China). The thickness of the cortex and the hippocampus was measured based on a vertical line perpendicular to the surface of the brain (4.0 mm lateral to the midline and 4.5 mm posterior to the bregma).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-6">
<title>Culture of primary cortical neurons</title>
<p>Postnatal-day-1 Sprague-Dawley P rats were intragastrically administered 75% alcohol and placed on ice. The cerebral cortexes were harvested and homogenized, followed by isolation with 0.25% trypsin, for 10 minutes, at 37°C, and then eluted with 10% fetal bovine serum. After centrifugation at 15,000 r/min, at room temperature, for 5 minutes, the supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was resuspended in complete culture medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA), containing high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM), 10% fetal calf serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution. Cells were subsequently placed in a 6-well plate containing three coverslips, coated with 50 μg/mL poly-d-lysine and laminin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), at 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL, for 4 hours. The medium was replaced with neurobasal medium (Hyclone), containing 2% B27 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The culture medium was replaced the following day, and one-half change was performed every 3 days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-7">
<title>Oxygen-glucose deprivation</title>
<p>Primary cortical neurons were cultured for 5 days, washed three times with PBS, and then placed into glucose-free medium (Gibco, Shanghai, China) at 37°C. Subsequently, the cells were transferred into a hypoxia chamber, equipped with a compact oxygen controller (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to maintain the inner concentration of 1% O<sub>2</sub>, 94% N<sub>2</sub>, and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, at 37°C, for 2 hours. Afterward, cells were reoxygenated by replacing the medium with normal DMEM and incubation in 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, for 24 hours.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-8">
<title>Terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling and Tuj1 staining</title>
<p>Terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) and Tuj1 staining were employed to detect neuronal apoptosis and morphological changes in the cortical neurons of P rats. Sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes, after three rinses with PBS, for 5 minutes each time. After rinsing with PBS again, sections were sealed with PBS, containing 0.1% Triton, in an ice bath, for 2 minutes. The TUNEL reaction mixture was prepared in the dark by combining the enzyme solution and the label solution at a ratio of 1:9, on ice. The specimens were incubated in a dark box, at 37°C, for 1 hour, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), containing an anti-fluorescence quencher, was added to the cells, for 3 minutes, at room temperature. Green staining represents TUNEL-positive cells, red staining represents Tuj1-positive cells, and blue staining represents DAPI-positive cells. Positively stained cells were observed under a high-content cell imaging system (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), and images from each slice were randomly collected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-9">
<title>Magnetic resonance imaging</title>
<p>Modern magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques provide excellent anatomical definition and tissue contrast that have led to the identification of specific acute changes in signal intensity and injury patterns associated with HIE (Hochwald et al., 2014). All the T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) tests were performed using a 7.0 T magnetic resonance scanner (Bruker Biospec 70/30, Ettlingen, Germany), with a 75-mm diameter volume coil for radiofrequency pulse transmission and a quadrature surface coil for signal detection, on P rats and F1-rats. During the imaging sessions, the animals were anesthetized as described previously. The body temperatures of all rats were maintained constantly at 37°C, using a heating blanket, and monitored with a rectal temperature probe. T2WI anatomical images were acquired from TS, through a rapid acquisition with spin-echo sequence, using the following parameters: repetition time = 2961.5 ms; echo time = 33 ms; field of view = 3.5 cm × 3.5 cm; matrix = 256 × 256; and slice thickness = 1.0 mm. The total acquisition time was 10 minutes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-10">
<title>Neurological severity score</title>
<p>The neurobehavioral conditions of the P rats were assessed at 2 and 3 months after HI, using a 10-point neurological severity score (Lin et al., 2019). The neurological severity score was used to evaluate the abilities of the rats to perform ten different tasks, assessing motor abilities, balance, and alertness. The tasks comprised an exit circle, monopoiesis/hemiparesis, straight walk, startle reflex, seeking behavior, beam balancing, round stick balancing, and beam walking at 1, 2 and 3 cm. A score of one point indicated that none of the tasks could be performed. All neurobehavioral evaluations were performed by two investigators who were blinded to the experimental groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-11">
<title>Morris water maze test</title>
<p>To test the learning and memory abilities of P and F1 rats, the Morris water maze was performed at 2 and 3 months after HI and 3 and 4 months after birth, respectively, as previously described (Chen et al., 2018). The Morris experimental system (Xinruan Information Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) is composed of a water maze device and an automatic image collection and software analysis system. In this experiment, the Morris water maze device was a 120-cm wide and 56-cm high round pool. The water tank was filled with milky white opaque water, at 18–20°C, to a 30-cm depth. The test was conducted including training and probe trial for 6 consecutive days. The pool was divided into four quadrants, with separate marks that were used to indicate the water entry point in each quadrant. A 10-cm wide cylindrical escape platform was placed 1.5 cm below the water surface and 30 cm away from the wall, in the second quadrant. Furthermore, an automatic camera system was set up over the pool to track the swimming routes of the rats. Before the experiment, the rats were placed in the proper start position, facing the tank wall, and allowed to swim freely for 120 seconds in a separate pool, for acclimation, to reduce their fear response and the generation of feces. A computer tracking program was started when the animal was released into the water. Tracking System SMART 3.0 (Panlab, Spain) was used to record the escape latency and the number of platform crossings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-12">
<title>Y-maze test</title>
<p>The Y-maze test was evaluated at 2 and 3 months after HI. The Y-maze device, provided by Shanghai Xinsoft (Shanghai, China), consisted of three arms including initial, wrong, and food arms. The P rats were fasted for 1–2 days, reducing their body weights to 85% of the original weight. In the adaptation period, they were placed in the middle of the apparatus and allowed to move through the maze for approximately 10 minutes, adapted to 2–3 times per day, a total of 1 day, and there is no need to put food (this adaption can be synchronized with the fasting period). During 1-day training period, the food (chocolate or bait) was placed in an arm of the Y maze. The door of the other arm was closed, and the rats were placed in the initial arm to find the food. Finally, the doors of the three arms of the Y-maze were simultaneously opened, with no food; the rats were placed in the starting arm. The arm entries of each rat were observed and recorded and the number of times the rats entered each arm within 5 minutes and the residence time in each arm were recorded (Gastambide et al., 2015).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-13">
<title>Rotarod test</title>
<p>The rotarod test was performed at 2 and 3 months after HI, as previously described (Mori et al., 2015). Three days before the experiment, adaptive training was performed for P rats, and then the rats were placed on a rotating rod to adapt to the movement on the rod. The rotation speed of the rod was set to 30–35 r/min. The rats were trained for 5–10 minutes per day, for 3 consecutive days. During the following experiment, the rotating rod was set to accelerate from 4 r/min to 40 r/min, within 3 minutes, and the time the rats remained on the rod was recorded. The test was performed continuously, three times a day, and the longest time was marked.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-14">
<title>Detection of brain weight and percentage of brain atrophy</title>
<p>Two months after HI, the weight of the cerebral hemisphere was measured in P rats. Next, a 2-mm thick brain tissue section was taken 1 mm behind the olfactory bulb and cut into six pieces. These pieces were photographed using a digital camera and traced and analyzed using ImageJ software (Version 1.43u; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The percentage of brain atrophy was calculated as (contralateral hemisphere volume – non-infarct ipsilateral hemisphere volume)/contralateral hemisphere volume × 100.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-15">
<title>Body weight detection</title>
<p>Starting from the first day, when F1 pups were born, the body weight of each rat was measured using an electronic balance (Shanghai Puchun Measure Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) at the same time every day for 1 month, and the data were recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-16">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). All measurement data were expressed as the mean ± SD. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was applied to process the results of the water maze test. Independent-sample Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was applied to all other data. For multiple-group comparisons, analysis of variance, followed by Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test, was used. Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used to analyze the data between the two groups. A value of <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p>

<p>P rats suffered from cerebral ischemia and hypoxia following the ligation of the right common carotid artery and subjection to 8% O<sub>2</sub>–92% N<sub>2</sub> for 2 hours during the neonatal period. The right cerebral hemisphere of the HI group exhibited obvious infarction and brain swelling compared with the sham group, as determined by TTC staining 24 hours after HI (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">D</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, after the successful establishment of HIE P model rats, morphological measures of brain growth and development in parental rats with HI-induced brain injuries were significantly different from those in sham rats, whereas the cerebral structural variations were not notable in F1 rats. Furthermore, the results of behavioral tests showed significant differences between the two groups of F1 rats, suggesting that the offspring of parental HI rats exhibited significant learning and memory ability dysfunctions. These data demonstrated that the offspring of parental rats with HI-induced injuries suffered neurodevelopmental defects.</p>
<p>Many animal experiments have confirmed that perinatal brain injury, the primary cause of neonatal HIE, can cause neurological deficits, brain edema, and astrocyte swelling (Li et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015) and might impair juvenile recognition memory (Domnick et al., 2015). Early HI brain injuries have been shown to disrupt cortical activity in neonatal rodent models, similar to the findings in human preterm newborns who suffer brain injuries. Studies have shown that neonatal rats experience severe neurological deficits and large numbers of nerve cell deaths during the early stages after cerebral ischemia. In fundamental agreement with these reports, the findings in the current study demonstrated cortical and hippocampal damage in an HI rat model. In our study, the Zea-Longa scores during the early stage of brain injury indicated that HI rats experienced significant neurological deficits. Simultaneously, TTC staining and MRI showed large areas of infarction in the injured cerebral hemisphere. Furthermore, hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that the sensorimotor cortex of rats was seriously damaged by HI. Moreover, after OGD in rat primary cortical neurons, TUNEL and Tuj1 staining showed increased apoptotic cell numbers and decreased neuronal numbers. In addition, infarction and tissue structure damage could be observed in the hippocampus, which represents the underlying mechanisms of the cognitive impairment observed in adult rats (Ehrenreich, 2017). As expected, behavioral tests performed in rats 2 and 3 months after HI, including neurological severity score, Morris water maze, Y-maze, and rotarod tests, showed that HI rats demonstrated significant memory, attention and executive ability impairments.</p>
<p>The offspring of individuals with mental diseases, such as schizophrenia, depression, and autism, regardless of whether they are caused by abnormal development or environmental factors, are at high risk of developing similar diseases (Green et al., 2018). In addition, several studies have suggested that the children of mothers with mental diseases were more likely to experience variant dysfunctions, such as psychological disorders (Parreco et al., 2018). High-risk offspring had higher rates of subthreshold mania or hypomania, manic, mixed, or hypomanic episodes, and major depressive episodes, and high-risk offspring also had higher rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (Davis et al., 2017). Therefore, to investigate whether the developmental symptoms experienced by parental HI patients could impact their children, HI model rats were mated (both parents suffered from HI insults). In accordance with the MRI and Morris water maze test results, no significant differences in cerebral morphology were observed between offspring of HI rats and offspring of normal rats; however, the spatial learning and memory abilities were notably impaired in the offspring of HI rats, indicating that the offspring of parents with HIE may also suffer from neurological dysfunction, which may be associated with genetic factors or other reasons.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that mothers with schizophrenia, parental posttraumatic stress disorder, and postnatal depression, in addition to heritable pathogenic genes, have subtle impacts on the behavior of their offspring due to their lack of normal behavioral models and feeding patterns (Schurhoff et al., 2019). In the present study, on the one hand, the genetic acquisition of pathogenic genes may lead to cognitive impairment in offspring. On the other hand, due to HI-induced deficits, HIE-model female rats may be incapable of taking care of their babies and teaching them properly, which may result in the offspring exhibiting similar neurological impairments.</p>
<p>HI injury appears to be sex-specific, and treatments for HI injury are therefore sex-dependent (Demarest et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2016; Waddell et al., 2016). In this study, we only studied the offspring of parental rats with HI insults and found behavioral changes in the offspring of HI rats. Given the notable different sex outcomes following HI injury and the need to exclude pubertal hormonal bias during adolescent social testing, in future studies whether social deficits and biochemical changes are decided by single parents or sex-specific pathways should be clarified.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these findings suggested that the offspring of HI rats have spatial learning and memory ability dysfunctions, which might be associated with parental genes or parental behavioral influences. However, the effects on the hippocampal neurons in the offspring of HI rats and the causes of cognitive impairment have not been further discussed in this study. The underlying causes of behavioral dysfunction require further in-depth investigations in the future. However, our study revealed a new direction for HI research, by investigating offspring, and provided a theoretical reference for clinical treatment, which could be an important indicator of the need to screen offspring for cognitive dysfunction when patients are subjected to HI during the perinatal period.</p>
