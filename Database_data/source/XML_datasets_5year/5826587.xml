<abstract>
<p id="P1">Adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs throughout life and supports healthy brain functions. The production of new neurons decreases with age and deficiencies in adult neurogenesis are associated with neurodevelopmental and degenerative disease. The rate of neurogenesis is dynamically sensitive to one’s environmental conditions and experiences, and certain stimuli are known to robustly enhance neurogenesis in rodent models, including voluntary exercise, enriched environment, and electroconvulsive shock. In these models, information about an organism’s environment and physiological state are relayed to neurogenic cell types within the hippocampus through a series of tissue and cellular interfaces, ultimately eliciting a neurogenic response from neural stem cells and newborn neurons. Therefore, understanding how novel genes and proteins act in specific cell types within this circuit-level context is of scientific and therapeutic value. Several well-studied neurotrophic factors have been implicated in environmentally-enhanced neurogenesis, and this review will serve to highlight recently-discovered, novel molecular mediators of neurogenesis in response to environmental cues. Furthermore, the contribution of advancing large-scale gene expression and function assessment technology to past, present, and future efforts to elucidate cell type-specific molecular mediators of environmentally-enhanced neurogenesis will be summarized.</p>
