<abstract>
<p>Synaptic vesicles (SVs) form distinct pools at synaptic terminals, and this well-regulated separation is necessary for normal neurotransmission. However, how the SV cluster, in particular synaptic compartments, maintains normal neurotransmitter release remains a mystery. The presynaptic protein Neurexin (NRX) plays a significant role in synaptic architecture and function, and some evidence suggests that NRX is associated with neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders. However, the role of NRX in SV clustering is unclear. Here, using the neuromuscular junction at the 2–3 instar stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae as a model and biochemical imaging and electrophysiology techniques, we demonstrate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> NRX (DNRX) plays critical roles in regulating synaptic terminal clustering and release of SVs. We found that DNRX controls the terminal clustering and release of SVs by stimulating presynaptic F-actin. Furthermore, our results indicate that DNRX functions through the scaffold protein Scribble and the GEF protein DPix to activate the small GTPase Ras-related C3 Botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1). We observed a direct interaction between the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of DNRX and the PDZ domains of Scribble and that Scribble bridges DNRX to DPix, forming a DNRX–Scribble–DPix complex that activates Rac1 and subsequently stimulates presynaptic F-actin assembly and SV clustering. Taken together, our work provides important insights into the function of DNRX in regulating SV clustering, which could help inform further research into pathological <italic>neurexin</italic>-mediated mechanisms in neurological disorders such as autism.</p>

<body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons are the basic unit of the nervous system, and they communicate with each other through synapses. After being captured by our sensory organs, neural signals pass between synapses in the form of neurotransmitters. As the vehicles of neurotransmitters, synaptic vesicles (SV)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1"><sup>2</sup></xref> are essential for neurotransmission. SVs can be divided into three distinct pools according to their localization and function. The SVs adjacent to the active zone and ready to be released are referred to as the ready release pool. The second pool of vesicles is the exo/endo-cycling pool, which is also found close to release sites and supplies the ready release pool. Finally, the pool located away from the active zone, and that contains the majority of SVs, is referred to as the reserve pool and is considered to be a storage pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Actin is a major part of the cytoskeleton that is required for maintaining the architecture of synapses as well as contributing to their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), and a significant amount of evidence has shown that the localization, translocation, and release of SVs can be altered by disturbing the polymerization of pre-synaptic actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>The synapse is a highly specialized structure, and synaptogenesis is a highly complex process. Previous studies have shown that synaptic adhesive molecules play important roles in synaptogenesis and neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), and a number of synaptic cell adhesion molecules, including Neuroligins and Neurexins have been identified over the past few decades. Neurexin was first recognized as a receptor for α-latrotoxin, a black widow spider venom component that triggers massive neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). There are three <italic>neurexin</italic> genes in mammals, each of which has two promoters generating α-Neurexin and β-Neurexins, whereas there is only one <italic>neurexin-1</italic> gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<italic>dnrx</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Recent studies both in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals showed that Neurexin plays a significant role in synaptic architecture and function, and there is evidence suggesting that <italic>neurexin</italic> is associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The complexity and redundancy of the <italic>neurexin</italic> genes in mammals motivated us to focus on simpler model systems, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, to investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of DNRX.</p><p>Neurexin has been shown to bind to several molecules, including the presynaptic scaffolding proteins Mint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), CASK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), and LRRTM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Recently, DNRX also has been demonstrated to interact with the <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor to regulate short-term synaptic depression and to interact with Spinophilin to maintain active zone architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). A typical trans-synaptic complex is formed by the heterophilic interaction of presynaptic Neurexins and postsynaptic Neuroligins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), and these complexes have attracted much attention as scaffolding complexes that not only maintain the normal structure of the synapse but also function in passing signals across the synapses. It is thus clear that Neurexin is a multifunctional molecule. Despite the identification and characterization of these proteins that functionally associated with DNRX, our understanding of the pathways including DNRX that control synaptic function are still incomplete, with other partners and mechanisms yet to be uncovered and analyzed.</p><p>In this study, we have investigated the role of DNRX in the cluster and release of SVs at synaptic terminals. We demonstrate that the effect of DNRX is mediated by presynaptic F-actin and there is a direct interaction between the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of DNRX and the PDZ domains of the tumor suppressor protein Scribble. Furthermore, we find that Scribble bridges DNRX to DPix, forming a DNRX–Scribble–DPix complex to activate Rac1 and affect presynaptic F-actin assembly and SV clustering. Taken together, these studies provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of neurotransmitter release by DNRX.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>The clustering and release of SVs at the synaptic terminal is altered in dnrx mutants</title><p>To better understand the role of Neurexin at the synapse, we investigated whether there are some additional defects after ablating <italic>dnrx</italic>. Previous studies both in mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic> have shown that Neurexin affects neurotransmitter release, and that the excitatory junction potential (EJP) amplitude and miniature EJP (mEJP) frequency are altered in the <italic>neurexin</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether the localization and membrane fusion of SVs would be affected in a <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant. As a marker of synaptic activity, we used Synaptotagmin (SYT), which is a synaptic vesicle membrane protein and calcium sensor that is efficiently transported to presynaptic terminals and is expressed in specific regions of the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), to indicate SV.</p><p>To assess the defects of SVs in <italic>dnrx</italic> mutants, we observed the synaptic terminal SV distribution of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) at different development stages of larvae from 2 to 3 instar. We found that loss of DNRX resulted in an ∼200% increase in the ratio of SYT-diffused boutons when compared with controls. Just as we expected, this defect could be fully rescued by overexpressing full-length <italic>dnrx</italic> cDNA within the pre-synapse in the <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant at 2 instar larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>A–C</italic>″ and <italic>J</italic>). When it turned to 3 instar larvae we got the same result for losing of DNRX resulted in an ∼300% increase in the ratio of SYT-diffused boutons when compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>D–F</italic>″ and <italic>K</italic>). Synapsin (SYN) is also a SV protein, which is localized at the SV membrane and can be used as another SV marker. We observed that the distribution of synaptic terminal SVs is diffused in <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>G–I</italic>″ and <italic>L</italic>). To be able to show the relative position of active zone (AZ) and SVs at the same time, we employed the <italic>syt::gfp</italic> knock-in fly with an integrated <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant background. Confocal images of third instar larvae NMJ boutons double labeled with active zone protein Bruchpilot (BRP) and GFP showed that loss of DNRX disrupted the distribution of terminal SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, M–<italic>P</italic>). The representative diagrammatic sketch illustrates the distribution of SVs in the <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>Q</italic>). To make our measurements more precise, we turned to stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy to visualize the terminal distribution of SVs, and we observed the same phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>R–R</italic>″). To determine whether the number of SVs and synapses were changed in <italic>dnrx</italic> mutants, we detected the number and density of AZ in <italic>wild-type</italic> and <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant and the immunostaining results showed that the number of AZ of single bouton is increased, whereas the AZ density of single bouton is decreased in <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M117.794040/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1, <italic>A–D</italic></ext-link>). Moreover, we analyzed the total protein levels of SYN and BRP in adult heads with antibodies, and there were no differences between <italic>dnrx</italic> mutants and <italic>wild-type</italic> flies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M117.794040/DC1">supplemental Fig. S2, <italic>A–C</italic></ext-link>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DNRX is necessary for synaptic terminal aggregation and release of SVs.</bold>

Thus, we also explored whether the release of SVs was altered in <italic>dnrx</italic> mutants. We observed profound abnormalities in the spontaneous release of SVs in the <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant and found that it can be restored to a normal level after inducing full-length DNRX within the pre-synapse in the <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>S–T</italic>). Collectively, these results suggest that DNRX is essential for the proper aggregation and release of SVs at synaptic terminals.</p></sec><sec><title>The effects of DNRX on SV aggregation and release depend on presynaptic F-actin</title><p>Studies in mammals have suggested that cell adhesion complexes can localize presynaptic SVs by regulating local actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Actin is one of the most prominent cytoskeletal molecules at synapses, and it is especially abundant at presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Moreover, pharmacological studies revealed a role for subsynaptic distribution of F-actin in SV mobilization and exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Studies in mammals have reported that treatment with latrunculin-A (an actin monomer sequestering agent) completely disrupts the actin arrangement and interferes with SV dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Conspicuously, actin participates in a regulatory mechanism at the synaptic terminals that inhibits the fusion of SVs at the active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). These observations indicate that DNRX might affect the distribution and release of SVs by regulating the presynaptic actin arrangement.</p><p>To determine whether the impact of DNRX on SV localization depends on presynaptic F-actin, we used Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin and fluorescently tagged actin (GFP-actin) to determine the distribution and amount of F-actin. We found that the fluorescence intensity of F-actin was significantly reduced in <italic>dnrx</italic> mutants and that this defect could be restored to normal levels after introducing full-length DNRX at the pre-synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>A–C</italic>‴). Furthermore, we measured the fluorescence intensity of F-actin in relationship to neuronal plasma membrane (HRP) and Discs large (DLG), which can be used to reflect the pre-synaptic and total F-actin, respectively. We found that both pre-synaptic and total F-actin were decreased in the <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant and could be rescued by introducing full-length DNRX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>D</italic> and <italic>E</italic>). GFP-tagged actin has previously been used to observe the localization of actin at synaptic terminals, and previous research has shown that these bright spots most likely correspond to F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). When we focus on the distribution of presynaptic F-actin, GFP-tagged actin has been confirmed to be particularly useful. We found that the presynaptic bright spots decreased in the <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant compared with <italic>wild-type</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic>‴), suggesting that DNRX positively regulates F-actin recruitment to the synapse.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DNRX regulates SV clustering and release dependent on presynaptic F-actin.</bold>

To better understand the effect of Scribble–DPix on DNRX, we assessed the spontaneous release of SVs and found that Scribble–DPix can rescue the abnormality in the <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <italic>Q–R</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>The PDZ-binding motif is essential for the effect of DNRX on F-actin assembly and SV release</title><p>To determine the specific motif of DNRX that might be involved in the regulation of F-actin and SV, we subsequently constructed the <italic>dnrx</italic><sup>Δ<italic>PDZ</italic></sup> transgenic fly, which lacks the C-terminal 7 amino acid residues according to the above result. To determine whether the PDZ-binding motif of DNRX is required for F-actin assembly, we first examined the F-actin intensity in <italic>wild-type</italic>, <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant, <italic>dnrx</italic> rescue, and <italic>dnrx</italic><sup>Δ<italic>PDZ</italic></sup> rescue lines. The immunostaining results showed that the fluorescence intensity of F-actin was significantly reduced in <italic>dnrx</italic> mutants and this defect could not be restored to normal levels after introducing DNRX<sup>ΔPDZ</sup> at presynapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>A–D</italic>‴). Furthermore, we measured the fluorescence intensity of F-actin in relationship to neuronal plasma membrane (HRP) and Discs large (DLG). The data showed that DNRX<sup>ΔPDZ</sup> had no effect on the regulation of F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic>). Next, to examine the association of the DNRX PDZ-binding motif with SV release, we performed electrophysiology experiments and the result also showed that DNRX<sup>ΔPDZ</sup> could not rescue the increased frequency of SV release observed in the <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>G</italic> and <italic>H</italic>). Finally, to better understand the effect of DNRX on the activity of Rac1, we assessed the activated Rac1 level after inducing DNRX<sup>ΔPDZ</sup> in the <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant background and we found that DNRX<sup>ΔPDZ</sup> still could not rescue the defect of Rac1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>I</italic> and <italic>J</italic>). Altogether, our data consistently indicate that the PDZ-binding motif of DNRX is essential for regulating F-actin assembly and SV release. Therefore, our results support a model that DNRX binds to DPix via Scribble and regulates F-actin polymerization by activating Rac1, and subsequently control SV clustering and release at synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>The PDZ-binding motif is essential for the effect of DNRX on F-actin assembly and SV release.</bold>

A large number of genes and proteins are involved in regulating the function of the brain. Mutations in synapse-associated genes cause neurologic disease. It would thus be desirable to explore the fundamental function of these genes <italic>in vivo</italic> and it may help attenuate the suffering of the patient. Considering the genetic techniques are available to manipulate, rapid life cycle, low cost, and a large number of genes are conserved between flies and vertebrates, it makes <italic>Drosophila</italic> emerging as an outstanding model to identify the biological basis for disease. Here, we use <italic>drosophila</italic> NMJ as a model to study and reveal the vital function of the cell adhesion molecule DNRX at synapse. Our study provides new mechanistic insights into the SV cluster and release regulation, which conceptually advances current knowledge of DNRX function at synapse.</p><sec><title>DNRX and Scribble are essential for nervous system</title><p>Neurexin is a highly conserved cell adhesion molecule that is predominantly localized at the presynaptic terminal. Previous studies have shown that Neurexin plays a significant role in synaptic architecture and function. In addition, accumulating evidence has implicated Neurexin in ASDs. ASDs are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in communication and social interaction as well as restricted interests and repetitive and stereotypic patterns of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). However, the precise function and underlying molecular mechanisms of Neurexin in both normal physiology and ASDs remain unclear. <italic>Drosophila</italic> Scribble is a cytoplasmic scaffolding protein that was first recognized as a tumor suppressor that regulates epithelial cell adhesion and migration in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that Scribble is also localized in the nervous system both in invertebrate and vertebrate animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), and plays a role in synaptic plasticity and animal behavior, including learning, memory, social behavior, and olfactory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). However, how Scribble functions at the synapse remains unknown. In this study, we have revealed that DNRX interacts directly with the Scribble PDZ domains through the very C-terminal PDZ-binding motif to regulate presynaptic F-actin and SVs.</p></sec><sec><title>F-actin is highly enriched at synaptic terminals and is vital for SV traffic, localization, and release</title><p>For decades, F-actin emerged as the major cytoskeleton identified in presynaptic nerve terminals. Considering the especial location of F-actin at the internal space of presynaptic nerve terminals, it raised a hypothesis that F-actin regulates synaptic vesicle localization and release. Previous studies from several groups provided consistent evidence that after disrupting the polymerization of actin, pre-synapse affected SV traffic, localization, and neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Moreover, cortical actin has been identified as a barrier for vesicles during the process of moving to the active zone in the presynaptic terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). However, whether and how F-actin participates in the regulation of SV at synapse is still controversial. Therefore, further investigation will be necessary to determine the function of F-actin at synapse and especially for advances in our understanding of the relationship with SV. By now the function of F-actin at synapse is still poorly understood. To better understand the effect of F-actin on SV we assessed the cluster and release of SV after ablating the actin-associated genes and found the obvious defects of SV cluster and release. To further test this possibility, we need to perform additional experiments to elaborate the vital role of F-actin in SV regulation in future.</p></sec><sec><title>The function of DNRX in regulating SVs via presynaptic F-actin</title><p>SV distribution and dynamics are essential for normal neural signal transmission and for synaptic plasticity both at peripheral and central synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Disruptions in SV function will lead to various forms of neurological disorders. The process of synaptic vesicle priming, docking, and fusion with the presynaptic membrane has been investigated extensively, and numerous molecules involved in this process have been identified. These include synaptotagmins, synapsins, synaptobrevins, and Munc18. However, how SV cluster in particular compartments and their role in regulating neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic terminal are unclear. The results from this study provide compelling evidences that DNRX plays an essential role in the distribution and release of SVs.</p><p>In this study, our data suggest the amount of F-actin is significantly reduced. Moreover, presynaptic Cortactin or the active form of DPak, key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, are able to rescue the defects in SV distribution and spontaneous release frequency in the <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant. These results illustrate the essential role of presynaptic actin in regulating SVs localization and release. Our results are consistent with the recent findings showing that Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin regulation is important for presynaptic neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Scribble is required for DNRX associates with DPix</title><p>Previous work has shown that Scribble is a scaffolding, tumor suppressor protein that through its PDZ domains interacts with a number of proteins, including β-catenin, βPix, and NOS1AP. Although NOS1AP can bind directly to the fourth Scribble PDZ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), βPix has binding affinity to all four PDZ domains of Scribble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In the present study, we use co-immunoprecipitation to show that DNRX can form a complex with Scribble in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also show that DNRX and Scribble are co-localized in both central and peripheral nervous system during embryonic, larval, and adult stages. Importantly, these two proteins are highly expressed in the mushroom body of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, suggesting a key role in learning and memory. We also show that DNRX can directly bind to all four Scribble PDZ domains through its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, similar to what is observed for βPix. These interaction results suggest that there may be competitions and cross-effect between DNRX and βPix. These interactions may also relate to the mutual effect on the protein level of Scribble and DNRX. Because the mRNA level of Scribble is not altered in the <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant, it is possible that when the DNRX or Scribble was absent, the complex becomes destabilized and subsequently degraded. Further experiments are needed to address this possibility.</p></sec><sec><title>DNRX–Scribble–DPix regulates presynaptic F-actin by activating Rac1</title><p>What is the functional consequence of the Scribble and DNRX interaction? The present study provides evidence that Scribble may act as a bridge between DNRX and DPix to regulate the actin cytoskeleton. βPix is a GEF specific to Rac1/Cdc2, a key mediator of actin reorganization in response to various stimuli. In the mammalian system, Rac1 is locally activated in dendritic spines, and this spatial restricted activation is regulated by Pix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). In the present study, we show that the active form of Rac1 (Rac1-GTP) is reduced in the <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant, <italic>dnrx</italic>, and <italic>scribble</italic> knockdown flies compared with <italic>wild-type</italic> for the protein level of DPix in these lines were decreased, supporting the idea that the DNRX and Scribble interaction activates Rac1. Recent studies show that Rac1 plays a critical roles in animal behavior, particularly in the process of forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). In addition, Scribble has recently been reported to activate forgetting through Rac1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Taken together, we suggest that DNRX may also be involved in forgetting by regulating the Rac1 signaling pathway. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that Rac1 activation is defective in multiple autism-related gene mutations, including the <italic>dnrx</italic> gene, and that Rac1 has been proposed to be a converging node linked to ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Thus, the present study demonstrating that DNRX interacts with Scribble and DPix to regulate Rac1 provides direct mechanistic insight into not only the fundamental mechanisms underlying the roles of the neuroligin–neurexin complex in actin-mediated presynaptic regulation, but also the pathological mechanism of ASD.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>cDNA clones</title><p>The Scribble, DPix, Cortactin, and DNRX full-length cDNA were obtained from DGRC.</p></sec><sec><title>Fly stocks</title><p>The following fly strains were used in this study. 1) The <italic>dnrx</italic> mutant allele <italic>dnrx</italic>273 was generated as a gift from Dr. Manzoor A.
