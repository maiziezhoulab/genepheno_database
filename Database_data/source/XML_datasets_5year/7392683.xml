<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par1">Neural circuits are initially assembled during development when neurons synapse with potential partners and later refined as appropriate connections stabilize into mature synapses while inappropriate contacts are eliminated. Disruptions to this synaptogenic process impair connectivity optimization and can cause neurodevelopmental disorders. Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often characterized by synaptic overgrowth, with the maintenance of immature or inappropriate synapses. Such synaptogenic defects can occur through mutation of a single gene, such as fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) loss causing the neurodevelopmental disorder fragile X syndrome (FXS). FXS represents the leading heritable cause of ID and ASD, but many other genes that play roles in ID and ASD have yet to be identified.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p id="Par2">In a <italic>Drosophila</italic> FXS disease model, one <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> null mutant stock exhibits previously unreported axonal overgrowths at developmental and mature stages in the giant fiber (GF) escape circuit. These excess axon projections contain both chemical and electrical synapse markers, indicating mixed synaptic connections. Extensive analyses show these supernumerary synapses connect known GF circuit neurons, rather than new, inappropriate partners, indicating hyperconnectivity within the circuit. Despite the striking similarities to well-characterized FXS synaptic defects, this new GF circuit hyperconnectivity phenotype is driven by genetic background mutations in this <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> stock. Similar GF circuit synaptic overgrowth is not observed in independent <italic>dfmr1</italic> null alleles. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was combined with whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTL) linked to neural circuit hyperconnectivity. The results reveal 8 QTL associated with inappropriate synapse formation and maintenance in the <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> mutant background.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="Par3">Synaptogenesis is a complex, precisely orchestrated neurodevelopmental process with a large cohort of gene products coordinating the connectivity, synaptic strength, and excitatory/inhibitory balance between neuronal partners. This work identifies a number of genetic regions that contain mutations disrupting proper synaptogenesis within a particularly well-mapped neural circuit. These QTL regions contain potential new genes involved in synapse formation and refinement. Given the similarity of the synaptic overgrowth phenotype to known ID and ASD inherited conditions, identifying these genes should increase our understanding of these devastating neurodevelopmental disease states.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p id="Par4">During neural circuit formation, axons and dendrites extend transitory processes that contact potential partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This initial synaptic connectivity is coordinated by a complex array of secreted morphogens, transmembrane receptors, and cytoskeletal regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Nascent synapses are usually formed in excess, overgrowing both appropriate and inappropriate targets, only to be refined over time through retraction and/or glial pruning, to sculpt the mature synaptic connectivity patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. With the onset of environmental sensory input, this refinement process continues, mediated by multiple activity-dependent synaptic mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Genetic disruption of this precise synapse initiation and maturation program causes neurodevelopmental disorders of intellectual and autistic disabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The most common heritable state is fragile X syndrome (FXS), a monogenic disorder and key model for studying links between synaptic connectivity and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par5">The FXS disease state is caused by genetic loss of mRNA- and channel-binding fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]). It has been repeatedly confirmed in both mouse and <italic>Drosophila</italic> FXS models that FMRP loss alone can cause circuitry and behavioral defects recapitulating the human condition. Both FXS patients and disease models manifest the hallmark phenotype of excess, immature synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This synaptic overgrowth has been well documented in both presynaptic boutons and postsynaptic spines, and studies have also identified overgrown axonal and dendritic branches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Many diverse mechanisms drive synaptic overelaboration, including enhanced metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) signaling, elevated microtubule and actin cytoskeleton stabilization, and disrupted synapse pruning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, in both FXS patients and models, genetic background has a profound impact on the penetrance and severity of synaptic defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par6">In the current study, we employ the well-characterized <italic>Drosophila</italic> FXS disease model to pursue mechanisms of synaptic connectivity defects. Specifically, we focus on the giant fiber (GF) neural circuit due to its large size, well-mapped neurons, and targeted transgenic tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We sought to model FXS synaptic connectivity defects in this tractable circuit with single-cell resolution to test the numerous proposed disease mechanisms. We focus particularly on the GF interneuron (GFI), a bilaterally symmetric neuron pair, with cell bodies and dendrites in the central brain, and large axons projecting into the thoracic ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The GFI axons use mixed electrical and chemical synapses to connect first with the peripherally synapsing interneuron (PSI) and giant fiber coupled 1–4 (GFC1–4) neurons at the inframedial bridge (IB), and then diverge to form two large bends that synapse onto the tergotrochanteral motor neuron (TTMn) and GFC2–3 neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par7">We initially set out to test whether the GFI displays synaptic overgrowth using a well-characterized FMRP null allele (<italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]). Consistent with reports from other circuits, <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> displays excess GFI filopodia during synaptogenesis and more GFI mature synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The excess GFI projections synapse onto GFC2/3, indicating synaptic overgrowth is redundant within the GF circuit, without inappropriate connections. This intra-circuit hyperconnectivity is more weakly manifest in <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> heterozygotes, suggesting semi-dominance, and significantly rescued by re-introduction of wildtype FMRP, suggesting a FMRP-specific requirement. However, our studies reveal FMRP loss does not cause the defect, which is instead dependent on background mutations in a <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> stock. We therefore used bulked segregant analysis (BSA) with whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify these mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Our results identify 8 loci driving the intra-circuit hyperconnectivity.</p>

<title>A FXS disease model exhibits excess GFI axonal projections</title>
<p id="Par8">The central brain giant fiber interneuron (GFI) can be labeled at single-neuron resolution by injecting TRITC-dextran into the axon in the cervical connective (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>a; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]). Co-injecting with the small gap junction-permeant neurobiotin (NB) tracer labels electrically coupled partners (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]). The primary presynaptic sites of the GFI are at the inframedial bridge (IB; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>a, arrowhead), which synapses with the peripherally synapsing interneuron (PSI) and giant fiber coupled (GFC) neurons 1–4, and the axonal bends (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>a, arrows), which synapse with the tergotrochanteral motor neuron (TTMn) and GFC2–3 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]). In addition, the GFI can be genetically targeted at near single-cell resolution using the 91H05-Gal4 driver, permitting a myriad of GFI transgenic manipulations ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]). Using either GFI-targeted expression of membrane-tethered GFP (mCD8::GFP) or the iontophoretic co-injection of TRITC-dextran and NB tracer dyes, we identified small projections along the distal GFI axonal bend of the <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> genetic control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>b, arrows). These putative synaptic contacts were therefore assayed in our fragile X syndrome (FXS) model, which is characterized by disrupted synapse formation and activity-dependent refinement ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]).
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Presynaptic projections from the giant fiber interneuron terminal bend. <bold>a</bold> Co-injection of TRITC-dextran (10 kDa; magenta) and neurobiotin (287 Da; yellow) into a <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> giant fiber interneuron (GFI) axon labels the neuron and all the gap junction dye-coupled GF circuit neurons. Visible are peripherally synapsing interneuron (PSI), tergotrochanteral motor neuron (TTMn) cell body, and giant fiber coupled (GFC) 1–4 neurons, which were just recently characterized (Kennedy and Broadie 2018).

<p id="Par9">We first compared genetic background control (<italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup>) and <italic>dfmr1</italic> null (<italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup>) GFIs expressing mCD8::GFP and found a very strong axonal projection phenotype when FMRP is removed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>a). In controls, GFI axon bends display only a few projections, whereas <italic>dfmr1</italic> mutants have many projections from the bends, often of substantive size and complexity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>a, arrows). Quantification of projections ≥ 2 μm in length shows controls have an average of 1.4 ± 0.5 projections/bend, while <italic>dfmr1</italic> nulls have 6.0 ± 0.7, a significant increase (<italic>p</italic> = 1.6 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>c). To ensure these projections are not caused by the Gal4 driver or UAS responder, we next dye-injected GFI axons with TRITC-dextran in <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> and <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2</xref>b).

Together, these findings suggest GFI axonal projections would be ideal to study how FMRP loss affects circuit connectivity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> FXS model. The projection phenotype is robust and relatively easy to measure, so we sought to characterize the defect more fully before dissecting the molecular mechanism responsible for the overgrowth.

<title>Increased axonal projections present during early GFI synaptogenesis</title>
<p id="Par10">We first investigated when the overgrown axonal projections develop during GF neural circuit formation. At 25 °C, the GFI reaches its TTMn target at ~ 24 h after puparium formation (APF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]), at which point synaptogenesis begins. The initial phase of synapse formation then lasts for approximately 1 day (24–48 h APF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]). In order to examine this synaptogenesis period, we collected animals staged at 34–50 h APF by selecting for the “yellow body” localized between the Malpighian tubules on the dorsal side of the pupae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Using GFI-specific 91H05-Gal4 to drive UAS-<italic>mcd8</italic>::<italic>gfp</italic>, we assayed axonal bend projections during this early time period (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>a). Both background control (<italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup>) and <italic>dfmr1</italic> null (<italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup>) GFIs exhibit far more extensive projection outgrowth at 34–50 h APF than at maturity, but the mutants show a much greater elevation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>a, arrows). These early GFI projections are usually far more slender than the projections at maturity suggesting they are immature filopodial processes searching for synaptic partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Quantification shows controls have 7.8 ± 1.0 projections/bend whereas <italic>dfmr1</italic> nulls have 17.8 ± 1.2, a highly significant elevation (<italic>p</italic> = 1.3 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig3">3</xref>b, left). Thus, the FXS model defect is apparent from the early stages of synaptogenesis.
<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>GFI axonal projection overgrowth begins early in synaptogenesis. <bold>a</bold> The giant fiber interneuron (GFI) axonal bend visualized with 91H05-Gal4 driven UAS<italic>-mcd8::gfp</italic> (green) during staged development in background controls (<italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup>, left) and <italic>dfmr1</italic> null mutants (<italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup>, right).

<p id="Par12">Synaptic markers are notoriously difficult to image in dense connectivity regions such as the GFI thoracic ganglia neuropil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Antibody labeling for synaptic markers paired with standard confocal microscopy does not provide sufficient spatial resolution to distinguish whether the synaptic marker is in a neuron of interest or neighboring neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Another commonly used approach, the Gal4/UAS transgenic expression of labeled presynaptic markers in neurons of interest, often leads to overexpression which can cause mis-localization and protein aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. To avoid these imaging difficulties, we employ here the newer synaptic tagging with recombination (STaR) technique to label Bruchpilot (Brp), a well-studied presynaptic active zone scaffold organizer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. STaR labeling requires a stop codon flanked by Flp recombination target (FRT) sites followed by a GFP sequence that is inserted downstream of a protein of interest (Brp-FSF-GFP; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>). Separately, the flippase (UAS-<italic>flp</italic>) is expressed in the neuron of interest to remove the FRT sites and enclosed stop codon, thus permitting readthrough from Brp to GFP (Brp::GFP; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>). We use this technique to label presynaptic active zones specifically within the GFI to examine the axonal bend projections.

<p id="Par13">We took advantage of this STaR labeling method to determine if the presynaptic Brp active zone scaffold is present in the GFI axonal bend projections and to assay the maintenance of these synaptic projections from eclosion through adult maturity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>). For these analyses, 91H05-Gal4 was used to drive expression of both membrane mCD8::RFP and Flp to create the GFP-labeled Brp in the marked GFI (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>a). The background control <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> and <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> null mutant animals were assayed immediately post-eclosion (1 h), during an early activity-dependent refinement period (1 day), and at full adult maturity (1 week), to assay for the persistence of GFI synaptic projections throughout life (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]). Results show that the majority of background control and <italic>dfmr1</italic> mutant projections contain the Brp presynaptic scaffold, indicating chemical synapse active zones in presynaptic processes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>a). The small Brp::GFP puncta (green) are clearly visible in GFI projections (magenta), both along the projection shafts and at the projection tips (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>a, inset). Note that while Brp labeling is strong in the GFI, there is signal in surrounding cells. This is likely due to the STaR technique revealing neurons with weak/transient Flp expression. The exogenous signal could come from cells with very low Gal4 activity or with previous expression, including precursor cells. The total synaptic projection number appears to remain steady from 1 h post-eclosion to maturity at 1 week after eclosion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>a), suggesting either that these projections are being created and removed at the same rate or, more likely, that projections make stable mature synapses that persist throughout adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par14">Quantification of the synaptic projections shows that 1-h animals have both Brp-negative and Brp-positive processes, albeit with the majority containing chemical synapses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4</xref>b).

<p id="Par15">Unlike general synaptic antibodies, the Shaking-B (ShakB) antibody specifically labels GFI electrical synapses, permitting simple imaging analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. To test whether GFI axon projections electrically couple to partner neurons, the GFI axon was injected with TRITC-dextran and labeled with the ShakB antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>a). Unlike Brp, we find ShakB present in a limited subset of projections (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>a, insets), with many projections either negative or below detection limits (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5</xref>a, arrowheads).

<p id="Par18">To test synaptic connectivity, we repeated the above dye injection experiments while co-labeling for the ShakB innexin to identify electrical synapses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>c). We find that ShakB synapses are present at the contact intersection of the GFI projections and the GFC2/3 neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>c, insets), although there are also frequently cases where ShakB labeling is not detectable in the GFI synaptic projections contacting a GFC neuron (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6</xref>c, arrowhead). Taken together, these findings suggest that the synaptic projections characterizing the <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> mutant GFI make redundant connections onto other known GF circuit neurons. However, we cannot definitively state that GFC2 and 3 are the only synaptic targets of the excess projections. Moreover, it is interesting to note that GFC2 and 3 extensively contact the main axon shaft in both controls and <italic>dfmr1</italic> nulls and form synapses there [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], making the projections unnecessary.

We also tested the heterozygous <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> condition (<italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup>/+) to determine whether full protein loss is required for the phenotype or if the defect occurs in heterozygotes, as has been reported previously in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> FXS model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Finally, to further test FMRP loss effects on synaptic projection overgrowth we took a transgenic RNAi approach using a highly expressing ubiquitous Gal4 driver to express a characterized <italic>dfmr1</italic> RNAi (UH1-Gal4&gt;<italic>dfmr1</italic> RNAi2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]). All of these studies are summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>.</p>
<p id="Par20">We first tested the genetic rescue condition (<italic>dfmr1.14</italic>/+; <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic>/<italic>50M</italic></sup> = “rescue”) by injecting the GFI with TRITC-dextran to assay the synaptic projection number. The re-introduction of wildtype FMRP causes a partial correction of the <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> phenotype, with significantly fewer synaptic projections present compared to the null mutant (projections/bend: <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> − 9.0 ± 0.6, rescue − 5.1 ± 0.4; unpaired ANOVA with Tukey post hoc analysis, <italic>p</italic> = 2.7 × 10<sup>−7</sup>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>a, c). This single <italic>dfmr1</italic> copy rescue is not complete, as more synaptic projections occur in the rescue condition than in the <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> genetic background control (3.6 ± 0.3 projections/bend), and this difference is significant (unpaired ANOVA with Tukey post hoc analysis, <italic>p</italic> = 0.047; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>a, c). Importantly, similar to the wildtype FMRP rescue results, single copy <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup>/+ heterozygotes also show an intermediate excess synaptic projection defect (projections/bend: <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> − 2.8 ± 0.5, <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup>/+ − 5.7 ± 0.5, <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> − 8.3 ± 0.7), with significant differences in all the comparisons (unpaired ANOVA with Tukey post hoc analysis: <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup><italic>v. dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup>/+ <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup>/+ vs. <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup><italic>p</italic> = 0.006; <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> vs. <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup><italic>p</italic> = 2.5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>a, d). Taken together, these results support the conclusion that FMRP loss causes the excess production of supernumerary GFI synaptic projections.</p>
<p id="Par21">Surprisingly, however, the alternate <italic>dfmr1</italic> mutants did not replicate the synaptic projection phenotype. The homozygous <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>B55</italic></sup> mutants appear nearly identical to control animals (projections/bend: <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> − 2.8 ± 0.5, <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>B55</italic></sup> − 3.3 ± 0.6), with no significant difference seen (unpaired ANOVA with Tukey post hoc analysis, <italic>p</italic> = 0.9; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>a, d). We tested <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>B55</italic></sup> by Western blot and confirmed that no FMRP is detectably expressed in the brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>b). The <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>/Df test, carried out separately, shows the same result, with no GFI synaptic projection increase relative to controls (projections/bend: <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> − 4.3 ± 0.5, <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>/Df − 3.8 ± 0.5, <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> − 7.9 ± 0.8, unpaired ANOVA with Tukey post hoc analysis, <italic>p</italic> = 0.8; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>a, e). Finally, ubiquitous RNAi FMRP knockdown also does not increase GFI synaptic projections compared to the transgenic control (projections/bend: UH1-Gal4/+ control − 4.1 ± 0.4, UH1-Gal4&gt;<italic>dfmr1</italic> RNAi2 − 3.0 ± 0.4), with no significant difference in projection number (two tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.05; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>a, f). Western blot analyses show that ubiquitous UH1-Gal4 driven <italic>dfmr1</italic> RNAi2 completely eliminates detectable FMRP from the brain, in contrast to an alternate knockdown approach of pan-neuronal <italic>elav</italic>-Gal4 driven <italic>dfmr1</italic> RNAi1, which shows the maintenance of a weak, residual FMRP signal in the brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig7">7</xref>b).</p>
<p id="Par22">To further test the above apparent semi-dominance observed with <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup>/+ heterozygotes, we carried out additional analyses with the well-characterized <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>3</italic></sup> null allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. A second transheterozygous <italic>dfmr1</italic> test was done by pairing the <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> allele with the <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>3</italic></sup> allele. The results show control projections (2.8 ± 0.4/bend, <italic>n</italic> = 18) are significantly lower than <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup>/+ heterozygotes (5.9 ± 0.4/bend, <italic>n</italic> = 17, unpaired ANOVA with Tukey post hoc analysis, <italic>p</italic> = 3.8 × 10<sup>−5</sup>), and also significantly reduced compared to the <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup>/<italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>3</italic></sup> trans-heterozygotes (6.8 ± 0.5/bend, <italic>n</italic> = 16, unpaired ANOVA with Tukey post hoc analysis, <italic>p</italic> = 1.8 × 10<sup>−7</sup>). Trans-heterozygotes were not significantly different than heterozygotes (ANOVA with Tukey post hoc analysis, <italic>p</italic> = 0.47. All three of these genotypes are significantly different compared to the homozygous <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup><italic>/dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> mutant condition (8.7 ± 0.5 projections/bend, <italic>n</italic> = 15, unpaired ANOVA with Tukey post hoc analysis, <italic>p</italic> = 2.1 × 10<sup>−11</sup>, 2.5 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, and 0.02, respectively). We note that there is overlap in the <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> control, <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup>/+ heterozygote and <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup><italic>/dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> homozygous animals used in the quantification of this experiment and the above <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>B55</italic></sup> experiment due to a shift in experimental design resulting from poor availability of weakened animals. Nevertheless, the additional results with the independent <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>3</italic></sup> null allele serve to confirm and extend the conclusions from the above <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup>, <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>B55</italic></sup> and <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> studies.</p>
<p id="Par23">Taking all of the above results together, we conclude that FMRP loss by itself does not cause the excess synaptic projections from the GFI axonal bend and that a second site mutation(s) in the <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> genetic background is required for the GF circuit hyperconnectivity defect. Importantly, the wildtype FMRP rescue was misleading in this case, causing us to draw the incorrect initial conclusion of a sole FMRP-specific requirement. The simple interpretation was that the rescue reinserted a single wildtype <italic>dfmr1</italic> allele into a null background to provide partial phenotype restoration. However, since alternative <italic>dfmr1</italic> null mutant and <italic>dfmr1</italic> RNAi lines lack the synaptic projection phenotype, it may be that a background mutation was lost when <italic>dfmr1.14</italic> was combined with <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup>. We do not rule out a role for FMRP, as it could be acting in concert with the background mutation(s) to enhance the synaptic projection phenotype. Interestingly, FXS patients also show similar genetic background effects, as the severity of the disease symptoms present over a very wide spectrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We therefore chose to pursue the FXS model background mutation(s) as a way to shed new light on molecular players in synapse development that could include novel FMRP interactors.</p>

<title>Identifying FXS background mutations driving intra-circuit hyperconnectivity</title>
<p id="Par24">We employed bulked segregant analysis (BSA) paired with whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> background mutations. BSA has been used to identify de novo mutations from divergent backgrounds in many systems, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. We pursued BSA by first inbreeding the heterozygous offspring of a <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> X <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> cross for 9 generations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>a). We then analyzed GFI synaptic projection number by intracellular dye injection, sorting animals into low, medium, and high phenotype pools (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>b). Inbreeding was continued during analysis with animals selected from the 9th–12th generations. A total of 234 animals were analyzed by single-neuron dye injection, from which 85 were in the low projection pool (0–3 projections), 70 in the medium pool (5–6 projections), and 34 in the high pool (7+ projections, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>c). An additional 45 animals had 4 projections, but these were not included in the analysis to keep the low and medium pools distinct. The intermediate pool was designed to capture partial phenotypes that might arise from intermixing of <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> and <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup>. The DNA extracted for each pool was used for WGS analysis to identify enriched genomic regions in the high pool relative to the low pool. The average BSA sequencing depths were 146 for the low pool and 112 for the high pool.

<p id="Par25">We analyzed bulked segregation to assay for significant changes ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], J. Wang, personal communication). We mapped frequencies of control <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> SNPs at each variable position in the low and high bulks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>c, top). If a SNP is not linked, we expected equal representation of <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> and <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> parental reads. In contrast, causative SNPs should be enriched in the high bulk and lost in the low bulk due to phenotype selection. When SNP frequencies are mapped, two outcomes appear. First, several divergences occur between low and high pools, suggesting regions linked to the phenotype. These occur on all chromosomes, except chromosome 4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>c, top, arrows). Divergences are more apparent when the frequencies for the high bulk are subtracted from the low bulk, and the difference plotted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>c, bottom, arrows). Second, low and high pools often veer sharply away from the predicted 50/50 distribution between <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> and <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup>, typically favoring <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup>. This is obvious towards the end of chromosome 3R, where both bulks approach <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup>. We expect atypical distributions are due to selection against mutations that hinder viability or fecundity. Indeed, <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> animals are sterile with reduced viability; traits attributed to FMRP loss, but which could also depend on background effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Interestingly, other regions have <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> sequence disfavored, such as the start of the X chromosome.</p>
<p id="Par26">A variety of statistical methods have been developed for analyzing BSA data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. We first used the QTLseqr method to define quantitative trait loci (QTL), which applies two separate statistical tests (QTL-seq and G’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]). Both statistical tests show that the divergent peaks present in the allele frequency analyses are enriched in the high phenotype pool, although they do not reach significance (data not shown). To further test the BSA data, we next analyzed results using MULTIPOOL, a different platform that uses Bayesian-based statistical inference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. This method also identified the same divergent regions as individual peaks, but similar to the QTLseqr analysis, found the segments are not significantly different (data not shown). As a third test, we applied the most recently developed PyBSASeq platform to our BSA dataset analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. This method uniquely tests for SNP enrichment across all chromosomal intervals, rather than at individual sites, to increase the QTL detection sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. This improved PyBSASeq analysis identified multiple statistically significant QTLs linked to the intra-circuit synapse hyperconnectivity phenotype. Comparisons were done only between the high and low phenotype pools, as including the intermediate pool data did not help refine the comparison further. Importantly, the same QTLs were identified with all three analysis methods.</p>
<p id="Par27">The first step in PyBSASeq processing is to identify individual SNPs where the low and high bulks are significantly different (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) based on a Fisher’s exact test. These “likely trait associated SNPS” (ltaSNPs) are plotted in sliding windows of 2 Mb with 10 kb steps. When total SNPs (blue) and ltaSNPs (black) are plotted for BSA data, peaks emerge that correspond with the previously seen allele frequency divergences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>d, top). To normalize for SNP density, the ltaSNPs to total SNPs ratio is plotted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig8">8</xref>d, bottom), showing strong peaks past the 99% confidence interval (red line), indicating causative QTLs. The identified peaks are in the following regions: 2 L:6.72–10.19; 2R:15.27–16.98; 3 L:8.56–8.91; 3R:25.79–26.7, 27.2–28.84 and 30.0–30.99; X:15.14–16.27, 17.68–21.17 (all values in Mb). All genes and miRNAs within these loci are listed in Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>. The smallest of these ranges, 3 L:8.56–8.91, includes 351 ltaSNPs in a genomic region that contains 45 protein-coding genes and 1 miRNA, demonstrating the resolution is not sharp enough to identify causative mutations from these results. Nevertheless, these 8 QTLs represent discrete regions of the genome related specifically to the synaptic hyperconnectivity phenotype identified in this study. The regions are small enough that they can be probed in the future with linkage analysis, complementation assays, and/or candidate RNAi screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p id="Par28">The goal of this work was to exploit the particularly well-mapped giant fiber circuit in order to dissect mechanisms underlying the FXS hallmark phenotype: supernumerary synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. While striking synaptic overgrowth did indeed manifest in this model circuit, causing intra-circuit hyperconnectivity, the defect is driven by background mutations in a <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> stock. FMRP loss was ruled out as the cause of GFI synaptic overgrowth based on three separate genetic elimination strategies: (1) <italic>dfmr1</italic> RNAi, (2) independent <italic>dfmr1</italic> alleles, and (3) genomic deficiency trans-heterozygotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. However, the supernumerary synapse phenotype was significantly rescued by the re-introduction of wildtype FMRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], suggesting an FMRP requirement. Based solely on rescue results, it would appear that FMRP loss partially contributes to circuit hyperconnectivity, interacting with genetic background mutations. Indeed, unidentified background mutations are widely reported to interact with FMRP loss in the mouse FXS model, creating learning defects and exacerbating autism-like behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Similarly, FXS patients show a broad disease symptom severity spectrum dependent on genetic background modifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par29">However, in light of the independent <italic>dfmr1</italic> null mutant results, FMRP rescue of the intra-circuit hyperconnectivity phenotype requires close scrutiny. Genetic rescue is interpreted as the strongest evidence of a gene-specific requirement, but background mutations can complicate this interpretation: recombining <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> and rescue lines may outcross contributing mutations. Indeed, recombined <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> animals always have fewer GF synaptic projections than the original stock (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig4">4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5c</xref> vs. Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig2">2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig5">5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig6">6a</xref>). It should also be noted that <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> was not enriched in the bulked segregant analysis, suggesting it is not required for the synaptic phenotype. Thus, the FMRP role in intra-circuit hyperconnectivity remains unclear and will require further interaction tests once the background mutations are identified. This work serves as a vital reminder that new <italic>dfmr1</italic> phenotypes should be validated by RNAi or fully independent mutant alleles. In other neural circuits, numerous <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> phenotypes have been validated with <italic>dfmr1</italic> RNAi and/or independent <italic>dfmr1</italic> mutants, including the <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>, <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>3</italic></sup>, and <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>B55</italic></sup> alleles used here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>], but <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> background interactions have also been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Studies lacking proper vetting should be validated before becoming the basis of future research. We note that it is unclear when these particular <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> background mutations arose, and they may be limited to just this one <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> stock. Nevertheless, this work serves as a cautionary tale of the possible effects of genetic background, even in well-controlled studies.</p>
<p id="Par30">The supernumerary GFI synaptic projections identified here arise from extensive filopodial outgrowths occurring during early synaptogenesis, although reduced synaptic pruning could also play a later contributing role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. The projection overgrowths occur throughout the course of giant fiber circuit formation, suggesting there is never a developmental stage where controls and mutant animals have equivalent synaptic outgrowth with subsequent differential pruning. This result supports a model in which increased GFI filopodial outgrowth is later converted to excess mature connections containing both chemical (Brp active zone scaffold) and electrical (ShakB gap junction innexin) synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. These mixed chemical/electrical synapse connections are a well-characterized feature of the giant fiber escape circuit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Although the great speed benefit of gap junction synapses is obvious for any escape circuit, it is not clear how slower chemical synapses contribute to escape circuit signaling, or indeed are prevented from muddying the fidelity of communication given the differential timing delay. Future studies will also be needed to determine the specific contribution of the axonal synaptic projections to giant fiber neural connectivity.</p>
<p id="Par31">No new out-of-circuit neurons can be identified as dye-coupled to the mutant GFI due to the excess synaptic projection overgrowths, indicating no inappropriate neural partnerships occur in the mutants. It is possible that inappropriate partners exist in the dense neuropil around GFI axonal bends, with electrical connections too weak to pass sufficient dye for detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Alternatively, inappropriate partners could be solely linked by chemical synapses. The identified targets of the excess synaptic projections are the GFC2 and GFC3 neurons, newly established giant fiber circuit members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. GFC2/3 neurons contact the GFI with en passant synapses at both the more proximal inframedial bridge and more distal axonal bends. GFC2/3 neurons have quite complex architectures, and it is unclear if the GFI synaptic projections contact the same regions in these neurons as en passant connections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Synaptic contact of partner neurons at inappropriate sites, as well as the formation of spatially isolated projection synapses, may deleteriously impact GFI information flow and circuit function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. It will be particularly interesting to test how these supernumerary synaptic projections impact giant fiber circuit activity and output escape behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>].</p>

PyBSASeq using pooled single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses identified eight QTL regions, ranging from 0.35 to 3.49 Mb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. QTL identification may have been complicated by a large number of causative mutations. Multiple interacting genetic sites are more difficult to detect using BSA, especially if they act additively or co-dependently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. An intermediate bulk pool was included to increase the QTL resolution, but this added no further information, likely due to the complexity of the genetic interactions. Traditional QTL analysis or genome-wide association study (GWAS) of individually sequenced animals with a broad phenotypic range could help isolate the individual mutations and further winnow down the genes in the QTLs identified in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>].</p>
<p id="Par33">Mechanisms driving intra-circuit synaptic hyperconnectivity are suggested by the QTL genes (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>). As supernumerary projections are apparent early in circuit development, and endure as mature synaptic connections following eclosion, candidate genes are predicted to regulate synapse formation and/or stabilization, rather than activity-dependent refinement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. From the gene list (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>), the gene products most likely to be involved include (1) cytoskeletal regulators responsible for axonal filopodial outgrowth, along with their accessory and regulatory proteins (e.g., Rho, RapGAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]), (2) cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) involved in synapse targeting/ initiation (e.g., Liprin-α, Neuroglian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]), (3) extracellular signaling ligands driving synapse formation and stabilization (e.g., Wingless (Wnt-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]), (4) synaptic destabilization/degradation machinery (e.g., Plum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]), and (5) regulatory proteins that may control the above mechanisms (e.g., transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]). Although these are the primary candidates of interest, other intriguing genes are present in the 8 QTLs identified here (Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>). Future work using RNAseq or linkage analyses will help identify the genes involved in synaptogenesis and place them in a broader neurodevelopmental context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p id="Par34">We discover here that a <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> stock has accumulated genetic background mutations spread across 8 QTLs, which promote supernumerary synapse projections in the well-mapped giant fiber escape circuit. Excess axonal projections are present from the early stages of synaptogenesis, later incorporate mixed chemical and electrical synapses, and are maintained at maturity. These supernumerary synapses only occur between defined circuit neurons, leading to intra-circuit hyperconnectivity. This suggests that the defect is not in target recognition, but rather in the regulation of synapse number. As synapse formation and refinement are critical processes related to numerous neurodevelopment disorders, including intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it is critical to understand underlying molecular mechanisms. Genetic background is known to be a key modifier of disease manifestation in ID/ASD states. Candidate genes identified here via a combination of bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) provide the means to interrogate new molecular mechanisms driving intra-circuit hyperconnectivity within these disease conditions, with the goal of generating therapeutic intervention strategies in the future.</p>

<title>Drosophila genetics</title>
<p id="Par35">All animals were maintained on a standard cornmeal/agar/molasses food in a 12-h light to dark cycling incubator at 25 °C. Timed egg lays were collected for 2–3 days, and experimental animals were selected from rearing tubes 10–14 days later, unless otherwise noted. Please see Additional File <xref ref-type="media" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lines used in genetic crosses. Genetic constructs were recombined as needed for the experiments described below. Genotype was confirmed by visible markers, or PCR when necessary.</p>

<title>Dye iontophoresis</title>
<p id="Par36">Dye injection was performed as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Briefly; glass electrodes (Kwik-Fil Borosilicate glass 1B100F-4, World Precision Instruments) were pulled on a laser puller (Model P-2000, Sutter Instrument Company) to 10MΩ resistance (3 M KCl). Electrodes were filled with 0.25% TRITC-dextran (10 kDa, Life Technologies) and 7% neurobiotin (Vector Laboratories, RRID:AB_2313575) in ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Filled electrodes were placed on a silver-chloride wire mounted on a PCS-5000 micromanipulator (Burleigh). In physiological saline, animals were cut along the dorsal midline to access the cervical connective, where electrodes were inserted into the GFI axon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. A square-pulse stimulator (Grass S48, Astro-Med) provided 7.5100 ms pulses/s (2 min, 20 nA injected current) monitored by an AxoClamp2B amplifier. A Digidata data acquisition system (1320A, Axon Instruments) was controlled with Clampex 9.2 software.</p>

<title>Confocal imaging</title>
<p id="Par37">Brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/sucrose (Electron Microscopy Services) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2, Life Technology) for 30 min, washed 3X with PBS, and then blocked for 1 h with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBST (PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Primary and secondary labeling was performed for either 2 h at room temperature (RT) or overnight at 4 °C. All probes were diluted in PBST with 0.2% BSA. The following probes were used: Streptavidin::Cy5 (1:20, SA1011 Thermo Fisher), rabbit anti-ShakB (1:200, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]), rabbit anti-GFP (1:2000; ab290, Abcam, RRID:AB_303395), FITC Goat anti-GFP (1:500; ab6662, Abcam, RRID:AB_305635), Rabbit anti-RFP (1:500; 600-401-379, Rockland, RRID:AB_2209751), Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat (1:250; A-11055, Thermo Fisher, RRID:AB_2534102), Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:250; R37118, Thermo Fisher, RRID:AB_2556546), Alexa 568-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:250; A10042, Thermo Fisher, RRID:AB_2534017), Alexa 647-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:250; A-31573, Thermo Fisher, RRID:AB_2536183), and Alexa 633-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:250; A-21071, Thermo Fisher, RRID:AB_141419). Preparations were then washed 3X for 30 min in PBST, 1X in PBS, and mounted on glass microscope slides (Probe On Plus 25 × 75 × 1.0 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 2, 2′-Thiodiethanol (TDE, Sigma-Aldrich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]). To prevent crushing, double-sided poster tape (Scotch) was placed on each side of the brains. Coverslips (No. 1.5H, Zeiss) were sealed with nail polish (Hard as Nails, Sally Hansen). Fluorescent images were collected using either a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope or a ZEISS LSM 880 confocal microscope with an Airyscan module, as indicated in the figure legends. Images show maximum Z-stack projections, unless otherwise noted in the figure legends. Occasional misaligned bidirectional scans were corrected using the FIJI plugin “Correct X Shift.”</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p id="Par38">Brains were dissected from adult females in PBS with a protease inhibitor (cOmplete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail; Roche). Four brains were collected in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM TRIS, 1 mM PMSF, Protease Inhibitor Cocktail; Sigma-Aldrich) on ice and sonicated for 20 s (Branson Model 102C, Sonifier 250 microtip). Samples were mixed with 4X LDS buffer (ThermoFisher) with 5% beta-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), incubated at RT for 20 min, boiled at 100 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 RPM for 10 min. Two brain protein equivalents were loaded on a 4%–16% Bis Tris SDS gel (ThermoFisher) in 1x MES buffer (ThermoFisher). Protein was transferred overnight in 1X transfer buffer/20% methanol (ThermoFisher). The membrane was dried for 1 h, blocked with 2% milk (Kroger) in TBS-T (150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween, 5 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.6) for 1 h at RT, and then stained with primary antibodies in 2% milk/TBS-T for 2 h at RT. The antibodies used were mouse anti-FMRP (1:3000, Sigma-Aldrich F4554) and rabbit anti-α-tubulin (1:40,000, AbCam Ab52866). Membranes were washed (6X 5-min TBS-T) and then incubated in secondary antibodies in 2% milk/TBS-T for 2 h at RT. The antibodies used were 800 Goat anti-mouse (1:20,000, Rockland) and Alexa 680 goat anti-rabbit (1:20,000, ThermoFisher).

<title>Whole genome sequencing and bulked segregant analysis</title>
<p id="Par39">Bulked segregant lines were created with multiple generations of inbreeding. To begin, <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> males were crossed with <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup>; <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup><italic>/</italic>TM6B, <italic>tb</italic>, <italic>hu</italic>, <italic>gfp</italic> females, and the transheterozygous offspring (<italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup>; <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup>/+) were interbred. The offspring were then interbred for a total of 12 generations. Animals from the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th generations were GFI-injected using the above dye iontophoresis method for projection quantification, with the body cryopreserved at − 80 °C. Bodies were then combined into 3 pools based on quantified GFI projection number; 0–3 projections were placed in the control pool, 5–6 projections in the intermediate pool, and 7+ projections in the strong phenotype pool. The low and high pool limits were designed based <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> and <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> projection profiles. Aggregating all dye-injected <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> animals from our experiments (<italic>n</italic> = 57) showed 58% had 3 or fewer projections, with a minimum of 0, a mode of 3 (<italic>n</italic> = 17), and a maximum of 6. For <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 43), 63% had 7 or more projections with a minimum value of 2, a mode of 9 (<italic>n</italic> = 8), and a maximum of 15. By using 3 projections as our cutoff for the low pool, we captured the modal <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> point, while minimizing the chance of capturing a <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> animal. Based on our aggregated data, selecting animals with 0–3 projections yields 94.3% <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> and 5.7% <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup>. Similarly, by using 7 as the cutoff for the high pool, we expect to see 100% <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic></sup> animals and capture the modal value of 9. DNA was extracted from each pool using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue extraction kit (Qiagen, Cat # 69504). 150bp paired-end read whole genome sequencing was performed on each of the samples, as well as the <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> and <italic>dfmr1</italic><sup><italic>50M</italic>/50M</sup> parental lines (Hudson Alpha, Illumina NovaSeq).</p>

<title>Data analyses</title>
<p id="Par40">Image analysis was done with FIJI software (version 2, RRID:SCR_002285 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]). GFI projection numbers were from one GFI bend, below the IB. If both GFI arms were visible, the projection number was averaged. GFI projection lengths were quantified using the FIJI Simple Neurite Trace plugin and were only included if their total length was greater than or equal to 2 μm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. For all branched GFI projections, the longest continuous branch was followed and the whole structure was counted as a single projection. Projection quantification was not performed in a blinded manner. For anti-ShakB fluorescence quantification, the TRITC dye injection signal was used to create the region of interest (ROI) encompassing the GFI bend. This ROI was then overlaid onto the ShakB channel, and number and total area of punctae above a background threshold (65) were automatically summed from a maximum z projection image using the FIJI “Analyze Particles” tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. For BSA analysis, samples were aligned using SpeedSeq using Flybase <italic>Drosophila</italic> reference genome build 6.28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. BAM files were deposited with SRA under BioProjectID: PRJNA625647. The Samtools depth function was used to calculate depth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>]. For the allele frequency/difference analyses and MULTIPOOL, variants were first called using the Samtools mpileup function and the bcftools call function and processed/plotted with the Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib packages in Python2.7 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>], J. Wang, personal communication). For QTLseqr and PyBSASeq analyses, variants were called and filtered to vcf files using GATK HaplotypeCaller, CombineGVCFs, and GenotypeGVCFs functions, followed by VariantsToTable to create a delimited file [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>].
