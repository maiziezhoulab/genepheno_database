<abstract>
<p id="P1"> Voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>v</sub>) channels initiate action potentials in most neurons, including primary afferent nerve fibers of the pain pathway. Local anesthetics block pain through non-specific actions at all Na<sub>v</sub> channels, but the discovery of selective modulators would facilitate the analysis of individual subtypes and their contributions to chemical, mechanical, or thermal pain. Here, we identify and characterize spider toxins that selectively activate the Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 subtype, whose role in nociception and pain has not been explored. We exploit these probes to demonstrate that Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-expressing fibers are modality-specific nociceptors: their activation elicits robust pain behaviors without neurogenic inflammation and produces profound hypersensitivity to mechanical, but not thermal, stimuli. In the gut, high-threshold mechanosensitive fibers also express Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 and show enhanced toxin sensitivity in a model of irritable bowel syndrome. Altogether, these findings establish an unexpected role for Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in regulating the excitability of sensory nerve fibers that underlie mechanical pain.</p>

<p id="P2"> Pain is a multimodal system in which activation of functionally distinct sensory nerve fibers elicits acute, protective reflexes, as well as maladaptive responses that contribute to persistent pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In these nociceptive neurons, three voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>v</sub>) channels – Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 – have garnered particular attention because mutations affecting these subtypes are associated with insensitivity to pain or persistent pain syndromes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 is also expressed by somatosensory neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, but no link has been established between this subtype and nociception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Mutations affecting Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 are associated with central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and Alzheimer’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, and these clinically dominant phenotypes may have masked roles for this subtype in peripheral neurons. For example, gain-of-function mutations in Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 underlie familial hemiplegic migraine type 3 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), and while this phenotype has been ascribed to a CNS-initiated mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, dysfunction in sensory neurons may also contribute to this pain syndrome.</p>
<p id="P3"> Another challenge to parsing out roles for Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in pain is that of developing subtype-selective drugs for any member of this highly conserved family of ion channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Natural products can be exploited as a source of evolutionarily honed agents that target receptors with exquisite specificity. Such agents may be found in complex venoms from spiders, scorpions, cone snails, and snakes, including toxins that excite sensory nociceptors to elicit pain or discomfort in offending predators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Here we describe two algogenic tarantula toxins that selectively activate Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 to elicit acute pain and mechanical allodynia, providing new insights into specific roles for this channel and Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-expressing sensory nerve fibers in nociception and pain hypersensitivity.</p>
<sec id="S1">
<title>Selective Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 activating toxins</title>
<p id="P4"> To identify novel toxins that target nociceptors, we used calcium imaging to screen through &gt;100 spider, scorpion and centipede venoms for the ability to activate cultured somatosensory neurons. Venom from the tarantula <italic>Heteroscodra maculata</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) robustly excited a subset of neurons from trigeminal (TG) or dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from mice or rats. Venom fractionation yielded two active peptides, which were identified by MALDI-MS and Edman sequencing as inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) peptides of related sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). We named these toxins δ-theraphotoxin-Hm1a (Hm1a) and δ-theraphotoxin-Hm1b (Hm1b). Application of synthetic Hm1a to rat DRG neurons likewise triggered calcium responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), validating Hm1a as an active venom component. All subsequent experiments were performed with synthetic Hm1a peptide unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p id="P5"> Tetrodotoxin (TTX) blocked Hm1a-evoked calcium responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), suggesting involvement of Na<sub>v</sub> channels. Indeed, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from TG neurons showed that Hm1a robustly inhibited Na<sub>v</sub> current inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Among Na<sub>v</sub> subtypes expressed by these neurons, only Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, 1.6 and 1.7 are sensitive to TTX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, narrowing our search. We next tested ICA-121431, a small molecule inhibitor with selectivity for Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 and 1.3 subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>), and found that it greatly diminished Hm1a-evoked calcium responses in both embryonic DRG and P0 mouse TG cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1c–d</xref>), suggesting that Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 is the main target of Hm1a in somatosensory neurons. In contrast, ICA-121431 only partially blocked responses to SGTx1, an Hm1a-related peptide that shows little selectivity among Na<sub>v</sub> subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and excites a larger cohort of sensory neurons compared to Hm1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1c–d</xref>). To confirm toxin selectivity for Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, we heterologously expressed Na<sub>v</sub>1.1–1.8 α subunits in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Indeed, Hm1a potently inhibited hNa<sub>v</sub>1.1 inactivation (EC<sub>50</sub> = 38 ± 6 nM), with substantially weaker effects on hNa<sub>v</sub>1.2 and hNa<sub>v</sub>1.3, and no effect on hNa<sub>v</sub>1.4–1.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>). Similar results were obtained with native Hm1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1f</xref>). Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 is not efficiently expressed in recombinant systems, but surrogate chimeras (rK<sub>v</sub>2.1 channels containing the S3b-S4 toxin-binding region from each of the four hNa<sub>v</sub>1.9 domains) were also toxin insensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1g</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p id="P6"> Hm1b is a novel toxin, but Hm1a was previously described as κ-theraphotoxin-Hm1a, a moderate-affinity blocker of K<sub>v</sub>4.1 voltage-gated potassium (K<sub>v</sub>) channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. We found, however, that high concentrations (up to 5 μM) of synthetic Hm1a blocked ≤20% of mK<sub>v</sub>4.1 current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1h</xref>), and 1 μM native Hm1a displayed a saturating effect on Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, but failed to block mK<sub>v</sub>4.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1h</xref>). Moreover, in cultured sensory neurons, outward K<sup>+</sup> currents were unaffected by 500 nM Hm1a, suggesting that its main physiologic target is Na<sub>v</sub>1.1. This may explain why injection of Hm1a into the mouse brain elicits convulsions and rapid death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Hm1a activates a subset of sensory neurons by selectively targeting Na<sub>v</sub>1.1.</p>
<p id="P7"> Analysis of Hm1a-responsive TG neurons in whole-cell current clamp configuration showed toxin-evoked hyperexcitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Hm1a did not alter resting membrane potential (before Hm1a, Vm = −55 ± 6 mV; after Hm1a, Vm = −56 ± 6 mV), however, it robustly enhanced spike frequency during a 20 pA current injection. Hm1a also significantly prolonged the action potential width (by 28.3 ± 8.4%; from 6.5 to 8.6 msec), consistent with introduction of non-inactivating sodium current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). We found that toxin responses were most robust in sensory neuron cultures derived from young (embryonic or newborn) mice or rats, likely reflecting a lower threshold for action potential firing in these cells or culture conditions. Indeed, we found that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) sensitization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> of adult neurons prior to toxin exposure greatly enhanced the percentage of toxin sensitive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1i</xref>), consistent with this hypothesis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S2">
<title>Selectivity depends on DIV S1-S2 loop</title>
<p id="P8"> Our data suggest that Hm1a inhibits both the speed and extent of fast inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), similar to the mechanism described for less selective peptide toxins that bind to the S3b-S4 voltage sensor region of domain IV (DIV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. To determine whether Hm1a targets the same locale, we transferred each of four S3b-S4 regions from hNa<sub>v</sub>1.1 into the cognate location of the homo-tetrameric rK<sub>v</sub>2.1 voltage-gated potassium channel, which is normally insensitive to the toxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). Indeed, transfer of just the DIV S3b-S4 region rendered rK<sub>v</sub>2.1 sensitive to Hm1a, demonstrating that this segment is a primary determinant of toxin action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). However, this region is identical or highly conserved in hNa<sub>v</sub>1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, and thus cannot fully account for toxin selectivity. To identify other functionally important regions, we constructed chimeras between Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.4, the latter being completely insensitive to Hm1a. Replacement of the S3b-S4 region of hNa<sub>v</sub>1.4 with that from hNa<sub>v</sub>1.1 did not confer toxin sensitivity, whereas transfer of both S3b-S4 and the S1-S2 loop resulted in full toxin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2c–e</xref>). These results indicate that both domains together determine toxin sensitivity and subtype selectivity, consistent with previous suggestions that S1-S2 contributes to toxin recognition sites on voltage sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="S3">
<title>Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 is found on myelinated Aδ fibers</title>
<p id="P9"> Using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization histochemistry, we found that Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 transcripts are expressed primarily by medium-diameter sensory neurons constituting 35% of all cells, most of which (&gt;75%) belong to the myelinated (NF200-positive) cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast, we observed limited (5–11%) overlap of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-positive cells with markers of small diameter, unmyelinated neurons, including TRPV1, CGRP, tyrosine hydroxylase, and the lectin IB4. However, we did see substantial co-expression with the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor (43% of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-positive cells express 5-HT<sub>3</sub>), a marker of lightly myelinated Aδ neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Finally, 22% of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-positive cells also expressed the cold/menthol receptor, TRPM8, which is found in both C and Aδ fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Taken together, we conclude that Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 is expressed primarily by myelinated neurons, including Aδ fibers, consistent with previous histological and transcriptome profiling data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. We also characterized Hm1a-sensitive neurons for responses to other receptor-selective agonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>), further confirming this assignment. Interestingly, most (&gt;85%) Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-positive cells also expressed Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, suggesting that this population of myelinated neurons contributes to nociception (see below).</p>
<p id="P10"> We next explored the effect of Hm1a on mechanonociceptive Aδ fibers (AMs) using the <italic>ex vivo</italic> skin-nerve preparation. We found that application of 1μM Hm1a to cutaneous receptive fields significantly increased firing rate in these AM fibers in response to mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), confirming expression of functional Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in this afferent population. Previous studies found limited expression of TRPV1 in AM fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, consistent with our findings of limited overlap between Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 and TRPV1. Taken together, these functional data confirm our histological assignment of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 expression to myelinated Aδ fibers, and further suggest that Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 participates in mechanical nociception.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="S4">
<title>Hm1a elicits pain and touch sensitivity</title>
<p id="P11"> Does activation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-expressing fibers produces pain behaviors? Indeed, injection of Hm1a (5μM in 10μl) into the mouse hind paw elicited immediate and robust nocifensive responses (bouts of licking or biting of the injected paw) throughout the observation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Toxin injection also significantly increased Fos immunoreactivity in dorsal horn neurons of the superficial lamina ipsilateral to the injection, signifying functional engagement of nociceptors and their central connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). To exclude the possibility that this depends on the small population of fibers co-expressing TRPV1 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, we ablated TRPV1-positive terminals by intrathecal (spinal) injection of capsaicin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, in which case Hm1a-evoked nocifensive behavior persisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Remarkably, Hm1a did not produce swelling or plasma extravasation of the injected paw, a neurogenic inflammatory response readily provoked by activation of peptidergic C-fiber nociceptors that include most TRPV1-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). These results further suggest that Hm1a elicits pain by activating a non-peptidergic subset of myelinated sensory fibers.</p>
<p id="P12"> Genetic or pharmacologic elimination of TRPV1-expressing fibers greatly diminishes sensitivity to noxious heat, but does not perturb sensitivity to mechanical stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. In light of the anatomical and physiological results described above, we asked whether Hm1a has differential effects on these modalities by monitoring responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli following intraplantar injection of toxin at a dose (500nM in 10μl) insufficient to elicit acute behavior. Indeed, intraplantar injection of Hm1a did not alter sensitivity to heat, but produced robust sensitization to mechanical stimulation that was not dependent on TRPV1-expressing fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d, e</xref>). Equivalent mechanical sensitization was also observed following injection of native Hm1b peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). In agreement with these behavioral observations, we found that all Hm1a-responsive adult DRG neurons displayed mechanically activated currents, except for those neurons that were also capsaicin sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>).</p>
<p id="P13"> To confirm the requirement of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in toxin-evoked behaviors, we crossed mice bearing a floxed Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 allele<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> to a line expressing Cre recombinase under control of the peripherin promoter, which is active in a large percentage of unmyelinated and myelinated sensory neurons during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Indeed, analysis of a peripherin-Cre x YFP reporter line showed that these animals express Cre recombinase in 46% of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4a, b</xref>). Strikingly, elimination of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 from this subset of fibers significantly attenuated toxin-evoked behaviors, including both acute nocifensive responses and mechanical sensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a, e</xref>).</p>
<p id="P14"> Robust activation of nociceptive pathways by nerve injury or inflammation can trigger both primary and secondary sensitization, the latter of which can manifest as mechanical or heat hypersensitivity contralateral to the insult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. In fact, we found that unilateral injection of Hm1a produced robust and equivalent mechanical sensitization of both the injected and contralateral paw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). This contralateral sensitization was also modality specific as no change in heat sensitivity was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Importantly, Hm1a-mediated mechanical sensitivity was equivalently reduced in ipsilateral and contralateral paws of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-peripherin Cre animals, demonstrating that contralateral effects depend on Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Since we did not observe signs of neurogenic inflammation, we asked whether this phenotype results from Hm1a-mediated nerve injury. However, this seems unlikely since toxin injection failed to induce expression of ATF3, a marker of nerve damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that direct activation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-expressing fibers is sufficient to produce robust and modality-specific bilateral sensitization.</p>

<title>Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 and irritable bowel syndrome</title>
<p id="P15"> Chronic mechanical hypersensitivity underlies the development of abdominal pain in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Given the apparent role of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in mechano-nociception, we asked if this channel is expressed by mechanically sensitive fibers of the gut, and if so, whether it contributes to neuronal sensitization in a model of chronic visceral mechanical hypersensitivity (CVH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. We therefore examined mechanical responses in an <italic>ex vivo</italic> gut-nerve preparation from healthy or CVH mice. In preparations from healthy animals, Hm1a increased mechanically-evoked spiking in a sub-population (40%) of high-threshold colonic afferents that constitute presumptive mechano-nociceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). Correspondingly, ICA-121431 reduced mechanical responses in 50% of fibers examined and blocked Hm1a sensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). Moreover, Hm1a significantly reduced the threshold for action potential firing in a subset (45%) of retrogradely traced colonic DRG neurons as measured by whole-cell current clamp analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). These results demonstrate that a subset of high-threshold mechanosensitive colonic fibers express functional Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels.</p>
<p id="P16"> In colonic afferents from CVH mice, baseline mechanosensory responses were elevated compared to healthy controls (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5a and 5c</xref>). Application of Hm1a enhanced mechanically-evoked spiking in a subset (36%) of CVH fibers beyond this already elevated level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Interestingly, in the context of CVH (and in contrast to normal controls), toxin application dramatically increased the electrical excitability of most (64%) retrogradely traced colonic DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>), suggesting functional upregulation of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1. Furthermore, ICA-121431 reduced mechanosensory responses in most (70%) CVH sensitized fibers to levels resembling those of baseline controls (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5a and 5c</xref>), and blocked the sensitizing effects of Hm1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Taken together, these results support a role for Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in mechanical hypersensitivity in IBS.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p id="P17"> Development of Na<sub>v</sub> channel subtype-selective ligands is an important, but challenging goal. Our results identify a site within the DIV S1-S2 loop that enhances subtype selectivity, providing a potential strategy for designing other subtype-specific gating modifiers. Moreover, toxins such as Hm1a/b that alter inactivation may be of particular utility in boosting Na<sub>v</sub> channel activity where partial loss-of-function has been linked to developmental or neurodegenerative disorders, such as autism, Alzheimer’s or Dravet syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Analysis of toxin-channel interactions, including the multi-site nature of this pharmacophore, may shed new light on strategies for developing a broader class of molecules having a similar selectivity and functional profile.</p>
<p id="P18"> The critical role of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in the brain may have prevented its prior recognition as a contributor to peripheral pain signaling. Our results now unambiguously implicate Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-expressing myelinated afferents in nociception. Activation or sensitization of these fibers is sufficient to elicit robust acute pain, as well as mechanical allodynia, without triggering neurogenic inflammation, distinguishing these fibers from well-characterized C-nociceptors. Previous studies have implicated myelinated Aδ fibers in mechano-nociception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, and Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 now provides an important new marker with which to more precisely identify the contribution of these fibers to acute and chronic pain.</p>
<p id="P19"> Our findings with the CVH model suggest that pharmacological blockade of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 represents a novel therapeutic strategy for diminishing chronic pain associated with IBS, and perhaps other pain conditions associated with mechanical sensitization, including migraine headache. While Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 activity in the brain may underlie aura in FHM3 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, our results suggest that these gain-of-function mutations may also produce migraine pain through actions of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 in mechanical nociceptors. In fact, anticonvulsants that target Na<sub>v</sub> channels, including Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, have demonstrated efficacy in reducing migraine attacks in some individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Moreover, rufinamide, an anticonvulsant that was recently shown to inhibit Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), has also been reported to diminish nerve-injury evoked mechanical allodynia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Our findings therefore provide a mechanistic rationale for these actions, and motivate further analysis of Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.1-expressing nociceptors in acute and persistent pain.</p>

<title>Venom collection and screening</title>
<p id="P20"> Venoms from spiders, scorpions and centipedes were collected by mild electrical stimulation of the chelicerae, telson or forcipules, respectively. Venoms were then lyophilized and kept frozen until use. Approximately 100 venoms were tested by ratiometric calcium imaging using a standard inverted microscope setup. Responses to high extracellular potassium (150mM), capsaicin (1 μM), or previously characterized venoms or purified toxins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> were used to validate the health and robustness of sensory neuron cultures used in screening assays. Responses were digitized and analyzed using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Venom-evoked responses that were stimulus-locked, visually detectable above background, and restricted to neurons (i.e. did not cause calcium entry into glia or fibroblasts) were selected for further analysis. Pharmacological analysis was used to narrow down potential targets and crude venoms or purified fractions were subsequently tested on cloned candidate channels. Candidates were taken forward based on the robustness of the response and evidence for selectivity at novel targets.

<title>Sequence determination</title>
<p id="P23"> N-terminal sequencing was performed by the Australian Proteome Analysis Facility (Sydney, NSW, Australia). In brief, Hm1a (600 pmol) and Hm1b (250 pmol) were reconstituted and reduced by addition DTT (25 mM) followed by incubation at 56°C for 0.5 h. The samples were then alkylated using iodoacetamide (55 mM) at room temperature for 0.5 h and purified by RP-HPLC using a Zorbax 300SB-C18 column (3 × 150 mm). The target peaks of interest were identified, collected then reduced to minimal volume under vacuum. The entire sample was loaded onto a precycled, Biobrene-treated disc and subjected to 37 (Hm1a) or 42 (Hm1b) cycles of Edman N-terminal sequencing, respectively. Automated Edman degradation was carried out using an Applied Biosystems 494 Procise Protein Sequencing System.</p>
<p id="P24"> Edman degradation of Hm1a yielded ECRYLFGGCSSTSDCCKHLSCRSDWKYCAWDGTF as the sequence, which has a calculated monoisotopic mass (for the M+H<sup>+</sup> ion) of 3908.58 Da.

Hence, we conclude that a serine residue (87 Da) is missing on the C-terminal end of Hm1a to give a complete sequence of ECRYLFGGCSSTSDCCKHLSCRSDWKYCAWDGTFS. The complete sequence has a calculated monoisotopic mass (for the M+H<sup>+</sup> ion) of 3995.61 Da, which is only 0.06 Da different to the mass that was measured for the native Hm1a.</p>
<p id="P25"> Edman degradation of Hm1b yielded ECRYLFGGCKTTADCCKHLGCRTDLYYCAWDGT as the sequence, which has a calculated monoisotopic mass (for the M+H<sup>+</sup> ion) of 3745.6 Da. This is 147 Da short of the monoisotopic mass of Hm1a of 3892.60 Da. We therefore conclude that an amidated phenylalanine is missing on the C-terminal end of Hm1b to give a complete sequence of ECRYLFGGCKTTADCCKHLGCRTDLYYCAWDGTF-NH<sub>2</sub>. To confirm that the C-terminus of Hm1b is amidated, we digested native Hm1b with carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) and monitored the reaction by MALDI-TOF to identify the mass of the C-terminal residue as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. 5 μL of 800 ng/μL native Hm1b in 100 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5.5, was incubated with 2 ng/μL CPY at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction was monitored by removing 0.4 μL at 0, 1, 5, 10 and 20 min and spotting it on a MALDI plate with equal volume of 7 mg/mL α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 60% (<italic>v/v</italic>) acetonitrile, 5% formic acid (FA). Dried spots were washed with 10 μL 1% FA and allowed to dry before they were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS on a 4700 Proteomics Bioanalyser (Applied Biosciences, Foster City, CA, USA), acquiring spectra in reflector positive mode. The first CPY-mediated cleavage yielded a mass difference of 146 Da, which corresponds to an amidated phenylanine residue. Thus, the complete sequence has a calculated monoisotopic mass (for the M+H<sup>+</sup> ion) of 3892.64 Da, matching the native Hm1b.</p>

After application of Hm1a, significant increases (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in mechanically-evoked firing were seen overall in both healthy and CVH fibers. However, in both conditions we clearly recorded Hm1a-responsive and Hm1a-non-responsive neurons. We therefore binned fibers by responsiveness and present these data separately for clarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>).

<title>Statistics and experimental design</title>
<p id="P48"> Sample sizes for cellular physiology, histology and animal behavior were chosen based on previous experience with these assays as the minimum number of independent observation required for statistically significant results. For histology, at least three sections from each of at least three animals were counted. For oocyte and mouse neuron experiments, multiple batches/litters were used for all experiments. For behavioral experiments, animals were randomly chosen for different experimental cohorts by a blinded experimenter. Experimental and control conditions were compared within the same experimental time-course using randomly selected animals from one or multiple cages. Responses were then scored by an experimenter blinded to injection condition and experimental cohort. Animal genotype was tracked by ear tags and genotype unblinding occurred after analysis was complete.</p>
<p id="P49"> Data were analyzed using Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and significance testing used either Student’s t-tests or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni or Tukey’s post-hoc tests, as noted in figure legends. All significance tests are two-sided. Significance levels are *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, and ****<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001. The number of experiments (n) and significance are reported in the figure legends. All significance tests were justified as appropriate given the experimental design and nature of the comparisons. We assume equal variance and normally distributed data within experimental paradigms where comparisons are made. These are common assumptions relied upon for significance testing within these experimental paradigms as previously published by our group and others.</p>

Therefore, male and female behavioral responses were pooled and subsequent experiments were performed on both male and female mice for CKO and WT littermate experiments, or only male mice for other conditions (e.g. Cap ablation). Nocifensive responses were recorded during a 20 min observation period immediately following intraplantar injections (10 μl PBS with or without 5 μM Hm1a). Licking/biting behavior was scored as seconds of behavior with the experimenter blinded to injection condition and experimental cohort (WT, CKO or Cap Ablated mice). Hargreaves and Von Frey tests were performed 30 min after intraplantar injection of 500 nM Hm1a or Hm1b to measure heat or mechanical sensitivity, respectively.

(Right) Group data from a population (5/10) of ICA-121432 (500nM)-sensitive afferents (****<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). <bold>b,</bold> (Left) Representative whole–cell current clamp recording of a retrogradely traced colonic DRG neuron in response to 500ms current injection at rheobase (the minimum current injection required to elicit action potential firing). Recordings were from the same neuron of a healthy control mouse before and after incubation with Hm1a (10nM). Scale bars = 250 ms, 20 mV. (Middle) Group data show significant reduction in rheobase following Hm1a application in a sub-population (5/11) of neurons (*<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Hm1a-responsive neuron defined as exhibiting ≥10% change in rheobase from baseline control.
