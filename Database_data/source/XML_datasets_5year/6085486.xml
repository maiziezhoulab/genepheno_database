<abstract>
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is identified by abnormal dendrite morphology and altered synaptic protein expression. Astrocyte secreted factors such as Tenascin C (TNC), may contribute to the synaptic changes, including maturation of the synapse. TNC is a known endogenous ligand of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) that has been shown to induce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). At the molecular level, elevated IL-6 promotes excitatory synapse formation and increases dendrite spine length. With these molecular changes linked to the phenotype of FXS, we examined the expression and the mechanism of the endogenous TLR4 activator TNC, and its downstream target IL-6 in astrocytes from the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (<italic>FMR1</italic>) knockout (KO) mouse model. Secreted TNC and IL-6 were significantly increased in <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes. Addition of TNC and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced IL-6 secretion, whereas the antagonist of TLR4 (LPS-RS) had an opposing effect. Cortical protein expression of TNC and IL-6 were also significantly elevated in the postnatal <italic>FMR1</italic> KO mouse. In addition, there was an increase in the number of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1)/post synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) positive synaptic puncta of both wild-type (WT) and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO neurons when plated with astrocyte conditioned media (ACM) from <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes, compared to those plated with media from wild type astrocytes. By assessing the cellular mechanisms involved, a novel therapeutic option could be made available to target abnormalities of synaptic function seen in FXS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of autism which affects 1:4,000 males and 1:8,000 females (Hatton et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">1998</xref>; Jin and Warren, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2000</xref>; Duy and Budimirovic, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2017</xref>). A multitude of symptoms occur in FXS ranging from mild to severe behavioral deficiencies such as cognitive impairment, hyperactivity, anxiety, autistic-like behaviors, susceptibility to seizures and motor disorders (Contractor et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2015</xref>; Hunsaker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2012</xref>). The defects in individuals with FXS are attributed to the mutation in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (<italic>FMR1</italic>) gene resulting from the expansion of the CGG untranslated region of the X chromosome (Jin and Warren, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2000</xref>). This expansion leads to the hypermethylation and silencing of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene, preventing the synthesis of the FMRP (Jin and Warren, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2000</xref>).</p>
<p>FMRP is an mRNA binding protein which regulates the translation, and transport of mRNA in the brain, with the highest levels seen in hippocampal and cerebellar neurons (Pacey et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2015</xref>). The lack of FMRP in FXS has been associated with abnormal synapse formation, synapse number and structure (Pfeiffer and Huber, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2009</xref>; Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2016</xref>). In neurons, FMRP is known to regulate synaptic plasticity; in particular metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) mediated long-term depression (LTD; Contractor et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2015</xref>). Under normal conditions FMRP is expressed in neurons (Arsenault et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2016</xref>), astrocytes and oligodendrocytes where it influences the synaptic environment to bind, transport and translocate mRNA (Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, astrocytes have emerged as an important cell type for regulating the synaptic environment, neuronal activation and plasticity through astrocyte secreted factors (Jones and Bouvier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2014</xref>). Tenascin C (TNC) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein secreted by astrocytes and has been implicated in extracellular matrix re-modeling during tissue repair and synapse development (Jones and Bouvier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2014</xref>; Stamenkovic et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2016</xref>). Non-neuronal cells stimulated with exogenous TNC exhibited increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8, via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation (Midwood et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2009</xref>; Maqbool et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2016</xref>). TNC has also been investigated in blood-brain barrier (BBB) repair (Fujimoto et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2016</xref>) and regulation of inflammatory cytokines (Latijnhouwers et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">1998</xref>). In support of this, TLR4 is expressed at the surface of astrocytes and microglia, and has been found to induce inflammation in neurological diseases (Trotta et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Preliminary results suggest that TLR4 stimulation in astrocytes, increases the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 (El-Hage et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2011</xref>). Elevated levels of IL-6 have been implicated in cognitive impairments, behavioral deficits and decreased social interactions (Greenhill et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2011</xref>). At the molecular level, elevated IL-6 increases excitatory synapse formation, while impairing the development of inhibitory synapses (Wei et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2013</xref>; Shen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2016</xref>). In addition, IL-6 has been shown to increase the length of dendritic spines and stimulate the formation of mushroom shaped dendritic spines, implying that IL-6 is involved in synapse formation (Wei et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent data suggest the action of three distinct regions of the C-terminal fibrinogen like globe (FBG) domain of TNC act cooperatively to activate TLR4, thereby promoting cytokine synthesis (Zuliani-Alvarez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2017</xref>). Given the respective role of TLR4 activation in non-neuronal tissue, the same principle may be applied to TLR4 expressed by astrocytes. TLR4 activation may influence synaptic development, therefore resulting in abnormal formation and maturation of excitatory synapses in FXS. Here we compared the developmental cortical expression of TNC, TLR4 and IL-6 from postnatal day (P), ranging from P1 to P21 in wild-type (WT) mice and mice that lack FMRP (<italic>FMR1</italic> knockout, KO). In addition, astrocytes were treated with exogenous TNC and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to determine the function of TLR4 activation in astrocytes. Treatments of cultured astrocytes with known antagonist of TLR4, LPS from <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> (LPS-RS) were conducted to determine if inflammatory cytokine synthesis could be decreased with the addition of an antagonist. Lastly, the role of astrocyte conditioned media (ACM) on synaptic development of WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO neurons was investigated. Most importantly, our findings suggest the expression of TNC and IL-6 are dysregulated in the cortical regions in FXS. With TNC contributing to induction of IL-6 through the activation of astrocytic TLR4, this mechanism may contribute to abnormal synapse development.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO mice (FVB.129P2[B6]-Fmr1 tm1Cgr) were housed and bred in the McMaster University Central Animal Facility. All experiments and animal-handling procedures followed the guidelines set by the Canadian Council on Animal Care and were approved by the McMaster Animal Research Ethics Board (AUP 13-12-49).</p>

<sec id="s2-2">
<title>Cortical Tissue Isolation for Western Blotting</title>
<p>WT and knockout (<italic>FMR1</italic> KO) mice were decapitated and whole brains were extracted at P1 (six males and two females), P7 (five males and three females), P14 (six males and two females) and P21 (eight males and zero female) into ice cold, sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.01 M). Cortical samples were dissected and were immediately flash-frozen in isopentane and stored at −80°C. Samples were mechanically homogenized on ice in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% Deoxycholic Acid, 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, Roche ULTRA protease inhibitor tablet, Roche PhoSTOP phosphatase inhibitor tablet). Homogenized tissue samples were left on ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and the protein concentration of each sample was determined by a DC protein assay (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Samples were aliquoted and stored at −80°C.</p>

<sec id="s2-3">
<title>Primary Cortical Astrocyte Culture</title>
<p>Primary cultures of astrocytes were isolated from <italic>FMR1</italic> KO and WT mice as described by Jacobs and Doering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2009</xref>). Cortical astrocytes were isolated from WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO mice at P1 or P2 and grown in a T75 culture flask in minimum essential media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with 30% glucose and 10% horse serum (Invitrogen). Culture were maintained for approximately 1 week or until 70% confluent at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were then removed from the T75 flask with the addition of Trypsin-EDTA 0.05% (Invitrogen) and re-plated on 24-well plates with coverslips for immunocytochemistry experiments or onto 6-well plates for collection of ACM. The 24-well plate contained coverslips coated with Poly-L-Lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; 1 mg/mL) and laminin (Invitrogen; 0.1 mg/mL) and seeded with 5,000 cells per well. Cells were maintained for 3 days <italic>in vitro</italic> for subsequent immunocytochemistry. The 6-well plates were also coated with Poly-L-Lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; 1 mg/mL) and laminin (Invitrogen; 0.1 mg/mL) and seeded at a density of 100,000 cells per well. Cells were maintained for 3 to 5 days <italic>in vitro</italic> for analysis of ACM and cell collection via Western Blotting.</p>

<title>Western Blotting</title>
<p>Cortical samples containing 30 μg (homogenized whole tissue) of protein were combined with sample buffer (1×; 5% Beta-Mercaptoethanol+ Laemmli Sample Buffer, Bio-Rad). Samples were boiled at 95°C for 5 min, briefly centrifuged and loaded onto 4%–15% precast polyacrylamide stain-free gel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated via electrophoresis at 135V, activated with UV light (302 nm) for visualization of total protein (1 min) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad) using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad). The membranes were then imaged for total loaded protein using a ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON, Canada), after which they were blocked for 1 h in a blocking solution (5% non-fat milk solution in Tris-buffered saline solution with Tween-20 (TBS-T). Each membrane was then incubated overnight at 4°C in TBS-T containing anti-rat TNC antibody (host rabbit; 1:250; MAB2138; R&amp;D Systems), anti-mouse TLR4 antibody (host rabbit; 1:250; 76B357.1; abcam) or anti-mouse IL-6 antibody (host rabbit; 1:500; ab9324; abcam). These antibodies recognize bands at 250 kDa corresponding to TNC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), 73 kDa corresponding to TLR4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and 50 kDa corresponding to IL-6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Following incubation, the membranes were washed 3 × 10 min in TBS-T and then incubated in TBS-T containing horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody against rat (1:10,000; ab97057; abcam) or mouse (1:5,000; NA931V; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada) for 1 h at room temperature. Following the incubation period, membranes were then washed 3 × 10 min in TBS-T and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence developer solutions (Bio-Rad). Membranes were scanned using a ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Densitometry measurements were conducted using Image Lab Software 5.2 (Bio-Rad). Each band corresponding to either TNC (~250 kDa), TLR4 (~73 kDa), or IL-6 (~50 kDa) was first normalized to total protein within the same lane and then to a cross gel control. These values were then expressed as a relative percentage of the average densitometry value obtained from the age-matched WT samples.</p>

<title>Cortical Neurons Maintained With Cortical Astrocyte Conditioned Media</title>
<p>Cortical astrocytes were isolated from WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO mice at P1 or P2 and grown in a T75 culture flask in minimum essential media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with 30% glucose and 10% horse serum (Invitrogen). Culture were maintained until 70% confluent at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After confluency has been reached, the media was switched to neural maintenance media (NMM; Stemcell Technologies), and supplemented with SM1 (Stemcell Technologies), GlutaMAX (Gibco) and 2 mg/ml L-Glutamic Acid (Sigma). The media was conditioned for 3 days before it could be used to supplement neuronal cultures. WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO neurons were plated on coverslips in a 24-well plate with Poly-L-Lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; 1 mg/mL) and laminin (Invitrogen; 0.1 mg/mL), and seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well in the conditioned NMM. Neuronal cultures were maintained for 12 days at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and then processed for immunocytochemical analysis.</p>

<title>Immunocytochemistry</title>
<p>Immunocytochemistry experiments were carried out with primary cortical astrocyte cultures following a protocol previously described by Cheng et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2016</xref>). The astrocytes were fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X-100. Non-specific binding was blocked with 1.0% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies were prepared in PBS and applied to the coverslips for 24 h. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-rat TNC antibody (host rabbit; 1:50; MAB2138; R&amp;D Systems), anti-mouse TLR4 antibody (host rabbit; 1:500; 76B357.1; abcam), anti-mouse IL-6 antibody (host rabbit; 1:1,000; ab9324; abcam) and chicken anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (anti-GFAP; 1:2,000; CH22102; Neuromics, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The second day, the coverslips were washed three times with PBS, following incubation with the secondary antibody for 3 h at room temperature. These included goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200; ab150157; abcam), donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 (1:1,000; A-21203; Invitrogen), donkey anti-chicken FITC (1:100; 703-095-155; Jackson). Lastly, the coverslips were washed three times with water and PBS, following mounting with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Three independent (<italic>n</italic> = 3) cultures and a total of 27 cells were examined per genotype. Visual imaging was acquired using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 epifluorescence microscope and Axiovision (v4.6) image acquisition software.</p>
<p>In addition, neuronal cultures supplemented with conditioned NMM, were processed in a similar manner to determine the co-localized vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) pre-synaptic and post synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) post-synaptic puncta. The following primary antibodies were used: guinea pig anti-VGLUT1 (1:200; AB5905; Millipore) and mouse anti-PSD95 (1:100; MAB1596; Millipore). The corresponding secondary antibodies were used: donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 (1:1,000; A-21203; Invitrogen) and donkey anti-guinea pig FITC (1:200, 706-095-148, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Sixteen independent neuronal cultures (<italic>n</italic> = 4/condition) supplemented with conditioned NMM were examined. Ten neurons per condition were examined from 9 wells per <italic>n</italic>, resulting in synapse counts averaged from 40 neurons.</p>

<sec id="s2-7">
<title>Measurements of Tenascin C and IL-6 Expression and Secretion</title>
<p>TNC and IL-6 levels were determined in astrocyte cultures and in ACM. Confluent astrocyte cultures were incubated with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA for 5 min at 37°C. Once cells were fully lifted, MEM media supplemented with serum was added to prevent further digestion. The samples were then centrifuged at 250× <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at RT. The cells were then lysed with lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% Deoxycholic Acid, 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, Roche ULTRA protease inhibitor tablet, Roche PhoSTOP phosphatase inhibitor tablet). The lysates were collected in Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was stored at −80°C until further protein quantification to determine the cell associated concentrations.</p>
<p>Aliquots of ACM from the same culture were processed to determine the secreted (extracellular) TNC and IL-6 levels. In preparation for conditioning, ACM was harvested for 3 days with the MEM media replaced with serum free minimum-essential media on the third day, after which the sample was collected and concentrated. The media was filtered using a 0.22 μm syringe filter for the removal of cellular debris and concentrated using Vivaspin 20 (GE Healthcare) through a 50 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) for TNC or Vivaspin 6 (GE Healthcare) through a 10 kDa MWCO for IL-6. ACM was stored at −80°C until further protein quantification with Western Blotting.</p>

<title>Cortical Astrocyte Drug Treatments</title>
<p>To assess TLR4 activation, WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO cortical astrocyte cultures were treated independently with exogenous TNC, in addition to the known TLR4 agonist (LPS) to test IL-6 induction. Additionally, TLR4 antagonist treatments with LPS-RS were performed to examine for a decrease cytokine expression. The astrocytes were grown for 3 to 5 days <italic>in vitro</italic> in serum-free minimum essential media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 30% glucose, achieving 70% confluency. At 3, 6 and 24 h prior to cell and ACM collections, astrocytes were treated with exogenous chicken TNC (10 μg/mL; CC118, Millipore), LPS (10 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) and LPS-RS (10 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), which were added to the astrocyte culture media. The cells were trypsinized and collected as previously discussed. The ACM was filtered using a 0.22 μm syringe and concentrated through a 10 kDa MWCO using Vivaspin 6 (GE Healthcare). The cell associated and secreted IL-6 protein levels were quantified using Western Blotting.</p>

<p>Visual imaging was acquired using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 epifluorescence microscope and Axiovision (v4.6) image acquisition software. SynapCountJ, is a custom written plug-in for ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) used to identify co-localized puncta. Background was removed from both the red and green channels of each image using the ImageJ rolling ball background subtraction algorithm. Dendrite tracings were done using NeuronJ (an ImageJ plugin). The coordinates of these tracings were uploaded into SynapCountJ along with the corresponding red and green channel images. The number of co-localized puncta was measured for each tracing and normalized to the tracing length. The investigators were blind to the genotypes and treatments when investigating the synaptic phenotypes in cultures.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In this study we investigated the developmental expression of TNC, TLR4 and IL-6 in cortical brain regions of WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO mice, aged P1, P7, P14 and P21. We hypothesized that the levels of astrocyte derived TNC are dysregulated in the <italic>FMR1</italic> KO mouse model, thus contributing to the elevated IL-6 levels, which may be responsible for the aberrant synaptic changes seen in FXS. While the expression of TLR4 remained consistent between the genotypes, treatments with LPS and exogenous TNC suggest that TLR4 is responsible for IL-6 secretion in astrocytes.</p>

<p>TNC, TLR4 and IL-6 were all highly expressed in primary cortical astrocytes from the WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO P1 or P2 mice.

To determine if there was differential expression of TNC, TLR4 and IL-6 in <italic>FMR1</italic> KO mice at P1, P7, P14 and P21, Western blotting experiments were conducted.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The first few weeks of postnatal development consist of highly regulated events involving synapse growth, formation and pruning (Faissner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2010</xref>; Gatto and Broadie, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2010</xref>). This complex and dynamic process requires a coordinated exchange of signals from neurons and glia (Cheng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2012</xref>). In many disorders of the nervous system, the structure and function of synapse formation is strained, and thereby translated to cognitive and behavioral deficits (Cheng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2012</xref>; Contractor et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2015</xref>). Recently, astrocytes have emerged as an essential cell type for the regulation of synaptic connectivity. Given their close proximity to neurons, astrocytes are able to regulate synapse formation through secreted and contact mediated factors (Faissner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2010</xref>; Jones and Bouvier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2014</xref>). A multitude of soluble factors secreted by astrocytes are responsible for synaptogenesis and synaptic function. Previous research from our lab has demonstrated that Hevin, SPARC and Thrombospondin-1 are soluble factors that can rescue afferent spine morphology in the <italic>FMR1</italic> KO mouse model (Jacobs and Doering, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2010</xref>; Cheng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2016</xref>; Wallingford et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2017</xref>). Thus, the discovery of other astrocyte secreted factors is essential to understand the extracellular impact of the environment on neurons.</p>
<sec id="s4-1">
<title>TNC, TLR4 and IL-6 Expression in the Cortex and Primary Astrocyte Cultures in WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO Astrocytes</title>
<p>In this study, we examined the interaction and activation of TLR4 by the astrocyte secreted factor, TNC. Such activation would result in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, which is ultimately known to be involved in the formation of excitatory synapses (Tancredi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2000</xref>; Wei et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2011</xref>). This study is the first to determine the relationship between TNC and IL-6, through the activation of TLR4 in astrocytes and in FXS. Interestingly, we discovered an up-regulation of TNC and IL-6 in the <italic>FMR1</italic> KO cortices at P14 and P21 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E,F</xref>). TNC expression was found to be down-regulated at P7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), potentially due to upstream factors such as intracellular signals that are controlled by soluble factors, integrins and other mechanical forces (Jones and Jones, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2000</xref>). Another mechanism for the elevated TNC expression could be due to astrocyte reactivity. First evidence of astrocyte reactivity in the FXS mouse model has been shown by the Pacey lab, making this a viable explanation as to why there is an increase of TNC in the <italic>FMR1</italic> KO model (Pacey et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2015</xref>). Additionally, developmental expression of TNC was found to be down-regulated in WT astrocytes, however this does not seem to be the case for TNC expression by <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes. Thus, these results do complement previous findings that TNC is developmentally down-regulated in a normal functioning system (Joester and Faissner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1999</xref>). Interestingly, IL-6 expression still remained elevated at P7, even though TNC expression was found to be down-regulated (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This could be explained by IL-6 regulation through the JAK/STAT3 pathway, as IL-6 has the potential to recruit JAK and phosphorylate STAT3, thus increasing the production and secretion of IL-6 (Beurel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2009</xref>; Samavati et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2009</xref>; Greenhill et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2011</xref>). However, since we bred WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO mice from separate colonies, we cannot exclude the possibility that the effects we observe are influenced by differences in maternal care.</p>
<p>In rodents, the critical time-span for synaptogenesis occurs in the first 2 weeks of life, while maturation of the synapses occurs approximately between P14 and P21 (Gatto and Broadie, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2010</xref>; Cheng et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2012</xref>). The elevation of TNC protein levels at these critical time points may suggest that there is more involvement of TNC in synaptogenesis than previously investigated. The maintenance of plasticity in the brain correlates with the expression of extracellular glycoproteins such as TNC, with recent studies suggesting that TNC may be involved in synapse function through the modulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (Dityatev and Schachner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2003</xref>; Faissner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2010</xref>; Barros et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>TNC is expressed at low amounts in healthy tissue, although up-regulation is seen in tissue injury and during states of inflammation (Udalova et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2011</xref>; Stamenkovic et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2016</xref>). This has been shown to trigger TLR4 activation in macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils and synovial fibroblasts (Midwood et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2009</xref>; Wei et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2011</xref>). In the CNS, there is a vast amount of TLR4 expression by neurons, microglia, as well as astrocytes (Gorina et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2011</xref>; Shen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2016</xref>). This study determined that the expression levels of cortical TLR4 are similar in both the WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO mouse model (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A recent study suggested that astrocytic activation of TLR4 through the Myd88 mediated pathway by LPS, induces pro-inflammatory cytokines and promotes excitatory synaptogenesis in the second postnatal week in mice (Shen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2016</xref>). This ultimately prompted the question whether TNC is capable of activating TLR4 in astrocytes to promote excitatory synaptogenesis through cytokine synthesis.</p>
<p>The pro-inflammatory cytokine of interest in this study was IL-6, as it has been implicated in ASD and in the formation of excitatory synapses (Wei et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2012</xref>). Although primary functions of IL-6 have been linked to neuroimmune responses that seem to be involved in physiological brain development, a recent study has suggested that IL-6 is increased in the cerebellum of autistic patients, which in turn alters synapse formation (Wei et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2011</xref>). Additionally, primary hippocampal neuron cultures, treated with exogenous IL-6 have shown to significantly reduce Group II-metabotropic receptors (mGluR2/3) and L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Vereyken et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2007</xref>). This is of interest since in the valproate-induced model of autism, mGluR2/3 protein and mGluR2 mRNA has been shown to be reduced (Jacobs and Doering, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2010</xref>). Major changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling have also been noted due to the absence of FMRP, which may result from the reduced mRNA for the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Contractor et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2015</xref>).</p>

<title>WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO Astrocyte Response to Immunological Challenges</title>
<p>The TLR receptor family has been mediating host defense infection and injury by recognizing pathogen and damage associated molecular patterns (PAMPS and DAMPS; Trotta et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2014</xref>). Upon activation with bacterial endotoxin LPS, TLRs promote responses such as induction of cytokines mediated by protein tyrosine kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and transcription factors such as nuclear factor κB (NFκB; Gorina et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2011</xref>). To determine if <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes respond differently to an immunological challenge, we treated WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes with LPS and examined the cultures with Western blots 3, 6 and 24 h post-treatment (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Only the WT astrocytes responded to LPS stimulation after 3 and 6 h treatments, as seen by an increase of secreted IL-6 in contrast to the <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes, where secreted levels remained comparable to the Naive group. This complements a previous report which observed no alterations in cultured primary microglia lacking FMRP when treated for 6 h with LPS (100 ng/mL; Yuskaitis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2011</xref>). To further analyze how TLR4 is capable of IL-6 induction through endogenous stimuli such as TNC, we treated WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes with TNC for 3, 6 and 24 h, and analyzed IL-6 protein expression with Western blotting (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). We have shown here that TNC is capable of activating TLR4 in the astrocyte and promoting cytokine secretion in WT astrocytes. In particular, the FBG domain has been identified as the domain to cause spontaneous release of IL-6 via the MyD88 dependent pathway (Midwood et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2009</xref>). <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes seemed to respond to exogenous TNC treatment only when treated for 3 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Since the <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes already have increased cell associated and secreted TNC levels, the system may have become oversaturated thus being unable to respond to the agonist when treated for longer periods of time (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). To determine whether <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes respond differently to TLR4 antagonist treatments, both WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes were treated with LPS-RS for 3, 6 and 24 h. Interestingly, only <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes had the ability to decrease the amount of secreted IL-6 when the TLR4 receptor was antagonized for 3 and 6 h (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Antagonist treatment effects were not seen in WT astrocytes potentially because <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes were more sensitive to the LPS-RS treatment. By 24 h, both the WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO may have become desensitized as no treatment effect is seen for either the TLR4 agonist and antagonist treatments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p>

<title>Increase of VGLUT1/PSD95 Synapse Co-localization of WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO Neurons Supplemented With Conditioned Media From <italic>FMR1</italic> KO Astrocytes</title>
<p>Synapses are points of cellular communication, which mediate neuronal connections. They rely on proper formation, maintenance and function, that are dependent by the number, type and connectivity patterns of neuronal circuitries (Chung et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2015</xref>). Improper synapse number, which ultimately leads to functional dysregulation, may cause neurodevelopmental disorders such as FXS. Keeping in mind the potential role that IL-6 may play in synaptic development (Wei et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2011</xref>), we sought to determine whether WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO neurons developed a different number of synaptic connections when cultured with ACM from <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes, compared to those cultured with ACM from WT astrocytes. We co-labeled these neurons with antibodies against VGLUT1 and PSD95. Intracortical synaptic connections were determined by co-localization of the pre- and post- synaptic markers. Interestingly we found an increased number of excitatory synaptic connections when WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO neurons were supplemented with ACM from <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). It is worth noting that ACM from WT astrocytes did not impact synaptic formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>It is well established that abnormal spine morphology and density are the major players in FXS research, however, only a handful of studies directly quantify the changes in excitatory synapses (Pfeiffer and Huber, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2009</xref>; Contractor et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2015</xref>; Yang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2016</xref>). To study the changes of excitatory synaptic density in more detail, we focused on the co-localization of VGLUT1 and PSD95. VGLUT1 is expressed in the majority of cortical-cortical synapses, in particular, these excitatory synaptic connections have been found to be elevated in layer IV and layer V of the mouse somatosensory cortex in FXS (Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2014</xref>). Since FXS is associated with hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli (Gatto and Broadie, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2010</xref>), an altered cortical-cortical connectivity could explain the deficits of processing sensory information.</p>
<p>The complexity of neuronal connections is dependent on the modulation of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), which regulate synapse formation, maturation and plasticity (McGeachie et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2011</xref>; Lee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2013</xref>). Recently, IL-6 over-expression in granule cells was found to affect cell adhesion and migration, which suggests that IL-6 could be implicated in the function of CAMs (Wei et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2011</xref>). In our study we have found that cell associated and secreted IL-6 is elevated in <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes, which further supports the hypothesis that IL-6 has an impact on CAMs. Additionally, TNC is also known to interact directly with CAMs (Zacharias et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1999</xref>; Rigato et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2002</xref>), supporting the argument that both TNC and IL-6 are implicated in synaptic development.</p>
<p>Here, we not only show that elevated levels of endogenous TNC is present in the <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes, but also that exogenous TNC is capable of inducing secretion of IL-6. With already elevated secreted levels of IL-6 present in astrocytes lacking FMRP, it was crucial to determine if this was the doing of TNC. Understanding the mechanism by which endogenous activators of TLR4 such as TNC mediate the secretion of IL-6 and other cytokines may help determine which astrocyte secreted factors and to what extent these factors impact synaptic dysregulation. Our findings thus show that an imbalance of astrocyte secreted factors could result in an imbalance of neuronal circuitries in FXS. Further experiments involving the NF-κB pathway, the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway and integrin contribution could further provide evidence to support the hypothesis of IL-6 being one of these important astrocyte secreted factors that partake in synapse development.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that TNC and IL-6 are both significantly increased in the <italic>FMR1</italic> KO cortex and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes at various stages of cortical development. We also showed that TNC has the capability of inducing the secretion of IL-6 in WT and <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. This study also investigated how <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes react to TLR4 agonists and antagonist in comparison to WT astrocytes. We speculate that the <italic>FMR1</italic> KO system is oversaturated by TNC, thus being unable to affect IL-6 secretion when treated with additional TLR4 agonists for long periods of time. We also speculate that <italic>FMR1</italic> KO astrocytes are more sensitive to some treatments such as LPS-RS. Ultimately, we can confirm the importance of astrocyte secreted factors in synaptic formation and development, however additional experiments are required to determine to what extent this process is driven by IL-6. These findings suggest that elevated IL-6, which has been previously noted in the autistic brain, could be the contributing factor in abnormal synapse formation, as shown by an increase of excitatory synapses in FXS, which would ultimately contribute to the development of autism.</p>
