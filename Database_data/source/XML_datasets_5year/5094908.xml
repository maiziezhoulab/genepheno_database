<abstract id="Abs1">
<p id="P1">More than 75,000 man-made chemicals contaminate the environment; many of these have not been tested for toxicities. These chemicals demand quantitative high-throughput screening assays to assess them for causative roles in neurotoxicities, including Parkinsonâ€™s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. To facilitate high throughput screening for cytotoxicity to neurons, three human neuronal cellular models were compared: SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, LUHMES conditionally-immortalized dopaminergic neurons, and Neural Stem Cells (NSC) from human fetal brain. These three cell lines were evaluated for rapidity and degree of differentiation, and sensitivity to 32 known or candidate neurotoxicants. First, expression of neural differentiation genes was assayed during a 7-day differentiation period. Of the three cell lines, LUHMES showed the highest gene expression of neuronal markers after differentiation. Both in the undifferentiated state and after 7 days of neuronal differentiation, LUHMES cells exhibited greater cytotoxic sensitivity to most of 32 suspected or known neurotoxicants than SH-SY5Y or NSCs. LUHMES cells were also unique in being more susceptible to several compounds in the differentiating state than the undifferentiated state; including known neurotoxicants colchicine, methyl-mercury (II), and vincristine. Gene expression results suggest that differentiating LUHMES cells may be susceptible to apoptosis because they express low levels of anti-apoptotic genes <italic>BCL2</italic> and <italic>BIRC5/survivin</italic>; whereas SH-SY5Y cells may be resistant to apoptosis because they express high levels of <italic>BCL2, BIRC5/survivin</italic>, and <italic>BIRC3</italic> genes. Thus, LUHMES cells exhibited favorable characteristics for neuro-cytotoxicity screening: rapid differentiation into neurons exhibiting high level expression neuronal marker genes, and marked sensitivity of LUHMES cells to known neurotoxicants.</p>

<title>Short Abstract</title>
<p id="P2">Three human neuronal cell lines were evaluated as high throughput screening models for neuronal cytotoxicity: SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, LUHMES conditionally-immortalized dopaminergic neurons, and Neural Stem Cells. After 7 days of differentiation LUHMES expressed the highest levels of neuronal markers. Differentiated LUHMES cells exhibited greater cytotoxic sensitivity to most of 32 suspected or known neurotoxicants than differentiated SH-SY5Y or NSCs, and greater cytotoxic sensitivity to 11 compounds compared to undifferentiated LUHMES cells.</p>
